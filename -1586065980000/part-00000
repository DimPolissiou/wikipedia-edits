Various Cistercian congregations existed for many years, and by 1664 the [[Abbot]] of La Trappe felt that the Cistercians were becoming too liberal. He introduced strict new rules in the abbey and the Strict Observance was born. Since this time, many of the rules have been relaxed. However, a fundamental tenet that monasteries should be self-supporting is still maintained by these groups.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nMonastery brewhouses, from different religious orders, have existed across Europe since the [[Middle Ages]]. From the very beginning, beer was brewed in French Cistercian monasteries following the Strict Observance. For example, the monastery of La Trappe in Soligny already had its own brewery in 1685. Breweries were later introduced in monasteries of other countries as the Trappist order spread from France into the rest of Europe. The Trappists, like many other religious orders, originally brewed beer to feed the community, in a perspective of self-sufficiency. Nowadays, Trappist breweries also brew beer to fund their works and charitable causes. Many of the Trappist monasteries and breweries were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[World War]]s. In the last 300 years, there were at least nine Trappist breweries in France, six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Austria, one in Bosnia and possibly other countries.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1997, eight Trappist abbeys{{spaced ndash}}six from Belgium ([[Orval Brewery|Orval]], [[Chimay Brewery|Chimay]], [[Westvleteren Brewery|Westvleteren]], [[Rochefort Brewery|Rochefort]], [[Westmalle Brewery|Westmalle]] and [[Achel Brewery|Achel]]), one from the Netherlands ([[Brouwerij De Koningshoeven|Koningshoeven]]) and one from Germany ([[Mariawald]]){{spaced ndash}}founded the International Trappist Association (ITA) to prevent non-Trappist commercial companies from abusing the Trappist name. This private association created a [[logo]] that is assigned to goods (cheese, beer, wine, etc.) that respect precise production criteria. For the beers, these criteria were the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers|title=Trappist beers|publisher=The International Trappist Association|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref>\n* The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.\n* The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life.\n* The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.\n\nThe German Trappist [[Mariawald|abbey of Mariawald]] has not produced beer since 1953, however it is a founding member of the Trappist Association and uses the same ''Authentic Trappist Product'' logo for its other products.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn the twentieth century, the growing popularity of Trappist beers led some brewers with no connection to the order to label their beers \"Trappist\". After unsuccessful negotiations, monks sued one such brewer in 1962 in [[Ghent]], Belgium.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Dutch brewery ''De Koningshoeven'' produces Trappist beers{{spaced ndash}}branded ''La Trappe''{{spaced ndash}}that are able to carry the \"Authentic Trappist Product\" logo. Their use of the International Trappist Association logo was withdrawn in 1999, but was restored in October 2005 (see [[Brouwerij de Koningshoeven]] for details).

After the introduction of an official Trappist beer designation by the International Trappist Association in 1997, it came to mean products similar in style or presentation to monastic beers.<ref name=Best>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHh-4M_QxEsC&pg=PA38&dq=Abbey+beers&hl=en&ei=HnkvTaK5Hse7hAeq7ZzpCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abbey%20beers&f=false|title=World's Best Beers: One Thousand Craft Brews from Cask to Glass|first=Ben|last=McFarland|page=38|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc|year=2009|isbn=1-4027-6694-7|accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref> In other words, an Abbey beer may be:\n* Produced by a non-Trappist monastery{{mdash}}e.g. Cistercian, Benedictine; or\n* produced by a commercial brewery under an arrangement with an extant monastery; or\n* branded with the name of a defunct or fictitious abbey by a commercial brewer; or\n* given a vaguely monastic branding, without specifically mentioning monastery, by a commercial brewer.\n\n==Types of beer==\nTrappist beers are mostly [[Brewing#Fermentation methods|top-fermented]], including La Trappe [[Bock]]bier, and mainly [[bottle conditioned]]. Trappist breweries use various systems of nomenclature for the different beers produced which relate to their relative strength.<ref name=\"Lierde\">Geert van Lierde et al., ''In het Spoor van de Trappisten'' {{ISBN|90-261-0704-8}}, page 25</ref>\n\nThe best known is the system where different beers are called ''Enkel/Single'', ''[[Dubbel|Dubbel/Double]],'' ''[[Tripel|Tripel/Triple]] and Quadrupel/Quadruple''. These terms roughly describe both the amount of malt and the [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|original gravity]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Garrett|last=Oliver|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|isbn=978-0195367133}}</ref> They may refer to the number of crosses or other marks chalked on the casks - two for a Dubbel and three for a Tripel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000791.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Down on your knees to bless monks' top ale|publisher=www.beerhunter.com|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>\n\nColours can be used to indicate the different types, dating back to the days when bottles were unlabelled and had to be identified by the ''capsule'' or bottle-top alone. Chimay beer labels are based on the colour system (in increasing order of strength red, white and blue). Westvleteren beers are still unlabelled.\n\nThere is also a number system (6, 8 and 10, as used by Rochefort), which gives an indication of strength, but is not necessarily an exact [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). [[Achel]] combine a strength and a colour (of the beer itself{{mdash}}blond or brown) designation.\n\n===Enkel===\n'''Enkel''', meaning \"single\", is a term used by the Trappist breweries to describe the basic recipe of their beers.<ref name=\"Lierde\"/> The name fell out of fashion with no breweries (Trappist or 'Abbey') using the term until recent years. Instead, \"Blond(e)\" (La Trappe, Westvleteren), \"5\" (Achel) or \"6\" (Rochefort) have been used to describe the brewery's lightest beer. Chimay introduced an Enkel (called ''Dor\u00e9e'' or Gold) commercially in bottles in 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/chimay-doree-speciale-du-potaupre/14228/|title=Chimay Dor\u00e9e / Sp\u00e9ciale du Potaupr\u00e9|website=RateBeer|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> Westmalle made their Enkel (called ''Extra'') available commercially through some outlets in 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://belgiuminabox.com/blog/2010/04/westmalle-extra-trappist-beer-now-available-www-belgiuminabox-com/#.Wp20AOjFLcc|title=New Product : Shop Westmalle-Extra Trappist Beer @ www.belgiuminabox.com {{!}} Belgiuminabox|website=belgiuminabox.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>. The term is often used interchangeably with 'Patersbier' (meaning Father's beer), as Enkels are a weak beer brewed originally to be consumed by the monks themselves.\n\n===Dubbel===\n{{Main|Dubbel}}\nDubbel is a Trappist breweries' naming convention.<ref name=Lierde /> The origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the Trappist Abbey of [[Westmalle Abbey|Westmalle]] in 1856. Westmalle Dubbel was imitated by other breweries, Trappist and commercial, Belgian and worldwide, leading to the emergence of a style. Dubbels are understood to be a fairly strong (6\u20138% ABV) [[brown ale]], with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character.\nExamples are: Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red/Premiere, Koningshoeven/La Trappe Dubbel, Achel 8 Bruin and Rochefort 6.\n\n===Tripel===\n{{Main|Tripel}}\n[[File:Westmalle Tripel in a glass.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Westmalle [[Tripel]]]]\n\nTripel is a naming convention traditionally used by Belgian Trappist breweries to describe the strongest beer in their range. Westmalle Tripel is considered to be the foundation of this beer style, and was developed in the 1930s. Achel 8 Blond, Westmalle Tripel, La Trappe Tripel, and Chimay White/Cinq Cents are all examples of Trappist tripels. The style has proven popular among secular breweries like St. Feuillien, Bosteels and St. Bernardus. Tripels as a style are generally beers with an alcohol content ranging from 8% to 10% ABV.\n\n===Quadrupel===\n{{Main|Quadrupel}}\nQuadrupel is the name Koningshoeven gave to a La Trappe ale they brew which is stronger and darker than their tripel.

The distinction between goblet and chalice is typically in the glass thickness. Goblets tend to be more delicate and thin, while the chalice is heavy and thick walled. Some chalices are etched on the bottom to [[nucleate]] a stream of bubbles for maintaining a nice head.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Chimays.jpg|Chimay beers and glass\nFile:Beerglass orval.jpg|[[Orval beer]]'s \"chalice\" glass\nFile:Beerglass trappiste rochefort.jpg|[[Rochefort beer]]'s \"goblet\" glass\nFile:Eleven_trappist_beer_and_glasses.jpg|Eleven Trappist beers and glasses\n</gallery>\n\n==Beer tourism==\nThe idea of visiting Trappist monasteries to sample their beers has become more popular in recent years, partly due to promotion by enthusiasts such as the 'beer hunter' [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]]. Some brewing monasteries maintain a visitors' center where their beers can be tasted and bought (sometimes with other monastic products such as bread and cheese).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chimay.com/en/espace-chimay.html?IDC=756|title=Espace Chimay|accessdate=2014-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orval.be/en/27/Discovery|title=Visit Orval|accessdate=2014-09-26}}</ref> Visits to the monastery itself are usually not available to the general public, although visitors can overnight in some of the monasteries (like Achel) if their purpose is non-touristic.

Various Cistercian congregations existed for many years, and by 1664 the [[Abbot]] of La Trappe felt that the Cistercians were becoming too liberal. He introduced strict new rules in the abbey and the Strict Observance was born. Since this time, many of the rules have been relaxed. However, a fundamental tenet that monasteries should be self-supporting is still maintained by these groups.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nMonastery brewhouses, from different religious orders, have existed across Europe since the [[Middle Ages]]. From the very beginning, beer was brewed in French Cistercian monasteries following the Strict Observance. For example, the monastery of La Trappe in Soligny already had its own brewery in 1685. Breweries were later introduced in monasteries of other countries as the Trappist order spread from France into the rest of Europe. The Trappists, like many other religious orders, originally brewed beer to feed the community, in a perspective of self-sufficiency. Nowadays, Trappist breweries also brew beer to fund their works and charitable causes. Many of the Trappist monasteries and breweries were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[World War]]s. In the last 300 years, there were at least nine Trappist breweries in France, six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Austria, one in Bosnia and possibly other countries.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1997, eight Trappist abbeys{{spaced ndash}}six from Belgium ([[Orval Brewery|Orval]], [[Chimay Brewery|Chimay]], [[Westvleteren Brewery|Westvleteren]], [[Rochefort Brewery|Rochefort]], [[Westmalle Brewery|Westmalle]] and [[Achel Brewery|Achel]]), one from the Netherlands ([[Brouwerij De Koningshoeven|Koningshoeven]]) and one from Germany ([[Mariawald]]){{spaced ndash}}founded the International Trappist Association (ITA) to prevent non-Trappist commercial companies from abusing the Trappist name. This private association created a [[logo]] that is assigned to goods (cheese, beer, wine, etc.) that respect precise production criteria. For the beers, these criteria were the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers|title=Trappist beers|publisher=The International Trappist Association|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref>\n* The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.\n* The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life.\n* The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.\n\nThe German Trappist [[Mariawald|abbey of Mariawald]] has not produced beer since 1953, however it is a founding member of the Trappist Association and uses the same ''Authentic Trappist Product'' logo for its other products.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn the twentieth century, the growing popularity of Trappist beers led some brewers with no connection to the order to label their beers \"Trappist\". After unsuccessful negotiations, monks sued one such brewer in 1962 in [[Ghent]], Belgium.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Dutch brewery ''De Koningshoeven'' produces Trappist beers{{spaced ndash}}branded ''La Trappe''{{spaced ndash}}that are able to carry the \"Authentic Trappist Product\" logo.

Trappist breweries use various systems of nomenclature for the different beers produced which relate to their relative strength.<ref name=\"Lierde\">Geert van Lierde et al., ''In het Spoor van de Trappisten'' {{ISBN|90-261-0704-8}}, page 25</ref>\n\nThe best known is the system where different beers are called ''Enkel/Single'', ''[[Dubbel|Dubbel/Double]],'' ''[[Tripel|Tripel/Triple]] and Quadrupel/Quadruple''. These terms roughly describe both the amount of malt and the [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|original gravity]]<ref>{{cite book|first=Garrett|last=Oliver|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|isbn=978-0195367133}}</ref>. They may refer to the number of crosses or other marks chalked on the casks - two for a Dubbel and three for a Tripel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000791.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Down on your knees to bless monks' top ale|publisher=www.beerhunter.com|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>\n\nColours can be used to indicate the different types, dating back to the days when bottles were unlabelled and had to be identified by the ''capsule'' or bottle-top alone. Chimay beer labels are based on the colour system (in increasing order of strength red, white and blue). Westvleteren beers are still unlabelled.\n\nThere is also a number system (6, 8 and 10, as used by Rochefort), which gives an indication of strength, but is not necessarily an exact [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). [[Achel]] combine a strength and a colour (of the beer itself{{mdash}}blond or brown) designation.\n\n===Enkel===\n'''Enkel''', meaning \"single\", is a term used by the Trappist breweries to describe the basic recipe of their beers.<ref name=\"Lierde\"/> The name fell out of fashion with no breweries (Trappist or 'Abbey') using the term until recent years. Instead, \"Blond(e)\" (La Trappe, Westvleteren), \"5\" (Achel) or \"6\" (Rochefort) have been used to describe the brewery's lightest beer. Chimay introduced an Enkel (called ''Dor\u00e9e'' or Gold) commercially in bottles in 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/chimay-doree-speciale-du-potaupre/14228/|title=Chimay Dor\u00e9e / Sp\u00e9ciale du Potaupr\u00e9|website=RateBeer|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> Westmalle made their Enkel (called ''Extra'') available commercially through some outlets in 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://belgiuminabox.com/blog/2010/04/westmalle-extra-trappist-beer-now-available-www-belgiuminabox-com/#.Wp20AOjFLcc|title=New Product : Shop Westmalle-Extra Trappist Beer @ www.belgiuminabox.com {{!}} Belgiuminabox|website=belgiuminabox.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>. The term is often used interchangeably with 'Patersbier' (meaning Father's beer), as Enkels are a weak beer brewed originally to be consumed by the monks themselves.\n\n===Dubbel===\n{{Main|Dubbel}}\nDubbel is a Trappist breweries' naming convention.<ref name=Lierde /> The origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the Trappist Abbey of [[Westmalle Abbey|Westmalle]] in 1856. Westmalle Dubbel was imitated by other breweries, Trappist and commercial, Belgian and worldwide, leading to the emergence of a style. Dubbels are understood to be a fairly strong (6\u20138% ABV) [[brown ale]], with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character.\nExamples are: Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red/Premiere, Koningshoeven/La Trappe Dubbel, Achel 8 Bruin and Rochefort 6.\n\n===Tripel===\n{{Main|Tripel}}\n[[File:Westmalle Tripel in a glass.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Westmalle [[Tripel]]]]\n\nTripel is a naming convention traditionally used by Belgian Trappist breweries to describe the strongest beer in their range. Westmalle Tripel is considered to be the foundation of this beer style, and was developed in the 1930s. Achel 8 Blond, Westmalle Tripel, La Trappe Tripel, and Chimay White/Cinq Cents are all examples of Trappist tripels. The style has proven popular among secular breweries like St. Feuillien, Bosteels and St. Bernardus. Tripels as a style are generally beers with an alcohol content ranging from 8% to 10% ABV.\n\n===Quadrupel===\n{{Main|Quadrupel}}\nQuadrupel is the name Koningshoeven gave to a La Trappe ale they brew which is stronger and darker than their tripel. Rochefort 10 is also an example of a quadrupel.\n\n==Ranges==\nThe official Trappist breweries produce the following beers for consumption:\n\n'''Achel''':\n1. Blond (Belgian strong ale, 8% ABV)\n2. Bruin (Belgian strong ale, 8% ABV)\n3. Extra Blond (Abbey tripel, 9.5% ABV)\n4. Extra Bruin (Abbey quadrupel, 9.5% ABV).\n5.

The distinction between goblet and chalice is typically in the glass thickness. Goblets tend to be more delicate and thin, while the chalice is heavy and thick walled. Some chalices are etched on the bottom to [[nucleate]] a stream of bubbles for maintaining a nice head.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Chimays.jpg|Chimay beers and glass\nFile:Beerglass orval.jpg|[[Orval beer]]'s \"chalice\" glass\nFile:Beerglass trappiste rochefort.jpg|[[Rochefort beer]]'s \"goblet\" glass\nFile:Eleven_trappist_beer_and_glasses.jpg|Eleven Trappist beers and glasses\n</gallery>\n\n==Beer tourism==\nThe idea of visiting Trappist monasteries to sample their beers has become more popular in recent years, partly due to promotion by enthusiasts such as the 'beer hunter' [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]].

{"title_page": "Transport in Poland", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n\n'''Transport in Poland''' involves air, water, road and rail transportation. The country has a large network of municipal public transport, such as buses, trams and the metro. As a country located at the 'cross-roads' of Europe, [[Poland]], with its highly [[Economy of Poland|developed economy]], is a nation with a large and increasingly modern network of transport infrastructure.\n\nThe country's most important waterway is the [[Vistula]] river. The largest seaports are the [[Port of Gda\u0144sk]], the [[Port of Gdynia]] and the [[Port of Szczecin]]. Air travel is generally used for international travel, with many flights originating at [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]]. Railways connect all of Poland's major cities and the state-owned [[Polish State Railways]] (PKP) corporation, through its subsidiaries, runs a great number of domestic and international services of varying speed and comfort. In addition to this, five out of sixteen Polish [[voivodeship]]s have their own provincial rail service providers.\n\n== Rail transport ==\n[[File:Poland rail map.svg|thumb|280px|Railways in Poland|left]]\n[[File:Wroc\u0142aw Dworzec G\u0142\u00f3wny.jpg|thumb|[[Wroc\u0142aw G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station]], the busiest train station in [[Wroc\u0142aw]].]]\n[[File:Polish Pendolino front 2.JPG|thumb|A [[PKP Intercity]] [[New Pendolino|ED250 Pendolino]] at [[Wroc\u0142aw G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Wroc\u0142aw Main Station]].]]\n[[File:Gda\u0144sk G\u0142\u00f3wny, Blick von Marienkirche.jpg|thumb|[[Gda\u0144sk G\u0142\u00f3wny (PKP station)|Gda\u0144sk Main Station]], one of Poland's most important railway terminals]]\n[[File:Bwe loco change rzepin.jpg|thumb|A Polish locomotive takes over haulage duty from a [[Deutsche Bahn]] unit at [[Rzepin]] on a Berlin-Warsaw Express train]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Poland}}\n{{see also|High-speed rail in Poland}}\nPoland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities the main railway station  is located near a city centre and is well connected to the local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by [[Polish State Railways|PKP]] Group. The rail network is very dense in western and northern Poland, while eastern part of the country is less developed. The capital city, [[Warsaw]], has the country's only [[Rapid transit|rapid transit system]]: the [[Warsaw Metro]].\n\nThe only high-speed rail line (though by most definitions, real [[high-speed rail]] only includes speeds over 200&nbsp;km/h) in central-eastern Europe is the [[Central Rail Line (Poland)]], ''Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa'' (CMK). It has a length of {{convert|223|km|abbr=on}}, and was built in 1971\u20131977; it links [[Warsaw]] with [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Katowice]]. Most trains on the CMK operate at speeds up to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, but since December 2014 new [[Alstom]] [[Pendolino]] ED250 trains operate on a 90&nbsp;km section of the CMK at {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, and improvements under way should raise the authorized speed to {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} on most of the line.

The regional airports were mostly serving as spokes, and were controlled by PPL, the state-owned airport authority. However, in the 1990s it was decided to deregulate the airport market and abolish the dominant position of PPL. Nearly all local airports (apart from Zielona G\u00f3ra airport) became separate companies, with local governments involved in their management, which led to the partial decentralisation. Soon after opening of Polish sky for competition, flights \u201cavoiding\u201d the Warsaw hub became more common.\n\nThere are twelve passenger airports in operation, and there is also an airport Heringsdorf in German village Garz, 7 kilometers from Polish seaside spa \u015awinouj\u015bcie.\n\n===International airports===\n[[List of airports in Poland]]\nThe following are the largest airports in Poland (In descending order for 2013):\n* [[Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport|Warsaw Frederic Chopin International Airport]]\n* [[John Paul II International Airport Krak\u00f3w-Balice|Krak\u00f3w John Paul II International Airport]]\n* [[Gda\u0144sk Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa Airport|Gda\u0144sk Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa International Airport]]\n* [[Katowice International Airport]]\n* [[Copernicus Airport Wroc\u0142aw|Wroc\u0142aw Miko\u0142aj Kopernik International Airport]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica Airport|Pozna\u0144 International Airport]]\n* [[Rzesz\u00f3w-Jasionka Airport]]\n* [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont Airport]]\n* [[Szczecin-Goleni\u00f3w \"Solidarno\u015b\u0107\" Airport]]\n* [[Warsaw Modlin]]\n*[[Bydgoszcz Ignacy Jan Paderewski Airport]] \n* [[Lublin Airport]]\n* [[Radom Airport]]\n* [[Olsztyn-Mazury Regional Airport]]\n\nDomestic:\n* [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Airport|Zielona G\u00f3ra-Babimost Airport]]\n\n'''Airports with paved runways:'''\nTotal: 84 (2005)\n* over 3,047 m: 4\n* 2,438 to 3,047 m: 29\n* 1,524 to 2,437 m: 41\n* 914 to 1,523 m: 7\n* under 914 m: 3\n\n'''Airports \u2013 with unpaved runways:'''\nTotal: 39 (2005)\n* 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\n* 1,524 to 2,437 m: 4\n* 914 to 1,523 m: 13\n* under 914 m: 21\n\n'''Heliports:''' 2 (2005)\n\n== Water transport ==\n\n[[File:MF Skania 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ferries of Polish company [[Unity Line]] in the city of Szczecin]]\n[[Image:Gdynia kamienna marina.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Gdynia]]'s main municipal marina]]\nThe country's most important waterway is the river [[Vistula]].

Typically, a city possesses its own local bus service, however, in some cases they have private competitors operating on certain lines upon the agreement with local authorities.\n\nUntil the 1990s, interurban connections were operated by a single, state-owned company [[Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Komunikacji Samochodowej|PKS]]. Since then, it has been broken into a number of independent national and municipal enterprises. In addition, several private operators emerged. There are two classes of service distinguished by vehicle length:\n* ''autobus'' \u2014 longer vehicles (12.0 m and more),\n* ''bus'' \u2014 shorter vehicles with smaller capacity, very popular on local connections, run by individual persons and smaller companies.\nWhile they often use the same bus stops, they tend to use different stations.\n\n=== Tram ===\n[[Image:Znak D-17.svg|50px|left]]\n[[Image:Bombardier NGT6 -2027.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] tram in [[Krak\u00f3w]]]]\n\nBigger cities run dense [[Tram|tram networks]], which are the primary mean of public transport.

The country has a large network of municipal public transport, such as buses, trams and the metro. As a country located at the 'cross-roads' of Europe, [[Poland]], with its highly [[Economy of Poland|developed economy]], is a nation with a large and increasingly modern network of transport infrastructure.\n\nThe country's most important waterway is the [[Vistula]] river. The largest seaports are the [[Port of Gda\u0144sk]], the [[Port of Gdynia]] and the [[Port of Szczecin]]. Air travel is generally used for international travel, with many flights originating at [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]]. Railways connect all of Poland's major cities and the state-owned [[Polish State Railways]] (PKP) corporation, through its subsidiaries, runs a great number of domestic and international services of varying speed and comfort. In addition to this, five out of sixteen Polish [[voivodeship]]s have their own provincial rail service providers.\n\n== Rail transport ==\n[[File:Poland rail map.svg|thumb|280px|Railways in Poland|left]]\n[[File:Wroc\u0142aw Dworzec G\u0142\u00f3wny.jpg|thumb|[[Wroc\u0142aw G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station]], the busiest train station in [[Wroc\u0142aw]].]]\n[[File:Polish Pendolino front 2.JPG|thumb|A [[PKP Intercity]] [[New Pendolino|ED250 Pendolino]] at [[Wroc\u0142aw G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Wroc\u0142aw Main Station]].]]\n[[File:Gda\u0144sk G\u0142\u00f3wny, Blick von Marienkirche.jpg|thumb|[[Gda\u0144sk G\u0142\u00f3wny (PKP station)|Gda\u0144sk Main Station]], one of Poland's most important railway terminals]]\n[[File:Bwe loco change rzepin.jpg|thumb|A Polish locomotive takes over haulage duty from a [[Deutsche Bahn]] unit at [[Rzepin]] on a Berlin-Warsaw Express train]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Poland}}\n{{see also|High-speed rail in Poland}}\nPoland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities the main railway station  is located near a city centre and is well connected to the local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by [[Polish State Railways|PKP]] Group. The rail network is very dense in western and northern Poland, while eastern part of the country is less developed. The capital city, [[Warsaw]], has the country's only [[Rapid transit|rapid transit system]]: the [[Warsaw Metro]].\n\nThe only high-speed rail line (though by most definitions, real [[high-speed rail]] only includes speeds over 200&nbsp;km/h) in central-eastern Europe is the [[Central Rail Line (Poland)]], ''Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa'' (CMK). It has a length of {{convert|223|km|abbr=on}}, and was built in 1971\u20131977; it links [[Warsaw]] with [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Katowice]]. Most trains on the CMK operate at speeds up to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, but since December 2014 new [[Alstom]] [[Pendolino]] ED250 trains operate on a 90&nbsp;km section of the CMK at {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, and improvements under way should raise the authorized speed to {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} on most of the line.

The regional airports were mostly serving as spokes, and were controlled by PPL, the state-owned airport authority. However, in the 1990s it was decided to deregulate the airport market and abolish the dominant position of PPL. Nearly all local airports (apart from Zielona G\u00f3ra airport) became separate companies, with local governments involved in their management, which led to the partial decentralisation. Soon after opening of Polish sky for competition, flights \u201cavoiding\u201d the Warsaw hub became more common.\n\nThere are twelve passenger airports in operation, and there is also an airport Heringsdorf in German village Garz, 7 kilometers from Polish seaside spa \u015awinouj\u015bcie.\n\n===International airports===\n[[List of airports in Poland]]\nThe following are the largest airports in Poland (In descending order for 2013):\n* [[Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport|Warsaw Frederic Chopin International Airport]]\n* [[John Paul II International Airport Krak\u00f3w-Balice|Krak\u00f3w John Paul II International Airport]]\n* [[Gda\u0144sk Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa Airport|Gda\u0144sk Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa International Airport]]\n* [[Katowice International Airport]]\n* [[Copernicus Airport Wroc\u0142aw|Wroc\u0142aw Miko\u0142aj Kopernik International Airport]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica Airport|Pozna\u0144 International Airport]]\n* [[Rzesz\u00f3w-Jasionka Airport]]\n* [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont Airport]]\n* [[Szczecin-Goleni\u00f3w \"Solidarno\u015b\u0107\" Airport]]\n* [[Warsaw Modlin]]\n*[[Bydgoszcz Ignacy Jan Paderewski Airport]] \n* [[Lublin Airport]]\n* [[Radom Airport]]\n* [[Olsztyn-Mazury Regional Airport]]\n\nDomestic:\n* [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Airport|Zielona G\u00f3ra-Babimost Airport]]\n\n'''Airports with paved runways:'''\nTotal: 84 (2005)\n* over 3,047 m: 4\n* 2,438 to 3,047 m: 29\n* 1,524 to 2,437 m: 41\n* 914 to 1,523 m: 7\n* under 914 m: 3\n\n'''Airports \u2013 with unpaved runways:'''\nTotal: 39 (2005)\n* 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\n* 1,524 to 2,437 m: 4\n* 914 to 1,523 m: 13\n* under 914 m: 21\n\n'''Heliports:''' 2 (2005)\n\n== Water transport ==\n\n[[File:MF Skania 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ferries of Polish company [[Unity Line]] in the city of Szczecin]]\n[[Image:Gdynia kamienna marina.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Gdynia]]'s main municipal marina]]\nThe country's most important waterway is the river [[Vistula]]. The largest seaports are the [[Port of Szczecin]] and [[Port of Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nMarine transport in Poland has two main sub-groups, riverine and seaborne. On the [[Baltic Sea]] coast, a number of large seaports exist to serve the international freight and passenger trade; these are typically deep water ports and are able to serve very large ships, including the [[ro-ro]] ferries of [[Unity Line]], [[Polferries]] and [[Stena Line]] which operate the [[Poland]] \u2013 [[Scandinavia]] passenger lines.\n\nRiverine services operate on almost all major Polish rivers and canals (such as the [[Danube\u2013Oder Canal|Danube\u2013Oder]] and [[Elbl\u0105g Canal|Elbl\u0105g canal]]s) as well as on domestic coastal routes.\n\n=== Waterways ===\nPoland has {{convert|3997|km|-1|abbr=on}} of navigable rivers and canals (as of 2009).\n\n=== Ports and harbors ===\n\n* [[Port of Gda\u0144sk]] ''[[Image:Znak T-11.svg|40px]] ([[Polferries]]: Gda\u0144sk \u2014 [[Nyn\u00e4shamn]] / [[Ystad]])''\n* [[Port of Gdynia]] ''[[Image:Znak T-11.svg|40px]] ([[Stena Line]]: Gdynia \u2014 [[Karlskrona]] / [[Gothenburg]]'' and ''[[Finnlines]]: Gdynia \u2014 [[Helsinki]] / [[Rostock]])''\n* [[Port of \u015awinouj\u015bcie|Port of Szczecin-\u015awinouj\u015bcie]] ''[[Image:Znak T-11.svg|40px]] ([[Polferries]]: \u015awinouj\u015bcie \u2014 [[Copenhagen]] / [[Ystad]] / [[R\u00f8nne]]'' and ''[[Unity Line]]: \u015awinouj\u015bcie \u2014 [[Ystad]] / [[Trelleborg]])''\n* [[Port of Police]]\n* [[Port of Ko\u0142obrzeg]]\n* [[Ustka|Port of Ustka]]\n\n=== Merchant marine ===\n{{main|Polish Merchant Navy}}\nTotal: 57 ships (1,000 GT or over) totaling 1,120,165 GT/{{DWT|1,799,569|metric|disp=long}}\n\nShips by type:\nbulk 50, cargo 2, chemical tanker 2, roll-on/roll-off 1, short-sea passenger 2\n(1999 est.)\n**\n\n== Municipal transport ==\n[[File:Solaris Urbino 10 1006.jpg|right|thumb|City bus in Warsaw, manufactured by Polish company [[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris]]]]\n\n=== Bus ===\n<!--[[Image:Dworzec.jpg|250px|]] -->\n[[Image:Znak D-15.svg|50px|left]]\nMost Polish towns and cities have well developed municipal bus services. Typically, a city possesses its own local bus service, however, in some cases they have private competitors operating on certain lines upon the agreement with local authorities.\n\nUntil the 1990s, interurban connections were operated by a single, state-owned company [[Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Komunikacji Samochodowej|PKS]]. Since then, it has been broken into a number of independent national and municipal enterprises. In addition, several private operators emerged. There are two classes of service distinguished by vehicle length:\n* ''autobus'' \u2014 longer vehicles (12.0 m and more),\n* ''bus'' \u2014 shorter vehicles with smaller capacity, very popular on local connections, run by individual persons and smaller companies.\nWhile they often use the same bus stops, they tend to use different stations.\n\n=== Tram ===\n[[Image:Znak D-17.svg|50px|left]]\n[[Image:Bombardier NGT6 -2027.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] tram in [[Krak\u00f3w]]]]\n\nBigger cities run dense [[Tram|tram networks]], which are the primary mean of public transport. Currently, there are 14 systems serving over 30 cities including [[Bydgoszcz]],  [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Katowice]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Szczecin]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Wroc\u0142aw]], with the total track length varying from {{convert|200|km|-1|abbr=on}} ([[Silesian Interurbans]]) to less than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} ([[Tramways in Grudzi\u0105dz]]). A new network has been constructed in [[Olsztyn]] in 2015. See the [[list of town tramway systems in Poland]]\n\nSince the 1990s, a number of cities attempts to upgrade certain parts of their networks to the [[light rail]] standard (called ''szybkie tramwaje'', En. ''fast trams''). The most notable investments are [[Pozna\u0144ski Szybki Tramwaj|Pozna\u0144 Fast Tram]] and [[Krakowski Szybki Tramwaj|Krak\u00f3w Fast Tram]] with the underground {{convert|1.5|km|1|abbr=on}} [[premetro]] section<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Trams in Poland \n | url = http://polandtravelplanner.com/transport/tram.html\n | website = Poland Travel Planner\n | access-date = 10 April 2019}}</ref>.\n\n=== Trolleybus ===\n[[Image:Znak D-16.svg|50px]]\nTrolleybuses can be found in three cities: [[Gdynia]] (with some lines reaching [[Sopot]]), [[Lublin]] and [[Tychy]].\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n{{main|Warsaw Metro}}\n[[Image:Warsaw Metro logo.svg|50px|left]]\n\nThe first [[rapid transit|metro]] line was opened in [[Warsaw]] in 1995.

Their mandate is to prevent and investigate [[crime]]s committed against the carrier or by or against [[passenger]]s or other customers of the carrier, or those committed on the carrier's property.\n\nA transit police force may consist of officers employed directly by a transit system, such as the [[Amtrak Police]], or it may exist as a specialized unit of a local police force, such as the Transit Police Services Bureau of the [[Orange County, California]] Sheriff's Department, which serves the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] or [[South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gvtaps.bc.ca|title=Under Construction gvtaps.bc.ca|website=www.gvtaps.bc.ca}}</ref> which serves the transit system of southern British Columbia, Canada.\n\nWhere the term \"transit police\" is used for the police working for a railroad/railway, it usually refers to a railroad providing urban [[mass transit]] (such as a city elevated system or [[rapid transit|subway]]) as opposed to long-distance rail carriage. Police who work either for a private non-passenger railroad or long-haul rail carrier are usually referred to as \"[[railroad police]]\" or \"railway police\". In [[Great Britain|Britain]], most of the rail system, including the [[London Underground]], is policed by a national transport police agency, the [[British Transport Police]]. Some transit police forces have full policing powers, such as [[BART Police]], [[SEPTA Transit Police]], [[Metro Transit Police Department]], [[Utah Transit Authority Police Department]] or [[MBTA Transit Police]], while in other areas, they have limited powers and are classed as [[special police]] or [[special constable]]s with limited powers.\n\nSome of the crimes transit police and railroad police investigate include [[trespass]]ing on the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of a railroad, [[assault]]s against passengers, tagging of [[graffiti]] on railroad [[rolling stock]] and [[bus]]es or [[bus stop]]s, [[pickpocketing]], ticket [[fraud]], [[robbery]] and theft of personal belongings, [[baggage]] or [[freight]], and [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealing]] at transit stations. They may also engage in random ticket checking hoping to catch and fine ticketless travelers. These controls are usually more frequent in transit systems using an [[Proof-of-payment|honor-based fare collecting approach]]. \n\n\n==Jurisdiction and authority==\nIn federal states like the United States, Canada, or Australia, federal and state statutes determine the jurisdiction and authority of all police departments, including transit police. Most transit police services have the same police authority as any other national, state and local police agencies, such as the [[British Transport Police]], [[New Jersey Transit Police Department]], [[BART Police]], [[Maryland Transit Administration Police]], [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]] Police, [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority Transit Police|SEPTA Transit Police]], [[Utah Transit Authority Police Department]], and the [[South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service]] have rather extensive jurisdictions, including traffic enforcement, with arrest powers on and off property. Transit and [[railroad police]] tend to have better results in finding [[crime|perpetrators]] of crimes they investigate than public police forces, possibly due to specialization and smaller case loads.\n\n==List of specialised transit/transport police agencies and departments==\n\n===[[Australia]]===\n'''New South Wales'''\n*Commuter Crime Unit, [[New South Wales Police Force]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/community_issues/transport_safety|title=Transport Safety - NSW Police Force|first=corporateName=NSW Police Force; jurisdiction=New South|last=Wales|website=www.police.nsw.gov.au}}</ref>\n*Police Transport Command [[New South Wales Police Force]] as of 2013.\n*[[RailCorp Transit Officer|Transit Officers]], [[RailCorp]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityrail.info/travelling_with/safety_and_education/safe_and_secure|title=Keeping you safe and secure - Sydney Trains|first=corporateName=Sydney Trains; contact=Communications Directorate|last=sector=Government|website=Sydney Trains|date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Closed down as of October 2013.\n\n'''Queensland'''\n*Railway Squad, [[Queensland Police]]<ref>http://www.police.qld.gov.au/Resources/Internet/join/documents/LR_Railway_Squad160709.pdf</ref>\n*Authorised Officers, [[Queensland Rail]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.queenslandrail.com.au/forcustomers/safetysecurity/securityinitiatives|title=Security initiatives|website=www.queenslandrail.com.au}}</ref>\n*TransLink Senior Network Officers, [[TransLink (South East Queensland)|TransLink]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://translink.com.au/about-translink/what-we-do/revenue-protection|title=Revenue protection - TransLink|website=translink.com.au}}</ref>\n*Customer Service Officers, [[G:link]]<ref>http://ridetheg.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Glink-Customer-Service-Charter-2014-06-05.pdf</ref>\n\n'''South Australia'''\n*Transit Services Branch, [[South Australia Police]] (all public transport in [[Adelaide]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sapolice.sa.gov.au/sapol/about_us/structure/operations_support_service/transit_services_branch.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524160225/http://www.sapolice.sa.gov.au/sapol/about_us/structure/operations_support_service/transit_services_branch.jsp |archivedate=2011-05-24 }}</ref> Private security also maintain a presence, especially during peak hours or events.\n\n'''Victoria'''\n*Transit Safety Division, Victoria Police members and Protective Services Officers (predominantly operate in [[Melbourne]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?document_id=267 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809051440/http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=267 |archivedate=2011-08-09 }}</ref>\n*Authorised Officers employed by Public Transport operator companies and by [[Public Transport Victoria|Public Transport Victoria (PTV)]].\n\n'''Western Australia'''\n*Police Rail Unit, [[Western Australia Police]] (operating in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]])\n*Transit Officers, [[Public Transport Authority (Western Australia)|Public Transport Authority of Western Australia]]\n\n===[[Canada]]===\n\nThe [[South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service]] (commonly known as the Metro Vancouver Transit Police) is the only full transit police force in Canada, a necessity since Metro Vancouver's [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] public transit system spans 22 separate municipalities and 16 police jurisdictions.\n\nMost other large Canadian cities use security officers appointed as [[special constable]]s or peace officers.

Their mandate is to prevent and investigate [[crime]]s committed against the carrier or by or against [[passenger]]s or other customers of the carrier, or those committed on the carrier's property.\n\nA transit police force may consist of officers employed directly by a transit system, such as the [[Amtrak Police]], or it may exist as a specialized unit of a local police force, such as the Transit Police Services Bureau of the [[Orange County, California]] Sheriff's Department, which serves the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] or [[South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gvtaps.bc.ca|title=Under Construction gvtaps.bc.ca|website=www.gvtaps.bc.ca}}</ref> which serves the transit system of southern British Columbia, Canada.\n\nWhere the term \"transit police\" is used for the police working for a railroad/railway, it usually refers to a railroad providing urban [[mass transit]] (such as a city elevated system or [[rapid transit|subway]]) as opposed to long-distance rail carriage. Police who work either for a private non-passenger railroad or long-haul rail carrier are usually referred to as \"[[railroad police]]\" or \"railway police\". In [[Great Britain|Britain]], most of the rail system, including the [[London Underground]], is policed by a national transport police agency, the [[British Transport Police]]. Some transit police forces have full policing powers, such as [[BART Police]], [[SEPTA Transit Police]], [[Metro Transit Police Department]], [[Utah Transit Authority Police Department]] or [[MBTA Transit Police]], while in other areas, they have limited powers and are classed as [[special police]] or [[special constable]]s with limited powers.\n\nSome of the crimes transit police and railroad police investigate include [[trespass]]ing on the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of a railroad, [[assault]]s against passengers, tagging of [[graffiti]] on railroad [[rolling stock]] and [[bus]]es or [[bus stop]]s, [[pickpocketing]], ticket [[fraud]], [[robbery]] and theft of personal belongings, [[baggage]] or [[freight]], and [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealing]] at transit stations. They may also engage in random ticket checking hoping to catch and fine ticketless travelers. These controls are usually more frequent in transit systems using an [[Proof-of-payment|honor-based fare collecting approach]]. \n\n\n==Jurisdiction and authority==\nIn federal states like the United States, Canada, or Australia, federal and state statutes determine the jurisdiction and authority of all police departments, including transit police. Most transit police services have the same police authority as any other national, state and local police agencies, such as the [[British Transport Police]], [[New Jersey Transit Police Department]], [[BART Police]], [[Maryland Transit Administration Police]], [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]] Police, [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority Transit Police|SEPTA Transit Police]], [[Utah Transit Authority Police Department]], and the [[South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service]] have rather extensive jurisdictions, including traffic enforcement, with arrest powers on and off property. Transit and [[railroad police]] tend to have better results in finding [[crime|perpetrators]] of crimes they investigate than public police forces, possibly due to specialization and smaller case loads.\n\n==List of specialised transit/transport police agencies and departments==\n\n===[[Australia]]===\n'''New South Wales'''\n*Commuter Crime Unit, [[New South Wales Police Force]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/community_issues/transport_safety|title=Transport Safety - NSW Police Force|first=corporateName=NSW Police Force; jurisdiction=New South|last=Wales|website=www.police.nsw.gov.au}}</ref>\n*Police Transport Command [[New South Wales Police Force]] as of 2013.\n*[[RailCorp Transit Officer|Transit Officers]], [[RailCorp]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityrail.info/travelling_with/safety_and_education/safe_and_secure|title=Keeping you safe and secure - Sydney Trains|first=corporateName=Sydney Trains; contact=Communications Directorate|last=sector=Government|website=Sydney Trains|date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Closed down as of October 2013.\n\n'''Queensland'''\n*Railway Squad, [[Queensland Police]]<ref>http://www.police.qld.gov.au/Resources/Internet/join/documents/LR_Railway_Squad160709.pdf</ref>\n*Authorised Officers, [[Queensland Rail]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.queenslandrail.com.au/forcustomers/safetysecurity/securityinitiatives|title=Security initiatives|website=www.queenslandrail.com.au}}</ref>\n*TransLink Senior Network Officers, [[TransLink (South East Queensland)|TransLink]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://translink.com.au/about-translink/what-we-do/revenue-protection|title=Revenue protection - TransLink|website=translink.com.au}}</ref>\n*Customer Service Officers, [[G:link]]<ref>http://ridetheg.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Glink-Customer-Service-Charter-2014-06-05.pdf</ref>\n\n'''South Australia'''\n*Transit Services Branch, [[South Australia Police]] (all public transport in [[Adelaide]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sapolice.sa.gov.au/sapol/about_us/structure/operations_support_service/transit_services_branch.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524160225/http://www.sapolice.sa.gov.au/sapol/about_us/structure/operations_support_service/transit_services_branch.jsp |archivedate=2011-05-24 }}</ref> Private security also maintain a presence, especially during peak hours or events.\n\n'''Victoria'''\n*Transit Safety Division, Victoria Police members and Protective Services Officers (predominantly operate in [[Melbourne]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?document_id=267 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809051440/http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=267 |archivedate=2011-08-09 }}</ref>\n*Authorised Officers employed by Public Transport operator companies and by [[Public Transport Victoria|Public Transport Victoria (PTV)]].\n\n'''Western Australia'''\n*Police Rail Unit, [[Western Australia Police]] (operating in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]])\n*Transit Officers, [[Public Transport Authority (Western Australia)|Public Transport Authority of Western Australia]]\n\n===[[Canada]]===\n\nThe [[South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service]] (commonly known as the Metro Vancouver Transit Police) is the only full transit police force in Canada, a necessity since Metro Vancouver's [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] public transit system spans 22 separate municipalities and 16 police jurisdictions.\n\nMost other large Canadian cities use security officers appointed as [[special constable]]s or peace officers.

In the first two decades of the twenty-first century, however, there has been a surge of films and television shows focusing on the superhero genre. There are many superheroes whose stories are propelled or entirely result from dealings with transhumanism. From The Incredibles, to Iron Man, to The Batman saga, there have been plenty of heroes who did not receive their powers naturally, and therefore represent the great leap human beings may take into improving their own condition. \n\nAdditionally, because these films represent the most popular trend in the medium today, they indeed represent a glimpse into the ideological shift of western culture as a whole. The fixation on normal men and women improving themselves artificially seems to have become a very widely accepted and celebrated idea.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=40260800|title=Humanity 2.0|journal=The

Cybernetic and genetic modifications, human-machine interfaces, self-aware computer \"spirits\" (advanced AIs), ubiquitous space travel and even true posthuman gods are all quite prominent and featured throughout. The main protagonists of many novels and campaigns, the Imperial Space Marines, are literal textbook transhumans: normal human men who have been so vastly augmented and changed by technology that they are no longer ''Homo sapiens'' but some other, new species. However unlike many transhuman or posthuman futures depicted by authors on the subject, ''Warhammer 40,000'' is bleak, violent and filled with war and even with the existence of posthuman gods (like the Emperor of Mankind or his Primarchs) humanity is still beset on all sides by threats\u2014including those of ''actual'', [[supernatural]] gods, namely the Chaos Gods, the two Orkish deities, Gork and Mork, and their fungal offspring and the C'Tan, the star eating gods who tricked the Necrons into becoming what they are now.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* [[Biopunk]]\n* [[Postcyberpunk]]\n* [[Cyborgs in fiction]]\n* [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]\n* [[Genetic engineering in science fiction]]\n* [[Superhuman#In fiction|Superhumans in fiction]]\n* [[Uplift (science fiction)#Uplifting in science fiction|Uplifting in science fiction]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nanotech-now.com/transhuman-books.htm List of transhumanist books]\n\n[[Category:Transhumanism in fiction| ]]\n[[Category:Science fiction themes]]\n[[Category:Biopunk]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk themes]]\n[[Category:Postcyberpunk]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism_in_fiction"}

International Review of Management and Business Research, 2(2), 355.</ref>'''Transformational leadership''' is a theory of [[leadership]] where a leader works with teams to identify needed change, creating a [[Goal|vision]] to guide the change through inspiration, and executing the change in tandem with committed members of a group;<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/transformational-leadership.html |work=Business Dictionary|title = Transformational Leadership |date = |last = |first = | accessdate = 2016-05-23 | quote = transformational leadership[:] Style of leadership in which the leader identifies the needed change, creates a vision to guide the change through inspiration, and executes the change with the commitment of the members of the group.}}</ref> it is an integral part of the [[Full Range Leadership Model]]. Transformational leadership serves to enhance the motivation, morale, and [[job performance]] of followers through a variety of mechanisms; these include connecting the follower's sense of [[self-identity|identity]] and self to a [[project]] and to the [[collective identity]] of the organization; being a [[role model]] for followers in order to inspire them and to raise their interest in the project; challenging followers to take greater [[ownership]] for their work, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of followers, which allows the leader to align followers with tasks that enhance their performance. It is also important to understand the qualities a transformational leadership can bring to a work organization. Transformational leaders are strong in the abilities to adapt to different situations, share a collective consciousness, self-manage, and be inspirational while leading a group of employees.   \n\nTransformational leadership is when leader behaviors influence followers and inspire them to perform beyond their perceived capabilities. Transformational leadership inspires people to achieve unexpected or remarkable results. It gives workers autonomy over specific jobs, as well as the authority to make decisions once they have been trained. This induces a positive change in the followers attitudes and the organization as a whole. Transformational leaders typically perform four distinct behaviors, also known as the four I's. These behaviors are inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.   \n\nInspirational motivation is when the leader inspires their followers to achieve. This leader sets high and reasonable goals for their followers and their organization. They inspire commitment and they create a shared vision for their organization. Leaders that utilize inspirational motivation motivate followers extrinsically and intrinsically, and they are able to articulate their expectations clearly.   \n\nIdealized influence is when the leader acts as a strong role model for their organization and leads by example. These types of leaders consider the needs of their followers and prioritize their needs. They typically have loads of charisma and are very ethical. Followers of these leaders typically try to emulate their leader as they tend to identify with them easily.\n\nIntellectual stimulation is when the leader encourages their followers to think for themselves. These leaders are creative, innovative, and are very open to new ideas. They tend to be tolerant of their followers mistakes, and even encourage them as they believe they promote growth and improvement within the organization. These leaders create learning opportunities for their followers and abandon obsolete practices.   \n\nIndividualized consideration is when the leader establishes a strong relationship with their followers. These leaders act as a caring supportive resource for their followers and their organization. They mentor their followers and allocate their time to developing their followers potential.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe concept of transformational leadership was initially introduced by [[James V. Downton]], the first to coin the term \"Transformational leadership\", a concept further developed by leadership expert and presidential biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]]. According to Burns, transformational leadership can be seen when \"leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=d5r6dul5Mv0C&pg=PA1|title = Transformational Leadership|accessdate = |website = |isbn = 9780802141187|last1 = Burns|first1 = James Macgregor|year = 2004}}</ref> Through the strength of their vision and personality, transformational leaders are able to inspire followers to change expectations, perceptions, and motivations to work towards common goals. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's [[personality]], traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and challenging goals. Transforming leaders are idealized in the sense that they are a moral exemplar of working towards the benefit of the team, organization and/or community. Burns theorized that transforming and transactional leadership were mutually exclusive styles. Later, researcher [[Bernard M. Bass]] expanded upon Burns' original ideas to develop what is today referred to as Bass\u2019 Transformational Leadership Theory. According to Bass, transformational leadership can be defined based on the impact that it has on followers. Transformational leaders, Bass suggested, garner trust, respect, and admiration from their followers.\n\nBernard M. Bass (1985), extended the work of Burns (1978) by explaining the [[psychological]] mechanisms that underlie transforming and transactional leadership. Bass introduced the term \"transformational\" in place of \"transforming.\" Bass added to the initial concepts of Burns (1978) to help explain how transformational leadership could be measured, as well as how it impacts follower motivation and performance. The extent to which a leader is transformational, is measured first, in terms of his influence on the followers. The followers of such a leader feel trust, admiration, [[loyalty]] and respect for the leader and because of the qualities of the transformational leader are willing to work harder than originally expected. These outcomes occur because the transformational leader offers followers something more than just working for self-gain; they provide followers with an inspiring mission and vision and give them an [[Identity (social science)|identity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision|accessdate = |doi=10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S |volume=18 |issue = 3|journal=Organizational Dynamics |pages=19\u201331|year = 1990|last1 = Bass|first1 = Bernard M.}}</ref> The leader transforms and motivates followers through their idealized influence (earlier referred to as charisma), intellectual stimulation and individual consideration. In addition, this leader encourages followers to come up with new and unique ways to challenge the status quo and to alter the environment to support being successful. Finally, in contrast to Burns, Bass suggested that leadership can simultaneously display both transformational and transactional leadership.\n\nIn 1985, transformational leadership had become more defined and developed whereby leaders known to use this style possessed the following traits: idealized influences, charisma, and inspirational motivation. Transformational leadership made transactional leadership more effective.<ref>Barling, J., & Cooper, C. L. (2008). ''The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior''. Vol. 1: Micro Approaches.

As a result, they inspire, empower, and stimulate followers to exceed normal levels of performance. Transformational leaders also focus on and care about followers and their personal needs and development.<ref name=\":1\" /> Transformational leaders fit well in leading and working with complex work groups and organizations, where beyond seeking an inspirational leader to help guide them through an uncertain environment, followers are also challenged and feel empowered; this nurtures them into becoming loyal, high performers.\n\nThere are 4 components to transformational leadership, sometimes referred to as the 4 I's:\n* '''Idealized Influence (II)''' \u2013 the leader serves as an ideal role model for followers; the leader \"walks the talk,\" and is admired for this. A transformational leader embodies the qualities that he/she wants in his/her team. In this case, the followers see the leader as a model to emulate. For the followers, it is easy to believe and trust in a transformational leader.  \n* '''Inspirational Motivation (IM)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders have the ability to inspire and motivate followers through having a vision and presenting that vision. Combined, these first two I's are what constitute the transformational leader's charisma. A transformational leader manages to inspire the followers easily with clarity. The transformational leader convinces the followers with simple and easy-to-understand words as well as with their own image.\n* '''Individualized Consideration (IC)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders demonstrate genuine concern for the needs and feelings of followers and help them self-actualize. This personal attention to each follower assists in developing trust among the organization's members and their authority figure(s). For example, the transformational leader can point out the problems of a  member working in a group. From this perspective, the leader can work towards training and developing a follower who is having difficulties in a  job. This is an important element because teams are able to rely on and work together so decisions can be made more quickly, the transformational leader increases their buy-in<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smirl |first1=Paul |title=Becoming a Transformational Leader |url=https://wsb.wisc.edu/programs-degrees/mba/blog/2018/08/23/becoming-a-transformational-leader |website=Wisconsin School of Business |accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Intellectual Stimulation (IS)''' \u2013 the leader challenges followers to be innovative and creative, they encourage their followers to challenge the status quo. A common misunderstanding is that transformational leaders are \"soft,\" but the truth is that they constantly challenge followers to higher levels of performance.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Riggio|first1=Ronald E.|title=Are You a Transformational Leader?|date=2009-03-24|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/200903/are-you-transformational-leader|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>\nTransformational leadership is said to have occurred when engagement in a group results in leaders and followers raising one another to increased levels of motivation and morality.<ref name=\":0\" />  It is not enough to make the correct choice, but to make the moral choice. In simple words, a transformational leader is not selfish and sees an opportunity of growth in others. Transformational leadership enhances intellectual stimulation through employee training and development.\n\nTransformational leaders do one thing tranactional leaders don't, which is going beyond self-actualization. The importance of transcending self-interests is something lost sight of by those who see that the ultimate in maturity of development is self-actualization. Bass. (1999). \n\n== Characteristics==\n\nFive major [[personality traits]] have been identified as factors contributing to the likelihood of an individual displaying the characteristics of a transformational leader. Different emphasis on different elements of these traits point to inclination in personality to inspirational leadership, [[transactional leadership]], and transformational leadership. These five traits are as follows.<ref name=\"Bono\">{{cite journal | last1 = Joyce | first1 = E. | last2 = Judge | first2 = Timothy A. | year = 2004 | title = Personality and Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 901\u2013910 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.901 | pmid=15506869| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.7909 }}</ref>\n[[File:\ud2b9\uc9d51.jpg|thumb|right|490px|Results of Meta Analysis finding correlation between personality traits and transformational leadership from data gathered by Joyce Bono and Timothy Judge.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>]]\n\n=== Extraversion ===\nThe two main characteristics of extraverts are [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]] and [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],<ref name=\"Bono\"/> which relate to the social and leadership aspects of their personality, respectively. Extraversion is generally seen as an inspirational trait usually exhibited in transformational leadership.\n\n=== Neuroticism ===\n[[Neuroticism]] generally gives an individual an anxiety related to productivity which, in a group setting can be debilitating to a degree where they are unlikely to position themselves in a role of transformational leadership due to lower self-esteem and a tendency to shirk from leadership responsibilities.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Openness to experience ===\nCreative expression and emotional responsiveness have been linked to a general tendency of openness to experience.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is also seen as a component of transformational leadership as it relates to the ability to give big-picture visionary leadership for an [[organization]].\n\n=== Agreeableness ===\nAlthough not a trait which specifically points to transformational leadership, leaders in general possess an agreeable nature stemming from a natural concern for others and high levels of individual consideration.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> [[Charisma]] and idealized influence is a classic ability of individuals who possess agreeability.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Conscientiousness ===\nStrong sense of direction and the ability to put large amounts of productive work into tasks is the by-product of [[conscientious]] leaders.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is more linked to a transactional form of leadership given the management-based abilities of such individuals and the detail oriented nature of their personality. Results suggest that transformational leaders might give greater importance to values pertaining to others than to values concerning only themselves<ref name=\"Krishnan\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Krishnan | first1 = Venkat | year = 2001 | title = Value Systems of Transformational Leaders | journal = Leadership & Organization Development Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 126\u2013132 | doi = 10.1108/01437730110389274}}</ref>\n\n\nStudies have shown that subordinates' and leaders' ratings of transformational leadership may not converge. According to leaders' self\u2010ratings, the extraverted, intuitive and perceiving preferences favour transformational leadership. On the contrary, subordinates' ratings indicated that leaders with sensing preference are associated with transformational leadership.\n<ref name=\"Hautala\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Hautala | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = The relationship between personality and transformational leadership | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 777\u2013794 | doi = 10.1108/02621710610684259}}</ref>\n\n== Measurement ==\nOne of the ways in which transformational leadership is measured is through use of the [[Multifactor leadership questionnaire|Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire]] (MLQ), a survey which identifies different leadership characteristics based on examples and provides a basis for leadership training.  Early development was limited because the knowledge in this area was primitive, and as such, finding good examples for the items in the questionnaire was difficult.  Subsequent development on the MLQ led to the current version of the survey, the MLQ5X.\n\nThe current version of the MLQ5X includes 36 items that are broken down into 9 scales with 4 items measuring each scale. Subsequent validation work by [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues provided strong evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the MLQ5X.<ref name=\"Antonakis\">{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B.

Although other researchers have still been critical of the MLQ model, since 2003 no one has been able to provide dis-confirming evidence of the theorized nine-factor model with such large sample sizes as those published by Antonakis.\n\nIn regards to transformational leadership, the first 5 components \u2013 Idealized Attributes, Idealized Behaviors, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration \u2013 are considered to be transformational leadership behaviors.\n\n== Effectiveness as compared to other leadership styles ==\nStudies have shown that transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes in relation to other leadership styles.  It is suggested that transformational leadership augments transactional in predicating effects on follower satisfaction and performance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bass, Riggio |first1=Bernard, Ronald |title=Transformational Leadership |date=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |pages=10 |edition=Second }}</ref> According to studies performed by Lowe, Kroeck, and Sivasubramaniam, charisma (or Idealized Influence) was found to be a variable that was most strongly related to leader effectiveness among MLQ scales.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1048-9843(96)90027-2|url=https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Lowe_Effectiveness_1996.pdf|title=Effectiveness correlates of transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic review of the MLQ literature|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385\u2013425|year=1996|last1=Lowe|first1=Kevin B.|last2=Kroeck|first2=K.Galen|last3=Sivasubramaniam|first3=Nagaraj}}</ref>  Other studies show that transformational leadership is positively associated with employee outcomes including commitment, role clarity, and well-being.<ref name=\":3\"/> However, the effectiveness of transformational leadership varies by the situational contexts. For example, it can be more effective when applied to smaller, privately held firms than complex organizations based on its outreach effect with members of the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Y |last2=Simseck |first2=Z |last3=Lubatkin |first3=M.H. |last4=Veiga |first4=J.F. |title=The impact of transformational CEOs on the performance of small- to medium-sized firms: Does organizational context matter?  |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=923\u201334 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.4.923 |pmid=18642995 }}</ref> However, we can conclude that transformational leadership has a positive effect on organizational effectiveness. This is because transformational leaders can encourage and facilitate change in their subordinates and encourage their development and creativity. <ref>Chi, H., Lan, C. and Dorigotov, B.

Openness to experience allows the leader to be more accepting of novel ideas and thus more likely to stimulate the follower intellectually. Conscientious leaders are achievement oriented and thus more likely to motivate their followers to achieve organizational goals. Extraverted and agreeable individuals are more outgoing and pleasant, respectively, and more likely to have successful interpersonal relationships. Thus, they are more likely to influence their followers and to be considerate towards them. Emotionally stable leaders would be better able to influence their followers because their stability would enable them to be better role models to followers and to thoroughly engage them in the goal fulfillment process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss3/7_Edited_Phipps%20Big5_pp430_447_jmDF.pdf|title = THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY FACTORS ON TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP: EXPLORING THE MODERATING ROLE OF POLITICAL SKILL|last = Phipps|first = Simone T.A.|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Leadership Studies|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nA specific example of cultural background affecting the effectiveness of transformational leadership would be Indian culture, where a nurturant-task style of leadership has been shown to be an effective leadership style. Singh and Bhandarker (1990) demonstrated that effective transformational leaders in India are likes heads of Indian families taking personal interest in the welfare of their followers. Leaders in Indian organizations are therefore more likely to exhibit transformational behaviors if their followers are more self-effacing in approaching the leaders. It is also hypothesized in general that subordinates\u2019 being socialized to be less assertive, self-confident, and independent would enhance superiors\u2019 exhibition of transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://rkvenkat.org/varun.pdf|title = Impact of Socialization on Transformational Leadership: Role of Leader Member Exchange|last = Gupta|first = Varun|date = July\u2013September 2004|journal = South Asian Journal of Management|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nFollower characteristics, combined with their perceptions of the leader and their own situation, did appear to moderate the connection between transformational leadership and subordinates\u2019 willingness to take charge and be good organizational citizens. For instance, if subordinates in a work group perceive their leader to be prototypical of them, then transformational leadership would have less of an impact on their willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. Likewise, if subordinates are goal oriented and possess a traditional view of the organizational hierarchy, they tend to be less affected by transformational leadership. Self-motivated employees are less likely to need transformational leaders to prod them into action, while \u201ctraditionalists\u201d tend to see positive organizational citizenship as something expected given their roles as followers\u2014not something they need to be \u201cinspired\u201d to do.\n\nEvidence suggests that the above sets of factors act, in essence, as both inhibitors of and substitutes for transformational leadership. As inhibitors, the presence of any of these factors\u2014either independently or especially collectively\u2014could make the presence of a transformational leader \u201credundant\u201d since followers\u2019 positive behavior would instead be sparked by their own motivations or perceptions. On the other hand, when these factors are not present (e.g., employees in a work group do not see their leader as \u201cone of us\u201d), then transformational leadership is likely to have a much greater impact on subordinates. In essence, when such \u201cfavorable conditions\u201d are not present, managers\u2014and the organizations they work for\u2014should see a better return on investment from transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|date = 2013|journal = Academy of Management Perspectives|doi = 10.5465/amp.2013.0064|pmid =|volume=27|issue = 2|last1 = Wyld|first1 = David|title = Transformation Leadership: When is It Redundant?}}</ref>\n\nIt was shown that leader continuity enhanced the effect of transformational leadership on role clarity and commitment, indicating that it takes time before transformational leaders actually have an effect on employees.

A transformational leader inspires and follows the employee's self-interests, while a transactional leader manages and reinforces generally without employee consideration. Aligning the organization into transformational leaders by committing, being involved, and developing with the employees will lead to higher job satisfaction and motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bass|title=Two Decades of Research and Development in Transformational Leadership|journal=European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology|volume=8|pages=9\u201332|doi=10.1080/135943299398410|url=http://techtied.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/bass_transforrmational_leadership.pdf|year=1999}}</ref> \n\nWhen transformational leadership was used in a nursing environment, researchers found that it led to an increase in organizational commitment.<ref name=b1/> A separate study examined that way that transformational leadership and transactional leadership compare when implemented into an online class.<ref name=\"Kahai\" /> The results of this study indicate that transformational leadership increases cognitive effort while transactional leadership decreases it.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Nelson Mandela===\nNelson Mandela used transformational leadership principles while working to abolish apartheid and enforce change in South Africa.  In 1995, he visited [[Betsie Verwoerd]], the widow of the architect of apartheid Hendrik Verwoerd, at her home in Orania.  Orania was an Afrikaner homeland and a striking anachronistic symbol of racial separation, and Mandela's recurring emphasis on forgiveness contributed toward the healing the prejudices of South Africa and as vast influence as a leader.  In 2000, he was quoted as saying, \"For all people who have found themselves in the position of being in jail and trying to transform society, forgiveness is natural because you have no time to be retaliative.\"<ref name=\"schoemaker\">Schoemaker, Paul (2013-12-05). [https://www.inc.com/paul-schoemaker/what-made-mandela-a-transformational-leader.html \"Nelson Mandela, Transformational Leader.\"] Inc.com.</ref> This illustrates a common approach in the narratives of transformational leadership, of describing a collective or corporate effort in individualised terms, and pointing to the responsibility or opportunity for individuals to commit to making the effort a success. Such an approach is seen in [[Community organizing|community organising]].\n\nHe also set an example for others to follow in terms of sacrifice and philanthropy.  Schoemaker describes one such instance:\n{{Quote|text=\"One such leader received a call from Mandela's office requesting that he accompany the President to the Eastern Cape.  This leader was less than enthusiastic and pleaded that he had an appointment around mid-day clashing with Mandela's request.  But there was no denying Mandela, so the leader agreed to go\u2014but first consulted with his financial director to set a reasonable limit on the size of the anticipated donation request.  They settled on 500,000 Rand, or about $50,000 in those days...upon landing, about 80,000 black school children\u2014all adorned in crisp white shirts\u2014simultaneously bowed to acknowledge the great man's arrival.  As they were climbing down from the helicopter, Mandela planted his hand firmly in his guest's back and said, 'Now, I hope you are not going to disappoint me?' The business leader decided in that instance to double the donation...how could he tell a man who sacrificed as much as Mandela that he couldn't afford to be more generous?\"}}\n\n=== Other Contexts ===\nTransformational leadership studies have been conducted in a variety of contexts including military,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kane|first=Thomas D.|last2=Tremble|first2=Trueman R.|title=Transformational leadership effects at different levels of the Army.|journal=Military Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137\u2013160|doi=10.1207/s15327876mp1202_4|year=2000}}</ref> education,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koh|first=William L.|last2=Steers|first2=Richard M.|last3=Terborg|first3=James R.|date=1995-07-01|title=The effects of transformational leadership on teacher attitudes and student performance in Singapore|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=16|issue=4|pages=319\u2013333|doi=10.1002/job.4030160404}}</ref> higher education teaching,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balwant|first=Paul T.|date=2016-02-01|title=Transformational Instructor-Leadership in Higher Education Teaching: A Meta-Analytic Review and Research Agenda|journal=Journal of Leadership Studies|volume=9|issue=4|pages=20\u201342|doi=10.1002/jls.21423}}</ref> business,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gang Wang|last2=Wang|first2=Gang|last3=Oh|first3=In-Sue|last4=Courtright|first4=Stephen H.|last5=Colbert|first5=Amy E.|date=2011-03-15|title=Transformational Leadership and Performance Across Criteria and Levels: A Meta-Analytic Review of 25 Years of Research|journal=Group & Organization Management|volume=36|issue=2|pages=223\u2013270|doi=10.1177/1059601111401017}}</ref> and temporary settings (e.g., project teams in corporate and education).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tyssen|first=Ana K.|last2=Wald|first2=Andreas|last3=Heidenreich|first3=Sven|date=2014|title=Leadership in the context of temporary organizations: A study on the effects of transactional and transformational leadership on followers' commitment in projects|journal=Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies|volume=21|issue=4|pages=376\u2013393|doi=10.1177/1548051813502086}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balwant|first=Paul T.|date=2019|title=Stay close!

The academic community is a front-runner in this sense of redefining transformational leadership to suit these changes in job definition.\n\nThe future of transformational leadership is also related to [[political globalization]] and a more homogenous spectrum of economic systems under which organizations find themselves operating. Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.\n\nThe concept of transformational leadership further needs clarification, especially when a leader is declared as a transformational or transactional leader. While discussing Jinnah's leadership style, Yousaf (2015) argued that it is not the number of followers, but the nature of the change that indicates whether a leader is transformational or transactional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yousaf|first=Nadeem|date=2015-01-01|title=Salient features of Jinnah's politics|journal=International Journal of Public Leadership|volume=11|issue=1|pages=46\u201364|doi=10.1108/IJPL-07-2014-0007|issn=2056-4929}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Leadership]]\n", "text_old": "<ref>Odumeru, J.

Transformational leadership serves to enhance the motivation, morale, and [[job performance]] of followers through a variety of mechanisms; these include connecting the follower's sense of [[self-identity|identity]] and self to a [[project]] and to the [[collective identity]] of the organization; being a [[role model]] for followers in order to inspire them and to raise their interest in the project; challenging followers to take greater [[ownership]] for their work, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of followers, which allows the leader to align followers with tasks that enhance their performance. It is also important to understand the qualities a transformational leadership can bring to a work organization. Transformational leaders are strong in the abilities to adapt to different situations, share a collective consciousness, self-manage, and be inspirational while leading a group of employees.   \n\nTransformational leadership is when leader behaviors influence followers and inspire them to perform beyond their perceived capabilities. Transformational leadership inspires people to achieve unexpected or remarkable results. It gives workers autonomy over specific jobs, as well as the authority to make decisions once they have been trained. This induces a positive change in the followers attitudes and the organization as a whole. Transformational leaders typically perform four distinct behaviors, also known as the four I's. These behaviors are inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.   \n\nInspirational motivation is when the leader inspires their followers to achieve. This leader sets high and reasonable goals for their followers and their organization. They inspire commitment and they create a shared vision for their organization. Leaders that utilize inspirational motivation motivate followers extrinsically and intrinsically, and they are able to articulate their expectations clearly.   \n\nIdealized influence is when the leader acts as a strong role model for their organization and leads by example. These types of leaders consider the needs of their followers and prioritize their needs. They typically have loads of charisma and are very ethical. Followers of these leaders typically try to emulate their leader as they tend to identify with them easily.\n\nIntellectual stimulation is when the leader encourages their followers to think for themselves. These leaders are creative, innovative, and are very open to new ideas. They tend to be tolerant of their followers mistakes, and even encourage them as they believe they promote growth and improvement within the organization. These leaders create learning opportunities for their followers and abandon obsolete practices.   \n\nIndividualized consideration is when the leader establishes a strong relationship with their followers. These leaders act as a caring supportive resource for their followers and their organization. They mentor their followers and allocate their time to developing their followers potential.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe concept of transformational leadership was initially introduced by [[James V. Downton]], the first to coin the term \"Transformational leadership\", a concept further developed by leadership expert and presidential biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]]. According to Burns, transformational leadership can be seen when \"leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=d5r6dul5Mv0C&pg=PA1|title = Transformational Leadership|accessdate = |website = |isbn = 9780802141187|last1 = Burns|first1 = James Macgregor|year = 2004}}</ref> Through the strength of their vision and personality, transformational leaders are able to inspire followers to change expectations, perceptions, and motivations to work towards common goals. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's [[personality]], traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and challenging goals. Transforming leaders are idealized in the sense that they are a moral exemplar of working towards the benefit of the team, organization and/or community. Burns theorized that transforming and transactional leadership were mutually exclusive styles. Later, researcher [[Bernard M. Bass]] expanded upon Burns' original ideas to develop what is today referred to as Bass\u2019 Transformational Leadership Theory. According to Bass, transformational leadership can be defined based on the impact that it has on followers. Transformational leaders, Bass suggested, garner trust, respect, and admiration from their followers.\n\nBernard M. Bass (1985), extended the work of Burns (1978) by explaining the [[psychological]] mechanisms that underlie transforming and transactional leadership. Bass introduced the term \"transformational\" in place of \"transforming.\" Bass added to the initial concepts of Burns (1978) to help explain how transformational leadership could be measured, as well as how it impacts follower motivation and performance. The extent to which a leader is transformational, is measured first, in terms of his influence on the followers. The followers of such a leader feel trust, admiration, [[loyalty]] and respect for the leader and because of the qualities of the transformational leader are willing to work harder than originally expected. These outcomes occur because the transformational leader offers followers something more than just working for self-gain; they provide followers with an inspiring mission and vision and give them an [[Identity (social science)|identity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision|accessdate = |doi=10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S |volume=18 |issue = 3|journal=Organizational Dynamics |pages=19\u201331|year = 1990|last1 = Bass|first1 = Bernard M.}}</ref> The leader transforms and motivates followers through their idealized influence (earlier referred to as charisma), intellectual stimulation and individual consideration. In addition, this leader encourages followers to come up with new and unique ways to challenge the status quo and to alter the environment to support being successful. Finally, in contrast to Burns, Bass suggested that leadership can simultaneously display both transformational and transactional leadership.\n\nIn 1985, transformational leadership had become more defined and developed whereby leaders known to use this style possessed the following traits: idealized influences, charisma, and inspirational motivation. Transformational leadership made transactional leadership more effective.<ref>Barling, J., & Cooper, C. L. (2008). ''The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior''. Vol. 1: Micro Approaches.

As a result, they inspire, empower, and stimulate followers to exceed normal levels of performance. Transformational leaders also focus on and care about followers and their personal needs and development.<ref name=\":1\" /> Transformational leaders fit well in leading and working with complex work groups and organizations, where beyond seeking an inspirational leader to help guide them through an uncertain environment, followers are also challenged and feel empowered; this nurtures them into becoming loyal, high performers.\n\nThere are 4 components to transformational leadership, sometimes referred to as the 4 I's:\n* '''Idealized Influence (II)''' \u2013 the leader serves as an ideal role model for followers; the leader \"walks the talk,\" and is admired for this. A transformational leader embodies the qualities that he/she wants in his/her team. In this case, the followers see the leader as a model to emulate. For the followers, it is easy to believe and trust in a transformational leader.  \n* '''Inspirational Motivation (IM)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders have the ability to inspire and motivate followers through having a vision and presenting that vision. Combined, these first two I's are what constitute the transformational leader's charisma. A transformational leader manages to inspire the followers easily with clarity. The transformational leader convinces the followers with simple and easy-to-understand words as well as with their own image.\n* '''Individualized Consideration (IC)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders demonstrate genuine concern for the needs and feelings of followers and help them self-actualize. This personal attention to each follower assists in developing trust among the organization's members and their authority figure(s). For example, the transformational leader can point out the problems of a  member working in a group. From this perspective, the leader can work towards training and developing a follower who is having difficulties in a  job. This is an important element because teams are able to rely on and work together so decisions can be made more quickly, the transformational leader increases their buy-in<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smirl |first1=Paul |title=Becoming a Transformational Leader |url=https://wsb.wisc.edu/programs-degrees/mba/blog/2018/08/23/becoming-a-transformational-leader |website=Wisconsin School of Business |accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Intellectual Stimulation (IS)''' \u2013 the leader challenges followers to be innovative and creative, they encourage their followers to challenge the status quo.

In simple words, a transformational leader is not selfish and sees an opportunity of growth in others. Transformational leadership enhances intellectual stimulation through employee training and development.\n\nTransformational leaders do one thing tranactional leaders don't, which is going beyond self-actualization. The importance of transcending self-interests is something lost sight of by those who see that the ultimate in maturity of development is self-actualization. Bass. (1999). \n\n== Characteristics==\n\nFive major [[personality traits]] have been identified as factors contributing to the likelihood of an individual displaying the characteristics of a transformational leader. Different emphasis on different elements of these traits point to inclination in personality to inspirational leadership, [[transactional leadership]], and transformational leadership. These five traits are as follows.<ref name=\"Bono\">{{cite journal | last1 = Joyce | first1 = E. | last2 = Judge | first2 = Timothy A. | year = 2004 | title = Personality and Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 901\u2013910 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.901 | pmid=15506869| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.7909 }}</ref>\n[[File:\ud2b9\uc9d51.jpg|thumb|right|490px|Results of Meta Analysis finding correlation between personality traits and transformational leadership from data gathered by Joyce Bono and Timothy Judge.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>]]\n\n=== Extraversion ===\nThe two main characteristics of extraverts are [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]] and [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],<ref name=\"Bono\"/> which relate to the social and leadership aspects of their personality, respectively. Extraversion is generally seen as an inspirational trait usually exhibited in transformational leadership.\n\n=== Neuroticism ===\n[[Neuroticism]] generally gives an individual an anxiety related to productivity which, in a group setting can be debilitating to a degree where they are unlikely to position themselves in a role of transformational leadership due to lower self-esteem and a tendency to shirk from leadership responsibilities.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Openness to experience ===\nCreative expression and emotional responsiveness have been linked to a general tendency of openness to experience.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is also seen as a component of transformational leadership as it relates to the ability to give big-picture visionary leadership for an [[organization]].\n\n=== Agreeableness ===\nAlthough not a trait which specifically points to transformational leadership, leaders in general possess an agreeable nature stemming from a natural concern for others and high levels of individual consideration.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> [[Charisma]] and idealized influence is a classic ability of individuals who possess agreeability.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Conscientiousness ===\nStrong sense of direction and the ability to put large amounts of productive work into tasks is the by-product of [[conscientious]] leaders.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is more linked to a transactional form of leadership given the management-based abilities of such individuals and the detail oriented nature of their personality. Results suggest that transformational leaders might give greater importance to values pertaining to others than to values concerning only themselves<ref name=\"Krishnan\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Krishnan | first1 = Venkat | year = 2001 | title = Value Systems of Transformational Leaders | journal = Leadership & Organization Development Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 126\u2013132 | doi = 10.1108/01437730110389274}}</ref>\n\n\nStudies have shown that subordinates' and leaders' ratings of transformational leadership may not converge. According to leaders' self\u2010ratings, the extraverted, intuitive and perceiving preferences favour transformational leadership.

Early development was limited because the knowledge in this area was primitive, and as such, finding good examples for the items in the questionnaire was difficult.  Subsequent development on the MLQ led to the current version of the survey, the MLQ5X.\n\nThe current version of the MLQ5X includes 36 items that are broken down into 9 scales with 4 items measuring each scale. Subsequent validation work by [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues provided strong evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the MLQ5X.<ref name=\"Antonakis\">{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B.

Although other researchers have still been critical of the MLQ model, since 2003 no one has been able to provide dis-confirming evidence of the theorized nine-factor model with such large sample sizes as those published by Antonakis.\n\nIn regards to transformational leadership, the first 5 components \u2013 Idealized Attributes, Idealized Behaviors, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration \u2013 are considered to be transformational leadership behaviors.\n\n== Effectiveness as compared to other leadership styles ==\nStudies have shown that transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes in relation to other leadership styles.  It is suggested that transformational leadership augments transactional in predicating effects on follower satisfaction and performance<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bass, Riggio |first1=Bernard, Ronald |title=Transformational Leadership |date=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |pages=10 |edition=Second }}</ref>.

According to Burns, the transforming approach creates significant change\nin the life of people and organizations. It redesigns perceptions and values, and changes expectations and aspirations\nof employees<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's personality, traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and\nchallenging goals<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>.\n\nTransformational leaders look towards changing the future to inspire followers and accomplish goals, whereas transactional leaders seek to maintain the ''status quo'', not aiming for progress. Transactional leaders frequently get results from employees by using authority, while transformational leaders have a true vision for their company, are able to inspire people, and are entirely committed to their work.\n\nThe MLQ does test for some transactional leadership elements \u2013 Contingent Reward and [[Management by exception|Management-by-Exception]] \u2013 and the results for these elements are often compared to those for the transformational elements tested by the MLQ.  Studies have shown transformational leadership practices lead to higher satisfaction with leader among followers and greater leader effectiveness, while transactional practices lead to higher follower job satisfaction and leader job performance.<ref name=\"piccolo\">{{cite journal|pmid=15506858|url=http://www.panglossinc.com/TA-TF%20Paper--JAP%20published.pdf|year=2004|last1=Judge|first1=T.

This leads to subordinates having a free hand in deciding policies and methods.\n\nStudies have shown that while transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes, laissez-faire leadership is associated with negative outcomes, especially in terms of follower satisfaction with leader and leader effectiveness.<ref name=\"piccolo\" />  Also, other studies comparing the leadership styles of men and women have shown that female leaders tend to be more transformational with their leadership styles, whereas laissez-faire leadership is more prevalent in male leaders.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12848221|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/64ab/af52dd802cf569379cf52bbb9822d56857aa.pdf|year=2003|last1=Eagly|first1=A.

Transactional Leadership was the next most effective; in the following order of effectiveness from most to least: contingent reward and managing-by-exception.

Openness to experience allows the leader to be more accepting of novel ideas and thus more likely to stimulate the follower intellectually. Conscientious leaders are achievement oriented and thus more likely to motivate their followers to achieve organizational goals. Extraverted and agreeable individuals are more outgoing and pleasant, respectively, and more likely to have successful interpersonal relationships. Thus, they are more likely to influence their followers and to be considerate towards them. Emotionally stable leaders would be better able to influence their followers because their stability would enable them to be better role models to followers and to thoroughly engage them in the goal fulfillment process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss3/7_Edited_Phipps%20Big5_pp430_447_jmDF.pdf|title = THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY FACTORS ON TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP: EXPLORING THE MODERATING ROLE OF POLITICAL SKILL|last = Phipps|first = Simone T.A.|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Leadership Studies|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nA specific example of cultural background affecting the effectiveness of transformational leadership would be Indian culture, where a nurturant-task style of leadership has been shown to be an effective leadership style. Singh and Bhandarker (1990) demonstrated that effective transformational leaders in India are likes heads of Indian families taking personal interest in the welfare of their followers. Leaders in Indian organizations are therefore more likely to exhibit transformational behaviors if their followers are more self-effacing in approaching the leaders. It is also hypothesized in general that subordinates\u2019 being socialized to be less assertive, self-confident, and independent would enhance superiors\u2019 exhibition of transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://rkvenkat.org/varun.pdf|title = Impact of Socialization on Transformational Leadership: Role of Leader Member Exchange|last = Gupta|first = Varun|date = July\u2013September 2004|journal = South Asian Journal of Management|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nFollower characteristics, combined with their perceptions of the leader and their own situation, did appear to moderate the connection between transformational leadership and subordinates\u2019 willingness to take charge and be good organizational citizens. For instance, if subordinates in a work group perceive their leader to be prototypical of them, then transformational leadership would have less of an impact on their willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. Likewise, if subordinates are goal oriented and possess a traditional view of the organizational hierarchy, they tend to be less affected by transformational leadership. Self-motivated employees are less likely to need transformational leaders to prod them into action, while \u201ctraditionalists\u201d tend to see positive organizational citizenship as something expected given their roles as followers\u2014not something they need to be \u201cinspired\u201d to do.\n\nEvidence suggests that the above sets of factors act, in essence, as both inhibitors of and substitutes for transformational leadership. As inhibitors, the presence of any of these factors\u2014either independently or especially collectively\u2014could make the presence of a transformational leader \u201credundant\u201d since followers\u2019 positive behavior would instead be sparked by their own motivations or perceptions. On the other hand, when these factors are not present (e.g., employees in a work group do not see their leader as \u201cone of us\u201d), then transformational leadership is likely to have a much greater impact on subordinates. In essence, when such \u201cfavorable conditions\u201d are not present, managers\u2014and the organizations they work for\u2014should see a better return on investment from transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|date = 2013|journal = Academy of Management Perspectives|doi = 10.5465/amp.2013.0064|pmid =|volume=27|issue = 2|last1 = Wyld|first1 = David|title = Transformation Leadership: When is It Redundant?}}</ref>\n\nIt was shown that leader continuity enhanced the effect of transformational leadership on role clarity and commitment, indicating that it takes time before transformational leaders actually have an effect on employees. Furthermore, co-worker support enhanced the effect on commitment, reflecting the role of followers in the transformational leadership process.

In 1995, he visited [[Betsie Verwoerd]], the widow of the architect of apartheid Hendrik Verwoerd, at her home in Orania.  Orania was an Afrikaner homeland and a striking anachronistic symbol of racial separation, and Mandela's recurring emphasis on forgiveness contributed toward the healing the prejudices of South Africa and as vast influence as a leader.  In 2000, he was quoted as saying, \"For all people who have found themselves in the position of being in jail and trying to transform society, forgiveness is natural because you have no time to be retaliative.\"<ref name=\"schoemaker\">Schoemaker, Paul (2013-12-05). [https://www.inc.com/paul-schoemaker/what-made-mandela-a-transformational-leader.html \"Nelson Mandela, Transformational Leader.\"] Inc.com.</ref> This illustrates a common approach in the narratives of transformational leadership, of describing a collective or corporate effort in individualised terms, and pointing to the responsibility or opportunity for individuals to commit to making the effort a success. Such an approach is seen in [[Community organizing|community organising]].\n\nHe also set an example for others to follow in terms of sacrifice and philanthropy.  Schoemaker describes one such instance:\n{{Quote|text=\"One such leader received a call from Mandela's office requesting that he accompany the President to the Eastern Cape.  This leader was less than enthusiastic and pleaded that he had an appointment around mid-day clashing with Mandela's request.  But there was no denying Mandela, so the leader agreed to go\u2014but first consulted with his financial director to set a reasonable limit on the size of the anticipated donation request.  They settled on 500,000 Rand, or about $50,000 in those days...upon landing, about 80,000 black school children\u2014all adorned in crisp white shirts\u2014simultaneously bowed to acknowledge the great man's arrival.  As they were climbing down from the helicopter, Mandela planted his hand firmly in his guest's back and said, 'Now, I hope you are not going to disappoint me?'

The academic community is a front-runner in this sense of redefining transformational leadership to suit these changes in job definition.\n\nThe future of transformational leadership is also related to [[political globalization]] and a more homogenous spectrum of economic systems under which organizations find themselves operating. Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.\n\nThe concept of transformational leadership further needs clarification, especially when a leader is declared as a transformational or transactional leader. While discussing Jinnah's leadership style, Yousaf (2015) argued that it is not the number of followers, but the nature of the change that indicates whether a leader is transformational or transactional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yousaf|first=Nadeem|date=2015-01-01|title=Salient features of Jinnah's politics|journal=International Journal of Public Leadership|volume=11|issue=1|pages=46\u201364|doi=10.1108/IJPL-07-2014-0007|issn=2056-4929}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Leadership]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_leadership"}
{"title_page": "TransferJet", "text_new": "'''TransferJet''' is a close proximity wireless transfer technology initially proposed by [[Sony]] and demonstrated publicly in early 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/200801/08-002E/index.html|title=Sony develops TransferJet}}</ref>  By touching (or bringing very close together) two electronic devices, TransferJet allows high speed exchange of data. The concept of TransferJet consists of a touch-activated interface which can be applied for applications requiring high-speed data transfer between two devices in a peer-to-peer mode without the need for external physical connectors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transferjet.org/tj/transferjet_overview.pdf|title=TransferJet Expanded White Paper}}</ref>\n\nTransferJet's maximum physical layer transmission rate is 560 Mbit/s. After allowing for error correction and other protocol overhead, the effective maximum throughput is 375 Mbit/s. TransferJet will adjust the data rate downward according to the wireless environment, thereby maintaining a robust link even when the surrounding wireless condition fluctuates.\n\nTransferJet has the capability of identifying the unique [[MAC Address|MAC]] addresses of individual devices, enabling users to choose which devices can establish a connection.  By allowing only devices inside the household, for example, one can prevent data theft from strangers while riding a crowded train.  If, on the other hand, one wishes to connect the device with any other device at a party, this can be done by simply disabling the filtering function.\n\nTransferJet uses the same frequency spectrum as [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but occupies only a section of this band available as a common worldwide channel.  Since the RF power is kept under -70 dBm/MHz, it can operate in the same manner as that of UWB devices equipped with [[Detect and Avoid|DAA]] functionality.  In addition, this low power level also ensures that there will be no interference to other wireless systems, including other TransferJet systems, operating nearby.\n\nBy reducing the RF power and spatial reach down to a few centimeters (about an inch or less), a TransferJet connection in its most basic mode does not require any initial setup procedure by the user for either device, and the action of spontaneously touching one device with another will automatically trigger the data transfer.  More complex usage scenarios will require various means to select the specific data to send as well as the location to store (or method to process) the received data.\n\nTransferJet utilizes a newly developed '''TransferJet Coupler''' based on the principle of electric induction field as opposed to radiation field for conventional antennas. The functional elements of a generic TransferJet Coupler consist of a coupling electrode or plate, a resonant stub and ground.  Compared to conventional radiating antennas, the TransferJet Coupler achieves higher transmission gain and more efficient coupling in the near-field while providing sharp attenuation at longer distances.  Because the Coupler generates longitudinal electric fields, there is no polarization and the devices can be aligned at any angle.\n\n'''TransferJet Specifications'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transferjet.org/tj/tj_spec.html|title=Basic Specifications}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The single reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] in February 1979 and repeated the feat the following month on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In New Zealand, Tragedy succeeded the number 1 hit for 6 weeks from 18 March - 22 April.\n\n==Origin==\n[[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin Gibb|Robin]] and [[Maurice Gibb]] wrote this song and \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" in an afternoon off from making the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' movie, in which they were starring. In the same evening, they wrote \"[[Shadow Dancing (song)|Shadow Dancing]]\", which was performed by [[Andy Gibb]] (and reached number one in the US).<ref>[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=5545 Tragedy Songfacts]</ref>\n\nThough not originally in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', it has subsequently been added to the musical score of the [[West End theatre|West End]] version of the movie-[[Musical theatre|musical]]. The song knocked \"[[I Will Survive]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] off the top spot in the US for two weeks before that song again returned to number one for an additional week. \"Tragedy\" was the second single out of the three released from the album to interrupt a song's stay at number one.

The single reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] in February 1979 and repeated the feat the following month on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In New Zealand, Tragedy succeeded the number 1 hit for 6 weeks from 18 March - 22 April.\n\n==Origin==\n[[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin Gibb|Robin]] and [[Maurice Gibb]] wrote this song and \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" in an afternoon off from making the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' movie, in which they were starring. In the same evening, they wrote \"[[Shadow Dancing (song)|Shadow Dancing]]\", which was performed by [[Andy Gibb]] (and reached number one in the US).<ref>[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=5545 Tragedy Songfacts]</ref>\n\nThough not originally in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', it has subsequently been added to the musical score of the [[West End theatre|West End]] version of the movie-[[Musical theatre|musical]]. The song knocked \"[[I Will Survive]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] off the top spot in the US for two weeks before that song again returned to number one for an additional week. \"Tragedy\" was the second single out of the three released from the album to interrupt a song's stay at number one. In the US, it would become the fifth of six consecutive number-ones in a single year, tying the record with [[Bing Crosby]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[the Beatles]] for most consecutive number-ones in the US in a single year.\n\nIn 1979, [[NBC]] aired ''[[The Bee Gees Special]]'', which showed how the sound effect for the explosion was created. Barry cupped his hands over a microphone and made an exploding sound with his mouth.

Entune 3.0 is a departure from previous Entune platforms as it is based on the [[Automotive Grade Linux]] operating system as opposed to Blackberry QNX in previous versions.  As such, it is not compatible with Entune 2.x mobile applications and integrations.  However, this operating platform upgrade potentially enables many more third-party developer enhancements by moving to an open-source platform as opposed to the proprietary QNX system used in previous versions.\n\n=== [[CarPlay|Carplay]] ===\nEntune 3.0 relies on an interface and app suite that is installed during vehicle assembly.  Software and firmware updates can be made to the head units via a USB flash drive, and some versions of the head units can also be updated over the air ([[Over-the-air programming|OTA]]).

The tourist industry declined to record low levels within two years of Castro's accession to power. Unlike the US, [[Canada]] normalised relations with Cuba in the 2010s and Canadians increasingly visited Cuba for vacations.  Approximately one third of visitors to Cuba each year (in 2014) are Canadians.

The impact on Cuba's [[socialist state|socialist society]] and economy has been significant. However, in recent years Cuba's tourism has decreased due to the economic recession, escalating foreign investment conflicts and fears, and internal economic restrictions. Since its reopening to tourism in the mid-1990s Cuba has not met the projected growth, has had relatively little restoration, and slow growth. A lack of foreign investment has also had a negative effect.

Such tourism became Cuba's third largest source of foreign currency, behind the two dominant industries of [[sugar]] and [[tobacco]]. Cuban drinks such as the [[daiquiri]] and [[mojito]] became common in the United States during this time, after Prohibition was repealed.\n\nA combination of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the end of prohibition, and World War II severely dampened Cuba's tourist industry, and it wasn't until the 1950s that numbers began to return to the island in any significant force. During this period, American [[organized crime]] came to dominate the leisure and tourist industries, a modus operandi outlined at the infamous [[Havana Conference]] of 1946. By the mid-1950s [[Havana]] became one of the main markets and the favourite route for the [[narcotics]] trade to the United States. Despite this, tourist numbers grew steadily at a rate of 8% a year and Havana became known as \"the Latin [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]\".<ref name=\"Miguel\"/><ref>[http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/funfacts/batist.htm History of Cuba] written and compiled by J.A.

A new governmental body, the National Institute of the Tourism Industry (INTUR), was established to encourage more tourism; taking over hotels, clubs, and beaches making them available to the general public at low rates. Tourist board chief Carlos Almonia announced a program of huge investment in hotels and the creation of a new airport.  But fears of Cuba's post-revolutionary status amongst Americans, who constituted 8 out of 10 of visitors,<ref name=\"Miguel\"/> meant a rapid decrease in travel to the island.\n\nIn January 1961, relations between the nations deteriorated as a result of bank and business expropriations, mass exodus, [[summary executions]], and private property being declared illegal by a now openly communist regime being backed by the [[USSR]]. Tourism travel to Cuba was soon declared by the [[U.S. State Department]] to be contrary to U.S. foreign policy and against the national interest. Tourism that year dropped to a record low of a mere 4180, forcing a dramatic downsizing of Cuba's tourist plans.<ref>[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkhtml&contentId=867459 Revolution to revolution: why is tourism booming in Cuba?] Chandana Jayawardena</ref>  Visitors to Cuba during the 1960s, 70s and 80s were comparatively rare. The number of tourists to the island did increase slowly, but it wasn't until 1989 that they were to equal pre-Revolutionary numbers.<ref name=\"Miguel\"/>\n\nThe collapse [[Revolutions of 1989|of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe]] in 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a crisis in the Cuban economy. The Soviets were Cuba's chief trading partner, and had effectively sheltered Cuba's sugar industry with large subsidies for 30 years. The lack of economic diversification during this period, and the sudden loss of key markets sent the country into a deep economic depression known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]]. The crisis precipitated the communist regime to find new avenues of income.\n\nPolicies were drawn up to satisfy the growing tourist markets of Canada and Europe with an aim to replace Cuba's reliance on the sugar industry and gain much needed foreign currency rapidly. A new Ministry of Tourism was created in 1994, and the Cuban state invested heavily in tourist facilities. Between 1990 and 2000, more than $3.5 billion was invested in the tourist industry. The number of rooms available to international tourists grew from 12,000 to 35,000,<ref name=\"Rockefeller\">[http://drclas.fas.harvard.edu/revista/?article_id=58 Tourism Development for the Cuban Economy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915093601/http://drclas.fas.harvard.edu/revista/?article_id=58 |date=2006-09-15 }}.

This has been made possible due to constitutional changes to Cuba's socialist [[command economy]], to allow for the recognition of foreign held capital. By the late 1990s, twenty five joint foreign and domestic venture companies were working within Cuba's tourist industry. Foreign investors and hoteliers from market based economies have found that Cuba's centralized economy and bureaucracy has created particular staffing issues and higher costs than normal. An additional factor cited by foreign investors is the degree of state involvement at the executive level, which is far higher than average.<ref>[http://cqx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/46/2/223.pdf Hotel and the enormous tourism developments in Cuba] Cornell University.</ref>\n\nThe influx of foreign capital, and associated capitalist management methods, led outside observers to question whether Cuba's socialist system could survive the resulting transformation. Fidel Castro responded in 1991,\n<blockquote>\"In the conditions of a small country like Cuba... It is very difficult to develop... relying on one's own resources. It is for this reason that we have no alternative but to associate ourselves with those foreign enterprises that can supply capital, technology, and markets.\" </blockquote>\nCastro was also of the belief that despite the undeniable influence of \"capitalist ideology\", socialism would prevail both in Cuba and the wider \"battle of ideas\".<ref name=Gunn>Gunn, Gillian. {{cite web |url= http://www.trinitydc.edu/academics/depts/Interdisc/International/caribbean%20briefings/TheSociologicalImpact.pdf |title= The Sociological Impact of Rising Foreign Investment |access-date= 2006-10-23 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928224349/http://www.trinitydc.edu/academics/depts/Interdisc/International/caribbean%20briefings/TheSociologicalImpact.pdf |archive-date= 2007-09-28 |url-status= dead }}&nbsp;{{small|(82.5&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, [[Georgetown University]] Cuba Briefing Paper Series, \"Tourist Apartheid\", January 1993.</ref>\n\nOne of the most notable developments in recent years has been China's investment in Cuba's tourism sector.

The development of new tourist facilities and related infrastructure in Cuba must, among other things, proceed in accordance with Cuban environmental laws and policies.  In 1995 the Cuban government established the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment (CITMA) and in 1997 the National Assembly has enacted Law 81 of the Environment, one of the most comprehensive \"framework\" environmental laws in the region.  Pursuant to that Law, the government adopted a number of decree laws and resolutions aimed at ensuring that future development (including tourism development) is sustainable.  Of particular importance to tourism development is Decree Law 212, Coastal Zone Management, which establishes setbacks and other siting requirements for new facilities in coastal areas.  CITMA Resolution 77/99 requires a thorough environmental assessment of major new construction projects and requires that project developers obtain an environmental license from CITMA.<ref>Daniel J.

The casas provide an inexpensive option for young or independent tourists.

Such tourism became Cuba's third largest source of foreign currency, behind the two dominant industries of [[sugar]] and [[tobacco]]. Cuban drinks such as the [[daiquiri]] and [[mojito]] became common in the United States during this time, after Prohibition was repealed.\n\nA combination of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the end of prohibition, and World War II severely dampened Cuba's tourist industry, and it wasn't until the 1950s that numbers began to return to the island in any significant force. During this period, American [[organized crime]] came to dominate the leisure and tourist industries, a modus operandi outlined at the infamous [[Havana Conference]] of 1946.

Despite this, tourist numbers grew steadily at a rate of 8% a year and Havana became known as \"the Latin [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]\".<ref name=\"Miguel\"/><ref>[http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/funfacts/batist.htm History of Cuba] written and compiled by J.A.

The hotel's guestlist includes [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], and also played host to the infamous [[Havana Conference]] in 1946]]\nImmediately upon becoming [[President of Cuba]] after the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959, [[Manuel Urrutia]] ordered the closing of many bars and gambling halls associated with prostitution and the drug trade, this effectively ending Cuba's image as a hedonistic escape. A new governmental body, the National Institute of the Tourism Industry (INTUR), was established to encourage more tourism; taking over hotels, clubs, and beaches making them available to the general public at low rates. Tourist board chief Carlos Almonia announced a program of huge investment in hotels and the creation of a new airport.  But fears of Cuba's post-revolutionary status amongst Americans, who constituted 8 out of 10 of visitors,<ref name=\"Miguel\"/> meant a rapid decrease in travel to the island.\n\nIn January 1961, relations between the nations deteriorated as a result of bank and business expropriations, mass exodus, [[summary executions]], and private property being declared illegal by a now openly communist regime being backed by the [[USSR]]. Tourism travel to Cuba was soon declared by the [[U.S. State Department]] to be contrary to U.S. foreign policy and against the national interest. Tourism that year dropped to a record low of a mere 4180, forcing a dramatic downsizing of Cuba's tourist plans.<ref>[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkhtml&contentId=867459 Revolution to revolution: why is tourism booming in Cuba?] Chandana Jayawardena</ref>  Visitors to Cuba during the 1960s, 70s and 80s were comparatively rare. The number of tourists to the island did increase slowly, but it wasn't until 1989 that they were to equal pre-Revolutionary numbers.<ref name=\"Miguel\"/>\n\nThe collapse [[Revolutions of 1989|of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe]] in 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a crisis in the Cuban economy. The Soviets were Cuba's chief trading partner, and had effectively sheltered Cuba's sugar industry with large subsidies for 30 years. The lack of economic diversification during this period, and the sudden loss of key markets sent the country into a deep economic depression known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]]. The crisis precipitated the communist regime to find new avenues of income.\n\nPolicies were drawn up to satisfy the growing tourist markets of Canada and Europe with an aim to replace Cuba's reliance on the sugar industry and gain much needed foreign currency rapidly. A new Ministry of Tourism was created in 1994, and the Cuban state invested heavily in tourist facilities. Between 1990 and 2000, more than $3.5 billion was invested in the tourist industry. The number of rooms available to international tourists grew from 12,000 to 35,000,<ref name=\"Rockefeller\">[http://drclas.fas.harvard.edu/revista/?article_id=58 Tourism Development for the Cuban Economy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915093601/http://drclas.fas.harvard.edu/revista/?article_id=58 |date=2006-09-15 }}.

By far the largest number come from [[Canada]], where arrivals have been increasing by almost 10% annually since 2007. Europeans follow next, primarily arriving from Great Britain, Spain, Italy, France and Germany.

This has been made possible due to constitutional changes to Cuba's socialist [[command economy]], to allow for the recognition of foreign held capital. By the late 1990s, twenty five joint foreign and domestic venture companies were working within Cuba's tourist industry. Foreign investors and hoteliers from market based economies have found that Cuba's centralized economy and bureaucracy has created particular staffing issues and higher costs than normal. An additional factor cited by foreign investors is the degree of state involvement at the executive level, which is far higher than average.<ref>[http://cqx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/46/2/223.pdf Hotel and the enormous tourism developments in Cuba] Cornell University.</ref>\n\nThe influx of foreign capital, and associated capitalist management methods, led outside observers to question whether Cuba's socialist system could survive the resulting transformation. Fidel Castro responded in 1991,\n<blockquote>\"In the conditions of a small country like Cuba... It is very difficult to develop... relying on one's own resources. It is for this reason that we have no alternative but to associate ourselves with those foreign enterprises that can supply capital, technology, and markets.\" </blockquote>\nCastro was also of the belief that despite the undeniable influence of \"capitalist ideology\", socialism would prevail both in Cuba and the wider \"battle of ideas\".<ref name=Gunn>Gunn, Gillian. {{cite web |url= http://www.trinitydc.edu/academics/depts/Interdisc/International/caribbean%20briefings/TheSociologicalImpact.pdf |title= The Sociological Impact of Rising Foreign Investment |access-date= 2006-10-23 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928224349/http://www.trinitydc.edu/academics/depts/Interdisc/International/caribbean%20briefings/TheSociologicalImpact.pdf |archive-date= 2007-09-28 |url-status= dead }}&nbsp;{{small|(82.5&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, [[Georgetown University]] Cuba Briefing Paper Series, \"Tourist Apartheid\", January 1993.</ref>\n\nOne of the most notable developments in recent years has been China's investment in Cuba's tourism sector.

The development of new tourist facilities and related infrastructure in Cuba must, among other things, proceed in accordance with Cuban environmental laws and policies.  In 1995 the Cuban government established the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment (CITMA) and in 1997 the National Assembly has enacted Law 81 of the Environment, one of the most comprehensive \"framework\" environmental laws in the region.  Pursuant to that Law, the government adopted a number of decree laws and resolutions aimed at ensuring that future development (including tourism development) is sustainable.  Of particular importance to tourism development is Decree Law 212, Coastal Zone Management, which establishes setbacks and other siting requirements for new facilities in coastal areas.  CITMA Resolution 77/99 requires a thorough environmental assessment of major new construction projects and requires that project developers obtain an environmental license from CITMA.<ref>Daniel J.

Cuba has been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. In 2005, more than 19,600 foreign patients traveled to Cuba for a wide range of treatments including [[eye surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=2010-01-28 }} Caribbean News Net</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm Cuba sells its medical expertise] BBC News</ref>\n\nSome complaints have arisen that foreign \"health tourists\" paying with dollars receive a higher quality of care than do Cuban citizens. Former leading Cuban [[neurosurgeon]] and [[dissident]] Dr. [[Hilda Molina]] asserts that the central revolutionary objective of free, quality medical care for all has been eroded by Cuba's need for foreign currency. Molina says that following the economic collapse known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]], the Cuban government established mechanisms designed to turn the medical system into a profit-making enterprise, thus creating a disparity in the quality of healthcare services between Cubans and foreigners.<ref>[http://www.cubacenter.org/media/archives/1998/summer/medicine_today.php3 Cuban Medicine Today by Dr [[Hilda Molina]]] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529183606/http://www.cubacenter.org/media/archives/1998/summer/medicine_today.php3 |date=2006-05-29 }} Center for a free Cuba - link fails 16.9.06</ref>\n\n===Mountain tourism===\nThe recent studies shows that Cuba has a huge potential for [[mountaineering]] activity, however, it is not utilized properly. The mountaineering in Cuba should be considered to be one of the key contributors (as well as other forms of active tourism e.g. biking, diving, caving) to the development, prosperity, and well-being of all stakeholders, and especially for the communities outside the tourism enclaves<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Apollo, M. & Rettinger, R.|date=2018-03-07|title=Mountaineering in Cuba: improvement of true accessibility as an opportunity for regional development of communities outside the tourism enclaves|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|volume=22|issue=15|pages=1797\u20131804|doi=10.1080/13683500.2018.1446920|issn=1368-3500}}</ref>. Furthermore, mountaineering regions mostly lie outside the enclaves, so no conflict will exist between active and [[All-inclusive_resort|all-inclusive]] tourism.

One such side effect is the revival of sex tourism in the city. Sex tourism was a central part of the tourism industry before the Revolution. However, after 1960, prostitution was essentially eradicated on the island due to government initiatives and a significant drop in demand as tourism was minimized.<ref name=\"Trumbull\">{{cite journal |last1=Trumbull |first1=C. |title=Prostitution and Sex Tourism in Cuba |journal=Cuba in Transition |publisher=American Society for the Study of the Cuban Economy |year=2001}}</ref> With tourism becoming more prevalent in the 1990s, however, so did the practice of prostitution. The demographic profile of tourists (the overwhelming majority being men between ages 25\u201360) is a key indicator of the existence of prostitution. Additionally, websites and magazines, such as Playboy, have outlined the opportunities for both heterosexual and homosexual sex tourism.<ref name=\"Trumbull\"/> According to Trumbull, many prostitutes engage in the practice out of economic necessity, but they do not work in oppressive conditions and a large number of prostitutes in contemporary Havana see the work as a way to earn a better living than if they were to work in open jobs throughout the city.<ref name=\"Trumbull\"/> Therefore, contemporary prostitution is different than the sex tourism of the 1950s in this regard.\n\n== Tourism: Economic Reform ==\n{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}\n\nCuba remains one of the few countries with an economy established by a centralized government.

These are typically single-family residences, and are a very popular choice for tourists. Prices can range from 15 to 30 euros per night or less for longer stays. The casas provide an inexpensive option for young or independent tourists. A stay in a private casa allows tourists more opportunity to mix with local Cubans, and engage in Cuban cultural life.\n\n== Social impacts  of tourism ==\nAs tourism played an increasing role in the economy, a large percentage of young people migrate to resort towns seeking employment in the tourism industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latintimes.com/tourism-cuba-threatens-drive-income-inequality-regional-disparities-risk-334069|title=Tourism In Cuba Threatens To Drive Up Income Inequality, Regional Disparities, Risk|date=11 August 2015|accessdate=31 July 2016}}</ref> Many of them working in menial jobs can earn more through tips than they can employed as professionals.

He described the moves as an economic necessity that would need to be maintained for as long as the country had a need for foreign currency. According to Castro, the government was \"pondering formulas\" that would allow Cubans to use some of the tourist facilities as a reward for outstanding work, but he believed that giving Cubans access to amenities at the expense of paying foreign tourists would ultimately be a counterproductive move for the economy.<ref name=Farah>Farah, Douglas.

The British administrative body, the [[National Cyclists' Union]] (NCU), had feared since the 19th century that massed racing on the roads would endanger all racing, including early-morning [[time trials]] and, originally, the very place of cyclists on the road.<ref>\"From James Moore to Laurent Fignon\", Cyclist Monthly, September 1983</ref>\n\nA race organised from [[Llangollen]] to [[Wolverhampton]] on 7 June 1942, in defiance of the NCU, led to its organisers and riders being banned. They formed a new body, the [[British League of Racing Cyclists]] (BLRC), which wanted not only massed racing but a British version of the [[Tour de France]].<ref>\"100 years of racing\", ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'', 29 April 1978</ref>\n\nThe first multi-day stage race in Britain was the Southern Grand Prix in [[Kent]] in August 1944.<ref name=ride>{{cite book| last=Messenger| first=Chas| authorlink=Chas Messenger| title=Ride and be Damned| publisher=Pedal Publishing| location=Harpenden| year=1998| isbn=978-0-9534096-0-0| page=151}}</ref> It was won by Les Plume of [[Manchester]]. The first stage was won by [[Percy Stallard]], the organiser of the Llangollen-Wolverhampton race in 1942.\n\nThe experience encouraged the BLRC to run a bigger race, the Victory Cycling Marathon, to celebrate the end of the war in 1945. It ran from [[Brighton]] to [[Glasgow]] in five stages and was won by Robert Batot of [[France]], with Frenchmen taking six of the top 10 places, the mountains competition and best team.\n\n[[Chas Messenger]], a BLRC official and historian, said: \"No one had ever put on a stage race in this country, other than the Southern Grand Prix, and even fewer people had even seen one. So raw were they that Jimmy Kain (the organiser) even wrote to the [[Auto-Cycle Union]] \u2013 the body for motorcycle racing \u2013 and the flags used by them were taken as a guide to what was needed.<ref name=ride/> Kain recalled the precarious budget: \"\u00a344 entry fees and \u00a3130 of my own money and \u00a316 when I went round with the hat after the Bradford stage.\"<ref>Letter to Percy Stallard, 1 January 1979</ref>\n\nThe writer Roger St Pierre said:\n:\"It was reported that 20,000 watched the start but I've seen a picture which would indicate it was probably three or four times that number. What outsiders didn't see though was just what a ramshackle affair it all was, with riders finishing stages often miles longer than billed then having to find a bed for the night \u2013 with the poorer riders ending up spending the night huddled in barns, haylofts or even under the hedgerows.\"<ref>St Pierre, Roger, Cycling Plus, UK, undated</ref>\n\nThe BLRC was not recognised by the world governing body, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] and so it recruited its French riders from another rebel organisation, the communist F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive et Gymnastique du Travail, using French caf\u00e9-owners in [[Soho]], [[London]], as their link.\n\n===Sponsors and politics===\n\n[[File:Gordon Thomas Receiving the 1953 Tour of Britain Winners Cup.jpg|thumb|[[Gordon Thomas (cyclist)|Gordon Thomas]] receiving the 1953 Tour of Britain cup]]\nThe Victory Cycling Marathon was run on what little money the BLRC could raise. Riders stayed in cheap boarding houses and officials used their own cars. In 1947, the ''[[News of the World]]'' gave \u00a3500 to the race, by then called Brighton-Glasgow. Within a year it pulled out again, concerned by the internal arguments that had bedevilled the BLRC from the start. The 1950 race was sponsored by ''Sporting Record'', another newspaper, followed by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in 1951.\n\nThe cycling official John Dennis said in 2002:\n:\"The most effective sponsor of the Tour of Britain (the ''Daily Express'') was lost as a result of the constant bickering between rival officials and organisations. I was the press officer to the ''Express'' publicity director, Albert Asher, and saw it all happen. He was upset by the petty disagreements and decided to support the new Formula 1 motor-racing instead.\"<ref>Fellowship News, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, issue 28, 2002</ref>\n\nSponsorship was taken up by the makers of [[Quaker Oats]] in 1954, and then in 1958 by the [[Milk Marketing Board]].\n\n===The Milk Race {{anchor|milkrace}}===\n{{redirect|Milk Race|the video game|Milk Race (video game)}}\nThe [[Milk Marketing Board]] (MMB) was a sales [[monopoly]] for [[dairy farming|dairy farmers]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. A semi-professional cyclist from [[Derby]], Dave Orford, asked the MMB to pay for \"Drink more milk\" to be embroidered on the jersey of every semi-professional, or independent, rider in the country. The MMB could then advertise that races had been won because of the properties of milk and the winner would receive a \u00a310 bonus as a result.\n\nOrford met the MMB's publicity officer, Reg Pugh, at the board's headquarters in [[Thames Ditton]], west of London. Orford said: \"At the end of the discussion he stated that the MMB would prefer to sponsor a major international marathon. So the Milk Race, the Tour of Britain, was born, starting in 1958 and lasting for 35 years, the longest cycle sponsorship in the UK ever.\"<ref>Private papers, January 2003</ref>\n\nThe first two races were open to semi-professionals but from 1960 until 1984 it was open only to amateurs. From 1985 until 1993 it was open to both amateurs and professionals. After 1993 the Milk Race ended as the MMB was wound up because of European monopoly laws.\n\nA tie-in video game, ''[[Milk Race (video game)|Milk Race]]'', was released in 1987.\n\nThe title ''Milk Race'' was revived in May 2013 as an annual one-day [[criterium]] in [[Nottingham]], with elite men's and women's races. The event is organised by [[Tony Doyle (cyclist)|Tony Doyle]] as Race Director and sponsored by the [[Dairy Council]] and the Milk Marketing Forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/537637/milk-race-returns.html |title=Milk Race returns |last1=Wynn |first1=Nigel|date=28 March 2013 |work=[[Cycling Weekly]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/22679312 |title=BBC Sport - Milk Race: Dani King wins women's race in Nottingham}}</ref>\n\n===Kellogg's Tour and PruTour===\n\n[[File:Waiting for the race (15377510045).jpg|thumb|The ''[[Caravane (cycling)|caravane]]'' before the race passed near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]]]\nThe professional Kellogg's Tour of Britain ran for eight editions from 1987 to 1994.

The [[Prudential plc]]-sponsored PruTour (1998\u20131999) ran twice.

London again hosted the final stage, however the Tour used a new circuit centered around [[Regent Street]] and [[Piccadilly]] as opposed to its traditional Whitehall loop, versions of which featured in seven editions of the race between 2004 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/tour-of-britain-2015-route-unveiled-162374 |title=Tour of Britain 2015 route unveiled |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=17 March 2015|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref> German rider [[Andr\u00e9 Greipel]], riding for [[Lotto\u2013Soudal]] was first across the line but was subsequently disqualified for a dangerous sprint.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/andre-greipel-denies-wrong-doing-after-being-relegated-in-tour-of-britain-finale-191412 |title=Andr\u00e9 Greipel denies wrongdoing after being relegated in Tour of Britain finale |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=13 September 2015|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref> In doing so, he became the first rider to be stripped of a stage win in modern race history; [[Elia Viviani]] was awarded the victory to go alongside successes in [[Wrexham]] on stage one and [[Floors Castle]] on stage three.\n\n===2016===\n{{Main|2016 Tour of Britain}}\nThe [[2016 Tour of Britain]], held between Sunday 4 and Sunday 11 September<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/tour-of-britain-2016-route-confirmed-with-stages-in-scotland-wales-and-dartmoor-213397 |title=Tour of Britain 2016 route confirmed with stages in Scotland, Wales and Dartmoor |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=25 February 2016|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref>, was won by home rider [[Steve Cummings]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/im-simple-guy-just-wants-ride-bike-283844 |title=Steve Cummings: \"I'm a simple guy who just wants to ride his bike\" |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=11 September 2016|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref>, who had previously finished second in 2008 and 2011.

Cummings formed the basis of his overall victory by placing second on [[Kendal]]'s steep Beast Banks climb on stage two, before moving into the race lead after the individual time trial in Bristol on stage 7a (the 2016 race was the third and, at present, last edition to feature a split stage). [[Team Sky]] enjoyed a productive week, with [[Ian Stannard]] soloing to a memorable victory at [[Tatton Park]] and [[Wout Poels]] taking victory atop a wind-swept Haytor on stage six. Poels' success followed his win on Hartside Pass in the 2015 race's hill-top finish stage. The 2016 Tour also proved to be the last professional race of [[Bradley Wiggins]]' cycling career before he retired from the sport. He placed 105th overall, riding for the eponymous [[Team Wiggins Le Col]] squad.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/28/bradley-wiggins-announces-retirement-from-cycling |title=Bradley Wiggins announces retirement from professional cycling |last=Glendenning |first=Barry |date=29 December 2016|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===2017===\n{{Main|2017 Tour of Britain}}\nThe [[2017 Tour of Britain]], which took place between Sunday 3 and Sunday 10 September, was won by Dutch rider [[Lars Boom]]. The  [[Team Jumbo\u2013Visma]] rider's victory saw him become the second rider to win the modern race overall for a second time following [[Edvald Boasson Hagen]]'s wins in 2009 and 2015.\n\nThis edition of the race was sponsored by [[OVO Energy]], the first of three editions that the Bristol-based energy supply company were the title partner of. In another move that emphasised the race's status on the international cycling calendar, [[ITV4]] broadcast each stage live in full for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/3334/tour-of-britain-to-broadcast-in-full-on-itv4 |title=Tour of Britain to broadcast on ITV4 |last=Robinson |first=Joseph |date=23 August 2017|publisher=Cyclist}}</ref>\n\n===2018===\n{{Main|2018 Tour of Britain}}\n[[Julian Alaphilippe]] became the first Frenchman to win the Tour of Britain since 2008 when he triumphed in the 2018 edition.

Fittingly for Thomas, the race started in Wales, with the other seven stages taking place in England.\n\nOutlining the event's innovative nature, the race's first-ever [[team time trial]] stage took place on day five of the Tour. Starting in [[Cockermouth]], the 14km uphill stage finished at [[Whinlatter]] having climbed the western side of the fell. The following day's stage also finished atop Whinlatter, albeit after two ascents of its eastern side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tourofbritain.co.uk/2018-ovo-energy-tour-of-britain-route-revealed/ |title=2018 Tour of Britain route revealed |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=5 June 2018|publisher=Tour of Britain}}</ref>\n\n===2019===\n{{Main|2019 Tour of Britain}}\nThe [[2019 Tour of Britain]], the first edition of the race to be run from Saturday to Saturday since 2010 (7 to 14 September)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tourofbritain.co.uk/2019-tour-of-britain-route-revealed/ |title=Explore the Tour of Britain 2019 route |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=3 September 2019|publisher=Tour of Britain}}</ref>, was won by [[Mathieu van der Poel]] after a race-long battle with Italian rider [[Matteo Trentin]] ([[Mitchelton\u2013Scott (men's team)]]).\n\nTogether with compatriot [[Dylan Groenewegen]], van der Poel won three stages of the race, including the [[Greater Manchester]] finale on day eight - one that started in Altrincham and visited all 10 boroughs of the metropolitan county before finishing along [[Deansgate]].

From 2014, the race has been rated [[UCI race classifications#Road racing|2.HC]] by the UCI.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.tourofbritain.co.uk/news/8991#.UvEoxPumXfUsp\n|title=The Tour of Britain upgraded to 2.HC status by UCI\n|date=4 February 2014\n|accessdate=4 February 2014\n|publisher=The Tour of Britain\n}}</ref> The race will become part of the new [[UCI ProSeries]] in 2020.\n\n==Tour of Britain (1945\u20131999)==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Tour of Britain has its origins in a dispute between cyclists during the Second World War. The British administrative body, the [[National Cyclists' Union]] (NCU), had feared since the 19th century that massed racing on the roads would endanger all racing, including early-morning [[time trials]] and, originally, the very place of cyclists on the road.<ref>\"From James Moore to Laurent Fignon\", Cyclist Monthly, September 1983</ref>\n\nA race organised from [[Llangollen]] to [[Wolverhampton]] on 7 June 1942, in defiance of the NCU, led to its organisers and riders being banned. They formed a new body, the [[British League of Racing Cyclists]] (BLRC), which wanted not only massed racing but a British version of the [[Tour de France]].<ref>\"100 years of racing\", ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'', 29 April 1978</ref>\n\nThe first multi-day stage race in Britain was the Southern Grand Prix in [[Kent]] in August 1944.<ref name=ride>{{cite book| last=Messenger| first=Chas| authorlink=Chas Messenger| title=Ride and be Damned| publisher=Pedal Publishing| location=Harpenden| year=1998| isbn=978-0-9534096-0-0| page=151}}</ref> It was won by Les Plume of [[Manchester]]. The first stage was won by [[Percy Stallard]], the organiser of the Llangollen-Wolverhampton race in 1942.\n\nThe experience encouraged the BLRC to run a bigger race, the Victory Cycling Marathon, to celebrate the end of the war in 1945. It ran from [[Brighton]] to [[Glasgow]] in five stages and was won by Robert Batot of [[France]], with Frenchmen taking six of the top 10 places, the mountains competition and best team.\n\n[[Chas Messenger]], a BLRC official and historian, said: \"No one had ever put on a stage race in this country, other than the Southern Grand Prix, and even fewer people had even seen one. So raw were they that Jimmy Kain (the organiser) even wrote to the [[Auto-Cycle Union]] \u2013 the body for motorcycle racing \u2013 and the flags used by them were taken as a guide to what was needed.<ref name=ride/> Kain recalled the precarious budget: \"\u00a344 entry fees and \u00a3130 of my own money and \u00a316 when I went round with the hat after the Bradford stage.\"<ref>Letter to Percy Stallard, 1 January 1979</ref>\n\nThe writer Roger St Pierre said:\n:\"It was reported that 20,000 watched the start but I've seen a picture which would indicate it was probably three or four times that number. What outsiders didn't see though was just what a ramshackle affair it all was, with riders finishing stages often miles longer than billed then having to find a bed for the night \u2013 with the poorer riders ending up spending the night huddled in barns, haylofts or even under the hedgerows.\"<ref>St Pierre, Roger, Cycling Plus, UK, undated</ref>\n\nThe BLRC was not recognised by the world governing body, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] and so it recruited its French riders from another rebel organisation, the communist F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive et Gymnastique du Travail, using French caf\u00e9-owners in [[Soho]], [[London]], as their link.\n\n===Sponsors and politics===\n\n[[File:Gordon Thomas Receiving the 1953 Tour of Britain Winners Cup.jpg|thumb|[[Gordon Thomas (cyclist)|Gordon Thomas]] receiving the 1953 Tour of Britain cup]]\nThe Victory Cycling Marathon was run on what little money the BLRC could raise. Riders stayed in cheap boarding houses and officials used their own cars. In 1947, the ''[[News of the World]]'' gave \u00a3500 to the race, by then called Brighton-Glasgow. Within a year it pulled out again, concerned by the internal arguments that had bedevilled the BLRC from the start. The 1950 race was sponsored by ''Sporting Record'', another newspaper, followed by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in 1951.\n\nThe cycling official John Dennis said in 2002:\n:\"The most effective sponsor of the Tour of Britain (the ''Daily Express'') was lost as a result of the constant bickering between rival officials and organisations. I was the press officer to the ''Express'' publicity director, Albert Asher, and saw it all happen. He was upset by the petty disagreements and decided to support the new Formula 1 motor-racing instead.\"<ref>Fellowship News, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, issue 28, 2002</ref>\n\nSponsorship was taken up by the makers of [[Quaker Oats]] in 1954, and then in 1958 by the [[Milk Marketing Board]].\n\n===The Milk Race {{anchor|milkrace}}===\n{{redirect|Milk Race|the video game|Milk Race (video game)}}\nThe [[Milk Marketing Board]] (MMB) was a sales [[monopoly]] for [[dairy farming|dairy farmers]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. A semi-professional cyclist from [[Derby]], Dave Orford, asked the MMB to pay for \"Drink more milk\" to be embroidered on the jersey of every semi-professional, or independent, rider in the country. The MMB could then advertise that races had been won because of the properties of milk and the winner would receive a \u00a310 bonus as a result.\n\nOrford met the MMB's publicity officer, Reg Pugh, at the board's headquarters in [[Thames Ditton]], west of London. Orford said: \"At the end of the discussion he stated that the MMB would prefer to sponsor a major international marathon. So the Milk Race, the Tour of Britain, was born, starting in 1958 and lasting for 35 years, the longest cycle sponsorship in the UK ever.\"<ref>Private papers, January 2003</ref>\n\nThe first two races were open to semi-professionals but from 1960 until 1984 it was open only to amateurs. From 1985 until 1993 it was open to both amateurs and professionals. After 1993 the Milk Race ended as the MMB was wound up because of European monopoly laws.\n\nA tie-in video game, ''[[Milk Race (video game)|Milk Race]]'', was released in 1987.\n\nThe title ''Milk Race'' was revived in May 2013 as an annual one-day [[criterium]] in [[Nottingham]], with elite men's and women's races. The event is organised by [[Tony Doyle (cyclist)|Tony Doyle]] as Race Director and sponsored by the [[Dairy Council]] and the Milk Marketing Forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/537637/milk-race-returns.html |title=Milk Race returns |last1=Wynn |first1=Nigel|date=28 March 2013 |work=[[Cycling Weekly]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/22679312 |title=BBC Sport - Milk Race: Dani King wins women's race in Nottingham}}</ref>\n\n===Kellogg's Tour and PruTour===\n\n[[File:Waiting for the race (15377510045).jpg|thumb|The ''[[Caravane (cycling)|caravane]]'' before the race passed near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]]]\nThe professional Kellogg's Tour of Britain ran for eight editions from 1987 to 1994.

The [[Prudential plc]]-sponsored PruTour (1998\u20131999) ran twice.

London again hosted the final stage, however the Tour used a new circuit centered around [[Regent Street]] and [[Piccadilly]] as opposed to its traditional Whitehall loop, versions of which featured in seven editions of the race between 2004 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/tour-of-britain-2015-route-unveiled-162374 |title=Tour of Britain 2015 route unveiled |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=17 March 2015|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref> German rider [[Andr\u00e9 Greipel]], riding for [[Lotto\u2013Soudal]] was first across the line but was subsequently disqualified for a dangerous sprint.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/andre-greipel-denies-wrong-doing-after-being-relegated-in-tour-of-britain-finale-191412 |title=Andr\u00e9 Greipel denies wrongdoing after being relegated in Tour of Britain finale |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=13 September 2015|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref> In doing so, he became the first rider to be stripped of a stage win in modern race history; [[Elia Viviani]] was awarded the victory to go alongside successes in [[Wrexham]] on stage one and [[Floors Castle]] on stage three.\n\n===2016===\n{{Main|2016 Tour of Britain}}\nThe [[2016 Tour of Britain]], held between Sunday 4 and Sunday 11 September<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/tour-of-britain-2016-route-confirmed-with-stages-in-scotland-wales-and-dartmoor-213397 |title=Tour of Britain 2016 route confirmed with stages in Scotland, Wales and Dartmoor |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=25 February 2016|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref>, was won by home rider [[Steve Cummings]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-of-britain/im-simple-guy-just-wants-ride-bike-283844 |title=Steve Cummings: \"I'm a simple guy who just wants to ride his bike\" |last=Bull |first=Nick |date=11 September 2016|publisher=Cycling Weekly}}</ref>, who had previously finished second in 2008 and 2011.

Cummings formed the basis of his overall victory by placing second on [[Kendal]]'s steep Beast Banks climb on stage two, before moving into the race lead after the individual time trial in Bristol on stage 7a (the 2016 race was the third and, at present, last edition to feature a split stage). [[Team Sky]] enjoyed a productive week, with [[Ian Stannard]] soloing to a memorable victory at [[Tatton Park]] and [[Wout Poels]] taking victory atop a wind-swept Haytor on stage six. Poels' success followed his win on Hartside Pass in the 2015 race's hill-top finish stage. The 2016 Tour also proved to be the last professional race of [[Bradley Wiggins]]' cycling career before he retired from the sport. He placed 105th overall, riding for the eponymous [[Team Wiggins Le Col]] squad<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/28/bradley-wiggins-announces-retirement-from-cycling |title=Bradley Wiggins announces retirement from professional cycling |last=Glendenning |first=Barry |date=29 December 2016|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>.\n\n===2017===\n{{Main|2017 Tour of Britain}}\nThe [[2017 Tour of Britain]], which took place between Sunday 3 and Sunday 10 September, was won by Dutch rider [[Lars Boom]].

Fittingly for Thomas, the race started in Wales, with the other seven stages taking place in England.\n\nOutlining the event's innovative nature, the race's first-ever [[team time trial]] stage took place on day five of the Tour.

It has seen rapid growth in its first two decades, having notably become the first race to be granted UCI  [[UCI ProTour]] status (now UCI WorldTour) in 2008, and becoming the first event of the [[UCI World Ranking]] calendar in 2009.\n\nThe race has always been held in the middle of the Australian summer season, and features a series of stages incorporating hills and flat sections over a six-day period. \n\nLike other UCI WorldTour races, the event attracts all of the top UCI teams, as well as features a national representative team made up of riders without full-time professional contracts. Teams traditionally consist of six riders.\n\nThe rider with the lowest cumulative time after each stage is honoured with the Ochre Jersey. Similarly, leaders in the Sprint, Mountains and Youth classifications wear jerseys to signify their positions in those standings.\n\n==History==\nThe Tour Down Under was established in 1999 and attracted a mix of local and international teams; for instance, current-day professional team [[AG2R La Mondiale (cycling team)|AG2R La Mondiale]] has competed in every Tour Down Under. \n\nThe concept was originally developed by a team led by [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] [[Team Pursuit|4000m team pursuit]] gold medallist [[Michael Turtur]] in conjunction with the [[Government of South Australia]] as a replacement for the previous [[Australian Grand Prix]] that had relocated to Melbourne a few years earlier.\n\nThe first Tour Down Under was originally a UCI 2.4 class race, and featured teams from Australia and around the world, including [[AG2R La Mondiale|GC-Casino]], [[BigMat-Auber93]], [[Cr\u00e9dit Agricole]], Lampre-Daikin, Palmans-Ideal, [[HTC-Highroad|Deutsche Bank Telekom]], [[Tinkoff (cycling team)|Team home-Jack&Jones]], [[Saeco (cycling team)|Saeco]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], [[Mapei]], plus teams assembled under the banner of 'Team Australia' and 'World Team'.

In 2015, these were upgraded to National Road Series status under the 'Women's Tour' banner. \n\nEvent organisers utilised the 'Women's Tour' name for the first UCI-ranked women's event in 2016. That race - a UCI 2.2 stage race - was won by [[Orica-AIS|Mitchelton-Scott (women's team)]] rider [[Katrin Garfoot]]. [[Amanda Spratt]] has won three events, including two classified at UCI 2.1 level. In 2020 the race became part of the new UCI Women's Pro Series and was won by American rider [[Ruth Winder]]. The women's race visits similar locations to the men's tour, such as the [[Barossa Valley]] and [[Adelaide Hills]] regions. \n\n==Course==\nThe Tour generally features stages surrounding Adelaide, from flat to undulating.  There are no high mountains, giving pure climbers few opportunities.  The traditional penultimate stage involves two laps of Willunga Hill, a 3&nbsp;km climb at an average of 7.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cycle2max.com/bike-hill-climb/Old-Willunga-Hill.aspx?id=656 |title=Old Willunga Hill Hill Climb &#124; South Australia, Australia |publisher=Cycle2max.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}</ref>  However most tour stages finish as a bunch sprint.\n\nSouth Australia in late January is often hot. Daily maximum temperatures approaching or exceeding {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}} are not uncommon - posing a unique challenge to riders.\n\n===Frequent locations===\nAs local Adelaide councils are awarded hosting rights for stage starts and finishes, high streets ad major townships such as [[The Parade, Norwood|The Parade in Norwood]], [[Unley, South Australia|King William Road in Unley]], [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], [[Stirling, South Australia|Stirling's Main Street]] and [[McLaren Vale]] tend to be frequent locations for hosting race departures and arrivals.\n\nRecent editions have seen the inclusion of [[Port Adelaide]] and the small township of [[Uraidla, South Australia|Uraidla]] feature as start/finish locations.\n\nMajor Adelaide regions also feature as part of both the men's and women's Tours Down Under. The Adelaide Hills are typically visited on several occasions in the event as these feature most of the area's major climbing locations, such as [[Mount Lofty]], [[Checker Hill]] and [[Corkscrew Road]]. \n\nThe major South Australian wine region of the [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] usually features at least one in each men's and women's event, with [[Mengler Hill]] the notable major climb of the region, while the long-established vineyards provide a unique setting for cyclists to venture, reminiscent of the continental races in France, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe Fleurieu Peninsula typically hosts one stage start and finish at McLaren Vale and Willunga Hill, however the race also visits the popular beach holiday spots of [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]], [[Port Elliot, South Australia|Port Elliot]] and [[Goolwa, South Australia|Goolwa]] at least once. \n\nOther regions to be visited sporadically include the South Australian [[Riverland]], the [[Coorong National Park|Coorong and Lower Lakes]] and [[Clare Valley wine region|Clare Valley]].\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:HahndorfSA.JPG|Hahndorf is a German settlement in the Adelaide Hills.\nFile:AdelaideHillsForestRange.JPG|Forest Range is a popular cycling location.\nFile:Mount lofty from south.jpg|Mount Lofty looking over the Adelaide Plains.\nFile:Adelaide sunset.jpg|View of Adelaide from the surrounding Adelaide Hills.\n</gallery>\n\n==Jerseys==\nLeaders of competitions within the race wear a distinctive jersey, as per cycling tradition. Both the men's and women's races acknowledge classification leaders with jerseys. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/history/jerseys  |title=Jerseys |publisher=Tour Down Under |accessdate=2007-01-16 |archiveurl = https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/history/jerseys <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2019-04-20}</ref>\n\n===Race classification jerseys===\n*General Classification: The ''Ochre'' jersey is awarded to the rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of each stage and to the winner at the end. [[Ochre]] is associated with Australia and the Tour Down Under is unique in having it for the leader's jersey. The jersey is currently sponsored by [[Santos Limited|Santos]].\n*Sprint Classification: The ''Sprint'' jersey is awarded to the rider with most points and time bonuses awarded to the first three riders across the line at points along the route and at the finish. This jersey's colour and design usually changes based on sponsor. The current Sprint Jersey is blue and sponsored by [[Ziptrak]], an Australian outdoor blind manufacturer.\n*Mountain classification: The ''King of the Mountain'' jersey is awarded to the rider with most points from those awarded to the first five riders over specified climb checkpoints, usually at the top of significant hills. This jersey retains the traditional 'polka dot' design used in cycling races to indicate the leader of this classification. The colour of the dots changes based on the sponsor. The current sponsor is [[Subaru|Subaru Australia]].\n*Young Rider's Classification: The ''Young Rider\u2019s'' jersey is awarded to the leading rider under 23 at the end of each stage. This jersey is traditionally white in colour. The current Young Rider jersey sponsor is the [[University of South Australia]].\n\n===Other prizes===\n*The ''Most aggressive rider'' is awarded red number patches at the conclusion of each day's stage. There is no overall classification. \n*The ''Winning team'' prize is awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time by its four best riders on each of the six stages.\n\n==Cycling Festival==\n[[File:Be active tour.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Participants in the 2005 Be Active Tour at Angaston]]\nA Festival of Cycling incorporating local food and wine experiences, amateur participation activities, street parties and markets and a central event hub have been hallmarks of the event for over a decade to provide greater opportunities for visitors to Adelaide to enjoy life in the city and its surrounding regions. \n\n=== Tour Village ===\nThe 'Tour Village' is the event's central hub and is based in Victoria Square in the Adelaide central business district, due to its proximity to the Hilton Hotel which is the primary accommodation for visiting teams. \n\nThe southern section of the square is the home of the 'Team Zone' which houses equipment, vehicles and facilities for the participating men's teams. \n\nThe northern section serves as a venue for bike retail displays, food vendors and bars, and a large public stage to host the traditional team presentations and an opening weekend concert that is free for the public. \n\n=== Street Parties ===\nHigh streets and townships hosting starts and finishes occasionally hold a street party, akin to a public fete, with fashion parades, local food and wine, markets and cycling-related activities. Some regional starts and finishes will host community breakfasts at start locations. \n\n=== Challenge Tour and participation activities ===\nThe Tour Down Under has a companion event, the ''Challenge Tour'', a recreational event held across one of the Tour Down Under stages prior to the professional riders, in addition to participatory rides for families and children. The inaugural Challenge Tour event in 2003 was known as the ''Break-Away Tour'' and attracted more than 600 riders. In 2004 riders increased to 1,400 and the event was known as the Be Active Tour. The 2005 tour saw more than 1,900 riders leave Salisbury, Williamstown and Angaston in {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} to tackle the hills and roads of stage 2. In 2006, riders rode 154&nbsp;km from Strathalbyn to Yankalilla in temperatures in excess of {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}}. The heat took its toll on riders and a heat policy now exists. As a result of the heat policy, the Challenge Tour has only been cancelled once- in 2018 - when temperatures over 40 degrees forced the event organisers to abandon the ride.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tour Down Under\u2019s Bupa Challenge Tour for amateur riders cancelled because of extreme heat |url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/tourdownunder/tour-down-unders-bupa-challenge-tour-for-amateur-riders-cancelled-because-of-extreme-heat/news-story/c8b44fbd79e1c64bca7e86f0180f7894 |website=The Advertiser |publisher=The Advertiser |accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 the name changed to Mutual Community Challenge Tour and it was joined by the Mutual Community Fun Tour and Powerade mini-tour for children.

This event, known as the Down Under Classic, typically takes place on roads within [[East End, Adelaide|Adelaide's East End]]. The race does not count towards the overall classification of the Tour Down Under, though riders do compete for prize money. The circuit also features the final stage of the Women's Tour Down Under, contested an hour before the start of the men's race. In 2020 the race was held as the Schwalbe Classic. \n\n=== Down Under Classic Winners ===\n{{Cycling past winner start}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2006|name={{sortname|Robbie|McEwen}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|DVL|2006}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2007|name={{sortname|Mark|Renshaw}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|C.A|2007}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2008|name={{sortname|Andr\u00e9|Greipel||Greipel, ANdre}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|THR|2008a}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2009|name={{sortname|Robbie|McEwen}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|KAT|2009}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2010|name={{sortname|Greg|Henderson||Henderson, Greg}}|nat=NZL|team={{ct|SKY|2010}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2011|name={{sortname|Matt|Goss}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|THR|2011}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2012|name={{sortname|Andr\u00e9|Greipel||Greipel, ANdre}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|LTB|2012}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2013|name={{sortname|Andr\u00e9|Greipel||Greipel, ANdre}}|nat=NED|team={{ct|LTB|2012}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2014|name={{sortname|Marcel|Kittel}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|TGA|2014}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2015 Tour Down Under|2015]]|name={{sortname|Marcel|Kittel}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|TGA|2015}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2016 Tour Down Under|2016]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|GEC|2016a}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2017 Tour Down Under|2017]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|ORS|2017}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2018 Tour Down Under|2018]]|name={{sortname|Peter|Sagan}}|nat=SVK|team={{ct|BOH|2018}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2019 Tour Down Under|2019]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|LTS|2019}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2020 Tour Down Under|2020]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|LTS|2020}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner end}}\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Ochre jersey===\nFrom 1999 until 2005, the race presented the general classification leader and eventual winner with a yellow jersey, as with other European races like the [[Tour de France]].

It has seen rapid growth in its first two decades, having notably become the first race to be granted UCI  [[UCI ProTour]] status (now UCI WorldTour) in 2008, and becoming the first event of the [[UCI World Ranking]] calendar in 2009.\n\nThe race has always been held in the middle of the Australian summer season, and features a series of stages incorporating hills and flat sections over a six-day period. \n\nLike other UCI WorldTour races, the event attracts all of the top UCI teams, as well as features a national representative team made up of riders without full-time professional contracts. Teams traditionally consist of six riders.\n\nThe rider with the lowest cumulative time after each stage is honoured with the Ochre Jersey. Similarly, leaders in the Sprint, Mountains and Youth classifications wear jerseys to signify their positions in those standings.\n\n==History==\nThe Tour Down Under was established in 1999 and attracted a mix of local and international teams; for instance, current-day professional team [[AG2R La Mondiale (cycling team)|AG2R La Mondiale]] has competed in every Tour Down Under. \n\nThe concept was originally developed by a team led by [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] [[Team Pursuit|4000m team pursuit]] gold medallist [[Michael Turtur]] in conjunction with the [[Government of South Australia]] as a replacement for the previous [[Australian Grand Prix]] that had relocated to Melbourne a few years earlier.\n\nThe first Tour Down Under was originally a UCI 2.4 class race, and featured teams from Australia and around the world, including [[AG2R La Mondiale|GC-Casino]], [[BigMat-Auber93]], [[Cr\u00e9dit Agricole]], Lampre-Daikin, Palmans-Ideal, [[HTC-Highroad|Deutsche Bank Telekom]], [[Tinkoff (cycling team)|Team home-Jack&Jones]], [[Saeco (cycling team)|Saeco]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], [[Mapei]], plus teams assembled under the banner of 'Team Australia' and 'World Team'.

In 2015, these were upgraded to National Road Series status under the 'Women's Tour' banner. \n\nEvent organisers utilised the 'Women's Tour' name for the first UCI-ranked women's event in 2016. That race - a UCI 2.2 stage race - was won by [[Orica-AIS|Mitchelton-Scott (women's team)]] rider [[Katrin Garfoot]]. [[Amanda Spratt]] has won three events, including two classified at UCI 2.1 level. In 2020 the race became part of the new UCI Women's Pro Series and was won by American rider [[Ruth Winder]]. The women's race visits similar locations to the men's tour, such as the [[Barossa Valley]] and [[Adelaide Hills]] regions. \n\n==Course==\nThe Tour generally features stages surrounding Adelaide, from flat to undulating.  There are no high mountains, giving pure climbers few opportunities.  The traditional penultimate stage involves two laps of Willunga Hill, a 3&nbsp;km climb at an average of 7.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cycle2max.com/bike-hill-climb/Old-Willunga-Hill.aspx?id=656 |title=Old Willunga Hill Hill Climb &#124; South Australia, Australia |publisher=Cycle2max.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}</ref>  However most tour stages finish as a bunch sprint.\n\nSouth Australia in late January is often hot. Daily maximum temperatures approaching or exceeding {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}} are not uncommon - posing a unique challenge to riders.\n\n===Frequent locations===\nAs local Adelaide councils are awarded hosting rights for stage starts and finishes, high streets ad major townships such as [[The Parade, Norwood|The Parade in Norwood]], [[Unley, South Australia|King William Road in Unley]], [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], [[Stirling, South Australia|Stirling's Main Street]] and [[McLaren Vale]] tend to be frequent locations for hosting race departures and arrivals.\n\nRecent editions have seen the inclusion of [[Port Adelaide]] and the small township of [[Uraidla, South Australia|Uraidla]] feature as start/finish locations.\n\nMajor Adelaide regions also feature as part of both the men's and women's Tours Down Under. The Adelaide Hills are typically visited on several occasions in the event as these feature most of the area's major climbing locations, such as [[Mount Lofty]], [[Checker Hill]] and [[Corkscrew Road]]. \n\nThe major South Australian wine region of the [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] usually features at least one in each men's and women's event, with [[Mengler Hill]] the notable major climb of the region, while the long-established vineyards provide a unique setting for cyclists to venture, reminiscent of the continental races in France, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe Fleurieu Peninsula typically hosts one stage start and finish at McLaren Vale and Willunga Hill, however the race also visits the popular beach holiday spots of [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]], [[Port Elliot, South Australia|Port Elliot]] and [[Goolwa, South Australia|Goolwa]] at least once. \n\nOther regions to be visited sporadically include the South Australian [[Riverland]], the [[Coorong National Park|Coorong and Lower Lakes]] and [[Clare Valley wine region|Clare Valley]].\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:HahndorfSA.JPG|Hahndorf is a German settlement in the Adelaide Hills.\nFile:AdelaideHillsForestRange.JPG|Forest Range is a popular cycling location.\nFile:Mount lofty from south.jpg|Mount Lofty looking over the Adelaide Plains.\nFile:Adelaide sunset.jpg|View of Adelaide from the surrounding Adelaide Hills.\n</gallery>\n\n==Jerseys==\nLeaders of competitions within the race wear a distinctive jersey, as per cycling tradition. Both the men's and women's races acknowledge classification leaders with jerseys. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/history/jerseys  |title=Jerseys |publisher=Tour Down Under |accessdate=2007-01-16 |archiveurl = https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/history/jerseys <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2019-04-20}</ref>\n\n===Race classification jerseys===\n*General Classification: The ''Ochre'' jersey is awarded to the rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of each stage and to the winner at the end. [[Ochre]] is associated with Australia and the Tour Down Under is unique in having it for the leader's jersey. The jersey is currently sponsored by [[Santos Limited|Santos]].\n*Sprint Classification: The ''Sprint'' jersey is awarded to the rider with most points and time bonuses awarded to the first three riders across the line at points along the route and at the finish. This jersey's colour and design usually changes based on sponsor. The current Sprint Jersey is blue and sponsored by [[Ziptrak]], an Australian outdoor blind manufacturer.\n*Mountain classification: The ''King of the Mountain'' jersey is awarded to the rider with most points from those awarded to the first five riders over specified climb checkpoints, usually at the top of significant hills. This jersey retains the traditional 'polka dot' design used in cycling races to indicate the leader of this classification. The colour of the dots changes based on the sponsor. The current sponsor is [[Subaru|Subaru Australia]].\n*Young Rider's Classification: The ''Young Rider\u2019s'' jersey is awarded to the leading rider under 23 at the end of each stage. This jersey is traditionally white in colour. The current Young Rider jersey sponsor is the [[University of South Australia]].\n\n===Other prizes===\n*The ''Most aggressive rider'' is awarded red number patches at the conclusion of each day's stage. There is no overall classification. \n*The ''Winning team'' prize is awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time by its four best riders on each of the six stages.\n\n==Cycling Festival==\n[[File:Be active tour.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Participants in the 2005 Be Active Tour at Angaston]]\nA Festival of Cycling incorporating local food and wine experiences, amateur participation activities, street parties and markets and a central event hub have been hallmarks of the event for over a decade to provide greater opportunities for visitors to Adelaide to enjoy life in the city and its surrounding regions. \n\n=== Tour Village ===\nThe 'Tour Village' is the event's central hub and is based in Victoria Square in the Adelaide central business district, due to its proximity to the Hilton Hotel which is the primary accommodation for visiting teams. \n\nThe southern section of the square is the home of the 'Team Zone' which houses equipment, vehicles and facilities for the participating men's teams. \n\nThe northern section serves as a venue for bike retail displays, food vendors and bars, and a large public stage to host the traditional team presentations and an opening weekend concert that is free for the public. \n\n=== Street Parties ===\nHigh streets and townships hosting starts and finishes occasionally hold a street party, akin to a public fete, with fashion parades, local food and wine, markets and cycling-related activities. Some regional starts and finishes will host community breakfasts at start locations. \n\n=== Challenge Tour and participation activities ===\nThe Tour Down Under has a companion event, the ''Challenge Tour'', a recreational event held across one of the Tour Down Under stages prior to the professional riders, in addition to participatory rides for families and children. The inaugural Challenge Tour event in 2003 was known as the ''Break-Away Tour'' and attracted more than 600 riders. In 2004 riders increased to 1,400 and the event was known as the Be Active Tour. The 2005 tour saw more than 1,900 riders leave Salisbury, Williamstown and Angaston in {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} to tackle the hills and roads of stage 2. In 2006, riders rode 154&nbsp;km from Strathalbyn to Yankalilla in temperatures in excess of {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}}. The heat took its toll on riders and a heat policy now exists. As a result of the heat policy, the Challenge Tour has only been cancelled once- in 2018 - when temperatures over 40 degrees forced the event organisers to abandon the ride.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tour Down Under\u2019s Bupa Challenge Tour for amateur riders cancelled because of extreme heat |url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/tourdownunder/tour-down-unders-bupa-challenge-tour-for-amateur-riders-cancelled-because-of-extreme-heat/news-story/c8b44fbd79e1c64bca7e86f0180f7894 |website=The Advertiser |publisher=The Advertiser |accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 the name changed to Mutual Community Challenge Tour and it was joined by the Mutual Community Fun Tour and Powerade mini-tour for children. It was renamed the Bupa Challenge Tour when Mutual Community was purchased by Bupa and continued to run under this title until 2018. In 2019 it was run as the Challenge Tour presented by The Advertiser and was held on a Saturday for the first time in its history.<ref>{{cite web |title=CHALLENGE TOUR TRAVELS FROM COAST TO CATTLE ON SATURDAY OF 2019 TDU |url=https://www.tourdownunder.com.au/news/2018/jul/19/challenge-tour-travels-from-coast-to-cattle-on-saturday-of-2019-tdu |website=Tour Down Under |publisher=Tour Down Under |accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This event, known as the Down Under Classic, typically takes place on roads within [[East End, Adelaide|Adelaide's East End]]. The race does not count towards the overall classification of the Tour Down Under, though riders do compete for prize money. The circuit also features the final stage of the Women's Tour Down Under, contested an hour before the start of the men's race. In 2020 the race was held as the Schwalbe Classic. \n\n=== Down Under Classic Winners ===\n{{Cycling past winner start}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2006|name={{sortname|Robbie|McEwen}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|DVL|2006}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2007|name={{sortname|Mark|Renshaw}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|C.A|2007}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2008|name={{sortname|Andr\u00e9|Greipel||Greipel, ANdre}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|THR|2008a}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2009|name={{sortname|Robbie|McEwen}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|KAT|2009}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2010|name={{sortname|Greg|Henderson||Henderson, Greg}}|nat=NZL|team={{ct|SKY|2010}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2011|name={{sortname|Matt|Goss}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|THR|2011}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2012|name={{sortname|Andr\u00e9|Greipel||Greipel, ANdre}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|LTB|2012}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2013|name={{sortname|Andr\u00e9|Greipel||Greipel, ANdre}}|nat=NED|team={{ct|LTB|2012}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=2014|name={{sortname|Marcel|Kittel}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|TGA|2014}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2015 Tour Down Under|2015]]|name={{sortname|Marcel|Kittel}}|nat=GER|team={{ct|TGA|2015}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2016 Tour Down Under|2016]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|GEC|2016a}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2017 Tour Down Under|2017]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|ORS|2017}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2018 Tour Down Under|2018]]|name={{sortname|Peter|Sagan}}|nat=SVK|team={{ct|BOH|2018}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2019 Tour Down Under|2019]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|LTS|2019}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner rider|year=[[2020 Tour Down Under|2020]]|name={{sortname|Caleb|Ewan}}|nat=AUS|team={{ct|LTS|2020}}}}\n{{Cycling past winner end}}\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Ochre jersey===\nFrom 1999 until 2005, the race presented the general classification leader and eventual winner with a yellow jersey, as with other European races like the [[Tour de France]].

He also won the [[Australian Super Touring Championship]] for BMW in [[1994 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|1994]].\n\nAfter four years of service to the [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] run [[JPS Team BMW]] from 1984 to 1987, Longhurst started his own touring car team in 1988, which became known as [[LoGaMo Racing]], which based itself on the Gold Coast behind the Longhurst family owned [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]]. For sponsorship reasons the team was known by various names during its time including [[Amatil|Freeport]] Motorsport and [[Benson & Hedges]] Racing. Initially running the powerful [[Ford Sierra RS500]] from 1988 to 1990, the team then began using the evolution model [[E30 M3|BMW M3]] (1991\u201393), before running a [[Holden Commodore VP]] supplied by [[Perkins Engineering]] in [[1994 Australian Touring Car season|1994]]. Longhurst saw particular success at [[Lakeside International Raceway]], winning three [[Lakeside ATCC round|rounds]] at the circuit in 1988, 1991 and 1992. In 1995, Longhurst sold out to fellow shareholders Gardner and Terry Morris and formed [[Longhurst Racing]] to compete in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] with a [[Ford Falcon EF]].\n\nTony Longhurst is the only driver to have won five of the now defunct AMSCAR series run at Sydney's [[Amaroo Park]] circuit. He won the series in 1986 ([[BMW E30|BMW 325i]]), 1987 (BMW M3), 1989 and 1990 (Ford Sierra RS500) and 1991 (BMW M3 Evolution).\n\nIn 1992 he also won the NZ Wellington street race in BMW M3. Came 3rd in 1989 Wellington street race and 3rd 1989 and 2nd in 1986 in the Pukekohe Nissan Mobil race in NZ.\n\nIn 2005, Longhurst bought the license for [[Team Dynamik]]'s second car, running the No. 45 car for [[Max Wilson]] under [[WOW Sight & Sound]] sponsorship. Following [[Simon Wills]]'s rollover at the Sandown 500, Longhurst purchased the remaining license from Team Dynamik and replaced Wills as Wilson's co-driver for the following round at Bathurst. He announced his retirement from competitive racing after the [[2005 Bathurst 1000]], where he and Brazilian co-driver [[Max Wilson]] failed to finish the race. He also made an appearance at the [[Targa Tasmania]] that year. He returned to this event in 2006, finishing fourth overall.\n\nLonghurst made two subsequent returns to the V8 Supercar Championship Series. In 2006, he was co-driver for Steve Owen in the [[Rod Nash Racing]] AutoBarn Commodore. The pair put in solid drives finishing 12th at Sandown and 7th at Bathurst. Longhurst's final drive came at the 2007 Sandown 500 where he paired with Glenn Seton following a series of last minute driver swaps in the Holden Racing Team following Mark Skaife having surgery to remove his appendix.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lynch |first1=Michael |title=Skaife ruled out of Sandown after appendix surgery |url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/motorsport/skaife-ruled-out-of-sandown-after-appendix-surgery-20070914-ge5tmd.html |work=The Age |accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 he added a [[Bathurst 12 Hour]] victory, co-driving with Rod Salmon and Damien White.<ref>[http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=319478&FS= Bathurst 12: Event race report]</ref> By winning the 12 Hour, Longhurst joined [[Allan Grice]], [[Gregg Hansford]], [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] and [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]] as winners of both the [[Bathurst 1000]] and Bathurst 12 Hour races (this list was later joined by [[Paul Morris (racing driver)|Paul Morris]] and [[Jonathon Webb]]).\n\nIn 2016, Longhurst returned to competition making an appearance at the [[Sydney Motorsport Park]] round of the [[2016 Australian GT Championship|Australian GT Championship]] in a Marque Sports [[Ford Focus]] and at the [[Silverstone Classic]] driving his [[1994 Australian Manufacturers' Championship]] winning [[BMW E36|BMW 318i]] [[Super Touring]] car.<ref>[http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/07/01/longhurst-eyes-bathurst-amid-race-return/ Longhurst eyes Bathurst amid race return] ''[[Speedcafe]]'' 1 July 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/06/25/longhurst-to-race-to-win-title-winning-bmw/ Longhurst to race title winning BMW at Silverstone] ''Speedcafe'' 25 June 2016</ref>\n\nThe Benson & Hedges Ford Sierra RS500 driven by Longhurst and Tomas Mezera to victory at [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] in 1988 (''pictured right'') is on display at the [[National Motor Racing Museum]] which is located on the outside of the final turn of the famous [[Mount Panorama Circuit]].\n\nLonghurst continues to live on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] and owns and manages the Boat Works facility at [[Coomera]].<ref>[http://www.oceanmagazine.com.au/j/index.php/livenews/1276-the-boat-works-rising The Boat Works Rising] ''Ocean Magazine'' 14 August 2015</ref>\n\nLonghurst will return to Bathurst for the first time since winning the [[2009 WPS Bathurst 12 Hour]] when he will drive at the [[2017 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour]] driving a [[BMW M6 GT3]] for BMW Team SRM alongside [[Timo Glock]], [[Mark Skaife]] and [[Russell Ingall]].\n\n==Career results==\nSourced from Driver Database<ref>[https://www.driverdb.com/drivers/tony-longhurst/ Tony Longhurst at Driver Database]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

He also won the [[Australian Super Touring Championship]] for BMW in [[1994 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|1994]].\n\nAfter four years of service to the [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] run [[JPS Team BMW]] from 1984 to 1987, Longhurst started his own touring car team in 1988, which became known as [[LoGaMo Racing]], which based itself on the Gold Coast behind the Longhurst family owned [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]]. For sponsorship reasons the team was known by various names during its time including [[Amatil|Freeport]] Motorsport and [[Benson & Hedges]] Racing. Initially running the powerful [[Ford Sierra RS500]] from 1988 to 1990, the team then began using the evolution model [[E30 M3|BMW M3]] (1991\u201393), before running a [[Holden Commodore VP]] supplied by [[Perkins Engineering]] in [[1994 Australian Touring Car season|1994]]. Longhurst saw particular success at [[Lakeside International Raceway]], winning three [[Lakeside ATCC round|rounds]] at the circuit in 1988, 1991 and 1992. In 1995, Longhurst sold out to fellow shareholders Gardner and Terry Morris and formed [[Longhurst Racing]] to compete in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] with a [[Ford Falcon EF]].\n\nTony Longhurst is the only driver to have won five of the now defunct AMSCAR series run at Sydney's [[Amaroo Park]] circuit. He won the series in 1986 ([[BMW E30|BMW 325i]]), 1987 (BMW M3), 1989 and 1990 (Ford Sierra RS500) and 1991 (BMW M3 Evolution).\n\nIn 1992 he also won the NZ Wellington street race in BMW M3. Came 3rd in 1989 Wellington street race and 3rd 1989 and 2nd in 1986 in the Pukekohe Nissan Mobil race in NZ.\n\nIn 2005, Longhurst bought the license for [[Team Dynamik]]'s second car, running the No. 45 car for [[Max Wilson]] under [[WOW Sight & Sound]] sponsorship. Following [[Simon Wills]]'s rollover at the Sandown 500, Longhurst purchased the remaining license from Team Dynamik and replaced Wills as Wilson's co-driver for the following round at Bathurst. He announced his retirement from competitive racing after the [[2005 Bathurst 1000]], where he and Brazilian co-driver [[Max Wilson]] failed to finish the race. He also made an appearance at the [[Targa Tasmania]] that year. He returned to this event in 2006, finishing fourth overall.\n\nLonghurst made two subsequent returns to the V8 Supercar Championship Series. In 2006, he was co-driver for Steve Owen in the [[Rod Nash Racing]] AutoBarn Commodore. The pair put in solid drives finishing 12th at Sandown and 7th at Bathurst. Longhurst's final drive came at the 2007 Sandown 500 where he paired with Glenn Seton following a series of last minute driver swaps in the Holden Racing Team following Mark Skaife having surgery to remove his appendix<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lynch |first1=Michael |title=Skaife ruled out of Sandown after appendix surgery |url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/motorsport/skaife-ruled-out-of-sandown-after-appendix-surgery-20070914-ge5tmd.html |work=The Age |accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref>.\n\nIn 2009 he added a [[Bathurst 12 Hour]] victory, co-driving with Rod Salmon and Damien White.<ref>[http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=319478&FS= Bathurst 12: Event race report]</ref> By winning the 12 Hour, Longhurst joined [[Allan Grice]], [[Gregg Hansford]], [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] and [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]] as winners of both the [[Bathurst 1000]] and Bathurst 12 Hour races (this list was later joined by [[Paul Morris (racing driver)|Paul Morris]] and [[Jonathon Webb]]).\n\nIn 2016, Longhurst returned to competition making an appearance at the [[Sydney Motorsport Park]] round of the [[2016 Australian GT Championship|Australian GT Championship]] in a Marque Sports [[Ford Focus]] and at the [[Silverstone Classic]] driving his [[1994 Australian Manufacturers' Championship]] winning [[BMW E36|BMW 318i]] [[Super Touring]] car.<ref>[http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/07/01/longhurst-eyes-bathurst-amid-race-return/ Longhurst eyes Bathurst amid race return] ''[[Speedcafe]]'' 1 July 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/06/25/longhurst-to-race-to-win-title-winning-bmw/ Longhurst to race title winning BMW at Silverstone] ''Speedcafe'' 25 June 2016</ref>\n\nThe Benson & Hedges Ford Sierra RS500 driven by Longhurst and Tomas Mezera to victory at [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] in 1988 (''pictured right'') is on display at the [[National Motor Racing Museum]] which is located on the outside of the final turn of the famous [[Mount Panorama Circuit]].\n\nLonghurst continues to live on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] and owns and manages the Boat Works facility at [[Coomera]].<ref>[http://www.oceanmagazine.com.au/j/index.php/livenews/1276-the-boat-works-rising The Boat Works Rising] ''Ocean Magazine'' 14 August 2015</ref>\n\nLonghurst will return to Bathurst for the first time since winning the [[2009 WPS Bathurst 12 Hour]] when he will drive at the [[2017 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour]] driving a [[BMW M6 GT3]] for BMW Team SRM alongside [[Timo Glock]], [[Mark Skaife]] and [[Russell Ingall]].\n\n==Career results==\nSourced from Driver Database<ref>[https://www.driverdb.com/drivers/tony-longhurst/ Tony Longhurst at Driver Database]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
