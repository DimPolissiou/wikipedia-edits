[[Mariology]] is a mainly [[Catholic]] [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiological]] study within [[theology]], which centers on the relation of Mary and the Church. Catholic Mariology is the encyclopedic area of [[theology]] concerned with [[Theotokos|Mary, the Mother of God]]. Theologically, it not only deals with her life, but her [[veneration]] in daily life, [[prayer]], art, music, architecture, in modern and [[ancient Christianity]] throughout the ages.\n\nThroughout history, Catholics have continued to build churches to honor the Blessed Virgin. Today, many Catholic churches dedicated to the Blessed Virgin exist on all continents, and in a sense, their evolving architecture tells the unfolding story of the development of Catholic Mariology. Throughout Catholic history, the veneration of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] has led to the creation of numerous items of [[Roman Catholic Marian art]]. Today, these items may be viewed from an artistic perspective, but also they are part of the fabric of [[Mariology of the Catholic Church|Catholic Mariology]].\n\n== Mary in the Early Church ==\n[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|300px|Virgin and Child on a wall painting in the early [[Catacombs of Rome|Roman catacombs]], 4th century.]]\n\n\"Many centuries were necessary to arrive at the explicit definition of the revealed truths concerning Mary,\" said [[Pope John Paul II]] during his papacy in the 1995. <ref>[https://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm4.htm Pope John Paul II, \"General Audience\", 8 November 1995]</ref> The importance of Mary and of Marian theology can be seen in the Church after the third century. The New Testament Gospels, composed during the late 1st century, contain the first references to the life of Mary; the New Testament Epistles, composed earlier, make no mention of her by name. There are, however, references to Mary in the Epistles, most notably in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]].<ref>Sr. M. Danielle Peters, \"An Overview of New Testament References,\" [https://udayton.edu/imri/marian-library/index.php The Mary Page], retrieved 21 January 2015.</ref><ref>Galatians 4:4, \"But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law\" (NASB)</ref> In the 2nd century, St. [[Irenaeus]] of Lyons called Mary the \"second Eve\" because through Mary and her willing acceptance of God's choice, God undid the harm that was done through Eve's choice to eat the forbidden fruit. The earliest recorded prayer to Mary is the [[sub tuum praesidium]] (3rd or 4th century) and the earliest depictions of her are from the [[Catacomb of Priscilla|Priscilla catacombs]] in Rome (early 3rd century).\n\nThe fact that [[Hugo Rahner]]'s 20th-century discovery and reconstruction of [[Saint Ambrose]]'s 4th-century view of Mary as the [[Mother of the Church]], was adopted at the [[Second Vatican Council]], is an example that shows the influence of early traditions and views on Mary in modern times.<ref>Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004, {{ISBN|0-8028-2266-5}} p. 84</ref> Theotokos means \"God-bearer\" or \"Mother of God\"; its use implies that Jesus, to whom Mary gave birth, is truly God and man in one person. [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorians]] preferred the title Christotokos meaning \"Christ-bearer\" or \"Mother of the Messiah\" not because they denied Jesus' divinity, but because they believed that God the Son or ''Logos'' existed before time and before Mary, and that Mary was mother only of Jesus as a human, so calling her \"Mother of God\" was confusing and potentially heretical. Both sides agreed that Jesus took divinity from God the Father and humanity from his mother. The majority at the council agreed with the Pope that denying Mary the title ''Theotokos'' would either imply that Jesus was not divine, or that Jesus had two separate personhoods, one of whom was son of Mary and the other not. Ultimately, the council affirmed the use of the title ''Theotokos'' and by doing so affirmed Jesus' [[Homoousian|undivided divinity and humanity]].\n\nThus, while the debate was over the proper title for Mary, it was primarily a [[Christological]] question about the nature of Jesus Christ, a question which would return at the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council]]. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican theological teaching affirms the title ''Mother of God'', while other Christian denominations give no such title to her.\n\n== Medieval Mariology ==\n[[File:NotreDameDeParis.jpg|thumb|200px|The medieval cathedral Notre Dame dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Paris France, was built in the years 1163\u20131345.]]\n\nThe Middle Ages saw a growth and development of Mariology. Belief in the [[Assumption of Mary]] became widespread across the Christian world from the 6th century onward, and is celebrated on 15 August in both the East and the West.<ref>Butler, Alban and Burns, Paul. ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'', 1998 {{ISBN|0-86012-257-3}} pp. 140-141</ref> The Medieval period brought major champions of Marian devotion to the fore, including [[Ephraim the Syrian]], and [[John Damascene]].\n\nThe [[Dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] developed within the Catholic Church over time. Conception of Mary was celebrated as a liturgical feast in England from the 9th century, and the doctrine of her \"holy\" or \"immaculate\" conception was first formulated in a tract by [[Eadmer]], companion and biographer of the better-known St. [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], Archbishop of [[Canterbury]] (1033\u20131109), and later popularized by the archbishop's nephew, Anselm the Younger.<ref name=\"Mary's Immaculate Conception\">[http://www.ewtn.com/faith/Teachings/marya2.htm Mary's Immaculate Conception]</ref> The [[Normans]] had suppressed the celebration, but it lived on in the popular mind. It was rejected by St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Alexander of Hales]], and St. [[Bonaventure]] (who, teaching at Paris, called it \"this foreign doctrine\", indicating its association with England), and by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who expressed questions about the subject, but said that he would accept the determination of the Church. Aquinas and Bonaventure, for example, believed that Mary was completely free from sin, but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception.<ref name=\"Mary's Immaculate Conception\" />\n\nThe majority of Western Marian writers during this period belonged to the monastic tradition, particularly the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictines]]. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries saw an extraordinary growth of the cult of the Virgin in western Europe, in part inspired by the writings of theologians such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (1090\u20131153).<ref name=cloisters>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/virg/hd_virg.htm  Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters. \u201cThe Cult of the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages.\u201d In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

[[Anthony of Padua]] (1195\u20131231) supported Mary's freedom from sin and her [[Immaculate Conception]].<ref>Huber, Raphael Mary, ''St. Anthony of Padua: Doctor of the Church Universal'', 1948 {{ISBN|1-4367-1275-0}} p. 31</ref><ref>Huber, Raphael M.  \u201cThe Mariology of St. Anthony of Padua,\u201d in ''Studia Mariana'' 7, Proceedings of the First Franciscan National Marian Congress in Acclamation of the Dogma of the Assumption, October 8\u201311, 1950 Burlington, Wisconsin</ref> His many sermons on the Virgin Mary shaped the Mariological approach of many Franciscans who followed his approach for centuries after his death.<ref>Kleinhenz, Christopher.

Scotus proposed a solution to the theological problem involved of being able to reconcile the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, by arguing that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ. Rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption given to her on account of her special role in history. Furthermore, Scotus said that Mary was redeemed ''in anticipation'' of Christ's death on the cross.<ref name=Fastiggi>[https://www.osv.com/Article/TabId/493/ArtMID/13569/ArticleID/17405/11-questions-answered-about-Mary.aspx Fastiggi, Robert. \"11 questions answered about Mary'', ''OSV Newsweekly'', April 29, 2015]</ref>  Scotus' defense of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as ''potuit, decuit ergo fecit'' \u2013 God could do it, it was fitting that He did it, and so He did it. Gradually the idea that Mary had been cleansed of [[original sin]] at the very moment of her conception began to predominate, particularly after [[Duns Scotus]] dealt with the major objection to Mary's sinlessness from conception, that being her need for redemption.<ref>Ludwig Ott, Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, Mercier Press Ltd., Cork, Ireland, 1955</ref> The very divine act, in making Mary sinless at the first instant of her conception was, he argued, the most perfect form of redemption possible.\n\nBy the end of the Middle Ages, Marian feasts were firmly established in the calendar of the liturgical year. [[Pope Clement IV]] (1265\u20131268) created a poem on the seven joys of Mary, which in its form is considered an early version of the Franciscan [[rosary]]<ref>Otto Stegm\u00fcller Clemens IV in Marienkunde, 1159</ref>\n\n== Renaissance to Baroque ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\n{{See also|Italian Renaissance painting|Marian art in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Ettal abbey 003.JPG|thumb|300px|As an example of Baroque painting and architecture, [[Ettal Abbey]]:1776 Frescos under the dome, dedicated to the [[Assumption of Mary]] unite heaven and earth.]]\n\nBeginning in the 13th century, a great deal of Marian art began to appear in Europe. The [[Renaissance]] period witnessed a dramatic growth in [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian art]].<ref>''Renaissance Art: A Very Short Introduction'' by Geraldine A. Johnson 2005 {{ISBN|0-19-280354-9}} pages 103-104</ref> In this period, significant works of Marian art by masters such as [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] were produced. Some Marian art was specifically produced to decorate the Marian churches built in this period.\n\nMajor Italian artist with Marian motifs include:  [[Fra Angelico]],  [[Donatello]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Piero di Cosimo]]  [[Paolo Uccello]] [[Antonello da Messina]]  [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Carlo Crivelli]]. Dutch and German artists with Marian paintings include: [[Jean Bellegambe]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Petrus Christus]], [[Gerard David]] (c.1455\u20131523), [[Hubert van Eyck]], [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], [[Quentin Matsys]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], [[Hans Baldung]]  and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. French and Spanish artists with Marian paintings include: [[Jean Fouquet]], [[Jean Clouet]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], [[Barth\u00e9lemy d'Eyck]], [[Jean Hey]] (formerly known as the Master of Moulins), [[Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo]], [[Ayne Bru]], [[Juan de Flandes]], [[Jaume Huguet]], [[Paolo da San Leocadio]].\n\n[[Francis of Assisi]] is credited with setting up the first known ''presepio'' or cr\u00e8che (Nativity scene). He was also particularly devoted to Christ's passion and crucifixion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HeQKHGeb8yoC&pg=PA3&dq=Francis+of+Assisi+and+the+Crucifiction&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4p_qNu9nPAhVDMz4KHX79AKIQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=Francis%20of%20Assisi%20and%20the%20Crucifiction&f=false Robson, Michael J., ''The Cambridge Companion to Francis of Assisi'', Cambridge University Press, 2011] {{ISBN|9780521760430}}</ref> The influence of the Franciscans gave rise to a more affective spirituality. Pope [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, greatly increased the prominence given to Mary, introducing the [[Presentation of Mary]] as a feast for the entire church (1472), extending the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Feast of the Visitation]] to the whole church (1475), and introducing the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], observed by the Franciscans since 1263 but strenuously opposed by the Dominicans and still highly-controversial in the fifteenth century.<ref>[Hollingsworth, Mary, ''Patronage in Renaissance Italy'', John Murray, 1994] {{ISBN|0719549264}}</ref> Around the time of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 many Orthodox monks fled to the West, bringing with them traditions of iconography. Depictions of the Madonna and Child can be traced to the Eastern ''Theotokos''. In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as [[Duccio]], Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, Caravaggio and Rubens. The early Renaissance saw an increased emphasis on Christ crucified and therefore Mary as the Sorrowful Mother, an object of compassionate devotion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tBM3JV2W7X4C&pg=PR76&lpg=PR76&dq=Mariology+during+the+Renaissance&source=bl&ots=jK97sFPHz5&sig=EPLJgjUeMB8-_z_n0YLh0rWA1HU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjo9f_xsNnPAhWDNz4KHRZIBLo4KBDoAQgnMAM#v=onepage&q=Mariology%20during%20the%20Renaissance&f=false Viladesau, Richard.

Protestant leaders like [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], while personally adhering to Marian beliefs like [[virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and sinlessness, considered [[BVM(RC)|Catholic veneration of Mary]] as competition to the divine role of Jesus Christ. [[File:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|thumb|200px|Giovanni [[Pierluigi da Palestrina]] composed numerous Marian Masses.]]\n\nAs a reflection of this theological opposition, Protestant reformers destroyed much religious art and Marian statues and paintings in churches in northern Europe and England.<!-- This section is linked from [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]] --> Some of the Protestant reformers, in particular [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven images of God. Major iconoclastic riots took place in [[Z\u00fcrich]] (in 1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[M\u00fcnster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), [[Augsburg]] (1537), and [[Scotland]] (1559).  Protestant inconoclasm swept through the [[Seventeen Provinces]] (now the Netherlands and Belgium and parts of Northern France) in the summer of 1566. In the middle of the 16th century, the [[Council of Trent]] confirmed the Catholic tradition of paintings and artworks in churches.  This resulted in a great development of Marian art and Mariology during the [[Baroque Period]].\n\nAt the same time, the Catholic world was engaged in ongoing [[Ottoman Wars in Europe]] against [[Turkey]] which were fought and won under the auspices of  the [[Virgin Mary]]. The victory at [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]]  was accredited to her \"and signified the beginning of a strong resurgence of Marian devotions, focusing especially on Mary, the Queen of Heaven and Earth and her powerful role as mediator of many graces\".<ref>Otto Stegm\u00fcller, Barock, in Marienkunde, 1967  566</ref> The [[Colloquium Marianum]], an elite group, and the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] based their activities on a virtuous life, free of [[Mortal sin|cardinal sins]].\n\nThe baroque literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of Mariological writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>A Roskovany, conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> The Jesuit [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]] (1548-1617) was the first theologian, who used the [[thomist]] method on Mariology and is considered the father of systematic Mariology.<ref name=Fastiggi/> Other well known contributors to baroque Mariology are [[Lawrence of Brindisi]], [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Francis of Sales]]. After 1650, the [[Immaculate Conception]]  is the subject of over 300  publications from [[Jesuit]] authors alone.<ref>Otto Stegm\u00fcller, Mariologisches Schrifttum in der Barockzeit,  1967  568</ref>\n\nThis popularity was at times accompanied with Marian excesses and alleged revelations of the Virgin Mary to individuals like [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]]<ref>who was placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] of forbidden book of the Church in 1681.</ref> Many of the baroque authors defended Marian [[spirituality]] and Mariology. In France, the often anti-Marian [[Jansenist]]s  were combated by [[John Eudes]] and [[Louis de Montfort]], canonized by [[Pope Pius XII]]<ref>although in 1673, the Holy Office itself acted against his book on slavery. (Stegm\u00fcller,  573)</ref>\n\nBaroque Mariology was supported by several popes during the period: [[Pope Paul V]] and [[Gregory XV]] ruled in 1617 and 1622 to be inadmissible to state, that the virgin was conceived non-immaculate. [[Alexander VII]] declared in 1661, that the soul of Mary was free from [[original sin]]. [[Pope Clement XI]] ordered the feast of the [[Immaculata]] for the whole Church in 1708. The feast of the [[Rosary]] was introduced in 1716, the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The [[Angelus]] prayer was strongly supported by [[Pope Benedict XIII]] in 1724 and by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1742.<ref>F Z\u00f6pfl, Barocke Fr\u00f6mmigkeit, in Marienkunde,  577</ref>\n\nPopular Marian piety was more colorful and varied than ever before: Numerous Marian [[pilgrimage]]s,  ''Marian Salve'' [[Catholic devotions|devotions]], new [[Litany|litanies]], Marian theatre plays, Marian [[hymn]]s, Marian [[procession]]s. Marian  [[Fraternal and service organizations|fraternities]], today mostly defunct, had  millions of members.<ref>Z\u00f6pfl  579</ref> Lasting impressions from the baroque mariology are in the field of [[classic]]al music, painting and art architecture, and in the numerous Marian [[shrine]]s from the baroque period in Spain, France, Italy, Austria and [[Bavaria]] but also in some South American cities.\n\n== Mariology during the Enlightenment ==\n[[File:Santa Maria della Salute Venice.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Santa Maria della Salute]], Venice, 1629.]]\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology on the defensive.  The Church continued to stress the [[virginity]] and special graces, but deemphasized Marian [[cult]]s.<ref>RG Giessler, ''die geistliche Lieddichting im Zeitalter der Aufkl\u00e4rung''. 1928, 987</ref> During this period, Marian theology was even discontinued in some seminaries (for example: in [[Salzburg]] Austria in the year 1782<ref>Narr Zoepfl Mariologie der Aufkl\u00e4rung, 1967, 411</ref>). Some theologians proposed the abolition of all Marian feast days altogether, except those with biblical foundations and the feast of the Assumption.<ref>Benedict Werkmeister, 1801</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in this period, a number of significant [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian churches]] were built, often laden with Marian symbols, and popular Marian devotions continued in many areas. An example is [[Santa Maria della Salute]] in Venice, built to give thanks to thank the Virgin Mary for the city's deliverance from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. The church is full of Marian symbolism: the great dome represents her crown, and the eight sides, the eight points on her symbolic star.\n\nMany [[Benedictine]]s, such as [[Celestino Sfondrati]] (died 1696) and [[Jesuit]]s,<ref>such as Anton Weissenbach SJ, Franz Neubauer SJ,</ref> supported by pious faithful and their [[Roman Catholic Marian movements and societies|movements and societies]] fought against the anti-Marian trends.  Increasing [[secularization]] led to the forced closing of most [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[convent]]s, and Marian [[pilgrimage]]s were either discontinued or greatly reduced in number.  Some Catholics criticized the practice of the [[rosary]] as not Jesus-oriented and too mechanical.<ref name=\"D Narr 417\" /> In some places, priests forbade the praying of the rosary during Holy Mass.<ref>In 1790, monastery schools outlawed the praying of the rosary during mass as a distraction. (D Narr 417).</ref> The highly conservative rural Bavarian dioceses of Passau  outlawed Marian prayer books and related articles in 1785.<ref name=\"D Narr 417\">D Narr 417</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Mariologists looked to ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' and other Mariological writings of [[Alphonsus Liguori]] (1696\u20131787), an Italian, whose culture was less affected by the Enlightenment. \"Overall, Catholic Mariology during the Enlightenment lost its high level of development and sophistication, but the basics were kept, on which the 19th century was able to build.\"<ref>Otto Stegm\u00fcller, 1967</ref>\n\n== Mariology in the 19th century ==\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Pius IX]] (1846\u20131878) solemnly declared the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1854.]]\nMariology in the 19th century was dominated by discussions about the dogmatic definition of the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[First Vatican Council]].  In 1854, [[Pope Pius IX]], with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, whom he had consulted between 1851\u20131853, proclaimed the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]], which had been a traditional belief among the faithful for centuries.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html Vatican website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810175256/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html |date=10 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had granted the unanimous wish of the bishops from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.<ref>Pius IX in B\u00e4umer, 245</ref>  During the [[First Vatican Council]], some 108 council fathers requested adding the words \"Immaculate Virgin\" to the \"[[Hail Mary]]\" prayer and to add the Immaculata to the [[Litany of Loreto]]. Some fathers requested the dogma of the Immaculate Conception to be included in the [[Creed]] of the Church.<ref>Bauer 566</ref>\n\nMany French Catholics supported making dogma both Papal [[infallibility]] and the [[assumption of Mary]] in the forthcoming ecumenical council.<ref>''Civilta Catolica'', 6 February 1869.</ref> During the [[First Vatican Council]], nine mariological petitions favored a possible assumption dogma.  It was strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially those from Germany. On 8 May, a majority of the fathers voted to reject making the Assumption a dogma, a position shared by [[Pope Pius IX]]. The concept of [[Co-Redemptrix]] was also discussed but left open. In its support, Council fathers highlighted the divine motherhood of Mary and called\nher the mother of all graces.<ref>B\u00e4umer 566</ref>\n\n\"[[Rosary Pope]]\" is a title given to [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1878\u20131903) because he issued a record eleven encyclicals on the rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October, and in 1883 created the Feast of ''Queen of the Holy Rosary''.<ref>Lauretanische Litanei, ''Marienlexikon'', St. Ottilien: Eos, 1988, p.41</ref>\n\n[[John Henry Newman]], wrote of the Eve-Mary parallel in support of Mary's original state of grace (Immaculate Conception), her part in 'Redemption', her 'Eschatological' fulfilment and her intercession.<ref>Newman, John Henry.

(London: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1972), Vol. XII</ref>\n\nPopular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary's conception. The doctrine itself had been endorsed by the Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), and by the end of the 15th century was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties. The Council of Basel was later held not to have been a true General (or Ecumenical) Council with authority to proclaim dogma. Such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323, and declared \"Doctor Angelicus\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545\u201363)\u2014which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine\u2014instead declined to take a position. It simply reaffirmed the constitutions of [[Sixtus IV]], which had threatened with excommunication anyone on either side of the controversy who accused the others of heresy.\n\nBut it was not until 1854 that [[Pope Pius IX]], with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, whom he had consulted between 1851\u20131853, proclaimed the doctrine in accordance with the conditions of [[papal infallibility]] that would be defined in 1870 by the [[First Vatican Council]].\n\n== Mariology in the 20th century ==\nIn 1904, in the first year of his pontificate, [[Pope Pius X]] celebrated the previous century's proclamation of the dogma of [[Immaculate Conception]] with the [[encyclical]] ''[[Ad diem illum]]''. In 1950, the [[dogma of the Assumption]] was defined by [[Pope Pius XII]]. The [[Second Vatican Council]] spoke of Mary as ''Mother of the Church''. Fifteen hundred years after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the [[encyclical]] ''[[Lux Veritatis]]'', reminding the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christians of the common faith. He presided over a Mariological congress in 1931.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer 534\">B\u00e4umer 534</ref>\n\nMariology in the 20th century reflected an increased membership in [[Roman Catholic Marian Movements and Societies]]. At the popular level, the 20th century witnessed growth in the number of lay Marian devotional organizations such as free [[rosary]] distribution groups. The number of 20th century pilgrims visiting [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian churches]] set new records. In South America alone, two major Marian basilicas, the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil and the new [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] on [[Tepeyac]] hill were constructed and jointly recorded over 10 million visitors per year.\n\nPrior to Vatican II, the French Mariological Society held a three-year series of Marian studies on the theme of Mary in relation to the Church.<ref>\u201cMarie et l\u2019Eglise,\u201d ''\u00c9tMar'' 9-11 (1951-53), 3 Vols</ref> \n\n=== Second Vatican Council ===\nMariological issues were included in the discussions at the [[Second Vatican Council]], (1962\u20131965) although the Council indicated that it had not addressed all Marian issues. The Council members had in depth discussions regarding the question of whether to treat Mary within the Constitution of the Church or outside it in a separate document.<ref name=McLoughlin66>''Mary for Time and Eternity'' by William McLoughlin, Jill Pinnock 2007 {{ISBN|0-85244-651-9}}-page 66</ref> The final decision, by a vote of 1114\u20131074 resulted in the treatment of Marian issues within the Church Constitution, as chapter eight of ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.<ref name=McLoughlin66 /> Chapter eight of ''Lumen gentium'' provides a \"pastoral summary\" of Catholic doctrines on Mary, which does not claim to be complete.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Leo Cardinal Scheffczyk, Vaticanum II, in Marienlexikon 567</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the [[Vatican II]] Council in December 1965, Catholics were presented with a multitude of changes. Some authors such as John W. O\u2019Malley have commented that these issues would forever alter Catholic practices and views, including those surrounding the Virgin Mary.  These changes reflected the Council's desire to make the Church more ecumenical and less isolated as it increasingly had become in the past century.<ref name=\"Vatican_II\">What Happened at Vatican II, John W.

[[Mariology]] is a mainly [[Catholic]] [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiological]] study within [[theology]], which centers on the relation of Mary and the Church. Catholic Mariology is the encyclopedic area of [[theology]] concerned with [[Theotokos|Mary, the Mother of God]]. Theologically, it not only deals with her life, but her [[veneration]] in daily life, [[prayer]], art, music, architecture, in modern and [[ancient Christianity]] throughout the ages.\n\nThroughout history, Catholics have continued to build churches to honor the Blessed Virgin. Today, many Catholic churches dedicated to the Blessed Virgin exist on all continents, and in a sense, their evolving architecture tells the unfolding story of the development of Catholic Mariology. Throughout Catholic history, the veneration of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] has led to the creation of numerous items of [[Roman Catholic Marian art]]. Today, these items may be viewed from an artistic perspective, but also they are part of the fabric of [[Mariology of the Catholic Church|Catholic Mariology]].\n\n== Mary in the Early Church ==\n[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|300px|Virgin and Child on a wall painting in the early [[Catacombs of Rome|Roman catacombs]], 4th century.]]\n\n\"Many centuries were necessary to arrive at the explicit definition of the revealed truths concerning Mary,\" said [[Pope John Paul II]] during his papacy in the 1995. <ref>[https://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm4.htm Pope John Paul II, \"General Audience\", 8 November 1995]</ref> The importance of Mary and of Marian theology can be seen in the Church after the third century. The New Testament Gospels, composed during the late 1st century, contain the first references to the life of Mary; the New Testament Epistles, composed earlier, make no mention of her by name. There are, however, references to Mary in the Epistles, most notably in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]].<ref>Sr. M. Danielle Peters, \"An Overview of New Testament References,\" [https://udayton.edu/imri/marian-library/index.php The Mary Page], retrieved 21 January 2015.</ref><ref>Galatians 4:4, \"But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law\" (NASB)</ref> In the 2nd century, St. [[Irenaeus]] of Lyons called Mary the \"second Eve\" because through Mary and her willing acceptance of God's choice, God undid the harm that was done through Eve's choice to eat the forbidden fruit. The earliest recorded prayer to Mary is the [[sub tuum praesidium]] (3rd or 4th century) and the earliest depictions of her are from the [[Catacomb of Priscilla|Priscilla catacombs]] in Rome (early 3rd century).\n\nThe fact that [[Hugo Rahner]]'s 20th-century discovery and reconstruction of [[Saint Ambrose]]'s 4th-century view of Mary as the [[Mother of the Church]], was adopted at the [[Second Vatican Council]], is an example that shows the influence of early traditions and views on Mary in modern times.<ref>Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004, {{ISBN|0-8028-2266-5}} p. 84</ref> Theotokos means \"God-bearer\" or \"Mother of God\"; its use implies that Jesus, to whom Mary gave birth, is truly God and man in one person. [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorians]] preferred the title Christotokos meaning \"Christ-bearer\" or \"Mother of the Messiah\" not because they denied Jesus' divinity, but because they believed that God the Son or ''Logos'' existed before time and before Mary, and that Mary was mother only of Jesus as a human, so calling her \"Mother of God\" was confusing and potentially heretical. Both sides agreed that Jesus took divinity from God the Father and humanity from his mother. The majority at the council agreed with the Pope that denying Mary the title ''Theotokos'' would either imply that Jesus was not divine, or that Jesus had two separate personhoods, one of whom was son of Mary and the other not. Ultimately, the council affirmed the use of the title ''Theotokos'' and by doing so affirmed Jesus' [[Homoousian|undivided divinity and humanity]].\n\nThus, while the debate was over the proper title for Mary, it was primarily a [[Christological]] question about the nature of Jesus Christ, a question which would return at the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council]]. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican theological teaching affirms the title ''Mother of God'', while other Christian denominations give no such title to her.\n\n== Medieval Mariology ==\n[[File:NotreDameDeParis.jpg|thumb|200px|The medieval cathedral Notre Dame dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Paris France, was built in the years 1163\u20131345.]]\n\nThe Middle Ages saw a growth and development of Mariology. Belief in the [[Assumption of Mary]] became widespread across the Christian world from the 6th century onward, and is celebrated on 15 August in both the East and the West.<ref>Butler, Alban and Burns, Paul.

Conception of Mary was celebrated as a liturgical feast in England from the 9th century, and the doctrine of her \"holy\" or \"immaculate\" conception was first formulated in a tract by [[Eadmer]], companion and biographer of the better-known St. [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], Archbishop of [[Canterbury]] (1033\u20131109), and later popularized by the archbishop's nephew, Anselm the Younger.<ref name=\"Mary's Immaculate Conception\">[http://www.ewtn.com/faith/Teachings/marya2.htm Mary's Immaculate Conception]</ref> The [[Normans]] had suppressed the celebration, but it lived on in the popular mind. It was rejected by St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Alexander of Hales]], and St. [[Bonaventure]] (who, teaching at Paris, called it \"this foreign doctrine\", indicating its association with England), and by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who expressed questions about the subject, but said that he would accept the determination of the Church. Aquinas and Bonaventure, for example, believed that Mary was completely free from sin, but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception.<ref name=\"Mary's Immaculate Conception\" />\n\nThe majority of Western Marian writers during this period belonged to the monastic tradition, particularly the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictines]]. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries saw an extraordinary growth of the cult of the Virgin in western Europe, in part inspired by the writings of theologians such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (1090\u20131153).<ref name=cloisters>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/virg/hd_virg.htm  Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters. \u201cThe Cult of the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages.\u201d In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

Scotus proposed a solution to the theological problem involved of being able to reconcile the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, by arguing that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ. Rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption given to her on account of her special role in history. Furthermore, Scotus said that Mary was redeemed ''in anticipation'' of Christ's death on the cross.<ref name=Fastiggi>[https://www.osv.com/Article/TabId/493/ArtMID/13569/ArticleID/17405/11-questions-answered-about-Mary.aspx Fastiggi, Robert. \"11 questions answered about Mary'', ''OSV Newsweekly'', April 29, 2015]</ref>  Scotus' defense of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as ''potuit, decuit ergo fecit'' \u2013 God could do it, it was fitting that He did it, and so He did it.

He was also particularly devoted to Christ's passion and crucifixion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HeQKHGeb8yoC&pg=PA3&dq=Francis+of+Assisi+and+the+Crucifiction&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4p_qNu9nPAhVDMz4KHX79AKIQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=Francis%20of%20Assisi%20and%20the%20Crucifiction&f=false Robson, Michael J., ''The Cambridge Companion to Francis of Assisi'', Cambridge University Press, 2011] {{ISBN|9780521760430}}</ref> The influence of the Franciscans gave rise to a more affective spirituality. Pope [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, greatly increased the prominence given to Mary, introducing the [[Presentation of Mary]] as a feast for the entire church (1472), extending the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Feast of the Visitation]] to the whole church (1475), and introducing the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], observed by the Franciscans since 1263 but strenuously opposed by the Dominicans and still highly-controversial in the fifteenth century.<ref>[Hollingsworth, Mary, ''Patronage in Renaissance Italy'', John Murray, 1994] {{ISBN|0719549264}}</ref> Around the time of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 many Orthodox monks fled to the West, bringing with them traditions of iconography.

Protestant leaders like [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], while personally adhering to Marian beliefs like [[virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and sinlessness, considered [[BVM(RC)|Catholic veneration of Mary]] as competition to the divine role of Jesus Christ. [[File:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.jpg|thumb|200px|Giovanni [[Pierluigi da Palestrina]] composed numerous Marian Masses.]]\n\nAs a reflection of this theological opposition, Protestant reformers destroyed much religious art and Marian statues and paintings in churches in northern Europe and England.<!-- This section is linked from [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]] --> Some of the Protestant reformers, in particular [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven images of God. Major iconoclastic riots took place in [[Z\u00fcrich]] (in 1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[M\u00fcnster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), [[Augsburg]] (1537), and [[Scotland]] (1559).  Protestant inconoclasm swept through the [[Seventeen Provinces]] (now the Netherlands and Belgium and parts of Northern France) in the summer of 1566. In the middle of the 16th century, the [[Council of Trent]] confirmed the Catholic tradition of paintings and artworks in churches.  This resulted in a great development of Marian art and Mariology during the [[Baroque Period]].\n\nAt the same time, the Catholic world was engaged in ongoing [[Ottoman Wars in Europe]] against [[Turkey]] which were fought and won under the auspices of  the [[Virgin Mary]]. The victory at [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]]  was accredited to her \"and signified the beginning of a strong resurgence of Marian devotions, focusing especially on Mary, the Queen of Heaven and Earth and her powerful role as mediator of many graces\".<ref>Otto Stegm\u00fcller, Barock, in Marienkunde, 1967  566</ref> The [[Colloquium Marianum]], an elite group, and the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] based their activities on a virtuous life, free of [[Mortal sin|cardinal sins]].\n\nThe baroque literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of Mariological writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>A Roskovany, conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> The Jesuit [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]] (1548-1617) was the first theologian, who used the [[thomist]] method on Mariology and is considered the father of systematic Mariology.<ref name=Fastiggi/> Other well known contributors to baroque Mariology are [[Lawrence of Brindisi]], [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Francis of Sales]].

(Stegm\u00fcller,  573)</ref>\n\nBaroque Mariology was supported by several popes during the period: [[Pope Paul V]] and [[Gregory XV]] ruled in 1617 and 1622 to be inadmissible to state, that the virgin was conceived non-immaculate. [[Alexander VII]] declared in 1661, that the soul of Mary was free from [[original sin]]. [[Pope Clement XI]] ordered the feast of the [[Immaculata]] for the whole Church in 1708. The feast of the [[Rosary]] was introduced in 1716, the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The [[Angelus]] prayer was strongly supported by [[Pope Benedict XIII]] in 1724 and by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1742.<ref>F Z\u00f6pfl, Barocke Fr\u00f6mmigkeit, in Marienkunde,  577</ref>\n\nPopular Marian piety was more colorful and varied than ever before: Numerous Marian [[pilgrimage]]s,  ''Marian Salve'' [[Catholic devotions|devotions]], new [[Litany|litanies]], Marian theatre plays, Marian [[hymn]]s, Marian [[procession]]s.

The Church continued to stress the [[virginity]] and special graces, but deemphasized Marian [[cult]]s.<ref>RG Giessler, ''die geistliche Lieddichting im Zeitalter der Aufkl\u00e4rung''. 1928, 987</ref> During this period, Marian theology was even discontinued in some seminaries (for example: in [[Salzburg]] Austria in the year 1782<ref>Narr Zoepfl Mariologie der Aufkl\u00e4rung, 1967, 411</ref>). Some theologians proposed the abolition of all Marian feast days altogether, except those with biblical foundations and the feast of the Assumption.<ref>Benedict Werkmeister, 1801</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in this period, a number of significant [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian churches]] were built, often laden with Marian symbols, and popular Marian devotions continued in many areas. An example is [[Santa Maria della Salute]] in Venice, built to give thanks to thank the Virgin Mary for the city's deliverance from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. The church is full of Marian symbolism: the great dome represents her crown, and the eight sides, the eight points on her symbolic star.\n\nMany [[Benedictine]]s, such as [[Celestino Sfondrati]] (died 1696) and [[Jesuit]]s,<ref>such as Anton Weissenbach SJ, Franz Neubauer SJ,</ref> supported by pious faithful and their [[Roman Catholic Marian movements and societies|movements and societies]] fought against the anti-Marian trends.  Increasing [[secularization]] led to the forced closing of most [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[convent]]s, and Marian [[pilgrimage]]s were either discontinued or greatly reduced in number.  Some Catholics criticized the practice of the [[rosary]] as not Jesus-oriented and too mechanical.<ref name=\"D Narr 417\" /> In some places, priests forbade the praying of the rosary during Holy Mass.<ref>In 1790, monastery schools outlawed the praying of the rosary during mass as a distraction.

In 1854, [[Pope Pius IX]], with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, whom he had consulted between 1851\u20131853, proclaimed the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]], which had been a traditional belief among the faithful for centuries.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html Vatican website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810175256/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html |date=10 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had granted the unanimous wish of the bishops from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.<ref>Pius IX in B\u00e4umer, 245</ref>  During the [[First Vatican Council]], some 108 council fathers requested adding the words \"Immaculate Virgin\" to the \"[[Hail Mary]]\" prayer and to add the Immaculata to the [[Litany of Loreto]]. Some fathers requested the dogma of the Immaculate Conception to be included in the [[Creed]] of the Church.<ref>Bauer 566</ref>\n\nMany French Catholics supported making dogma both Papal [[infallibility]] and the [[assumption of Mary]] in the forthcoming ecumenical council.<ref>''Civilta Catolica'', 6 February 1869.</ref> During the [[First Vatican Council]], nine mariological petitions favored a possible assumption dogma.  It was strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially those from Germany. On 8 May, a majority of the fathers voted to reject making the Assumption a dogma, a position shared by [[Pope Pius IX]]. The concept of [[Co-Redemptrix]] was also discussed but left open. In its support, Council fathers highlighted the divine motherhood of Mary and called\nher the mother of all graces.<ref>B\u00e4umer 566</ref>\n\n\"[[Rosary Pope]]\" is a title given to [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1878\u20131903) because he issued a record eleven encyclicals on the rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October, and in 1883 created the Feast of ''Queen of the Holy Rosary''.<ref>Lauretanische Litanei, ''Marienlexikon'', St. Ottilien: Eos, 1988, p.41</ref>\n\n[[John Henry Newman]], wrote of the Eve-Mary parallel in support of Mary\u2019s original state of grace (Immaculate Conception), her part in 'Redemption', her 'Eschatological' fulfilment and her intercession.<ref>Newman, John Henry.

(London: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1972), Vol. XII</ref>\n\nPopular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary's conception. The doctrine itself had been endorsed by the Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), and by the end of the 15th century was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties. The Council of Basel was later held not to have been a true General (or Ecumenical) Council with authority to proclaim dogma. Such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323, and declared \"Doctor Angelicus\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545\u201363)\u2014which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine\u2014instead declined to take a position. It simply reaffirmed the constitutions of [[Sixtus IV]], which had threatened with excommunication anyone on either side of the controversy who accused the others of heresy.\n\nBut it was not until 1854 that [[Pope Pius IX]], with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, whom he had consulted between 1851\u20131853, proclaimed the doctrine in accordance with the conditions of [[papal infallibility]] that would be defined in 1870 by the [[First Vatican Council]].\n\n== Mariology in the 20th century ==\nIn 1904, in the first year of his pontificate, [[Pope Pius X]] celebrated the previous century's proclamation of the dogma of [[Immaculate Conception]] with the [[encyclical]] ''[[Ad diem illum]]''. In 1950, the [[dogma of the Assumption]] was defined by [[Pope Pius XII]]. The [[Second Vatican Council]] spoke of Mary as ''Mother of the Church''. Fifteen hundred years after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the [[encyclical]] ''[[Lux Veritatis]]'', reminding the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christians of the common faith. He presided over a Mariological congress in 1931.<ref name=\"B\u00e4umer 534\">B\u00e4umer 534</ref>\n\nMariology in the 20th century reflected an increased membership in [[Roman Catholic Marian Movements and Societies]]. At the popular level, the 20th century witnessed growth in the number of lay Marian devotional organizations such as free [[rosary]] distribution groups. The number of 20th century pilgrims visiting [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian churches]] set new records. In South America alone, two major Marian basilicas, the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil and the new [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] on [[Tepeyac]] hill were constructed and jointly recorded over 10 million visitors per year.\n\nPrior to Vatican II, the French Mariological Society held a three-year series of Marian studies on the theme of Mary in relation to the Church.<ref>\u201cMarie et l\u2019Eglise,\u201d ''\u00c9tMar'' 9-11 (1951-53), 3 Vols</ref> \n\n=== Second Vatican Council ===\nMariological issues were included in the discussions at the [[Second Vatican Council]], (1962\u20131965) although the Council indicated that it had not addressed all Marian issues.

Some authors such as John W. O\u2019Malley have commented that these issues would forever alter Catholic practices and views, including those surrounding the Virgin Mary.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

Queen's University grew from about 2,000 students in the 1940s to its present size of over 28,000 students, more than 90 per cent of whom are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.\n\nMunicipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston.

To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

As a result of the report of the ''Commission of Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston'', the facility was closed in 2000. Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.\n\nIn September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation.

Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''\"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"''<ref name=\"queens\">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada. These include: the original square hockey puck from the first Queens University vs. the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) game in 1886, hockey's oldest sweater worn by a Queen's student in 1894, and Canada's first Olympic gold medal from 1924, among others.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html \u201cThe Top 10 Artifacts in the Museum\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053201/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref>\n\nNew to the city is Leon's Centre, in the downtown core.

The [[Kingston Yacht Club]] in downtown Kingston has a learn to sail program for both children and adults.\n\n===Diving===\nKingston is known for fresh-water [[wreck diving]]. [[List of shipwrecks of Canada#Ontario|Kingston's shipwrecks]] are well preserved by its cool fresh water, and the recent [[zebra mussel]] invasion has caused a dramatic improvement in water clarity that has enhanced the quality of diving in the area.\n\n===Lawn bowling===\nThe Kingston Lawn Bowling Club has been at its location on Napier Street since 1932, although the sport's beginnings in Kingston have been traced back to 1914.<ref>[https://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html Kingston Lawn Bowling Club \u2013 About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514141551/http://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html |date=May 14, 2016 }} Retrieved November 22, 2018</ref> While the club offers a variety of recreational opportunities, a number of its members have gone on to compete successfully at the provincial level and beyond.

The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].\n\n===Curling===\nThree curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf & Country Club, Garrison Golf & Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].<ref>[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca \u2013 Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks \u2013 Kingston, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174549/http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=July 6, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993.

In 2020, Kingston will host the Tim Hortons Brier, the national men's curling championship. Kingston previously hosted the Brier in 1957.

KPRFC is a non-profit organization answering directly to the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union (EORU), the [[Ontario Rugby Union]] (ORU), and [[Rugby Canada]] (RC). The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015.

Situated between [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]], the city has the second largest population, after [[Indio, California|Indio]], of the nine cities in the [[Coachella Valley]] of Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|website=Census.gov|title=Cities: SUB-EST2009-4|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/cities/SUB-EST2009-4.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805012857/http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/SUB-EST2009-4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 5, 2011|access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>  Its population was 51,200 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The population of Cathedral City, along with the surrounding areas, has grown significantly into the 21st century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early History: before 1860===\nCathedral City sits at the northwestern end of the Coachella Valley between the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] to the north, and the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] to the south, with the [[San Gorgonio Pass]] to the West.  The earliest established inhabitants of this region were the [[Cahuilla|Cahuilla Indians]].  They arrived in the area around 3,000 BCE.<ref name=\"Cahuilla1\">{{cite web |title=History and Culture: Cultural History |url=http://www.aguacaliente.org/content/History%20and%20Culture/ |publisher=Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  The Cahuilla were organized into bands of about 600 to 800 people, and it was the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] who inhabited the lands that included what would become Cathedral City, California.<ref name=\"Cahuilla2\">{{cite web |last1=Feller |first1=Walter |title=Digital Desert: Mojave Desert: Cahuilla Indians |url=http://mojavedesert.net/cahuilla-indians/ |website=Digital Desert |publisher=Walter Feller |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe land was claimed by [[Spain]] in 1768 when Spain established [[The Californias|Las Californias]], a province of the [[Viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]], and then by [[Mexico]] in 1821 when Mexico and Spain signed the [[Treaty of Cordoba]]. At that time the province had already been renamed and expanded into the larger [[Alta California]] province.  After the [[Mexican-American War]], and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, possession of the land was formally transferred to the [[United States]], and it officially became part of the [[California|State of California]] when the state was formed in 1850.\n \nIn 1852 [[United States Army|US Army]] [[Colonel Henry Washington]], a nephew of [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]], was contracted by the government to survey Southern California.<ref name=Survey1>{{cite web |last1=Mojave |first1=Mojo on the |title=George Washington's Nephew in the Mojave Desert? |url=https://www.desertusa.com/dusablog/george-washingtons-nephew-mojave-desert.html |website=DesertUSA |publisher=Mojo on the Mojave |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  On November 7 of that year he established the [[San Bernardino meridian|initial point]], in the San Bernardino Mountains, from which all future surveys in Southern California would be based.<ref name=\"Survey2\">{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=Michael A |title=Three Monuments, One Initial Point (The Story of The San Bernardino Initial Point Monument) |journal=California Surveyor |date=September 2002 |issue=#135 |url=http://www.mdshs.org/articles/duffy.html |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  In 1855 he was contracted to continue his work and survey the Coachella Valley.  It was then that he found and named Cathedral Canyon for which Cathedral City would be named.<ref name=Survey1/>\n\nBesides Colonel Henry Washington, there were occasional explorers, colonizers and soldiers that made their way through the area during the Spanish, Mexican, and early American eras, but none established any permanent structures or residences.  The Cahuilla remained the only people known to be living in the area.\n\n===Stage and Freight Lines 1860 \u2013 1880===\n\nPrior to the 1860s the only regularly traveled routes through the Coachella Valley were trading paths used by the Cahuilla and other Native American tribes.  One of these paths, on the southwestern side of the valley, followed the base of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains somewhere near the [[Whitewater River (California)|Whitewater River]], and would have passed through the area that would become Cathedral City.  Early non-native explorers, surveyors, and military, such as Colonel Washington, made use of these routes, but regular transportation services were not established until 1862.\n  \nThe [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|Colorado River Gold Rush]], which started in the spring of 1862, prompted [[William D. Bradshaw]], a frontiersman, to seek a quicker route from Los Angeles to the [[Colorado River]].  Later that year he hired a guide, and with the help of the Cahuilla and [[Maricopa people|Maricopa Indians]], mapped a route from [[San Bernardino, California]], through the San Gorgonio Pass and Coachella Valley, past the northern shore of the [[Salton Sink]], through the passes between the [[Chuckwalla Mountains|Chuckwalla]] and [[Chocolate Mountains]], and up to the Colorado River across from La Paz in the [[New Mexico Territory]], (now the state of [[Arizona]]).  Much of the route is thought to have followed the original southwestern trading path used by the Cahuilla.\n\nShortly after Bradshaw defined the trail from San Bernardino to La Paz, various stagecoach and freight companies began using the route.  The stage and freight lines brought miners, supplies, and mail between San Bernardino and La Paz, and the route became known as the [[Bradshaw Trail]] or \u201cGold Road\u201d.  The Bradshaw trail, like the original Cahuillian trail, passed through the future Cathedral City, but the nearest scheduled stops were Agua Caliente (now Palms Springs), and Indian Wells (now Indio). The stage and freight lines were eventually supplanted by the railroads, but the trail would later become the basis for Palm Canyon Drive and [[California State Route 111|Highway 111]] that run through the city today.\n\n===Depression era nightclubs===\nIn 1931, Al and Lou Wertheimer of the reputed Detroit \"Purple Gang\" opened the Dunes Club just outside Palm Springs' city limits. This was followed in 1939 by Earl T. Sausser's 139 Club and the Cove Club in 1941, built by Jake Katelman and Frank Portnoy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moruzzi|first=Peter|title=Palm Springs Holiday|year=2009|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, UT|isbn=978-1-4236-0476-1|pages=39\u201342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdZPqOwMM2gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>Artist Carlo Wahlbeck, resident of Palm Springs, is the owner of 29 wood panels that used to hang in the now-demolished 139 Club.

County, California]]. The city's name is derived from Cathedral [[Canyon]] located to the south of the city in the foothills of the [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]]. The canyon was named in 1850 by U.S. Army [[Colonel Henry Washington]] after deciding a rock formation of the canyon looked reminiscent of a [[cathedral]].<ref>{{GNIS|270352|Cathedral Canyon}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the arrival of European explorers and settlers, the land was part of the territory inhabited by the [[Cahuilla]] Indians. Development of a town began when a [[subdivision (land)|housing subdivision]] was built in 1925, although it was not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] until 1981. Situated between [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]], the city has the second largest population, after [[Indio, California|Indio]], of the nine cities in the [[Coachella Valley]] of Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|website=Census.gov|title=Cities: SUB-EST2009-4|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/cities/SUB-EST2009-4.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805012857/http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/SUB-EST2009-4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 5, 2011|access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>  Its population was 51,200 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The population of Cathedral City, along with the surrounding areas, has grown significantly into the 21st century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early History: before 1860===\nCathedral City sits at the northwestern end of the Coachella Valley between the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] to the north, and the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] to the south, with the [[San Gorgonio Pass]] to the West.  The earliest established inhabitants of this region were the [[Cahuilla|Cahuilla Indians]].  They arrived in the area around 3,000 BCE.<ref name=\"Cahuilla1\">{{cite web |title=History and Culture: Cultural History |url=http://www.aguacaliente.org/content/History%20and%20Culture/ |publisher=Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  The Cahuilla were organized into bands of about 600 to 800 people, and it was the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] who inhabited the lands that included what would become Cathedral City, California.<ref name=\"Cahuilla2\">{{cite web |last1=Feller |first1=Walter |title=Digital Desert: Mojave Desert: Cahuilla Indians |url=http://mojavedesert.net/cahuilla-indians/ |website=Digital Desert |publisher=Walter Feller |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe land was claimed by [[Spain]] in 1768 when Spain established [[The Californias|Las Californias]], a province of the [[Viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]], and then by [[Mexico]] in 1821 when Mexico and Spain signed the [[Treaty of Cordoba]]. At that time the province had already been renamed and expanded into the larger [[Alta California]] province.  After the [[Mexican-American War]], and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, possession of the land was formally transferred to the [[United States]], and it officially became part of the [[California|State of California]] when the state was formed in 1850.\n \nIn 1852 [[United States Army|US Army]] [[Colonel Henry Washington]], a nephew of [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]], was contracted by the government to survey Southern California.<ref name=Survey1>{{cite web |last1=Mojave |first1=Mojo on the |title=George Washington's Nephew in the Mojave Desert? |url=https://www.desertusa.com/dusablog/george-washingtons-nephew-mojave-desert.html |website=DesertUSA |publisher=Mojo on the Mojave |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  On November 7 of that year he established the [[San Bernardino meridian|initial point]], in the San Bernardino Mountains, from which all future surveys in Southern California would be based.<ref name=\"Survey2\">{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=Michael A |title=Three Monuments, One Initial Point (The Story of The San Bernardino Initial Point Monument) |journal=California Surveyor |date=September 2002 |issue=#135 |url=http://www.mdshs.org/articles/duffy.html |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  In 1855 he was contracted to continue his work and survey the Coachella Valley.  It was then that he found and named Cathedral Canyon for which Cathedral City would be named.<ref name=Survey1/>\n\nBesides Colonel Henry Washington, there were occasional explorers, colonizers and soldiers that made their way through the area during the Spanish, Mexican, and early American eras, but none established any permanent structures or residences.  The Cahuilla remained the only people known to be living in the area.\n\n===Stage and Freight Lines 1860 \u2013 1880===\n\nPrior to the 1860\u2019s the only regularly traveled routes through the Coachella Valley were trading paths used by the Cahuilla and other Native American tribes.  One of these paths, on the southwestern side of the valley, followed the base of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains somewhere near the [[Whitewater River (California)|Whitewater River]], and would have passed through the area that would become Cathedral City.  Early non-native explorers, surveyors, and military, such as Colonel Washington, made use of these routes, but regular transportation services were not established until 1862.\n  \nThe [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|Colorado River Gold Rush]], which started in the spring of 1862, prompted [[William D. Bradshaw]], a frontiersman, to seek a quicker route from Los Angeles to the [[Colorado River]].  Later that year he hired a guide, and with the help of the Cahuilla and [[Maricopa people|Maricopa Indians]], mapped a route from [[San Bernardino, California]], through the San Gorgonio Pass and Coachella Valley, past the northern shore of the [[Salton Sink]], through the passes between the [[Chuckwalla Mountains|Chuckwalla]] and [[Chocolate Mountains]], and up to the Colorado River across from La Paz in the [[New Mexico Territory]], (now the state of [[Arizona]]).  Much of the route is thought to have followed the original southwestern trading path used by the Cahuilla.\n\nShortly after Bradshaw defined the trail from San Bernardino to La Paz, various stagecoach and freight companies began using the route.  The stage and freight lines brought miners, supplies, and mail between San Bernardino and La Paz, and the route became known as the [[Bradshaw Trail]] or \u201cGold Road\u201d.  The Bradshaw trail, like the original Cahuillian trail, passed through the future Cathedral City, but the nearest scheduled stops were Agua Caliente (now Palms Springs), and Indian Wells (now Indio). The stage and freight lines were eventually supplanted by the railroads, but the trail would later become the basis for Palm Canyon Drive and [[California State Route 111|Highway 111]] that run through the city today.\n\n===Depression era nightclubs===\nIn 1931, Al and Lou Wertheimer of the reputed Detroit \"Purple Gang\" opened the Dunes Club just outside Palm Springs' city limits. This was followed in 1939 by Earl T. Sausser's 139 Club and the Cove Club in 1941, built by Jake Katelman and Frank Portnoy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moruzzi|first=Peter|title=Palm Springs Holiday|year=2009|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, UT|isbn=978-1-4236-0476-1|pages=39\u201342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdZPqOwMM2gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>Artist Carlo Wahlbeck, resident of Palm Springs, is the owner of 29 wood panels that used to hang in the now-demolished 139 Club.

In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.\n\nThe inaugural [[1877 Wimbledon Championship]] started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held. It was won by [[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], an old Harrovian [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]] player, from a field of 22.

First prize, awarded to [[Maud Watson]], was a silver flower-basket worth 20 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]].]]\n\nBy 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.\n\nIn 1884, the club added [[List of Wimbledon ladies' singles champions|Ladies' Singles]] and [[List of Wimbledon gentlemen's doubles champions|Gentlemen's Doubles]] competitions. [[List of Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions|Ladies' Doubles]] and [[List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions|Mixed Doubles]] events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three ''Major or Grand Slam'' events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players; professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the [[History of tennis|open era]] in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between [[Fred Perry]] in 1936 and [[Andy Murray]] in 2013, while no British woman has won since [[Virginia Wade]] in 1977, although [[Annabel Croft]] and [[Laura Robson]] won the Girls' Championship in [[1984 Wimbledon Championships|1984]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|2008]] respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.\n\nThough properly called \"The Championships, Wimbledon\", depending on sources the event is also known as \"The All England Lawn Tennis Championships\", \"The Wimbledon Championships\" or simply \"Wimbledon\". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the [[International Lawn Tennis Federation]] as the \"World Grass Court Championships\".\n\n=== 21st century ===\nWimbledon is considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the Club is to maintain its leadership.

Stage two (1997\u20132009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000\u20132011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601051854/http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history|date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nA new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on [[Centre Court]]. The Club tested the new roof at an event called ''A Centre Court Celebration'' on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving [[Andre Agassi]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Tim Henman]]. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]].  The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] on 29 June 2009.

This led to many winners retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start of the competition. Since 1922, the prior year's champions were required to play all the rounds, like other tournament competitors.\n\n== Schedule ==\nEach year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June or first Monday in July, two weeks after the [[Queen's Club Championships]], which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the [[Gerry Weber Open]], which is held in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle, Germany]], during the same week. Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are [[Eastbourne International|Eastbourne]], England, and [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships|Rosmalen]] in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events. The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is [[Birmingham Classic (tennis)|Birmingham]], also in England. The  men's event which is outside Europe before Wimbledon is the Antalya open in Turkey. The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the [[Hall of Fame Tennis Championships]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.\n\nWimbledon is scheduled for 14 days, beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday.

However, rain has forced play on the Middle Sunday four times, in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016. On the first of these four occasions, Wimbledon staged a \"People's Sunday\", with unreserved seating and readily available, inexpensive tickets, allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts.\n\nThe second Monday at Wimbledon is often called \"Manic Monday\", because it is the busiest day with the last-16 matches for both men's and women's singles, where fans have a pick of watching on a single day, any of the best 32 players left; which is also unique in a Grand Slam singles competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2017-manic-monday-what-is-it-court-times-roger-federer-andy-murray-rafael-nadal-novak-a7833151.html |title=Wimbledon 2017: What is Manic Monday |date=12 July 2017|work=The Independent }}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, the championships have begun one week later than in previous years, extending the gap between the tournament and the [[French Open]] from two to three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18913701|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2012|date=19 July 2012}}</ref> Additionally the [[Stuttgart Open]] men's tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June, extending the grass court season.\n\n== Players and seeding ==\nBoth the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Facts and Figures|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=27 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419022018/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|archivedate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions.

Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given [[Seed (sports)|seedings]] in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the [[1924 Wimbledon Championships]]. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the [[1927 Wimbledon Championships]] and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] and [[Helen Wills]].<ref name=compendium2013>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=2013 Wimbledon Compendium|edition=23rd|date=2013|publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|location=London|pages=163, 164, 200|isbn=978-1-899039-40-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Committee of Management decide which players receive wildcards. Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen's Singles Championship was [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the [[Bank of England]] Sports Ground in [[Roehampton]]. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events. From 2019 singles qualification will increase to 128 players and no doubles qualification will occur.<ref name=\":0\" /> Previously the same-sex doubles competitions lasted for only two rounds. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: [[John McEnroe]] in 1977 (Gentlemen's Singles), [[Vladimir Voltchkov]] in 2000 (Gentlemen's Singles), and [[Alexandra Stevenson]] in 1999 (Ladies' Singles).\n\nPlayers are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their [[International Tennis Federation]] world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.\n\nThe Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it can change the seedings based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that.<ref name=seedingexplained>{{cite news |last=Tebbutt |first=Tom |date=16 June 2010 |title=Explaining Wimbledon's seeding method |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/explaining-wimbledons-seeding-method/article4322158/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |access-date=17 June 2016 }}</ref> A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: [[Boris Becker]] in 1985 and [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by [[Richard Krajicek]], who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was [[Venus Williams]], who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:cmglee London Wimbledon Championships venue aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the grounds]]\n{{Main|All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club}}\n\nSince 2002, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% [[ryegrass|perennial ryegrass]]. Prior to 2002 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% [[Creeping Red Fescue]] was used. The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon \u2013 Grass Courts|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/news/media-centre/grass-courts|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon grass |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |publisher=Wimbledon Championship |accessdate=7 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507105351/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |archivedate= 7 May 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe main show courts, [[Centre Court]] and [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]], are normally used for only two weeks a year, during the Championships, but play can extend into a third week in exceptional circumstances. The remaining 17 courts are regularly used for other events hosted by the Club. The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. One of the show courts is also used for home ties of the GB teams in the [[Davis Cup]] on occasions.\n\nWimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts. At one time, all the Majors, except the French Open, were played on grass. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] abandoned grass in 1975 for [[green clay]] and the Australian Open did so in 1988 for [[hard court]]s; the US Open eventually would adopt hard courts as well.\n\nThe principal court, [[Centre Court]], was opened in 1922 when the Club moved from Worple Road to Church Road. The Church Road venue was larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand.\n[[File:Wimbledon order of play.jpg|thumb|left|The order of play for all courts is displayed on boards around the grounds.]]\n\nDue to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open in about 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336573017483.html |title=Wimbledon \u2013 Centre Court roof |publisher=[[AELTC]] |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> Whilst the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] and [[Dinara Safina]]. The first full match played and completed under the roof featured [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]], played on the same date.\n\nThe court has a capacity of 15,000. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.\n\nThe second most important court is [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]]. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court.  The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. Construction of a new retractable roof on the No.1 Court began after the 2017 Championships and was completed in time for the 2019 championships. The capacity of the stadium also rose by 900 to 12,345.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2019/06/11/wimbledons-new-no1-court-roof-marks-2019-stadium-changes/#44f3501c667f|title=New No. 1 Court Roof Among Stadium Changes For Wimbledon 2019|work=Forbes|date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, a new [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 2 Court]] has been used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people.

Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.\n\nAt the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an area of grass officially known as the [[Aorangi Terrace]]. When British players do well at Wimbledon, the hill attracts fans for them, and is often renamed after them by the press: [[Greg Rusedski]]'s followers convened at \"Rusedski Ridge\", and [[Tim Henman]] has had the hill nicknamed [[Henman Hill]]. As both of them have now retired and [[Andy Murray]] is the number 1 British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as \"Murray Mound\" or \"[[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]\", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish rugby ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on \u2013 the area is still usually referred to as Henman Hill.

This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. Since 2008 they have been drawn from schools in the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], as well as from [[Surrey]].<ref name=BBG>{{cite web|title=Ball Boys and Ball Girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/ball_boys_and_ball_girls.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years [[Year Nine|nine]] and [[Year Ten|ten]].<ref name=\"Official Site\">[http://www.aeltc.com/CMS/BBG/background.aspx Official Site] Ballboys and Ballgirls Background Information</ref> They serve for one, or if re-selected, for up to five tournaments, up to year thirteen.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507113749/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html |date=7 May 2013 }} About the Ball Boys and Girls</ref>\n\nStarting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day's play.<ref name=\"Official Site\" /> Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. From the second Wednesday, BBGs are told to leave the Championships, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of \u00a3120-\u00a3180 being paid to each ball boy\nor girl after the 13-day period depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or [[skorts]], track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water bottle holder, bag and trainers. Along with this it is seen as a privilege, and a valuable addition to a school leaver's [[curriculum vitae]], showing discipline. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been used since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Wimbledon \u2013 Behind the scenes \u2013 Ball boys and ball girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336567795051.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nProspective BBGs are first nominated by their school [[headteacher]], to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships for a feel of the grass court.\n\n=== Colours and uniforms ===\n[[File:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|[[S\u00e9bastien Grosjean]] takes a shot on Court 18 during the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|2004 Championships]].]]\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours.

Controversy followed [[Martina Navratilova]]'s wearing branding for \"Kim\" cigarettes in 1982. Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer [[Ralph Lauren]]. This marked the first time in the history of the Championships that an outside company was used to design Wimbledon clothing.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Referring to players ===\nBy tradition, the \"Men's\" and \"Women's\" competitions are referred to as \"Gentlemen's\" and \"Ladies'\" competitions at Wimbledon. The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys'\" and \"Girls'\" competitions.\n\nPrior to 2009, female players were referred to by the title \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\" on scoreboards. As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, [[Chris Evert]] appeared on scoreboards as \"Mrs. J. M. Lloyd\" during her marriage to [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], since [[Coverture#Outside the legal realm|\"Mrs. X\" essentially designates the wife of X]].

The chair umpire will say \"Mr. <surname> is challenging the call...\" and \"Mr. <surname> has X challenges remaining.\" Up until 2018, the chair umpire says \"Miss\"/\"Mrs.\" <surname> when announcing the score of the Ladies' matches.

In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave. Initially, this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949.

The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight.

[[NBC]] began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of [[NBC]]'s \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_5|title=NBC Sports establishes \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from [[Bud Collins]], whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US. Collins was sacked by [[NBC]] in 2007, but was promptly hired by [[ESPN]], the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster [[Dick Enberg]].\n\nFrom 1975 to 1999, premium channel [[HBO]] carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included [[Jim Lampley]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]] and [[Barry MacKay]] among others.<ref>HBO Guides, program schedules, 1975 to 1999</ref> [[ESPN]] took over as the cable-television partner in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=ESPN, Wimbledon come to terms |url=https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2003/04/14/ESPN-Wimbledon-come-to-terms/27281050341777/ |work=UPI |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe AELTC grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and using [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in [[2009 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|2009]], ESPN2's coverage of the [[Tommy Haas]]-[[Novak Djokovic]] quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous [[Ivo Karlovi\u0107]]-[[Roger Federer]] quarterfinal in full.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |title=Why Wimbledon Switched to ESPN From NBC |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/sports/tennis/why-wimbledon-switched-to-espn-from-nbc.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 July 2011}}</ref> Beginning with the 2012 tournament, coverage moved to ESPN and [[ESPN2]], marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) where live coverage is exclusively on pay television.

Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] with the weekday matches broadcast on the [[Televisa Deportes Network]].  As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after [[sign-on]].  Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.\n\nIn most of the remainder of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on [[ESPN Latin America|ESPN]], as do the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, [[SporTV]] has exclusive rights to the broadcast.\n\n==== Other countries ====\nIn several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]], [[Eurosport 2]] and the Eurosport Player. Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] holds the right to show matches until 2022. In the [[Netherlands]] Center Court is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]] and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player. But Court One is covered live on [[Ziggo Sport]]/[[Ziggo Sport Select]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the free-to-air [[Nine Network]] covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the [[Seven Network]], the host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel [[7Two]] would broadcast the event from 2011. Pay television network [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports Australia]] also covers the event. In [[India]] and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on [[Star Sports]].\n\nCoverage is free-to-air in [[New Zealand]] through [[TVNZ One]], beginning each night at 11 pm (midday in London).  In 2017 their new channel, [[TVNZ Duke]] (also free-to-air), carried an alternative to the main feed, including (for example) matches on outside courts involving New Zealand players.\n\n[[Fox Sports Asia]] holds broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia.\n\nMost matches are also available for viewing through internet betting websites and other live streaming services, as television cameras are set up to provide continuous coverage on nearly all the courts.\n\n== Trophies and prize money ==\n\n=== Trophies ===\n[[File:Wimbledon trophies.jpg|thumb|The Ladies' (top) and Gentlemen's singles trophies]]\nThe Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 47{{nbsp}}cm) in height and 7.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 19{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter.

The salver, which is 18.75{{nbsp}}inches (about 48{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology.  The actual dish remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a miniature replica bearing the names of all past Champions. From 1949 to 2006 the replica was 8 inches in diameter, and since 2007 it has been a three-quarter size replica with a diameter of 13.5 inches.<ref name=\"wimbledon_trophies\" />\n\nThe winner of the Gentlemen's Doubles, Ladies' Doubles, and Mixed Doubles events receive silver cups. A trophy is awarded to each player in the Doubles pair, unlike the other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments where the winning Doubles duo shares a single trophy. The Gentlemen's Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884. The Ladies' Doubles Trophy, a silver cup and cover known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, was presented to the All England Club in 1949 by The Duchess of Kent. The Mixed Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup and cover presented to the All England Club by the family of two-time Wimbledon doubles winner S.H.

been held at the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|All England Club]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[London]], since 1877 and is played on outdoor [[grass court]]s, and since 2009 with a retractable roof over [[Centre Court]].\n\nWimbledon is one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, the others being the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Since the Australian Open shifted to [[hardcourt]] in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on [[grass court|grass]], which is widely considered as the classic tennis court.\n\nThe tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. However, recent changes to the tennis calendar have seen the event moved back by a week to begin in early July.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/18913701|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Enhanced UK grass court season announced for 2017|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2016-04-07/enhanced_uk_grass_court_season_announced_for_2017.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=7 April 2016}}</ref> Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place.\n\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors and royal patronage.

In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.\n\nThe inaugural [[1877 Wimbledon Championship]] started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held. It was won by [[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], an old Harrovian [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]] player, from a field of 22.

First prize, awarded to [[Maud Watson]], was a silver flower-basket worth 20 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]].]]\n\nBy 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.\n\nIn 1884, the club added [[List of Wimbledon ladies' singles champions|Ladies' Singles]] and [[List of Wimbledon gentlemen's doubles champions|Gentlemen's Doubles]] competitions. [[List of Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions|Ladies' Doubles]] and [[List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions|Mixed Doubles]] events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three ''Major or Grand Slam'' events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players; professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the [[History of tennis|open era]] in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between [[Fred Perry]] in 1936 and [[Andy Murray]] in 2013, while no British woman has won since [[Virginia Wade]] in 1977, although [[Annabel Croft]] and [[Laura Robson]] won the Girls' Championship in [[1984 Wimbledon Championships|1984]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|2008]] respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.\n\nThough properly called \"The Championships, Wimbledon\", depending on sources the event is also known as \"The All England Lawn Tennis Championships\", \"The Wimbledon Championships\" or simply \"Wimbledon\". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the [[International Lawn Tennis Federation]] as the \"World Grass Court Championships\".\n\n=== 21st century ===\nWimbledon is considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the Club is to maintain its leadership.

Stage two (1997\u20132009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000\u20132011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601051854/http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history|date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nA new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on [[Centre Court]]. The Club tested the new roof at an event called ''A Centre Court Celebration'' on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving [[Andre Agassi]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Tim Henman]]. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]].  The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] on 29 June 2009. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02{{nbsp}}pm in a victory over [[Marcos Baghdatis]] at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships.

This led to many winners retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start of the competition. Since 1922, the prior year's champions were required to play all the rounds, like other tournament competitors.\n\n== Schedule ==\nEach year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June or first Monday in July, two weeks after the [[Queen's Club Championships]], which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the [[Gerry Weber Open]], which is held in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle, Germany]], during the same week. Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are [[Eastbourne International|Eastbourne]], England, and [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships|Rosmalen]] in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events. The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is [[Birmingham Classic (tennis)|Birmingham]], also in England.

The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the [[Hall of Fame Tennis Championships]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.\n\nWimbledon is scheduled for 14 days, beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday.

Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given [[Seed (sports)|seedings]] in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the [[1924 Wimbledon Championships]]. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the [[1927 Wimbledon Championships]] and from then on players were seeded on merit.

Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen's Singles Championship was [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the [[Bank of England]] Sports Ground in [[Roehampton]]. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events. From 2019 singles qualification will increase to 128 players and no doubles qualification will occur.<ref name=\":0\" /> Previously the same-sex doubles competitions lasted for only two rounds. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: [[John McEnroe]] in 1977 (Gentlemen's Singles), [[Vladimir Voltchkov]] in 2000 (Gentlemen's Singles), and [[Alexandra Stevenson]] in 1999 (Ladies' Singles).\n\nPlayers are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their [[International Tennis Federation]] world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.\n\nThe Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it can change the seedings based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that.<ref name=seedingexplained>{{cite news |last=Tebbutt |first=Tom |date=16 June 2010 |title=Explaining Wimbledon's seeding method |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/explaining-wimbledons-seeding-method/article4322158/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |access-date=17 June 2016 }}</ref> A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: [[Boris Becker]] in 1985 and [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by [[Richard Krajicek]], who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was [[Venus Williams]], who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:cmglee London Wimbledon Championships venue aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the grounds]]\n{{Main|All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club}}\n\nSince 2002, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% [[ryegrass|perennial ryegrass]].

The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. One of the show courts is also used for home ties of the GB teams in the [[Davis Cup]] on occasions.\n\nWimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts.

The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] abandoned grass in 1975 for [[green clay]] and the Australian Open did so in 1988 for [[hard court]]s; the US Open eventually would adopt hard courts as well.\n\nThe principal court, [[Centre Court]], was opened in 1922 when the Club moved from Worple Road to Church Road. The Church Road venue was larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand.\n[[File:Wimbledon order of play.jpg|thumb|left|The order of play for all courts is displayed on boards around the grounds.]]\n\nDue to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open in about 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336573017483.html |title=Wimbledon \u2013 Centre Court roof |publisher=[[AELTC]] |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> Whilst the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] and [[Dinara Safina]]. The first full match played and completed under the roof featured [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]], played on the same date.\n\nThe court has a capacity of 15,000. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.\n\nThe second most important court is [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]]. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court.  The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. Construction of a new retractable roof on the No.1 Court began after the 2017 Championships and was completed in time for the 2019 championships. The capacity of the stadium also rose by 900 to 12,345.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2019/06/11/wimbledons-new-no1-court-roof-marks-2019-stadium-changes/#44f3501c667f|title=New No. 1 Court Roof Among Stadium Changes For Wimbledon 2019|work=Forbes|date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, a new [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 2 Court]] has been used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people. To obtain [[planning permission]], the playing surface is around 3.5m below ground level, ensuring that the single-storey structure is only about 3.5m above ground level, and thus not affecting local views.<ref name=\"Wim 18\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aeltc.com/cms/media/pressreleases/no2_24_04_07.aspx |title=Tickets \u2013 2013 Wimbledon Championships Website \u2013 Official Site by IBM |publisher=[[AELTC]].com |date=|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> Plans to build on the current site of Court 13 were dismissed due to the high capacity of games played at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]].

Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.\n\nAt the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an area of grass officially known as the [[Aorangi Terrace]]. When British players do well at Wimbledon, the hill attracts fans for them, and is often renamed after them by the press: [[Greg Rusedski]]'s followers convened at \"Rusedski Ridge\", and [[Tim Henman]] has had the hill nicknamed [[Henman Hill]]. As both of them have now retired and [[Andy Murray]] is the number 1 British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as \"Murray Mound\" or \"[[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]\", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish rugby ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on \u2013 the area is still usually referred to as Henman Hill. None of these nicknames are official.\n\n=== Bank of England Sports Centre ===\n\nThe qualifying matches, prior to the main draw, take place at the [[Bank of England Ground|Bank of England Sports Ground]], in [[Roehampton]], {{convert|3.6|mi|km|1}} from the All-England Club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/qualifying.html |title=Qualifying \u2013 Information on The Championships Qualifying Competition |publisher=Wimbledon |accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Traditions ==\n[[File:Wimbledon Court 10 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|Court 10.

Writer [[Peter York]] sees the event as representing a particular white and affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as \"a southern, well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character\".

Traditionally, [[Wandsworth School|Wandsworth Boys School]] in Sutherland Grove, Southfields and Mayfield Girls School on [[West Hill, Wandsworth|West Hill]] in Wandsworth, both now defunct, were the schools of choice for selection of BBGs. This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. Since 2008 they have been drawn from schools in the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], as well as from [[Surrey]].<ref name=BBG>{{cite web|title=Ball Boys and Ball Girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/ball_boys_and_ball_girls.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years [[Year Nine|nine]] and [[Year Ten|ten]].<ref name=\"Official Site\">[http://www.aeltc.com/CMS/BBG/background.aspx Official Site] Ballboys and Ballgirls Background Information</ref> They serve for one, or if re-selected, for up to five tournaments, up to year thirteen.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507113749/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html |date=7 May 2013 }} About the Ball Boys and Girls</ref>\n\nStarting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day's play.<ref name=\"Official Site\" /> Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. From the second Wednesday, BBGs are told to leave the Championships, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of \u00a3120-\u00a3180 being paid to each ball boy\nor girl after the 13-day period depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or [[skorts]], track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water bottle holder, bag and trainers. Along with this it is seen as a privilege, and a valuable addition to a school leaver's [[curriculum vitae]], showing discipline. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been used since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Wimbledon \u2013 Behind the scenes \u2013 Ball boys and ball girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336567795051.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nProspective BBGs are first nominated by their school [[headteacher]], to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships for a feel of the grass court.\n\n=== Colours and uniforms ===\n[[File:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|[[S\u00e9bastien Grosjean]] takes a shot on Court 18 during the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|2004 Championships]].]]\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours.

Controversy followed [[Martina Navratilova]]'s wearing branding for \"Kim\" cigarettes in 1982. Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer [[Ralph Lauren]]. This marked the first time in the history of the Championships that an outside company was used to design Wimbledon clothing.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Referring to players ===\nBy tradition, the \"Men's\" and \"Women's\" competitions are referred to as \"Gentlemen's\" and \"Ladies'\" competitions at Wimbledon. The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys'\" and \"Girls'\" competitions.\n\nPrior to 2009, female players were referred to by the title \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\" on scoreboards. As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, [[Chris Evert]] appeared on scoreboards as \"Mrs. J. M. Lloyd\" during her marriage to [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], since [[Coverture#Outside the legal realm|\"Mrs. X\" essentially designates the wife of X]].

The coverage is presented by [[Sue Barker]] (live) and [[Claire Balding]] (highlights).

It said in a statement that views on commentary were subjective but that they \"do appreciate that over-talking can irritate our audience\". The BBC added that it hoped it had achieved \"the right balance\" across its coverage and was \"of course sorry if on occasion you have not been satisfied\".

Four hours live coverage of the [[1967 Wimbledon Championships|1967 Championships]] was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however, the Gentlemen's Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives because it was the first Gentlemen's Final transmitted in colour. The tennis balls used were traditionally white, but were switched to yellow in 1986 to make them stand out for colour television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.watches2u.com/blog/wimbledon-facts.html|title=Wimbledon Facts|website=www.watches2u.com|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> Since 2007, Wimbledon matches have been transmitted in [[High-definition television|high-definition]], originally on the BBC's free-to-air channel [[BBC HD]], with continual live coverage during the tournament of Centre Court and Court No. 1 as well as an evening highlights show ''[[Today at Wimbledon]]''.

A piece titled \"A Sporting Occasion\" is the traditional closing theme, though nowadays coverage typically ends either with a montage set to a popular song or with no music at all. Mansfield also composed the piece \"World Champion\", used by NBC during intervals (change-overs, set breaks, etc.) and at the close of broadcasts throughout the tournament.\n\n==== Ireland ====\nIn Ireland, [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] broadcast the tournament during the 1980s and 1990s on their second channel [[RT\u00c9 Two]], they also provided highlights of the games in the evening. The commentary provided was given by Matt Doyle a former Irish-American professional tennis player and Jim Sherwin a former RT\u00c9 newsreader. Caroline Murphy was the presenter of the programme. RT\u00c9 made the decision in 1998 to discontinue broadcasting the tournament due to falling viewing figures and the large number of viewers watching on the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/1998/0708/98070800158.html|title=Tennis \u2013 set for change?|date=8 July 1998|work=The Irish Times |accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref> From 2005 until 2014 [[TG4]] Ireland's Irish-language broadcaster provided coverage of the tournament.

[[NBC]] began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of [[NBC]]'s \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_5|title=NBC Sports establishes \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from [[Bud Collins]], whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US. Collins was sacked by [[NBC]] in 2007, but was promptly hired by [[ESPN]], the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster [[Dick Enberg]].\n\nFrom 1975 to 1999, premium channel [[HBO]] carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included [[Jim Lampley]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]] and [[Barry MacKay]] among others.<ref>HBO Guides, program schedules, 1975 to 1999</ref> [[ESPN]] took over as the cable-television partner in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=ESPN, Wimbledon come to terms |url=https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2003/04/14/ESPN-Wimbledon-come-to-terms/27281050341777/ |work=UPI |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe AELTC grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and using [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in [[2009 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|2009]], ESPN2's coverage of the [[Tommy Haas]]-[[Novak Djokovic]] quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous [[Ivo Karlovi\u0107]]-[[Roger Federer]] quarterfinal in full.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |title=Why Wimbledon Switched to ESPN From NBC |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/sports/tennis/why-wimbledon-switched-to-espn-from-nbc.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 July 2011}}</ref> Beginning with the 2012 tournament, coverage moved to ESPN and [[ESPN2]], marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) where live coverage is exclusively on pay television.

Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] with the weekday matches broadcast on the [[Televisa Deportes Network]].  As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after [[sign-on]].  Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.\n\nIn most of the remainder of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on [[ESPN Latin America|ESPN]], as do the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, [[SporTV]] has exclusive rights to the broadcast.\n\n==== Other countries ====\nIn several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]], [[Eurosport 2]] and the Eurosport Player. Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] holds the right to show matches until 2022. In the [[Netherlands]] Center Court is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]] and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player. But Court One is covered live on [[Ziggo Sport]]/[[Ziggo Sport Select]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the free-to-air [[Nine Network]] covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the [[Seven Network]], the host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel [[7Two]] would broadcast the event from 2011. Pay television network [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports Australia]] also covers the event. In [[India]] and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on [[Star Sports]].\n\nCoverage is free-to-air in [[New Zealand]] through [[TVNZ One]], beginning each night at 11 pm (midday in London).  In 2017 their new channel, [[TVNZ Duke]] (also free-to-air), carried an alternative to the main feed, including (for example) matches on outside courts involving New Zealand players.\n\n[[Fox Sports Asia]] holds broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia.\n\nMost matches are also available for viewing through internet betting websites and other live streaming services, as television cameras are set up to provide continuous coverage on nearly all the courts.\n\n== Trophies and prize money ==\n\n=== Trophies ===\n[[File:Wimbledon trophies.jpg|thumb|The Ladies' (top) and Gentlemen's singles trophies]]\nThe Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 47{{nbsp}}cm) in height and 7.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 19{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter.

The actual dish remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a miniature replica bearing the names of all past Champions.

A trophy is awarded to each player in the Doubles pair, unlike the other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments where the winning Doubles duo shares a single trophy. The Gentlemen's Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884. The Ladies' Doubles Trophy, a silver cup and cover known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, was presented to the All England Club in 1949 by The Duchess of Kent.

It was probably brought to [[Great Britain]] by [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] in the mid-5th century, and the first [[Old English literature|Old English literary works]] date from the mid-7th century. After the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], a [[langues d'o\u00efl|relative of French]]. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as [[Middle English]].\n\nOld English developed from a set of [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] or [[Ingvaeonic]] dialects originally spoken by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes traditionally known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. As the [[Anglo-Saxons]] became dominant in England, their language [[Celtic language-death in England|replaced]] the languages of [[Roman Britain]]: [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion]]. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]: [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]]. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period,<ref name=\":2\" /> although the dominant forms of Middle and [[Modern English]] would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong [[Old Norse]] influence due to [[Danelaw|Scandinavian rule]] and settlement beginning in the 9th century.\n\nOld English is one of the [[West Germanic languages]], and its closest relatives are [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. Within [[Old English grammar]] nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many [[inflection]]al endings and forms, and [[word order]] is much freer.<ref name=\":2\" /> The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic system]], but from about the 8th century this was replaced by a [[Old English Latin alphabet|version of the Latin alphabet]].\n\n==Terminology==\n''Englisc'', which the term ''English'' is [[List of English words of Anglo-Saxon origin|derived from]], means 'pertaining to the Angles'.<ref>Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> In Old English, this word was derived from ''Angles'' (one of the [[Germanic tribe]]s who conquered parts of Great Britain in the 5th century).<ref>Pyles, Thomas and John Algeo 1993. ''Origins and development of the English language''. 4th edition. (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich).</ref> During the 9th century, all invading Germanic tribes were referred to as ''Englisc''. It has been hypothesised that the Angles acquired their name because their land on the coast of [[Jutland]] (now mainland [[Denmark]]) resembled a [[fishhook]]. [[Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*anguz}} also had the meaning of 'narrow', referring to the shallow waters near the coast. That word ultimately goes back to Proto-Indo-European ''{{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*h\u2082en\u01f5\u02b0-}}'', also meaning 'narrow'.<ref>Barber, Charles, Joan C. Beal and Philip A. Shaw 2009. ''The English language. A historical introduction''. Second edition of Barber (1993). Cambridge: University Press.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the derivation of 'narrow' is the more likely connection to [[angling]] (as in [[fishing]]), which itself stems from a [[Proto-Indo-European root|Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root]] meaning ''bend, angle''.<ref>Mugglestone, Lynda (ed.) 2006. ''The Oxford History of English.'' Oxford: University Press.</ref> The semantic link is the fishing hook, which is curved or bent at an angle.<ref>Hogg, Richard M. and David Denison (ed.) 2006. ''A history of the English language''. Cambridge: University Press.</ref> In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a [[fishing]] people or were originally descended from such, and therefore England would mean 'land of the [[fishermen]]', and English would be 'the fishermen's language'.<ref>Baugh, Albert C. and Thomas Cable 1993 ''A history of the English language''. 4th edition.

While indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process, Albert Baugh dates Old English from 450 to 1150, a period of full inflections, a [[synthetic language]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Perhaps around 85% of Old English words are no longer in use, but those that survived are basic elements of [[Modern English]] vocabulary.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOld English is a [[West Germanic language]], developing out of [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (also known as North Sea Germanic) dialects from the 5th century. It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] which became the [[Kingdom of England]]. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern [[Scotland]], which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Other parts of the island \u2013 [[Wales]] and most of [[Scotland]] \u2013 continued to use [[Celtic languages]], except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where [[Old Norse]] was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: [[Cornish language#Middle Cornish|Medieval Cornish]] was spoken all over [[Cornwall]] and in adjacent parts of [[Devon]], while [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of [[Cumbria]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] may have been spoken on the English side of the [[England\u2013Wales border|Anglo-Welsh border]]. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under [[Danelaw|Danish law]].\n\nAnglo-Saxon literacy developed after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation]] in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving work of [[Old English literature]] is ''[[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]]'', which was composed between 658 and 680 but not written down until the early 8th century.<ref name=\":2\" /> There is a limited corpus of [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic inscriptions]] from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably the inscriptions on the [[Franks Casket]]) date to the early 8th century. The [[Old English Latin alphabet]] was introduced around the 8th century.\n\n[[File:Statue d'Alfred le Grand \u00e0 Winchester.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.86|[[Alfred the Great]] statue in [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]].

Alfred [[Alfred the Great#Advocacy of education in the English language|advocated education in English]] alongside Latin, and had many works translated into the English language; some of them, such as [[Pope Gregory I]]'s treatise ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', appear to have been translated by Alfred himself. In Old English, typical of the development of literature, poetry arose before prose, but Alfred chiefly inspired the growth of prose.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA later literary standard, dating from the later 10th century, arose under the influence of Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester]], and was followed by such writers as the prolific [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham]] (\"the Grammarian\"). This form of the language is known as the \"[[Winchester]] standard\", or more commonly as Late West Saxon. It is considered to represent the \"classical\" form of Old English.<ref>Hogg (1992), p. 83.</ref> It retained its position of prestige until the time of the Norman Conquest, after which English ceased for a time to be of importance as a literary language.\n\nThe history of Old English can be subdivided into:\n*Prehistoric Old English (c. 450 to 650); for this period, Old English is mostly a [[reconstructed language]] as no literary witnesses survive (with the exception of limited [[Anglo-Saxon runes|epigraphic evidence]]). This language, or closely related group of dialects, spoken by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, and pre-dating documented Old English or Anglo-Saxon, has also been called Primitive Old English.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stumpf |first=John |title=An Outline of English Literature; Anglo-Saxon and Middle English Literature |year=1970 |publisher=Forum House Publishing Company |place=London |page=7 |quote=We do not know what languages the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons spoke, nor even whether they were sufficiently similar to make them mutually intelligible, but it is reasonable to assume that by the end of the sixth century there must have been a language that could be understood by all and this we call Primitive Old English.}}</ref> \n*Early Old English (c. 650 to 900), the period of the oldest manuscript traditions, with authors such as [[C\u00e6dmon]], [[Bede]], [[Cynewulf]] and [[Aldhelm]].\n*Late Old English (c. 900 to 1170), the final stage of the language leading up to the Norman conquest of England and the subsequent transition to [[Early Middle English]].\n\nThe Old English period is followed by [[Middle English]] (12th to 15th century), [[Early Modern English]] (c. 1480 to 1650) and finally [[Modern English]] (after 1650).\n\n==Dialects==\n[[File:Her swutela\u00f0 seo gecwydr\u00e6dnes \u00f0e.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ang|Her s\u01bfutela\u00f0 seo gec\u01bfydr\u00e6dnes \u00f0e}} ('Here is manifested the Word to thee').

In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and South of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England. The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantiest literary remains.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEach of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, Northumbria south of the [[River Tyne|Tyne]], and most of [[Mercia]], were [[Viking invasion of Britain|overrun by the Vikings]] during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended, and all of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], were then integrated into Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]].\nFrom that time on, the West Saxon dialect (then in the form now known as Early West Saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from Latin in that period.\n\nThe later literary standard known as Late West Saxon (see [[#History|History]], above), although centred in the same region of the country, appears not to have been directly descended from Alfred's Early West Saxon. For example, the former [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/iy/}} tended to become monophthongised to {{IPA|/i/}} in EWS, but to {{IPA|/y/}} in LWS.<ref>Hogg (1992), p. 117; but for a different interpretation of this, see [[Old English phonology#Diphthongs|Old English diphthongs]].</ref>\n\nDue to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars.<ref>Magennis (2011), pp. 56\u201360.</ref> Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while [[Scots language|Scots]] developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the [[West Country dialects#History and origins|dialect of Somerset]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/somersetshiredi00bayngoog The Somersetshire dialect: its pronunciation, 2 papers (1861)] Thomas Spencer Baynes, first published 1855 & 1856</ref>\n\nFor details of the sound differences between the dialects, see [[Phonological history of Old English#Dialects|Phonological history of Old English (dialects)]].\n\n==Influence of other languages==\n{{further|Celtic influence in English|Latin influence in English|Scandinavian influence in English}}\nThe language of the Anglo-Saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native [[British Celtic languages]] which it [[Celtic language-death in England|largely displaced]]. The number of Celtic [[loanwords]] introduced into the language is very small, although dialect and toponymic terms are more often retained in western language contact zones (Cumbria, Devon, Welsh Marches and Borders and so on) than in the east. However, various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that Celtic may have had on developments in English [[syntax]] in the post-Old English period, such as the regular [[progressive aspect|progressive]] construction and [[Analytic language|analytic word order]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |title=Rotary-munich.de |format=PDF |accessdate=20 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327012738/http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb \"do\". These ideas have generally not received widespread support from linguists, particularly as the aforementioned features do not become widespread until the late Middle English and Early Modern English periods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zarranz|first=Jaione Inda|title=The Progress of the English Progressive|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/84679048.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Koch|first=Anthony S.|title=Function and Grammar in the History of English: Periphrastic Do|url=https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kroch/papers/function-grammar-do.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOld English contained a certain number of loanwords from [[Latin]], which was the scholarly and diplomatic ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Western Europe. It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral [[Angles]] and [[Saxon people|Saxons]] left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were [[Christianization of England|converted to Christianity]] and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the [[Latin alphabet]] was introduced and adapted for the [[#Orthography|writing of Old English]], replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly [[Old French]]) words into English occurred after the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and thus in the [[Middle English]] rather than the Old English period.\n\nAnother source of loanwords was [[Old Norse]], which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the [[Danelaw]] from the late 9th century, and during the rule of [[Cnut]] and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many [[toponym|place-names]] in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the [[West Saxon dialect]], away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in [[Middle English]] texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 60\u201383; 110\u2013130 (Scandinavian influence).}}</ref><ref name=\"Shay2008\">{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Shay |title=The history of English: a linguistic introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1vj0-f_U1SQC&pg=PA86 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |date=30 January 2008 |publisher=Wardja Press |isbn=978-0-615-16817-3 |page=86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Growth and Structure of the English Language|last = Jespersen|first = Otto|publisher = B.

For sound changes before and after the Old English period, see [[Phonological history of English]].\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Old English grammar}}\n\n===Morphology===\n[[Noun]]s [[declension|decline]] for five [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]]; three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, and plural; and are strong or weak. The instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the [[dative case|dative]]. Only [[pronoun]]s and strong adjectives retain separate [[instrumental case|instrumental]] forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case: the [[locative case|locative]]. The evidence comes from Northumbrian [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] texts  (e.g., {{script|Runr|\u16a9\u16be \u16b1\u16a9\u16de\u16c1}} ''on rodi'' \"on the Cross\").<ref>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to English Runes|last=Boydell|date=1999|page=230}}</ref>\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, number, and strong, or weak forms. [[Pronoun]]s and sometimes [[participle]]s agree in case, gender, and number. First-person and second-[[grammatical person|person]] [[personal pronoun]]s occasionally distinguish [[dual (grammatical number)|dual-number]] forms. The [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] {{lang|ang|s\u0113}} and its [[inflection]]s serve as a [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] (\"the\"), a [[demonstrative adjective]] (\"that\"), and [[Pronoun#Demonstrative|demonstrative pronoun]]. Other [[demonstrative]]s are {{lang|ang|\u00fees}} (\"this\"), and {{lang|ang|\u0121eon}} (\"yon\"). These words [[inflection|inflect]] for case, gender, number. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive [[determiner]] is also present.\n\nVerbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, and third; two numbers: singular, plural; two [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: present, and past; three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[grammatical mood#indicative|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[imperative mood|imperative]];<ref name=\"Continuum\">{{cite web|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/britlit/old_english|publisher=Continuum}}</ref> and are strong (exhibiting ablaut) or weak (exhibiting a dental suffix). Verbs have two [[infinitive]] forms: bare, and bound; and two [[participle]]s: present, and past. The subjunctive has past and present forms. Finite verbs agree with [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in person, and number. The [[future tense]], [[passive voice]], and other [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] are formed with compounds.\n[[Preposition and postposition|Adpositions]] are mostly before but often after their object. If the [[object (grammar)|object]] of an adposition is marked in the dative case, an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.\n\nRemnants of the Old English case system in Modern English are in the [[English personal pronouns|forms of a few pronouns]] (such as ''I/me/mine'', ''she/her'', [[Who (pronoun)|''who/whom/whose'']]) and in the [[English possessive|possessive]] ending ''-'s'', which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending ''-es''. The modern [[English plural]] ending ''-(e)s'' derives from the Old English ''-as'', but the latter applied only to \"strong\" masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases; different plural endings were used in other instances. Old English nouns had [[grammatical gender]], while modern English has only natural gender. Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted, as in the case of {{lang|ang|\u01bf\u012bf}}, a neuter noun referring to a female person.\n\nIn Old English's verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the [[Uses of English verb forms|compound tenses of Modern English]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C |year=2002 |title=A Guide to Old English |place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |pages=109\u2013112}}</ref> Old English verbs include [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]], which use a suffix such as {{lang|ang|-de}}.<ref name=\"Continuum\"/> As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms. Then, as now, dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs, as in ''work'' and ''worked''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Syntax===\nOld English [[syntax]] is similar to [[English grammar|that of modern English]]. Some differences are consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, allowing freer [[word order]].\n*Default word order is [[verb-second]] in [[independent clause|main clauses]], and verb-final in [[subordinate clause]]s, being more like modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (and to a slightly lesser extent{{efn|Both German, Old English and Dutch use the same V2 word order in main clauses, but Old English (generally) and modern Dutch also use the same structure in subordinate clauses.}} the structure of  [[German language|German]]) than modern English.<ref>\u00d8ystein Heggelund (2007) Old English subordinate clauses and the shift to verb-medial order in English, English Studies, 88:3, 351-361</ref>\n*No [[do-support|''do''-support]] in questions and negatives. Questions were usually formed by [[inversion (linguistics)|inverting]] [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[finite verb]], and negatives by placing ''ne'' before the finite verb, regardless what verb. \n*Multiple negatives can stack up in a sentence intensifying each other ([[negative concord]]).\n*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type \"when X, Y\" (e.g. \"When I got home, I ate dinner\") don't use a ''wh-''type conjunction, but rather a ''th-''type [[correlative conjunction]] such as {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101}}, otherwise meaning \"then\" (e.g. {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101 X, \u00fe\u0101 Y}} in place of \"when X, Y\"). The ''wh-''words are used only as [[interrogative]]s and as [[indefinite pronouns]].\n*Similarly, ''wh-'' forms were not used as [[relative pronoun]]s. Instead, the indeclinable word {{lang|ang|\u00fee}} is used, often preceded by (or replaced by) the appropriate form of the article/demonstrative {{lang|ang|se}}.\n\n==Orthography==\n{{Anchor|alphabet}}\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon runes|Old English Latin alphabet}}\n[[File:Anglosaxonrunes.svg|upright=1.13|thumb|The [[runic alphabet]] used to write Old English before the introduction of the [[Latin alphabet]]]]\n\nOld English was first written in [[runic alphabet|runes]], using the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]] \u2013 a rune set derived from the Germanic 24-character [[elder futhark]], extended by five more runes used to represent Anglo-Saxon vowel sounds, and sometimes by several more additional characters. From around the 8th century, the runic system came to be supplanted by a (minuscule) [[half-uncial]] script of the [[Latin alphabet]] introduced by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Christian]] missionaries.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |year=1987 |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-26438-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys/page/203 203]}}</ref> This was replaced by [[Insular script]], a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental [[Carolingian minuscule]] (also known as ''Caroline'') replaced the insular.\n\nThe Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters {{angbr|j}} and {{angbr|w}}, and there was no {{angbr|v}} as distinct from {{angbr|u}}; moreover native Old English spellings did not use {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|q}} or {{angbr|z}}. The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by four more: {{angbr|[[\u00e6]]}} ({{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, modern ''ash'') and {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00f0}}}} ({{lang|ang|\u00f0\u00e6t}}, now called [[eth (letter)|eth]] or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u00fe}}}} and [[wynn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}}, which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s, representing a single sound. Also used was the [[Tironian note]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u204a}}}} (a character similar to the digit 7) for the [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''and''. A common [[scribal abbreviation]] was a [[thorn with stroke|thorn with a stroke]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\ua765}}}}, which was used for the pronoun {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u00e6t}}. [[Macron (diacritic)|Macron]]s over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress, or as abbreviations for a following ''m'' or ''n''.<ref>C.M. Millward, Mary Hayes, ''A Biography of the English Language'', Cengage Learning 2011, p. 96.</ref><ref>Stephen Pollington, ''First Steps in Old English'', Anglo-Saxon Books 1997, p. 138.</ref>\n\nModern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions. The modern forms of Latin letters are used, including {{angbr|g}} in place of the [[insular G]], {{angle bracket|s}} for [[long S]], and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|r}}. Macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (In some older editions an [[acute accent]] mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|c}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|g}}}} by placing dots above the palatals: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u010b}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u0121}}}}. The letter wynn {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}} is usually replaced with {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|w}}}}, but {{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, eth and thorn are normally retained (except when eth is replaced by thorn).\n\nIn contrast with [[English orthography|Modern English orthography]], that of Old English was reasonably [[regular spelling|regular]], with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and [[phoneme]]s. There were not usually any [[silent letter]]s\u2014in the word ''cniht'', for example, both the {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|h}} were pronounced, unlike the {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|gh}} in the modern ''knight''.

What they contained, how important they were for an understanding of literature before the Conquest, we have no means of knowing: the scant catalogues of monastic libraries do not help us, and there are no references in extant works to other compositions....How incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, all extant Anglo-Saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts.}}\n\nSome of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are ''[[Beowulf]]'', an [[epic poem]]; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a record of early English history; the [[Franks Casket]], an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and [[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]], a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as [[Bede]] and [[C\u00e6dmon]]. C\u00e6dmon, the earliest English poet we know by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===''Beowulf''===\nThe first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic ''[[Beowulf]]'', a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of Old English.<ref name=\":2\" /> This passage describes how [[Hrothgar]]'s legendary ancestor [[Scyld]] was found as a baby, washed ashore, and adopted by a noble family. The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order. As such, it is not typical of Old English prose. The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem.\n\nThe words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context. Notice how ''what'' is used by the poet where a word like ''lo'' or ''behold'' would be expected. This usage is similar to ''what-ho!'', both an expression of surprise and a call to attention.\n\nEnglish poetry is based on stress and alliteration. In alliteration, the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word, as with {{lang|ang|'''G'''\u0101r-Dena}} and {{lang|ang|'''\u0121'''e\u0101r-dagum}}. Vowels alliterate with any other vowel, as with {{lang|ang|'''\u00e6'''\u00feelingas}} and {{lang|ang|'''e'''llen}}.

Over time, these word-lists were consolidated and alphabeticised to create extensive Latin-Old English glossaries with some of the character of [[dictionary|dictionaries]], such as the [[Cleopatra Glossaries]], the [[Harley Glossary]] and the [[Brussels Glossary]].<ref>Patrizia Lendinara, \u2018Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries: An Introduction\u2019, in Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries (Aldershot: Variorum, 1999), pp. 1\u201326.</ref> In some cases, the material in these glossaries continued to be circulated and updated in [[Middle English]] glossaries, such as the [[Durham Plant-Name Glossary]] and the [[Laud Herbal Glossary]].<ref>''Das Durhamer Pflanzenglossar: lateinisch und altenglish'', ed. by Bogislav von Lindheim, Beitr\u00e4ge zur englischen Philologie, 35 (Bochum-Langendreer: Poppinghaus, 1941).</ref>\n\nOld English lexicography was revived in the early modern period, drawing heavily on Anglo-Saxons' own glossaries.

It was probably brought to [[Great Britain]] by [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] in the mid-5th century, and the first [[Old English literature|Old English literary works]] date from the mid-7th century. After the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], a [[langues d'o\u00efl|relative of French]]. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as [[Middle English]].\n\nOld English developed from a set of [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] or [[Ingvaeonic]] dialects originally spoken by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes traditionally known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. As the [[Anglo-Saxons]] became dominant in England, their language [[Celtic language-death in England|replaced]] the languages of [[Roman Britain]]: [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion]]. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]: [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]]. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period,<ref name=\":2\" /> although the dominant forms of Middle and [[Modern English]] would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong [[Old Norse]] influence due to [[Danelaw|Scandinavian rule]] and settlement beginning in the 9th century.\n\nOld English is one of the [[West Germanic languages]], and its closest relatives are [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. Within [[Old English grammar]] nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many [[inflection]]al endings and forms, and [[word order]] is much freer.<ref name=\":2\" /> The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic system]], but from about the 8th century this was replaced by a [[Old English Latin alphabet|version of the Latin alphabet]].\n\n==Terminology==\n''Englisc'', which the term ''English'' is [[List of English words of Anglo-Saxon origin|derived from]], means 'pertaining to the Angles'.<ref>Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> In Old English, this word was derived from ''Angles'' (one of the [[Germanic tribe]]s who conquered parts of Great Britain in the 5th century).<ref>Pyles, Thomas and John Algeo 1993. ''Origins and development of the English language''. 4th edition. (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich).</ref> During the 9th century, all invading Germanic tribes were referred to as ''Englisc''. It has been hypothesised that the Angles acquired their name because their land on the coast of [[Jutland]] (now mainland [[Denmark]]) resembled a [[fishhook]]. [[Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*anguz}} also had the meaning of 'narrow', referring to the shallow waters near the coast. That word ultimately goes back to Proto-Indo-European ''{{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*h\u2082en\u01f5\u02b0-}}'', also meaning 'narrow'.<ref>Barber, Charles, Joan C. Beal and Philip A. Shaw 2009. ''The English language. A historical introduction''. Second edition of Barber (1993). Cambridge: University Press.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the derivation of 'narrow' is the more likely connection to [[angling]] (as in [[fishing]]), which itself stems from a [[Proto-Indo-European root|Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root]] meaning ''bend, angle''.<ref>Mugglestone, Lynda (ed.) 2006. ''The Oxford History of English.'' Oxford: University Press.</ref> The semantic link is the fishing hook, which is curved or bent at an angle.<ref>Hogg, Richard M. and David Denison (ed.) 2006. ''A history of the English language''. Cambridge: University Press.</ref> In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a [[fishing]] people or were originally descended from such, and therefore England would mean 'land of the [[fishermen]]', and English would be 'the fishermen's language'.<ref>Baugh, Albert C. and Thomas Cable 1993 ''A history of the English language''. 4th edition.

While indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process, Albert Baugh dates Old English from 450 to 1150, a period of full inflections, a [[synthetic language]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Perhaps around 85% of Old English words are no longer in use, but those that survived are basic elements of [[Modern English]] vocabulary.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOld English is a [[West Germanic language]], developing out of [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (also known as North Sea Germanic) dialects from the 5th century. It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] which became the [[Kingdom of England]]. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern [[Scotland]], which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Other parts of the island \u2013 [[Wales]] and most of [[Scotland]] \u2013 continued to use [[Celtic languages]], except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where [[Old Norse]] was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: [[Cornish language#Middle Cornish|Medieval Cornish]] was spoken all over [[Cornwall]] and in adjacent parts of [[Devon]], while [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of [[Cumbria]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] may have been spoken on the English side of the [[England\u2013Wales border|Anglo-Welsh border]]. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under [[Danelaw|Danish law]].\n\nAnglo-Saxon literacy developed after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation]] in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving work of [[Old English literature]] is ''[[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]]'', which was composed between 658 and 680 but not written down until the early 8th century.<ref name=\":2\" /> There is a limited corpus of [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic inscriptions]] from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably the inscriptions on the [[Franks Casket]]) date to the early 8th century.

Alfred [[Alfred the Great#Advocacy of education in the English language|advocated education in English]] alongside Latin, and had many works translated into the English language; some of them, such as [[Pope Gregory I]]'s treatise ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', appear to have been translated by Alfred himself.

In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and South of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England. The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantiest literary remains.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEach of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, Northumbria south of the [[River Tyne|Tyne]], and most of [[Mercia]], were [[Viking invasion of Britain|overrun by the Vikings]] during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended, and all of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], were then integrated into Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]].\nFrom that time on, the West Saxon dialect (then in the form now known as Early West Saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from Latin in that period.\n\nThe later literary standard known as Late West Saxon (see [[#History|History]], above), although centred in the same region of the country, appears not to have been directly descended from Alfred's Early West Saxon. For example, the former [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/iy/}} tended to become monophthongised to {{IPA|/i/}} in EWS, but to {{IPA|/y/}} in LWS.<ref>Hogg (1992), p. 117; but for a different interpretation of this, see [[Old English phonology#Diphthongs|Old English diphthongs]].</ref>\n\nDue to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars.<ref>Magennis (2011), pp. 56\u201360.</ref> Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while [[Scots language|Scots]] developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the [[West Country dialects#History and origins|dialect of Somerset]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/somersetshiredi00bayngoog The Somersetshire dialect: its pronunciation, 2 papers (1861)] Thomas Spencer Baynes, first published 1855 & 1856</ref>\n\nFor details of the sound differences between the dialects, see [[Phonological history of Old English#Dialects|Phonological history of Old English (dialects)]].\n\n==Influence of other languages==\n{{further|Celtic influence in English|Latin influence in English|Scandinavian influence in English}}\nThe language of the Anglo-Saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native [[British Celtic languages]] which it [[Celtic language-death in England|largely displaced]]. The number of Celtic [[loanwords]] introduced into the language is very small, although dialect and toponymic terms are more often retained in western language contact zones (Cumbria, Devon, Welsh Marches and Borders and so on) than in the east. However, various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that Celtic may have had on developments in English [[syntax]] in the post-Old English period, such as the regular [[progressive aspect|progressive]] construction and [[Analytic language|analytic word order]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |title=Rotary-munich.de |format=PDF |accessdate=20 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327012738/http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb \"do\". These ideas have generally not received widespread support from linguists, particularly as the aforementioned features do not become widespread until the late Middle English and Early Modern English periods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zarranz|first=Jaione Inda|title=The Progress of the English Progressive|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/84679048.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Koch|first=Anthony S.|title=Function and Grammar in the History of English: Periphrastic Do|url=https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kroch/papers/function-grammar-do.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOld English contained a certain number of loanwords from [[Latin]], which was the scholarly and diplomatic ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Western Europe. It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral [[Angles]] and [[Saxon people|Saxons]] left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were [[Christianization of England|converted to Christianity]] and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the [[Latin alphabet]] was introduced and adapted for the [[#Orthography|writing of Old English]], replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly [[Old French]]) words into English occurred after the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and thus in the [[Middle English]] rather than the Old English period.\n\nAnother source of loanwords was [[Old Norse]], which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the [[Danelaw]] from the late 9th century, and during the rule of [[Cnut]] and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many [[toponym|place-names]] in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the [[West Saxon dialect]], away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in [[Middle English]] texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 60\u201383; 110\u2013130 (Scandinavian influence).}}</ref><ref name=\"Shay2008\">{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Shay |title=The history of English: a linguistic introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1vj0-f_U1SQC&pg=PA86 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |date=30 January 2008 |publisher=Wardja Press |isbn=978-0-615-16817-3 |page=86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Growth and Structure of the English Language|last = Jespersen|first = Otto|publisher = B.

The instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the [[dative case|dative]]. Only [[pronoun]]s and strong adjectives retain separate [[instrumental case|instrumental]] forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case: the [[locative case|locative]]. The evidence comes from Northumbrian [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] texts  (e.g., {{script|Runr|\u16a9\u16be \u16b1\u16a9\u16de\u16c1}} ''on rodi'' \"on the Cross\").<ref>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to English Runes|last=Boydell|date=1999|page=230}}</ref>\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, number, and strong, or weak forms. [[Pronoun]]s and sometimes [[participle]]s agree in case, gender, and number. First-person and second-[[grammatical person|person]] [[personal pronoun]]s occasionally distinguish [[dual (grammatical number)|dual-number]] forms. The [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] {{lang|ang|s\u0113}} and its [[inflection]]s serve as a [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] (\"the\"), a [[demonstrative adjective]] (\"that\"), and [[Pronoun#Demonstrative|demonstrative pronoun]]. Other [[demonstrative]]s are {{lang|ang|\u00fees}} (\"this\"), and {{lang|ang|\u0121eon}} (\"yon\"). These words [[inflection|inflect]] for case, gender, number. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive [[determiner]] is also present.\n\nVerbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, and third; two numbers: singular, plural; two [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: present, and past; three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[grammatical mood#indicative|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[imperative mood|imperative]];<ref name=\"Continuum\">{{cite web|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/britlit/old_english|publisher=Continuum}}</ref> and are strong (exhibiting ablaut) or weak (exhibiting a dental suffix). Verbs have two [[infinitive]] forms: bare, and bound; and two [[participle]]s: present, and past. The subjunctive has past and present forms. Finite verbs agree with [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in person, and number. The [[future tense]], [[passive voice]], and other [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] are formed with compounds.\n[[Preposition and postposition|Adpositions]] are mostly before but often after their object. If the [[object (grammar)|object]] of an adposition is marked in the dative case, an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.\n\nRemnants of the Old English case system in Modern English are in the [[English personal pronouns|forms of a few pronouns]] (such as ''I/me/mine'', ''she/her'', [[Who (pronoun)|''who/whom/whose'']]) and in the [[English possessive|possessive]] ending ''-'s'', which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending ''-es''. The modern [[English plural]] ending ''-(e)s'' derives from the Old English ''-as'', but the latter applied only to \"strong\" masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases; different plural endings were used in other instances. Old English nouns had [[grammatical gender]], while modern English has only natural gender. Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted, as in the case of {{lang|ang|\u01bf\u012bf}}, a neuter noun referring to a female person.\n\nIn Old English's verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the [[Uses of English verb forms|compound tenses of Modern English]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C |year=2002 |title=A Guide to Old English |place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |pages=109\u2013112}}</ref> Old English verbs include [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]], which use a suffix such as {{lang|ang|-de}}.<ref name=\"Continuum\"/> As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular).

Questions were usually formed by [[inversion (linguistics)|inverting]] [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[finite verb]], and negatives by placing ''ne'' before the finite verb, regardless what verb. \n*Multiple negatives can stack up in a sentence intensifying each other ([[negative concord]]).\n*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type \"when X, Y\" (e.g. \"When I got home, I ate dinner\") don't use a ''wh-''type conjunction, but rather a ''th-''type [[correlative conjunction]] such as {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101}}, otherwise meaning \"then\" (e.g. {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101 X, \u00fe\u0101 Y}} in place of \"when X, Y\"). The ''wh-''words are used only as [[interrogative]]s and as [[indefinite pronouns]].\n*Similarly, ''wh-'' forms were not used as [[relative pronoun]]s. Instead, the indeclinable word {{lang|ang|\u00fee}} is used, often preceded by (or replaced by) the appropriate form of the article/demonstrative {{lang|ang|se}}.\n\n==Orthography==\n{{Anchor|alphabet}}\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon runes|Old English Latin alphabet}}\n[[File:Anglosaxonrunes.svg|upright=1.13|thumb|The [[runic alphabet]] used to write Old English before the introduction of the [[Latin alphabet]]]]\n\nOld English was first written in [[runic alphabet|runes]], using the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]] \u2013 a rune set derived from the Germanic 24-character [[elder futhark]], extended by five more runes used to represent Anglo-Saxon vowel sounds, and sometimes by several more additional characters. From around the 8th century, the runic system came to be supplanted by a (minuscule) [[half-uncial]] script of the [[Latin alphabet]] introduced by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Christian]] missionaries.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |year=1987 |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-26438-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys/page/203 203]}}</ref> This was replaced by [[Insular script]], a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental [[Carolingian minuscule]] (also known as ''Caroline'') replaced the insular.\n\nThe Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters {{angbr|j}} and {{angbr|w}}, and there was no {{angbr|v}} as distinct from {{angbr|u}}; moreover native Old English spellings did not use {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|q}} or {{angbr|z}}. The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by four more: {{angbr|[[\u00e6]]}} ({{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, modern ''ash'') and {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00f0}}}} ({{lang|ang|\u00f0\u00e6t}}, now called [[eth (letter)|eth]] or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u00fe}}}} and [[wynn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}}, which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s, representing a single sound. Also used was the [[Tironian note]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u204a}}}} (a character similar to the digit 7) for the [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''and''. A common [[scribal abbreviation]] was a [[thorn with stroke|thorn with a stroke]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\ua765}}}}, which was used for the pronoun {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u00e6t}}. [[Macron (diacritic)|Macron]]s over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress, or as abbreviations for a following ''m'' or ''n''.<ref>C.M. Millward, Mary Hayes, ''A Biography of the English Language'', Cengage Learning 2011, p. 96.</ref><ref>Stephen Pollington, ''First Steps in Old English'', Anglo-Saxon Books 1997, p. 138.</ref>\n\nModern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions. The modern forms of Latin letters are used, including {{angbr|g}} in place of the [[insular G]], {{angle bracket|s}} for [[long S]], and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|r}}. Macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (In some older editions an [[acute accent]] mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|c}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|g}}}} by placing dots above the palatals: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u010b}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u0121}}}}. The letter wynn {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}} is usually replaced with {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|w}}}}, but {{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, eth and thorn are normally retained (except when eth is replaced by thorn).\n\nIn contrast with [[English orthography|Modern English orthography]], that of Old English was reasonably [[regular spelling|regular]], with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and [[phoneme]]s. There were not usually any [[silent letter]]s\u2014in the word ''cniht'', for example, both the {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|h}} were pronounced, unlike the {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|gh}} in the modern ''knight''.

What they contained, how important they were for an understanding of literature before the Conquest, we have no means of knowing: the scant catalogues of monastic libraries do not help us, and there are no references in extant works to other compositions....How incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, all extant Anglo-Saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts.}}\n\nSome of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are ''[[Beowulf]]'', an [[epic poem]]; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a record of early English history; the [[Franks Casket]], an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and [[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]], a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as [[Bede]] and [[C\u00e6dmon]]. C\u00e6dmon, the earliest English poet we know by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===''Beowulf''===\nThe first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic ''[[Beowulf]]'', a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of Old English.<ref name=\":2\" /> This passage describes how [[Hrothgar]]'s legendary ancestor [[Scyld]] was found as a baby, washed ashore, and adopted by a noble family. The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order. As such, it is not typical of Old English prose. The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem.\n\nThe words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context. Notice how ''what'' is used by the poet where a word like ''lo'' or ''behold'' would be expected. This usage is similar to ''what-ho!'', both an expression of surprise and a call to attention.\n\nEnglish poetry is based on stress and alliteration. In alliteration, the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word, as with {{lang|ang|'''G'''\u0101r-Dena}} and {{lang|ang|'''\u0121'''e\u0101r-dagum}}.

At first these were often [[marginalia|marginal]] or [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] glosses, but soon came to be gathered into word-lists such as the [[\u00c9pinal-Erfurt glossary|\u00c9pinal-Erfurt]], [[Leiden Glossary|Leiden]] and [[Corpus Glossary|Corpus]] Glossaries. Over time, these word-lists were consolidated and alphabeticised to create extensive Latin-Old English glossaries with some of the character of [[dictionary|dictionaries]], such as the [[Cleopatra Glossaries]], the [[Harley Glossary]] and the [[Brussels Glossary]].<ref>Patrizia Lendinara, \u2018Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries: An Introduction\u2019, in Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries (Aldershot: Variorum, 1999), pp. 1\u201326.</ref> In some cases, the material in these glossaries continued to be circulated and updated in [[Middle English]] glossaries, such as the [[Durham Plant-Name Glossary]] and the [[Laud Herbal Glossary]].<ref>''Das Durhamer Pflanzenglossar: lateinisch und altenglish'', ed. by Bogislav von Lindheim, Beitr\u00e4ge zur englischen Philologie, 35 (Bochum-Langendreer: Poppinghaus, 1941).</ref>\n\nOld English lexicography was revived in the early modern period, drawing heavily on Anglo-Saxons' own glossaries. The major publication at this time was [[William Somner]]'s ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum''.<ref>William Somner, ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum'', English Linguistics 1500\u20131800 (A Collection of Facsimile Reprints), 247 (Menston: The Scholar Press, 1970).</ref> The next substantial Old English dictionary was [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' of 1838.\n\n===Modern===\nIn modern scholarship, the following dictionaries remain current:\n\n* [[Angus Cameron (academic)|Cameron, Angus]], et al.

The city is located on [[Lake Catemaco]], with the municipality stretching north to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Catemaco is a tourist destination with its main attractions being the lake, remnants of the region's rainforest and a tradition of sorcery/witchcraft that has its roots in the pre Hispanic period and mostly practiced by men.  This tradition is well known in Mexico and attracts clients from various walks of life, including businessmen and national level politicians. Catemaco holds an annual event in March dedicated to sorcery which can draw up to 5,000 visitors.\n\n==The city==\n[[File:RoadAlongLakeCatemaco.JPG|left|thumb|Breakwater/boardwalk along Lake Catemaco]]\nThe city of Catemaco is located in southern Veracruz, about 160&nbsp;km from the [[Veracruz, Veracruz|port of Veracruz]] and 220&nbsp;km from the state capital of [[Xalapa]].<ref name=semar>{{cite web |title= Catemaco, Veracruz |publisher=SEMAR |url= http://digaohm.semar.gob.mx/cuestionarios/cnarioCatemaco.pdf|accessdate=May 3, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=encmuc>{{cite web |work=Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de M\u00e9xico Estado de Veracruz-Llave |title=Catemaco |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM30veracruz/index.html |accessdate=May 3, 2014 }}</ref> It is located inland, extending 2.5im along the shore of Lake Catemaco, a large freshwater lake, which is one of the city's main tourist attractions, along with its cuisine and its tradition of sorcery.<ref name=semar/> Along the lake, the city has a 1.5&nbsp;km [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]/[[boardwalk]], which is frequently crowded with both visitors and vendors, especially those selling charms and a local freshwater snail called tegogolo.<ref name=semar/><ref name=rincones>{{cite book |title=Veracruz: Gu\u00eda para descubrir los encantos del estado |publisher=Editorial Oc\u00e9ano de M\u00e9xico |location=Mexico City |year=2010 |isbn=978-607-400-323-9 |pages=73\u201374}}</ref> The city's docks are located in the center of this area, classified as a fishing and tourism port by the federal government.

Veneration of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel|this version of the Virgin Mary]], the patroness of the municipality, began in the early colonial period, as a substitute for the local worship of [[Chalchiuhtlicue]], the goddess of water and fishermen.<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=eanaya>{{cite news  |author=Edgar Anaya|title= Catemaco: El embrujo de un lago |newspaper=El Norte |date=August 12, 2001 |page= 1}}</ref> This basilica contains an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which has been credited with miracles.<ref name=semar/> It is rivaled in devotion only by a shrine on an island in Lake Catemaco called El Tegal, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared.<ref name=eanaya/> The current structure was begun in 1799 but was not finished until 1961.<ref name=semar/> The church is a combination of [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] with a cupola 21 meters high. The surrounding stained glass windows depict the lives of Jesus and Mary.<ref name=rincones/> Each year, Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated at this basilica, a launching of boats in procession to Agaltepec Island and traditional music including [[danz\u00f3n]], [[Son Jarocho]] and other tropical music, using guitars, violins, the [[vihuela]] and [[double bass]].<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=rincones/>\n\nOther landmarks in the city include the Statue of the Fisherman, the Torre del Reloj (Clock Tower), the Brizuela Absal\u00f3n House, the Gasca Blanco House and the Herrera Garc\u00eda House.<ref name=encmuc/> The Casa de los Tesoros is a large gift shop, which offers [[bagel]]s, [[bizcocho]]s and [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]].<ref name=semar/>\n\nThere is a bus station principally connecting the city with the ports of Veracruz and [[Coatzacoalcos]].<ref name=semar/>\n\n==The \u201cwitches\u201d of Catemaco==\n[[File:ShamanReunionCatemaco4.JPG|thumb|300px|Grounds where the annual \"brujo\" reunion is held in Catemaco]]\nCatemaco is known in Mexico for its community of \u201c''brujos''\", which can be translated as 'witches' or 'sorcerers', as most are men.<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=jbudd>{{cite news  |author=Jim Budd|title= Viajando Ligero/ El misterioso Catemaco |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 27, 2002 |page=5 }}</ref> The history of magical practices here extends back to the pre-Hispanic period and may have survived because of its relative isolation,<ref name=rincones/><ref name=mexconnect>{{cite web |author=Diodora Bucur |title= Catemaco: Mexico's cradle of sorcery and witchcraft: Veracruz town hosts the annual National Congress of Sorcerers |date=March 3, 2010 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3605-catemaco-mexico-s-cradle-of-sorcery-and-witchcraft |accessdate=May 3, 2014 }}</ref> but Lake Catemaco is said to emit a kind of energy, along with the Mono Blanco Mountain that rises above it.<ref name=jbudd/>\n\nThese magical practices are an uneasy mix of Catholic rite, especially the invocation of saints and pre-Hispanic beliefs and rituals.<ref name=mexconnect/> Though many tourists are simply amused by the kitschy T-shirts of witches or other souvenirs or attractions, some do take the practice seriously. There are practitioners of both \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d magic, with the white version being more acceptable. Those who practice the black version charge more.<ref name=jbudd/>\n\nSorcery is one of the main attractions of Catemaco. The belief in magical practices has attracted people from all walks of life, from waiters and taxi drivers to national-level politicians. Veracruz governor [[Fidel Herrera Beltr\u00e1n]] even pushed for a national school for sorcery in Catemaco, without success and is a regular at the annual event. Visitors usually seek limpias (ritual cleansings), healing or something to give them an edge in business.<ref name=jbudd/><ref name=mexconnect/> These magical practices have also migrated out of the Catemaco area as residents move to other places such as [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] to work.<ref name=hnajera>{{cite news  |author=Horacio N\u00e1jera |title= Tiene Catemaco 'sucursal' en Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey |date=March 28, 2007 |page=13}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the sorcery is a main attraction, it is not promoted as part of Halloween or [[Day of the Dead]] .<ref name=jbudd/> The main event for practitioners is the annual Congreso Nacional de Brujos de Catemaco (officially called the Ritos, Ceremonias y Artesan\u00edas M\u00e1gica because of objections from the Catholic Church) .<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=mexconnect/> The main event is the opening, on the first Friday of March. This begins with a \u201cblack mass\u201d on the edge of Lake Catemaco by the \u201cbrujo mayor\u201d (loosely translated as \u201chigh witch or sorcerer\u201d), which attracts up to 5,000 people. The event was founded in the 1970s by former brujo mayor Gonzalo Aguirre and today attracts around 200 shamans, healers ([[curandero]]s), herbalists, psychics and fortune tellers. It also brings in as much as three million [[Mexican peso|pesos]] to the local economy.<ref name=mexconnect/>\n\nThe popularity of the brujos and the event has created problems as well. Many con artists have taken advantage of the situation, making the finding of genuine practitioners difficult.<ref name=mexconnect/><ref name=levgarcia>{{cite news  |author=Lev Garcia|title= Hacen de Catemaco un campo de batalla |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 14, 2004 |page=22}}</ref> There have been disputes among the practitioners over clients, tourism, and who leads the rites at the annual gathering. There has also been controversy related to those who sacrifice animals or petition [[Santa Muerte]] or the Devil.<ref name=levgarcia/>\n\n==History==\nIn the early pre Hispanic period, the area was dominated by the [[Olmec]]s,<ref name=eanaya/> but the name is derived from Nahuatl, meaning \u201cplace of the burned houses.\u201d This name is probably in reference to an eruption of the San Martin Volcano.<ref name=encmuc/>\n\nFrom the 16th century, the area was part of the province of [[Santiago Tuxtla]], which became a municipality after Independence. The city itself was founded in 1774. In 1881, it officially became a town and in 1966 declared a city.<ref name=encmuc/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Catemaco,

({{IPA-es|kate'mako|lang|Catemaco1.ogg}}) is a city in [[Catemaco Municipality]] located in the south of the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]]. The city is located on [[Lake Catemaco]], with the municipality stretching north to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Catemaco is a tourist destination with its main attractions being the lake, remnants of the region\u2019s rainforest and a tradition of sorcery/witchcraft that has its roots in the pre Hispanic period and mostly practiced by men.  This tradition is well known in Mexico and attracts clients from various walks of life, including businessmen and national level politicians. Catemaco holds an annual event in March dedicated to sorcery which can draw up to 5,000 visitors.\n\n==The city==\n[[File:RoadAlongLakeCatemaco.JPG|left|thumb|Breakwater/boardwalk along Lake Catemaco]]\nThe city of Catemaco is located in southern Veracruz, about 160&nbsp;km from the [[Veracruz, Veracruz|port of Veracruz]] and 220&nbsp;km from the state capital of [[Xalapa]].<ref name=semar>{{cite web |title= Catemaco, Veracruz |publisher=SEMAR |url= http://digaohm.semar.gob.mx/cuestionarios/cnarioCatemaco.pdf|accessdate=May 3, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=encmuc>{{cite web |work=Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de M\u00e9xico Estado de Veracruz-Llave |title=Catemaco |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM30veracruz/index.html |accessdate=May 3, 2014 }}</ref> It is located inland, extending 2.5im along the shore of Lake Catemaco, a large freshwater lake, which is one of the city\u2019s main tourist attractions, along with its cuisine and its tradition of sorcery.<ref name=semar/> Along the lake, the city has a 1.5&nbsp;km [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]/[[boardwalk]], which is frequently crowded with both visitors and vendors, especially those selling charms and a local freshwater snail called tegogolo.<ref name=semar/><ref name=rincones>{{cite book |title=Veracruz: Gu\u00eda para descubrir los encantos del estado |publisher=Editorial Oc\u00e9ano de M\u00e9xico |location=Mexico City |year=2010 |isbn=978-607-400-323-9 |pages=73\u201374}}</ref> The city\u2019s docks are located in the center of this area, classified as a fishing and tourism port by the federal government.

Those who practice the black version charge more.<ref name=jbudd/>\n\nSorcery is one of the main attractions of Catemaco. The belief in magical practices has attracted people from all walks of life, from waiters and taxi drivers to national-level politicians. Veracruz governor [[Fidel Herrera Beltr\u00e1n]] even pushed for a national school for sorcery in Catemaco, without success and is a regular at the annual event. Visitors usually seek limpias (ritual cleansings), healing or something to give them an edge in business.<ref name=jbudd/><ref name=mexconnect/> These magical practices have also migrated out of the Catemaco area as residents move to other places such as [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] to work.<ref name=hnajera>{{cite news  |author=Horacio N\u00e1jera |title= Tiene Catemaco 'sucursal' en Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey |date=March 28, 2007 |page=13}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the sorcery is a main attraction, it is not promoted as part of Halloween or [[Day of the Dead]] .<ref name=jbudd/> The main event for practitioners is the annual Congreso Nacional de Brujos de Catemaco (officially called the Ritos, Ceremonias y Artesan\u00edas M\u00e1gica because of objections from the Catholic Church) .<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=mexconnect/> The main event is the opening, on the first Friday of March. This begins with a \u201cblack mass\u201d on the edge of Lake Catemaco by the \u201cbrujo mayor\u201d (loosely translated as \u201chigh witch or sorcerer\u201d), which attracts up to 5,000 people. The event was founded in the 1970s by former brujo mayor Gonzalo Aguirre and today attracts around 200 shamans, healers ([[curandero]]s), herbalists, psychics and fortune tellers. It also brings in as much as three million [[Mexican peso|pesos]] to the local economy.<ref name=mexconnect/>\n\nThe popularity of the brujos and the event has created problems as well. Many con artists have taken advantage of the situation, making the finding of genuine practitioners difficult.<ref name=mexconnect/><ref name=levgarcia>{{cite news  |author=Lev Garcia|title= Hacen de Catemaco un campo de batalla |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 14, 2004 |page=22}}</ref> There have been disputes among the practitioners over clients, tourism, and who leads the rites at the annual gathering.

The city itself was founded in 1774.

Workers from the Brazilian Northeast started settling around the station. Local farmers started selling their products at the new market. Though, the new marketplace Castanhal was founded. The Bragan\u00e7a railway was shut down in 1964 and the rails were removed. The government of the state of Par\u00e1 gave Castanhal the nickname \"cidade modelo\" (Model Town).\nIn 2004, Pope John Paul II erected the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Castanhal|diocese of Castanhal]], which is subordinated as a suffragan diocese to the archdiocese of Bel\u00e9m, Par\u00e1.\n\n== Education ==\nCastanhal has become a regional center for education in the state of Par\u00e1.

Workers from the Brazilian Northeast started settling around the station. Local farmers started selling their products at the new market. Though, the new marketplace Castanhal was founded. The Bragan\u00e7a railway was shut down in 1964 and the rails were removed. The government of the state of Par\u00e1 gave Castanhal the nickname \"cidade modelo\" (Model Town).\nIn 2004, Pope John Paul II erected the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Castanhal|diocese of Castanhal]], which is subordinated as a suffragan diocese to the archdiocese of Bel\u00e9m, Par\u00e1.\n\n== Education ==\nCastanhal has become a regional center for education in the state of Par\u00e1.

The total length of the walls is estimated at 6 km and the maximum height was 10 m, and width 3-5 m. The city had two main entrances; east and west. The east gate of Kassope is entered today by tourists and protected by a large metal gate, which rescued the slot on the rock [6] . Kassope had some minor gates. A small western gate survives today in good condition, and looks like a stone tunnel because it is covered with a megalithic arch. The Macedonian Tomb is visible on the right.\n\n===The North Stoa===\nConstructed in the period of the Public of Epirus (234 / 3-168 BC) the Stoa has a polygonal stone shelf and superstructure was brick with wooden frames. The north side is reinforced with 17 buttresses. Inside there was a colonnade with 13 Ionic columns. In front of the North Portico revealed 21 stone pedestals with inscriptions of 3rd-2nd century BC The position of the market and the public space of Kassope had direct contact with the main road and the gate of the wall, position favouring an easy access of rural residents in the area of the Commonwealth of Epirus operation. It was men gathering place, covered 100x80m area = 8.000 m2 and could accommodate hundreds of people.[6]\n\n===The West Lodge===\nLocated on the west side of the market, between the temple and the Prytaneion. It consists of a peristyle court with 3 x 4 Doric columns . Around the courtyard, arranged six spaces. To the east there was gallery with 13 Doric columns. Temple - Sanctuary is in contact with the West Gallery, in the east. In the courtyard of this is the altar of Venus. The Prytaneion was a building about 8 rooms on the west side of the city and in contact with the West Gallery. [6] .\n\n===The Katagogeion===\nThe Katagogeion was a public building dimensions 33 x 30,3 m., With patio, two floors on three sides and the fourth storey to hiding the sun and probably functioned as a hostel, ancient hotel. Another view says that probably they were a kind of shopping mall. A similar building was in ancient Olympia . It dates to around 400-350 BC It consists of a rectangular central courtyard (Aithrion, atrium) 14x12 m dimensions, surrounded by four galleries with 7 x 8 Octagonal columns with Doric capitals . Behind the arcades are lined spaces which communicate with each other, but only with the galleries.There was a second floor with balcony and communication was by a wooden staircase, whose stone pedestals were rescued. Under the Hellenistic dive was oldest building of the 4th century BC The 31 bedrooms of Katagogeiou was 18 on the ground floor and 13 on the upper deck. The bricks of the tile roof are preserved and must be constructed in neighboring Amvrakia which had workshops ceramics . [6] .\n\n===The Little Theatre, or Odeon or Bouleuterion===\nThe Odeon is located in the southeastern part of the city and is the first monument we just enter in the city, left. It dates to the 3rd century BC It seems to be carved on a rock, with construction of stone stands on this. Its capacity is about 300-500 people and suggested that seats 2,500 [12] is excessive. The Conservatory was housed, the roof rested on square surrounding wall and the dimensions of the stage was 15.4 x 7,60 m. Using Conservatory apparently was music and literary events, but may be used as the Chamber of Public of Epirus. Front Conservatory ruins an altar, possibly of Apollo. Department of rock underlying the Conservatory has collapsed and there were placed guardrail [6] .\n\n===The Grand Theatre===\nLocated in the ruined hill northwest of Kassope. Constructed in the 3rd century BC and had a capacity of about 2,500 people, according to some authors could accommodate 6,000 people. It was the largest of a total of two theaters that existed in the city. The other, called the Conservatory of distinction. The large theater due to natural decay is now destroyed and almost not open, but clearly at a distance 200 m. Landslides rocks have led to some of them in the theater. One rock weighing 30 tons was stopped in the middle of the stage [6] .\n\n===The Macedonian Tomb===\nThis Mausoleum, known from old, located southwest, the end of the citadel and was called \"Vasilospito\".

The visitor first goes down a worn stairs and enters a corridor 10,5 X 1,44 m. After entering the main deck 3,02 x 2,29 x 3,30m which is plastered and painted with wear. The ceiling is vaulted from carved stone and has a hole from looters [6] . The tomb was found empty because it was looted in the past. It is certain that it belonged to someone important noble Kassope, possibly Macedonian ally [13] . Another view says that this is probably Memorial founder of the city [14] .\n\n===The sanctuary of Aphrodite===\nIts ruins are located outside the city Kassope next to the road leading to Zalogo, 200m east of that.

{"title_page": "History of Celtic F.C. (1994\u2013present)", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=March 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Celtic park 5.jpg|thumb|right|170px]]\n[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic Football Club]] has always competed in the highest level of [[football in Scotland]], currently the [[Scottish Premiership]]. The club was constituted in 1887, and played its first game in 1888. Celtic play their home games at [[Celtic Park]] having moved there in 1892 from their original ground nearby.\n\nBy 1994, Celtic had endured several years of decline and were encountering difficulties on and off the park.  Expatriate businessman [[Fergus McCann]] wrested control of the club from the family dynasties that had run Celtic since its founding.  The club was reconstituted as a PLC and floated on the stock market, raising \u00a314&nbsp;million.

The club was constituted in 1887, and played its first game in 1888. Celtic play their home games at [[Celtic Park]] having moved there in 1892 from their original ground nearby.\n\nBy 1994, Celtic had endured several years of decline and were encountering difficulties on and off the park.  Expatriate businessman [[Fergus McCann]] wrested control of the club from the family dynasties that had run Celtic since its founding.  The club was reconstituted as a PLC and floated on the stock market, raising \u00a314&nbsp;million.  The finance provided funding for the rebuilding of Celtic Park into a 60,000 all-seated stadium, the largest football stadium in Scotland.\n\nThe team improved over the years that followed and in 1998 won the league title, their first championship success in ten years. The arrival of [[Martin O'Neill]] as manager in 2000 saw the club become one of two dominant forces in Scotland, winning three league titles in five years and reaching the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final in 2003]]. In [[2005\u201306 in Scottish football|2005\u201306]], Celtic's home games attracted an average attendance of 58,149, placing Celtic at the time behind only [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in terms of highest average attendance for any football club in the United Kingdom.\n\nCeltic are currently managed by [[Neil Lennon]], who was appointed on a permanent basis after his Scottish Cup victory over Hearts in May 2019, having earlier in the season taken over on a caretaker basis following [[Brendan Rodgers]]' departure from the club.\n\n==The Fergus McCann era (1994\u20131999)==\nThe [[Bank of Scotland]] informed Celtic on 3 March 1994 that it was calling in [[Receivership|receivers]] as a result of the club exceeding a \u00a35&nbsp;million [[overdraft]].<ref name=\"ssc1\">{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Hugh|title=The Saving of Celtic, Part One: David Low|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/the-saving-of-celtic-part-one-david-low.23570438|work=Herald Scotland|accessdate=1 March 2014|date=1 March 2014}}</ref> Expatriate businessman [[Fergus McCann]], however, wrested control of the club from the family dynasties which had controlled Celtic since its founding,<ref name=\"ssc1\" /> purchasing the club for a reported \u00a39&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s9_2|title=Celtic FC Team Profile|publisher=Scottish Premier League|accessdate=23 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314003846/http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s9_2|archive-date=14 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  According to media reports, McCann took over the club minutes before it was to be declared [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]].<ref name=\"ssc1\" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/celtic/6469284/Celtic-chairman-John-Reid-pledges-to-keep-the-clubs-finances-under-control.html |title=Celtic chairman John Reid pledges to keep the club's finances under control |work=The Telegraph |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2011 |first=Roddy |last=Forsyth}}</ref><ref name=\"Celticseer\">{{cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/spl/Fergus-the-Celtic-seer.2507591.jp |title=Fergus the Celtic seer |work=The Scotsman |date=29 February 2004 |accessdate =23 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/new-celtic-team-takes-over-three-directors-ousted-as-17-8m-rescue-package-pledged-the-new-team-takes-over-with-a-promise-1.717089 |title= New Celtic team takes over.
