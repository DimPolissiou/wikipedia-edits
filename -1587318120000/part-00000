At the core of all of the communication is the idea of health and the emphasis of health. The goal of health communication research is to identify and provide better and more effective communication strategies that will improve the overall health of society. (Atkin & Silk, page 489)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" />\n\n==Research==\nThere are many purposes and reasons why health communication research is important and how it betters the health care field. The training programs of Health Care Professionals, or HCP, can be adapted and developed based on health communication research. (Atkin & Silk, 495)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" /> Due to there being a diverse culture that makes up the group of patients within the health care field, communication to other cultures has been taught and has been made a focus in health care training classes. Research suggests that nonverbal and verbal communication between health care professionals and patient can lead to improved patient outcomes{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}. According to Atkin and Silk on page 496<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" /> some health care facilities, like hospitals are providing training and education materials to patients. The goal of hospitals doing this is to allow for patients to have a better outcome due to better communication skills.\nOver the years, there has been much research done on health communication. For example, researchers want to know if people are more effectively motivated by a positive message versus a negative message. Researchers examine ideas like, are people better motivated by ideas of wealth and safety or an idea of illness and death. Researchers are examining which dimensions of persuasive incentives are most influential: physical health versus economic, versus psychological, versus moral, versus social. (Atkin & Silk, 497)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" />\nImpact of the Health Campaign-After research has been conducted and analyzed on the effects of health communication, it can be concluded that a health communication campaign that is requiring a behavior change causes the desired behavior change in about 7%-10%  or more in the people who are in the campaign site than those who are in the control group. Also, the effects are stronger for adoption of a new behavior than cessation of a current behavior, about 12% higher.\n\nWhen assessing how affective a health campaign is, the key determinant is the degree of audience reception, the quality and quantity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the larger communication environment. It is possible that an audience can be more receptive to some messages than others. The media channel and how the message is reached by the audience can affect the effectiveness of the health campaign. (Atkin & Silk, page 498)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" />\n\nThe efforts and effects of health messages and communication are often counter affected by alcohol and tobacco commercials. The advertisement for these items is often made to be glamorous and will contradict what was said in the health campaign. This can lead to the efforts of the health communication seem to be pointless.\n\n==Training==\nHealth [[communication professionals]] are specifically trained in methods and strategies for effective communication of [[public health]] messages, with qualifications in research, strategic development, and evaluating effectiveness.<ref name=\"EHS\"/> Health communication is taught in [[Master's degree|master's]] and doctoral programs.<ref name=\"HD\"/><ref name=TE>{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Timothy|author2=James N.

Practitioners are pragmatic and draw from social-scientific scholarship, theories from the humanities, and professional fields such as education, management, law and marketing (Maibach 2008). Professionals trained in health communication encounter a wide range of employment opportunities spanning between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and have the opportunity for a large amount of career mobility.<ref name=\"TE\"/> Examples of jobs in each of these categories include federal, state, and local health departments in the public sector, Pharmaceutical companies and large corporations in the private sector, and various non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[American Heart Association]] in the volunteer sector.\n\n==Overview==\n[[International Communication Association]] officially recognized health communication in 1975; in 1997, the [[American Public Health Association]] categorised health communication as a discipline of [[Public health|Public Health]] Education and Health Promotion.<ref name=\"HD\"/>\n\nCareers in the field of health communication range widely between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and professionals of health communication are distinctively trained to conduct communication research, develop successful and repeatable campaigns for health promotion and advocacy, and to evaluate how effective these strategies have been for future campaigns.<ref name=\"EHS\"/>\n\nClear communication is essential to successful [[public health]] practice at every level of the [[ecological model]]: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, organizational, and societal. In each instance of health communication, there must be careful deliberation concerning the appropriate channel for messages to best reach the target audience, ranging from face-to-face interactions to television, Internet, and other forms of [[mass media]].<ref name=HTB>{{cite journal|last=Parvis|first=Leo|title=How to Benefit From Health Communication|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|date=Jul\u2013Aug 2002|volume=65|issue=1|page=41}}</ref> The recent explosion of new [[Internet]] communication technologies, particularly through the development of health websites (such as [[MedlinePlus]], Healthfinder, and [[WebMD]]), online support groups (such as the Association for Cancer Online Resources), web portals, tailored information systems, telehealth programs, electronic health records, [[social networking]], and [[mobile devices]] (cell phones, PDAs, etc.) means that the potential media are ever changing.\n\nThe social and cultural contexts in which health communication occurs are also widely diverse and can include (but are not limited to) homes, schools, doctor's offices, and workplaces, and messages must consider the variant levels of health literacy and education of their audience, as well as demographics, values, socioeconomic issues, and many other factors that may influence effective communication.<ref name=\"EHS\"/>\n\n=== Critical Health Communication ===\nCritical Health Communication refers to scholarship that interrogates \"how meanings and enactments of health are tied to issues of power through the systematic construction and maintenance of inequalities.\"<ref name=\"frontiersin.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=\"Doing\" Critical Health Communication.

Unlike much mainstream Health Communication, most Critical Health Communication holds that simply circulating better quality, or more visible message about health is not enough to meaningfully influence health outcomes or correct health care disparities. The first comprehensive review of Critical Health Communication was published in 2008,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zoller|first=Heather M.|last2=Kline|first2=Kimberly N.|date=January 2008|title=Theoretical Contributions of Interpretive and Critical Research in Health Communication|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=89\u2013135|doi=10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|issn=2380-8985}}</ref> and since then the volume of Health Communication research taking a critical approach has steadily increased.\n\n==Strategies and methods==\nTailoring a health message is one strategy for persuasive health communication.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Noar|first=Seth M. |author2=Christina N.

Meta-analytic review of tailored print health behavior change interventions.}}</ref> For messages of health communication to reach selected audiences accurately and quickly, health communication professionals must assemble a collection of superior and audience appropriate information that target population segments. Understanding the audience for the information is critical to effective delivery.\n\nCommunication is an enigma that is detrimental to the healthcare world and to the resulting health of a patient. Communication is an activity that involves oral speech, voice, tone, nonverbal body language, listening and more. It is a process for a mutual understanding to come at hand during interpersonal connections. A patient's communication with their healthcare team and vice versa, affects the outcome of their health. Strong, clear, and positive relationships with physicians can chronically improve and increase the condition of a certain patient. Through two approaches, the biomedical model and the biopsychosocial model; this can be successfully achieved. Evidence has shown that communication and its traditions have altered throughout the years. With the use of many new discoveries and the changes within our technology market, communication has severely improved and become instantaneous.\n\nCommunicators need to continually synthesize knowledge from a range of other scholarly disciplines including marketing, psychology, and behavioural sciences.<ref name=\"EHS\"/> Once this information has been collected, professionals can choose from a variety of methods and strategies of communication that they believe would best convey their message. These methods include [[Advocacy|campaigns]], entertainment advocacy, media advocacy, new technologies, and interpersonal communication.<ref name=\"HD\"/>\n\n===Campaigns===\nHealth Communication campaigns are arguably the most utilized and effective method for spreading [[public health]] messages, especially in endorsing disease prevention (e.g. [[cancer]], [[HIV/AIDS]]) and in general health promotion and wellness (e.g. [[family planning]], [[reproductive health]]).<ref name=\"HTB\"/> The [[Institute of Medicine]] argues that health communication campaigns tend to organize their message for a diverse audience in one of three ways:<ref name=\"HD\"/>\n* By catering to the common denominator within the audience\n* By creating one central message and then later making systematic alterations in order to better reach a certain audience segment, while retaining the same central message\n* By creating distinctly different messages for different audience segments\nBoth the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and scholars of health communication emphasize the importance of [[strategic planning]] throughout a campaign.  This includes a variety of steps to ensure a well-developed message is being communicated:<ref name=\"CDC\"/>\n* Reviewing background information to define what the problem is and who is affected by the problem\n* Setting communication objectives and proposing a plan to meet the wanted outcome\n* Analyze the target audience by determining interests, attitudes, behaviors, benefits, and barriers\n* Select channels and materials for communication in relation to what will most effectively reach audiences\n* Develop and pretest message concepts to determine understanding, acceptance, and reaction to the message\n* Implement communication with selected audience and monitor exposures and reactions to the message\n* Assess the outcome and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the campaign, noting if changes need to be made\n\n====Historical campaigns====\n\n=====American smallpox epidemic=====\nIn 1721, health communication was used to mitigate the smallpox epidemic in Boston. Cotton Mather, a political leader, used pamphlets and speeches to promote inoculation of smallpox.Alcohol abuse has been a problem within society for about as long as alcohol has been around. In the 19th century, the Women's Christian Temperance Union led a movement against alcohol abuse. They utilized mass communication to communicate the desired message. News papers and magazines allowed for the promotion of the anti-alcohol movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-cotton-mather-fought-smallpox|title=When Cotton Mather Fought The Smallpox {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref>\n\n=====Cardiovascular disease=====\nThree-community study and the five-city project were experimental campaigns to inform middle-aged men about the causes of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Health messages were communicated via television, radio, newspaper, cookbooks, booklets, and bus cards. The three \"communities\" comprised three experimental communication strategies: a media-only campaign, a media campaign supplemented with face-to-face communication, and a no-intervention [[control group]]. The experimented revealed that after one year, the most informed at-risk men were those in the second experimental group: they men consumed the media campaign and were attended by a [[health care provider]].\n\n===Communication channels===\n\n====Entertainment media====\nUsing the entertainment industry as a platform for advocating health information and education is a communication strategy that has become increasingly popular. The most utilized strategy is for health communication professionals to create partnerships with storyline creators so that public health information can be incorporated into within the plot of a television show. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has formed a strong partnership with Hollywood, Health, and Society, at the [[University of Southern California]] [[Norman Lear Center]] to continue to produce new storylines on television and in film studios that will help to promote public health information.<ref name=\"CDC\"/> Some of the resources provided with this partnership include comprehensive \"tip sheets\" to provide writers with easy to access and trustworthy information on health issues, and meetings and panels to discuss new information and resources. Some of the most notable examples of this method of communication in recent years have been with the films ''Contagion'' and ''I Am Legend'' in understanding the spread of disease, ''NBC's'' series ''Parenthood'' in Asperger's Syndrome, and with the ''CW's'' series ''90210'' and spreading cancer awareness. More recently, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] focused specifically on health films have been organised by the [[American Public Health Association]], [[International Health Film Festival|the International Health Film Festival]], the Global Health Film Initiative of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Public Health Film Society]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1757913915619120| pmid=26702114|title = Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival| journal=Perspectives in Public Health| volume=136| issue=1| pages=23\u201324|year = 2016|last1 = Botchway|first1 = Stella| last2=Hoang| first2=Uy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.apha.org/events-and-meetings/annual/schedule/film-festival | title=The APHA Global Public Health Film Festival}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalhealthfilm.org/ | title=Global Health Film &#124; Home}}</ref><ref name=\"academic.oup.com\">{{Cite web | doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdx022| pmid=28369436| title=First International Public Health Film Competition 2016\u2014reflections on the development and use of competition judging criteria| journal=Journal of Public Health| volume=40| pages=169\u2013174| year=2018| last1=Hoang| first1=U.| last2=Luna| first2=P.| last3=Russell| first3=P.| last4=Bergonzi-King| first4=L.| last5=Ashton| first5=J.| last6=McCarthy| first6=C.| last7=Donovan| first7=H.| last8=Inman| first8=P.| last9=Seminog| first9=O.| last10=Botchway| first10=S.}}</ref>\n\nWriters and storyline developers have an increased motivation to continue to incorporate public health information into their scripts with the creation of the Sentinel for Health Awards in 2000, which honors storylines that effectively promote health topics and audience awareness of [[public health]] issues.<ref name=\"CDC\"/> Surveys conducted by [[Porter Novelli]] in 2001 reported many interesting statistics on the effectiveness of this strategy, such as that over half of regular prime time and daytime drama viewers have reported that they have learned something about health promotion or disease prevention from a TV show.<ref name=\"HD\"/> Amongst this data, minority groups are significantly represented with well over half of African American and Hispanic viewers stating that they had either taken some form of preventative action after hearing about a health issue on TV, or that a TV storyline helped them to provide vital health information to a friend or family member.\n\n====Direct marketing====\n{{Main|Social marketing}}\n[[File:Text messaging used to provide encouragement to quit smoking.png|thumb|Some health organizations manage text messaging services to help people avoid smoking]]\nMedia advocacy use strategic mass media tools combined with widespread organization in order to advocate for healthy public policies or lifestyles.<ref name=\"HD\"/> This can include the use of [[text messaging]] and [[email]] to spread messages from person to person, and using [[social networking]] venues to promote health information to a wide-ranging audience. As technologies expand, the platforms for health communication through media advocacy will undoubtedly expand as well.\n\n====Interpersonal communication====\nHealth communication relies on strong interpersonal communication in order to influence health decisions and behaviours. The most important of these relationships are the connection and interaction between an individual and their [[health care provider]] (e.g., physician, therapist, pharmacist) and an individual's social support system (family, friends, community). These connections can positively influence the individual's decision to make healthy choices.<ref name=\"HD\"/> Patients are more prone to listen when they feel invested emotionally into the situation. If they feel as if they understand what is being said, they are more prone to make objective decisions based on the information heard. Two of the most prominent areas of study in interpersonal health communication are the patient-centered and the relationship centered models of care.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Apker |first1=Julie |title=Communication in health organizations |date=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-745-64754-8 |edition=1}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nHealth communication has become essential in promoting the general [[public health]] in myriad situations. One of health communication's most important applications has been throughout major Environmental events (e.g. [[hurricanes]], [[flooding]], [[tornado]]s) and addressing the affected audience's questions and needs quickly and efficiently, keeping the protection of [[public health]] and the forefront of their message.<ref name=\"EHS\"/> Health communication professionals are constantly working to improve this type of risk communication in order to be prepared in the case of an emergency.\n\nAnother increasingly important application of health communication has been in reaching students in the college community. The National College Health Assessment has measured that 92.5% of college students reported being in \"good, very good, or excellent health\", however college students seem to battle serious problems with stress, depression, substance abuse, and a general lack of nutrition in comparison to other age groups and audiences.<ref name=CS>{{cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|author2=Nichole Egbert |author3=Evelyn Ho |title=Everyday Health Communication Experiences of College Students|journal=Journal of American College Health|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=427\u2013435|doi=10.3200/jach.56.44.427-436|pmid=18316288}}<!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--></ref> Professionals in health communication are actively striving for new ways to reach this at-risk audience in order to raise standards of [[public health]] in the college setting and to promote a healthier life style amongst students.\n\n==Challenges==\nThere are many challenges in communicating information about health to individuals. Some of the most essential issues have to do with the gap between individual health literacy and healthcare workers and institutions, as well as flaws in communicating health information through mass media.\n\n===Literacy-communication gap===\n{{Further|Health literacy}}\n\nOne problem that health communication seeks to address is the gap that has formed between health literacy and the use of health communication.<ref>{{cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 19|year=1996|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=187\u2013227|vauthors=Viswanath K, Finnegan JR |authorlink=The knowledge gap hypothesis: twenty-five years later|editor=Burleson, B|chapter=.}}</ref>  While the goal is that health communication will effectively ''lead'' to health literacy, issues such as the use of unexplained medical jargon, ill-formed messages, and often a general educational gap have created a disparity.

This issue may generate unwarranted panic amongst those who receive the messages and be an issue as technology continues to advance. An example of this may be observed in the ongoing distrust of vaccinations due to the publication of numerous messages that wrongly link the childhood measles-mumps-rubella ([[MMR vaccine|MMR]]) vaccination with the development and onset of [[Autism]].<ref name=MMR>{{cite news|last=Brauser|first=Deborah|title=Autism and MMR Vaccine Study an 'Elaborate Fraud,' Charger BMJ|date=January 6, 2001}}</ref> The speed with which this message spread due to new social networking technologies caused many parents to distrust vaccinations and therefore forgo having their children receive the vaccine.

PHS publication, 5-8. </ref> Then, the term was adopted by members of an interest group at ICA, [[International Communication Association]] in 1975. \nThe research of health communication surrounds the development of effective messages about health, the dissemination of health-related information through broadcast, print, and electronic media, and the role of inter personal relationships in health communities. At the core of all of the communication is the idea of health and the emphasis of health. The goal of health communication research is to identify and provide better and more effective communication strategies that will improve the overall health of society. (Atkin & Silk, page 489)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" />\n\n==Research==\nThere are many purposes and reasons why health communication research is important and how it betters the health care field. The training programs of Health Care Professionals, or HCP, can be adapted and developed based on health communication research. (Atkin & Silk, 495)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" /> Due to there being a diverse culture that makes up the group of patients within the health care field, communication to other cultures has been taught and has been made a focus in health care training classes. Research suggests that nonverbal and verbal communication between health care professionals and patient can lead to improved patient outcomes{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}. According to Atkin and Silk on page 496<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" /> some health care facilities, like hospitals are providing training and education materials to patients. The goal of hospitals doing this is to allow for patients to have a better outcome due to better communication skills.\nOver the years, there has been much research done on health communication. For example, researchers want to know if people are more effectively motivated by a positive message versus a negative message. Researchers examine ideas like, are people better motivated by ideas of wealth and safety or an idea of illness and death. Researchers are examining which dimensions of persuasive incentives are most influential: physical health versus economic, versus psychological, versus moral, versus social. (Atkin & Silk, 497)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" />\nImpact of the Health Campaign-After research has been conducted and analyzed on the effects of health communication, it can be concluded that a health communication campaign that is requiring a behavior change causes the desired behavior change in about 7%-10%  or more in the people who are in the campaign site than those who are in the control group. Also, the effects are stronger for adoption of a new behavior than cessation of a current behavior, about 12% higher.\n\nWhen assessing how affective a health campaign is, the key determinant is the degree of audience reception, the quality and quantity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the larger communication environment. It is possible that an audience can be more receptive to some messages than others. The media channel and how the message is reached by the audience can affect the effectiveness of the health campaign. (Atkin & Silk, page 498)<ref name=\"Atkin & Silk\" />\n\nThe efforts and effects of health messages and communication are often counter affected by alcohol and tobacco commercials. The advertisement for these items is often made to be glamorous and will contradict what was said in the health campaign. This can lead to the efforts of the health communication seem to be pointless.\n\n==Training==\nHealth [[communication professionals]] are specifically trained in methods and strategies for effective communication of [[public health]] messages, with qualifications in research, strategic development, and evaluating effectiveness.<ref name=\"EHS\"/> Health communication is taught in [[Master's degree|master's]] and doctoral programs.<ref name=\"HD\"/><ref name=TE>{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Timothy|author2=James N.

Practitioners are pragmatic and draw from social-scientific scholarship, theories from the humanities, and professional fields such as education, management, law and marketing (Maibach 2008). Professionals trained in health communication encounter a wide range of employment opportunities spanning between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and have the opportunity for a large amount of career mobility.<ref name=\"TE\"/> Examples of jobs in each of these categories include federal, state, and local health departments in the public sector, Pharmaceutical companies and large corporations in the private sector, and various non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[American Heart Association]] in the volunteer sector.\n\n==Overview==\n[[International Communication Association]] officially recognized health communication in 1975; in 1997, the [[American Public Health Association]] categorised health communication as a discipline of [[Public health|Public Health]] Education and Health Promotion.<ref name=\"HD\"/>\n\nCareers in the field of health communication range widely between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and professionals of health communication are distinctively trained to conduct communication research, develop successful and repeatable campaigns for health promotion and advocacy, and to evaluate how effective these strategies have been for future campaigns.<ref name=\"EHS\"/>\n\nClear communication is essential to successful [[public health]] practice at every level of the [[ecological model]]: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, organizational, and societal. In each instance of health communication, there must be careful deliberation concerning the appropriate channel for messages to best reach the target audience, ranging from face-to-face interactions to television, Internet, and other forms of [[mass media]].<ref name=HTB>{{cite journal|last=Parvis|first=Leo|title=How to Benefit From Health Communication|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|date=Jul\u2013Aug 2002|volume=65|issue=1|page=41}}</ref> The recent explosion of new [[Internet]] communication technologies, particularly through the development of health websites (such as [[MedlinePlus]], Healthfinder, and [[WebMD]]), online support groups (such as the Association for Cancer Online Resources), web portals, tailored information systems, telehealth programs, electronic health records, [[social networking]], and [[mobile devices]] (cell phones, PDAs, etc.) means that the potential media are ever changing.\n\nThe social and cultural contexts in which health communication occurs are also widely diverse and can include (but are not limited to) homes, schools, doctor's offices, and workplaces, and messages must consider the variant levels of health literacy and education of their audience, as well as demographics, values, socioeconomic issues, and many other factors that may influence effective communication.<ref name=\"EHS\"/>\n\n=== Critical Health Communication ===\nCritical Health Communication refers to scholarship that interrogates \"how meanings and enactments of health are tied to issues of power through the systematic construction and maintenance of inequalities.\"<ref name=\"frontiersin.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=\"Doing\" Critical Health Communication.

Unlike much mainstream Health Communication, most Critical Health Communication holds that simply circulating better quality, or more visible message about health is not enough to meaningfully influence health outcomes or correct health care disparities. The first comprehensive review of Critical Health Communication was published in 2008,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zoller|first=Heather M.|last2=Kline|first2=Kimberly N.|date=January 2008|title=Theoretical Contributions of Interpretive and Critical Research in Health Communication|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=89\u2013135|doi=10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|issn=2380-8985}}</ref> and since then the volume of Health Communication research taking a critical approach has steadily increased.\n\n==Strategies and methods==\nTailoring a health message is one strategy for persuasive health communication.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Noar|first=Seth M. |author2=Christina N.

Meta-analytic review of tailored print health behavior change interventions.}}</ref> For messages of health communication to reach selected audiences accurately and quickly, health communication professionals must assemble a collection of superior and audience appropriate information that target population segments. Understanding the audience for the information is critical to effective delivery.\n\nCommunication is an enigma that is detrimental to the healthcare world and to the resulting health of a patient. Communication is an activity that involves oral speech, voice, tone, nonverbal body language, listening and more. It is a process for a mutual understanding to come at hand during interpersonal connections. A patient's communication with their healthcare team and vice versa, affects the outcome of their health. Strong, clear, and positive relationships with physicians can chronically improve and increase the condition of a certain patient. Through two approaches, the biomedical model and the biopsychosocial model; this can be successfully achieved. Evidence has shown that communication and its traditions have altered throughout the years. With the use of many new discoveries and the changes within our technology market, communication has severely improved and become instantaneous.\n\nCommunicators need to continually synthesize knowledge from a range of other scholarly disciplines including marketing, psychology, and behavioural sciences.<ref name=\"EHS\"/> Once this information has been collected, professionals can choose from a variety of methods and strategies of communication that they believe would best convey their message. These methods include [[Advocacy|campaigns]], entertainment advocacy, media advocacy, new technologies, and interpersonal communication.<ref name=\"HD\"/>\n\n===Campaigns===\nHealth Communication campaigns are arguably the most utilized and effective method for spreading [[public health]] messages, especially in endorsing disease prevention (e.g. [[cancer]], [[HIV/AIDS]]) and in general health promotion and wellness (e.g. [[family planning]], [[reproductive health]]).<ref name=\"HTB\"/> The [[Institute of Medicine]] argues that health communication campaigns tend to organize their message for a diverse audience in one of three ways:<ref name=\"HD\"/>\n* By catering to the common denominator within the audience\n* By creating one central message and then later making systematic alterations in order to better reach a certain audience segment, while retaining the same central message\n* By creating distinctly different messages for different audience segments\nBoth the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and scholars of health communication emphasize the importance of [[strategic planning]] throughout a campaign.  This includes a variety of steps to ensure a well-developed message is being communicated:<ref name=\"CDC\"/>\n* Reviewing background information to define what the problem is and who is affected by the problem\n* Setting communication objectives and proposing a plan to meet the wanted outcome\n* Analyze the target audience by determining interests, attitudes, behaviors, benefits, and barriers\n* Select channels and materials for communication in relation to what will most effectively reach audiences\n* Develop and pretest message concepts to determine understanding, acceptance, and reaction to the message\n* Implement communication with selected audience and monitor exposures and reactions to the message\n* Assess the outcome and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the campaign, noting if changes need to be made\n\n====Historical campaigns====\n\n=====American smallpox epidemic=====\nIn 1721, health communication was used to mitigate the smallpox epidemic in Boston. Cotton Mather, a political leader, used pamphlets and speeches to promote inoculation of smallpox.Alcohol abuse has been a problem within society for about as long as alcohol has been around. In the 19th century, the Women's Christian Temperance Union led a movement against alcohol abuse. They utilized mass communication to communicate the desired message. News papers and magazines allowed for the promotion of the anti-alcohol movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-cotton-mather-fought-smallpox|title=When Cotton Mather Fought The Smallpox {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref>\n\n=====Cardiovascular disease=====\nThree-community study and the five-city project were experimental campaigns to inform middle-aged men about the causes of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Health messages were communicated via television, radio, newspaper, cookbooks, booklets, and bus cards. The three \"communities\" comprised three experimental communication strategies: a media-only campaign, a media campaign supplemented with face-to-face communication, and a no-intervention [[control group]]. The experimented revealed that after one year, the most informed at-risk men were those in the second experimental group: they men consumed the media campaign and were attended by a [[health care provider]].\n\n===Communication channels===\n\n====Entertainment media====\nUsing the entertainment industry as a platform for advocating health information and education is a communication strategy that has become increasingly popular. The most utilized strategy is for health communication professionals to create partnerships with storyline creators so that public health information can be incorporated into within the plot of a television show. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has formed a strong partnership with Hollywood, Health, and Society, at the [[University of Southern California]] [[Norman Lear Center]] to continue to produce new storylines on television and in film studios that will help to promote public health information.<ref name=\"CDC\"/> Some of the resources provided with this partnership include comprehensive \"tip sheets\" to provide writers with easy to access and trustworthy information on health issues, and meetings and panels to discuss new information and resources. Some of the most notable examples of this method of communication in recent years have been with the films ''Contagion'' and ''I Am Legend'' in understanding the spread of disease, ''NBC's'' series ''Parenthood'' in Asperger's Syndrome, and with the ''CW's'' series ''90210'' and spreading cancer awareness. More recently, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] focused specifically on health films have been organised by the [[American Public Health Association]], [[International Health Film Festival|the International Health Film Festival]], the Global Health Film Initiative of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Public Health Film Society]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1757913915619120| pmid=26702114|title = Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival| journal=Perspectives in Public Health| volume=136| issue=1| pages=23\u201324|year = 2016|last1 = Botchway|first1 = Stella| last2=Hoang| first2=Uy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.apha.org/events-and-meetings/annual/schedule/film-festival | title=The APHA Global Public Health Film Festival}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalhealthfilm.org/ | title=Global Health Film &#124; Home}}</ref><ref name=\"academic.oup.com\">{{Cite web | doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdx022| pmid=28369436| title=First International Public Health Film Competition 2016\u2014reflections on the development and use of competition judging criteria| journal=Journal of Public Health| volume=40| pages=169\u2013174| year=2018| last1=Hoang| first1=U.| last2=Luna| first2=P.| last3=Russell| first3=P.| last4=Bergonzi-King| first4=L.| last5=Ashton| first5=J.| last6=McCarthy| first6=C.| last7=Donovan| first7=H.| last8=Inman| first8=P.| last9=Seminog| first9=O.| last10=Botchway| first10=S.}}</ref>\n\nWriters and storyline developers have an increased motivation to continue to incorporate public health information into their scripts with the creation of the Sentinel for Health Awards in 2000, which honors storylines that effectively promote health topics and audience awareness of [[public health]] issues.<ref name=\"CDC\"/> Surveys conducted by [[Porter Novelli]] in 2001 reported many interesting statistics on the effectiveness of this strategy, such as that over half of regular prime time and daytime drama viewers have reported that they have learned something about health promotion or disease prevention from a TV show.<ref name=\"HD\"/> Amongst this data, minority groups are significantly represented with well over half of African American and Hispanic viewers stating that they had either taken some form of preventative action after hearing about a health issue on TV, or that a TV storyline helped them to provide vital health information to a friend or family member.\n\n====Direct marketing====\n{{Main|Social marketing}}\n[[File:Text messaging used to provide encouragement to quit smoking.png|thumb|Some health organizations manage text messaging services to help people avoid smoking]]\nMedia advocacy use strategic mass media tools combined with widespread organization in order to advocate for healthy public policies or lifestyles.<ref name=\"HD\"/> This can include the use of [[text messaging]] and [[email]] to spread messages from person to person, and using [[social networking]] venues to promote health information to a wide-ranging audience. As technologies expand, the platforms for health communication through media advocacy will undoubtedly expand as well.\n\n====Interpersonal communication====\nHealth communication relies on strong interpersonal communication in order to influence health decisions and behaviours. The most important of these relationships are the connection and interaction between an individual and their [[health care provider]] (e.g., physician, therapist, pharmacist) and an individual's social support system (family, friends, community). These connections can positively influence the individual's decision to make healthy choices.<ref name=\"HD\"/> Patients are more prone to listen when they feel invested emotionally into the situation. If they feel as if they understand what is being said, they are more prone to make objective decisions based on the information heard. Two of the most prominent areas of study in interpersonal health communication are the patient-centered and the relationship centered models of care.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Apker |first1=Julie |title=Communication in health organizations |date=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-745-64754-8 |edition=1}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nHealth communication has become essential in promoting the general [[public health]] in myriad situations. One of health communication's most important applications has been throughout major Environmental events (e.g. [[hurricanes]], [[flooding]], [[tornado]]s) and addressing the affected audience's questions and needs quickly and efficiently, keeping the protection of [[public health]] and the forefront of their message.<ref name=\"EHS\"/> Health communication professionals are constantly working to improve this type of risk communication in order to be prepared in the case of an emergency.\n\nAnother increasingly important application of health communication has been in reaching students in the college community. The National College Health Assessment has measured that 92.5% of college students reported being in \"good, very good, or excellent health\", however college students seem to battle serious problems with stress, depression, substance abuse, and a general lack of nutrition in comparison to other age groups and audiences.<ref name=CS>{{cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|author2=Nichole Egbert |author3=Evelyn Ho |title=Everyday Health Communication Experiences of College Students|journal=Journal of American College Health|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=427\u2013435|doi=10.3200/jach.56.44.427-436|pmid=18316288}}<!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--></ref> Professionals in health communication are actively striving for new ways to reach this at-risk audience in order to raise standards of [[public health]] in the college setting and to promote a healthier life style amongst students.\n\n==Challenges==\nThere are many challenges in communicating information about health to individuals. Some of the most essential issues have to do with the gap between individual health literacy and healthcare workers and institutions, as well as flaws in communicating health information through mass media.\n\n===Literacy-communication gap===\n{{Further|Health literacy}}\n\nOne problem that health communication seeks to address is the gap that has formed between health literacy and the use of health communication.<ref>{{cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 19|year=1996|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=187\u2013227|vauthors=Viswanath K, Finnegan JR |authorlink=The knowledge gap hypothesis: twenty-five years later|editor=Burleson, B|chapter=.}}</ref>  While the goal is that health communication will effectively ''lead'' to health literacy, issues such as the use of unexplained medical jargon, ill-formed messages, and often a general educational gap have created a disparity.

Such shortcomings of health communication may lead to increased hospitalizations, the inability to respond to and manage a disease or medical condition, and a generally declining health status.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn some populations, health-related websites (e.g., [[WebMD]]) and online support groups (e.g., Association for Cancer Online Resources) have increased access to health information.<ref name=\"HD\"/>\n\n===Mass media===\nMass communication is used to promote beneficial changes in behavior among members of populations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abroms|first=LC|author2=Maibach, EW|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|year=2008|volume=29|pages=219\u201334|pmid=18173391|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090824|title=The effectiveness of mass communication to change public behavior.}}</ref>  A major criticism of the use of mass media as a method of health communication is the unfortunate ability for false and misinformed messages to spread quickly through the mass media, before they have the chance to be disputed by professionals. This issue may generate unwarranted panic amongst those who receive the messages and be an issue as technology continues to advance. An example of this may be observed in the ongoing distrust of vaccinations due to the publication of numerous messages that wrongly link the childhood measles-mumps-rubella ([[MMR vaccine|MMR]]) vaccination with the development and onset of [[Autism]].<ref name=MMR>{{cite news|last=Brauser|first=Deborah|title=Autism and MMR Vaccine Study an 'Elaborate Fraud,' Charger BMJ|date=January 6, 2001}}</ref> The speed with which this message spread due to new social networking technologies caused many parents to distrust vaccinations and therefore forgo having their children receive the vaccine. Although this panic is based on false information, many still harbor a lingering suspicion towards vaccinations and refuse them, which has caused a [[public health]] concern.\n\n==Historical timeline==\nThe following are some of the key events in the development of health communication as a formal discipline since the 1970s.<ref>Kreps et al. 1998</ref>\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n{{Ordered list\n| item1_value=1975 | [[International Communication Association]] establishes the Therapeutic Communication Interest Group (which later became the \u201cHealth Communication\u201d Division)\n| item2_value=1979 | The American Academy on Physician and Patient (later renamed the American Academy on Communication in Healthcare) was established to promote research, education, and professional standards in patient-clinician communication.\n| item3_value=1984 |Health communication textbooks begin appearing: Kreps & Thornton (1984), Sharf (1984), and Northhouse & Northhouse (1985)\n| item4_value=1985 | [[National Communication Association]] forms the Commission for Health Communication, which later became the Health Communication Division\n| item5_value=1989 | First peer reviewed journal devoted to health communication, ''[[Health Communication (journal)|Health Communication]]''.

It was the seventh race of the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the 59th running of the [[Monaco Grand Prix|event]].  [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 78-lap race for the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] team. His teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] finished second with [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]]'s [[Eddie Irvine]] third.\n\n[[David Coulthard]], who qualified in [[pole position]] by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, [[Stall (engine)|stalled]] at the start of the [[Parade lap|formation lap]] because of an electronic [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control system]] fault, leading to Schumacher inheriting his position. Schumacher maintained the lead in the first laps with [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] second and Barrichello third. H\u00e4kkinen responded to Schumacher's pace before he lost second to Barrichello on lap 13 because his car pulled to the right. Schumacher continued to lead until he made a [[pit stop]] on the 55th lap, relinquishing it to Barrichello for four laps. He then retook it and held it to claim his fourth victory of the season, his fifth at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the 48th of his career.\n\nAs a consequence of the race, Michael Schumacher extended his lead in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] from four to twelve [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] over Coulthard. Barrichello maintained third and [[Ralf Schumacher]] remained in fourth after he retired late in the event.

It was the seventh race of the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the 59th running of the [[Monaco Grand Prix|event]].  [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 78-lap race for the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] team.

This [[picaresque]] novel is heavily influenced by [[surrealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[critical theory]], and other branches of [[Continental philosophy]]. Its style is an amalgam of [[magical realism]] and [[postmodern]] [[pastiche]]. The novel has been called a theoretical fiction, as it clearly engages in some of the theoretical issues of its time, notably [[feminism]], mass media and the [[counterculture]].\n\n==Plot introduction==\n\nSet in an unspecified Latin American country, the novel features Desiderio, a government minister in the main city, currently under attack by Doctor Hoffman's reality-distorting machines. Desiderio embarks on a journey to find Hoffman's former physics teacher, eventually bringing him to Hoffman's castle.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel presents the story from the perspective of Desiderio, a bureau member in the main city currently under the attack of Doctor Hoffman's desire machines. With these machines, Doctor Hoffman expands the dimensions of time and space, allowing ever-changing mirages to inhabit the same dimension as the living. Desiderio, though indifferent to the haunting apparitions, finds himself visited nightly by a glass woman, the manifestation of Albertina, Hoffman's daughter and Desiderio's lover-to-be. Unlike Desiderio, many people go crazy in response to the apparitions, and the city, severed from communication with the outside world, becomes a place of rampant insanity and crime, thereby prompting a [[state of emergency]]. Under the command of the Minister of Determination, Desiderio embarks on an undercover journey to find and assassinate Doctor Hoffman.\n\nOn his way to the first stop on his journey, Desiderio encounters Doctor Hoffman's former physics professor who now works as blind [[peep-show]] proprietor. During the story, Desiderio visits the sexualised exhibits of the peep show a number of times to find that they bear uncanny resemblance to the events that occur within his own life. Upon reaching his first destination, the Mayor's Office of town S., Desiderio finds that the Mayor has disappeared. Thereupon he visits the Mayor's home where he rapes the Mayor's [[sleepwalking|somnambulist]] daughter, Mary Anne, while she remains unconscious. When Mary Anne turns up dead, dirty members of the Determination Police charge Desiderio, but he escapes. From there on, Desiderio finds himself involved in a number of wild adventures in which the novel features many graphic scenes of eroticism that include sexual taboos. On these adventures, Albertina secretly accompanies Desiderio.\n\nDesiderio spends time living with the river people, Amerindian families that live on barges. He later joins a [[traveling carnival]] in which he becomes enthralled with the mind-boggling performance of the Acrobats of Desire. Following a tragic event, a [[Lithuania]]n count, in flight from the wrath of a black pimp, takes Desiderio into his company. With the count, Desiderio narrowly escapes becoming the victim of cannibalism on the African coast before Albertina reveals herself and leads Desiderio through the landscape of Nebulous Time where a community of [[centaurs]] adopts the two. However, the couple's lives become endangered yet again and they must flee to Hoffman's castle, where Doctor Hoffman explains his plans to reduce the world into its most basic constituents with the help of Desiderio and Albertina. While Desiderio loves Albertina, he ultimately chooses reality over the fulfilment of desire when he kills both Doctor Hoffman and his daughter. As a result, Desiderio becomes the proclaimed hero of the Great War. Nevertheless, he continues to long for his dead lover.\n\n==Structure==\n\n''The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman'' is a [[first-person narrative|first person]] [[frame narrative]]. Desiderio recounts the events of his past with several instances of second person. \"...it was I who killed her. But you must not expect a love story or a murder story. expect a tale of picaresque adventure or even of heroic adventure...\" (14). Carter ornamentally depicts many of Desiderio's events and [[Defamiliarization|defamiliarise]]s the reader throughout the novel. In the introduction of the novel, Desiderio essentially gives away the ending and the climax. This formal choice repeats throughout the novel as Carter constantly references the outcome of actions and events that have not occurred in the text.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Doctor Hoffman''' \u2013 an evil, sadistic scientist akin to [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]]. The doctor is the antagonist and diabolical adversary of the novel. He masters physics and surpasses his teacher, the proprietor; he later uses this ability to create a new form of reality where nothing is bound by time or the normal rules of physics. With help from his colleague Mendoza, he discovers that \"eroto-energy\" can power his desire machines with omnipotent and everlasting energy. He uses his desire machines to fuel energy into his new reality.\n\n'''Desiderio''' \u2013 The Narrator and protagonist of the novel. He is now an old man and recounts the events of his life to explain how he became a hero. He was sardonic in his youth and the complex images produced by the desire machines bored him; he could not surrender to the mirages. This attitude kept him alive. Desiderio, in Italian, literally means wish, longing, and desire.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=desiderio Dictionary.com \u2013 Desiderio</ref> Dr Hoffmans daughter, Albertina, haunts Desiderios dreams and constantly seduces him. Despite his love for Albertina, he eventually murders her. He is a government minister in an unspecified Latin country that works under the Minister. The Minister sends him on a journey to find and inconspicuously assassinate Dr. Hoffman, and destroy his machine.\n\n'''Albertina''' \u2013 Dr. Hoffman's daughter, who supports her father's actions and ideals. She is Desiderio's soul mate and she is extremely sexually appealing. She wants to use the energy from her and Desiderio\u2019s love to energise the omnipotent desire machines, thus increasing her father's power. The name is most likely a reference to Proust's \"Albertine\", a female character that serves as an \"other\", or mirror for the protagonist.\n\n'''Minister''' \u2013 Works with Desiderio and essentially rules the city until Dr. Hoffman starts his campaign against human reason. The minister loves logic and admires [[statis]]. Despite his envy of Dr. Hoffman's power, the minister wants to stop the freak show that the Doctor has created. To restore society, he creates reality testing labs to discover Doctor Hoffman's secret methods.\n\n'''The Count''' \u2013 The egotistic and vulgar traveller that takes Desiderio into his company. Consistent with his arrogance, he claims that \"he only lived to negate the world,\" and he travels according to his erotic desires (123).

This [[picaresque]] novel is heavily influenced by [[surrealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[critical theory]], and other branches of [[Continental philosophy]]. Its style is an amalgam of [[magical realism]] and [[postmodern]] [[pastiche]]. The novel has been called a theoretical fiction, as it clearly engages in some of the theoretical issues of its time, notably [[feminism]], mass media and the [[counterculture]].\n\n==Plot introduction==\n\nSet in an unspecified Latin American country, the novel features Desiderio, a government minister in the main city, currently under attack by Doctor Hoffman's reality-distorting machines. Desiderio embarks on a journey to find Hoffman's former physics teacher, eventually bringing him to Hoffman's castle.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel presents the story from the perspective of Desiderio, a bureau member in the main city currently under the attack of Doctor Hoffman's desire machines. With these machines, Doctor Hoffman expands the dimensions of time and space, allowing ever-changing mirages to inhabit the same dimension as the living. Desiderio, though indifferent to the haunting apparitions, finds himself visited nightly by a glass woman, the manifestation of Albertina, Hoffman's daughter and Desiderio's lover-to-be. Unlike Desiderio, many people go crazy in response to the apparitions, and the city, severed from communication with the outside world, becomes a place of rampant insanity and crime, thereby prompting a [[state of emergency]]. Under the command of the Minister of Determination, Desiderio embarks on an undercover journey to find and assassinate Doctor Hoffman.\n\nOn his way to the first stop on his journey, Desiderio encounters Doctor Hoffman's former physics professor who now works as blind [[peep-show]] proprietor. During the story, Desiderio visits the sexualised exhibits of the peep show a number of times to find that they bear uncanny resemblance to the events that occur within his own life. Upon reaching his first destination, the Mayor's Office of town S., Desiderio finds that the Mayor has disappeared. Thereupon he visits the Mayor's home where he rapes the Mayor's [[sleepwalking|somnambulist]] daughter, Mary Anne, while she remains unconscious. When Mary Anne turns up dead, dirty members of the Determination Police charge Desiderio, but he escapes. From there on, Desiderio finds himself involved in a number of wild adventures in which the novel features many graphic scenes of eroticism that include sexual taboos. On these adventures, Albertina secretly accompanies Desiderio.\n\nDesiderio spends time living with the river people, Amerindian families that live on barges. He later joins a [[traveling carnival]] in which he becomes enthralled with the mind-boggling performance of the Acrobats of Desire. Following a tragic event, a [[Lithuania]]n count, in flight from the wrath of a black pimp, takes Desiderio into his company. With the count, Desiderio narrowly escapes becoming the victim of cannibalism on the African coast before Albertina reveals herself and leads Desiderio through the landscape of Nebulous Time where a community of [[centaurs]] adopts the two. However, the couple's lives become endangered yet again and they must flee to Hoffman's castle, where Doctor Hoffman explains his plans to reduce the world into its most basic constituents with the help of Desiderio and Albertina. While Desiderio loves Albertina, he ultimately chooses reality over the fulfilment of desire when he kills both Doctor Hoffman and his daughter. As a result, Desiderio becomes the proclaimed hero of the Great War. Nevertheless, he continues to long for his dead lover.\n\n==Structure==\n\n''The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman'' is a [[first-person narrative|first person]] [[frame narrative]]. Desiderio recounts the events of his past with several instances of second person. \"...it was I who killed her. But you must not expect a love story or a murder story. expect a tale of picaresque adventure or even of heroic adventure...\" (14). Carter ornamentally depicts many of Desiderio's events and [[Defamiliarization|defamiliarise]]s the reader throughout the novel. In the introduction of the novel, Desiderio essentially gives away the ending and the climax. This formal choice repeats throughout the novel as Carter constantly references the outcome of actions and events that have not occurred in the text.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Doctor Hoffman''' \u2013 an evil, sadistic scientist akin to [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]]. The doctor is the antagonist and diabolical adversary of the novel. He masters physics and surpasses his teacher, the proprietor; he later uses this ability to create a new form of reality where nothing is bound by time or the normal rules of physics. With help from his colleague Mendoza, he discovers that \"eroto-energy\" can power his desire machines with omnipotent and everlasting energy. He uses his desire machines to fuel energy into his new reality.\n\n'''Desiderio''' \u2013 The Narrator and protagonist of the novel. He is now an old man and recounts the events of his life to explain how he became a hero. He was sardonic in his youth and the complex images produced by the desire machines bored him; he could not surrender to the mirages. This attitude kept him alive. Desiderio, in Italian, literally means wish, longing, and desire.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=desiderio Dictionary.com \u2013 Desiderio</ref> Dr Hoffmans daughter, Albertina, haunts Desiderios dreams and constantly seduces him. Despite his love for Albertina, he eventually murders her. He is a government minister in an unspecified Latin country that works under the Minister. The Minister sends him on a journey to find and inconspicuously assassinate Dr. Hoffman, and destroy his machine.\n\n'''Albertina''' \u2013 Dr. Hoffman's daughter, who supports her father's actions and ideals. She is Desiderio's soul mate and she is extremely sexually appealing. She wants to use the energy from her and Desiderio\u2019s love to energise the omnipotent desire machines, thus increasing her father's power. The name is most likely a reference to Proust's \"Albertine\", a female character that serves as an \"other\", or mirror for the protagonist.\n\n'''Minister''' \u2013 Works with Desiderio and essentially rules the city until Dr. Hoffman starts his campaign against human reason. The minister loves logic and admires [[statis]]. Despite his envy of Dr. Hoffman's power, the minister wants to stop the freak show that the Doctor has created. To restore society, he creates reality testing labs to discover Doctor Hoffman's secret methods.\n\n'''The Count''' \u2013 The egotistic and vulgar traveller that takes Desiderio into his company. Consistent with his arrogance, he claims that \"he only lived to negate the world,\" and he travels according to his erotic desires (123). Though generally undaunted, the Count reveals a fear of the black pimp who wishes to kill him. Albertina later tells Desiderio that her father considered the Count a threat to her father's plans.\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Feminism===\nCarter explores [[feminism]] throughout the novel. Despite the fact that all of her female characters are victimised, they do not lose their sexual desire. \"Rather than desexualize and subsequently dehumanize her female characters, Carter creates women who are sexual even when their desires are seemingly undesirable from feminist perspectives.\"<ref>[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a781179338&fulltext=713240928 Undesirable Desires: Sexuality as Subjectivity in Angela Carter's The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman]</ref> This \"undesirable desire\" portrays her female character as strong and unbreakable, supporting her feminist views.\n\n===Media's effect on society===\nDoctor Hoffman's illusion inducing machines create the same effect as today's newspapers, magazines, websites, and television broadcasts.
