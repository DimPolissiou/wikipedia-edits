The name Plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses: the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevins]], who were also [[counts of Anjou]]; the main body of the Plantagenets following the loss of Anjou; and the Plantagenets' two [[cadet branch]]es, the houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]]. The family held the [[English throne]] from 1154, with the accession of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], until 1485, when [[Richard III]] died in battle.\n\nUnder the Plantagenets, England was transformed \u2013 although this was only partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as [[Magna Carta]]. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was no longer just the most powerful man in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, and the establishment of English as the primary language.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Plantagenets were defeated in the [[Hundred Years' War]] and beset with social, political and economic problems. Popular revolts were commonplace, triggered by the denial of numerous freedoms. English nobles raised private armies, engaged in private feuds and openly defied [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].\n\nThe rivalry between the House of Plantagenet's two cadet branches of York and Lancaster brought about the [[Wars of the Roses]], a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, when the reign of the Plantagenets and the [[England in the Middle Ages|English Middle Ages]] both met their end with the death of King Richard III. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; five months later, he married [[Elizabeth of York]], thus ending the Wars of the Roses, and giving rise to the [[House of Tudor|Tudor dynasty]]. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid some of the problems that had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. The resulting stability allowed for the [[English Renaissance]], and the advent of [[early modern Britain]].\n\n==Terminology==\n\n===''Plantagenet''===\n[[File:Henry II Plantagenet.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ancient depiction of the first Plantagenet King Henry the 2nd of England|upright|[[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189) is considered by some to be the first Plantagenet king of England.]]\n\n[[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]], adopted Plantagenet as his family name in the 15th century. ''Plantegenest'' (or ''Plante Genest'') had been a 12th-century nickname for his ancestor [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]], [[Count of Anjou]] and [[Duke of Normandy]]. One of many popular theories suggests the blossom of [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]], a bright yellow (\"gold\") flowering plant, [[Genisteae|genista]] in [[medieval Latin]], as the source of the nick-name.<ref name=plant2007>{{harvnb|Plant|2007}}</ref> \n\nIt is uncertain why Richard chose this specific name, although during the [[Wars of the Roses]] it emphasised Richard's status as Geoffrey's patrilineal descendant. The retrospective usage of the name for all of Geoffrey's male-line descendants was popular during the subsequent [[Tudor dynasty]], perhaps encouraged by the further legitimacy it gave to Richard's great-grandson, [[Henry VIII]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|2001|p=206}}</ref> It was only in the late 17th century that it passed into common usage among historians.<ref name=Wilson>{{harvnb|Keefe|2008|}}</ref>\n\n===''Angevins''===\n{{Further|Angevin kings of England|Angevin Empire}}\n{{wikt-lang|Fr|Angevin}} is French for \"from [[Anjou]]\". The three Angevin kings were [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. \"Angevin\" can also refer to the period of history in which they reigned. Many historians identify the Angevins as a distinct English royal house. \"Angevin\" is also used in reference to any sovereign or government derived from Anjou. As a noun, it refers to any native of Anjou or an Angevin ruler, and specifically to other [[counts and dukes of Anjou]], including the ancestors of the three kings who formed the English royal house; their cousins, who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]]; and to unrelated members of the French royal family who were later granted the titles and formed different dynasties, such as the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[House of Valois-Anjou|Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref> Consequently, there is disagreement between those who consider [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] to be the first Plantagenet monarch, and those who do not distinguish between Angevins and Plantagenets and therefore consider the first Plantagenet to be Henry II.<ref>{{harvnb|BlockmansHoppenbrouwers|2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007a|pp=15\u201323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined by [[Kate Norgate]] in 1887. There was no known contemporary collective name for all of the territories under the rule of the Angevin Kings of England. This led to circumlocutions such as \"our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be\" or \"the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father\". The \"Empire\" portion of \"Angevin Empire\" has been controversial, especially as these territories were not subject to any unified laws or systems of governance, and each retained its own laws, traditions, and feudal relationships. In 1986 a convention of historians concluded that there had not been an Angevin state, and therefore no \"[[Angevin Empire]]\", but that the term {{lang|fr|espace Plantagenet}} (French for \"Plantagenet area\") was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2\u20135}}</ref> Nonetheless, historians have continued to use \"Angevin Empire\".{{#tag:ref|For instance, David Crouch in ''[https://books.google.ie/books?id=Yb9cOQAACAAJ William Marshal: Court, Career, and Chivalry in the Angevin Empire, 1147\u20131219]'' (Longman, 1990); Ralph V.

In 1060 the couple inherited the title via [[cognatic kinship]] from [[House of Ingelger|an Angevin family]] that was descended from a noble named [[Ingelger]], whose recorded history dates from 870.<ref name=Davies190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries, power struggles occurred between rulers in northern and western France including those of Anjou, [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and the kings of France. In the early 12th century Geoffrey of Anjou married [[Empress Matilda]], [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]]'s only surviving legitimate child and heir to the English throne. As a result of this marriage, Geoffrey's son [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] inherited the English throne as well as Norman and Angevin titles, thus marking the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>\n\nThe marriage was the third attempt of Geoffrey's father, [[Fulk V, Count of Anjou]], to build a political alliance with Normandy. He first espoused his daughter, [[Matilda of Anjou|Alice]], to [[William Adelin]], Henry I's heir. After William drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]'' Fulk married another of his daughters, [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]], to [[William Clito]], son of Henry I's older brother, [[Robert Curthose]]. Henry I had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to Normandy. Finally Fulk achieved his goal through the marriage of Geoffrey and Matilda. Fulk then passed his titles to Geoffrey and became [[King of Jerusalem]].<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}.</ref>\n\n==Angevin kings==\n{{See also|Angevin kings of England}}\n\n===Arrival in England===\n{{further|The Anarchy}}\n[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Map of King Henry the second's continental holdings in 1154 covering parts of today's France|[[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s continental holdings in 1154 (in various shades of red), forming part of the \"[[Angevin Empire]]\"]]\n\nWhen Henry II was born in 1133, his grandfather, Henry I, was reportedly delighted, saying that the boy was \"the heir to the kingdom\".<ref name=\"Gillingham 2001 11\u201312\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> The birth reduced the risk that the king's realm would pass to his son-in-law's family, which might have occurred if the marriage of Matilda and Geoffrey had proved childless. The birth of a second son, also named [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], increased the likelihood that, in accordance with French custom, Henry would receive the English maternal inheritance and Geoffrey the Angevin paternal inheritance. This would separate the realms of England and Anjou.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2001 11\u201312\"/> In order to secure an orderly succession, Geoffrey and Matilda sought more power from Henry I, but quarrelled with him after the king refused to give them power that might be used against him. When he died in December 1135, the couple were in Anjou, allowing Matilda's cousin [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]] to seize the crown of England. Stephen's contested accession initiated the widespread civil unrest later called the Anarchy.<ref name=Schama2000p117>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=117}}</ref>\n\nCount Geoffrey had little interest in England. Instead he commenced a ten-year war for the duchy of Normandy, but it became clear that to bring this conflict to a successful conclusion Stephen would need to be challenged in England so in 1139 Matilda and her half-brother, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert]] invaded England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=15}}</ref> From the age of nine, Henry was repeatedly sent to England to be the male figurehead of the campaigns, since it became apparent that he would become king if England was conquered. In 1141 Stephen was captured at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] and later exchanged for Robert who had also been captured. Geoffrey continued the conquest of Normandy and in 1150 transferred the duchy to Henry while retaining the primary role in the duchy's government.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\nThree events allowed the Angevins' successful termination of the conflict:\n* Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the division of his realm between Henry and Henry's younger brother Geoffrey, who would have inherited Anjou. According to [[William of Newburgh]], who wrote in the 1190s, Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou for as long as he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen. Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore an oath that the young Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=18}}</ref> [[W. L. Warren]] cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source, it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would consider such an oath binding and it would break the inheritance practice of the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1973|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> The young Geoffrey died in 1158, before receiving Anjou, but he had become [[count of Nantes]] when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler.

Consequently, the Angevins acquired the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=60\u201361}}</ref>\n* Stephen's wife and elder son, [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]],  died in 1153 leading to the [[Treaty of Wallingford]]. The treaty agreed the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142, recognised Henry as Stephen's heir, guaranteed Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]] his father's estates and allowed Stephen to be king for life.

The eldest son, [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Henry]], became [[List of rulers of Saxony#Dukes of Saxony|duke of Saxony]] and [[List of rulers of the Electoral Palatinate|count palatine of the Rhine]].

Becket's defiance as Archbishop alienated the king and his counsellors. Henry and Becket had repeated disputes over issues such as church tenures, the marriage of Henry's brother, and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket and other English bishops to recognise sixteen ancient customs in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], governing relations between the king, his courts and the church. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry tried to ruin him by filing legal cases relating to Becket's previous tenure as chancellor. Becket fled and remained in exile for five years. Relations later improved, and Becket returned, but they declined again when Henry's son was crowned as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]], which Becket perceived as a challenge to his authority. Becket later excommunicated those who had offended him. When he received this news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Four of Henry's knights killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a failed arrest attempt.

In Richard's absence, Philip II overran large portions of Normandy and John acquired control of Richard's English lands. After returning to England, Richard forgave John and re-established his authority in England.

The pope offered Henry's brother [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], but the military cost of displacing the incumbent [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick]] was prohibitive. [[Matthew Paris]] wrote that Richard stated: \"You might as well say, 'I make you a present of the moon \u2013 step up to the sky and take it down'.\" Instead, Henry purchased the kingdom for his son Edmund, which angered many powerful barons. The barons led by Henry's brother-in-law Simon de Montfort forced him to agree to the [[Provisions of Oxford]], under which his debts were paid in exchange for substantial reforms. In France, with the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]], Henry formally surrendered the territory of his Angevin ancestors to [[Louis IX of France]], receiving in return the title duke of Aquitaine and the territory of Gascony as a vassal of the French king.<ref name=\"RidgewayH3ONDB\"/>\n\n[[File:Montfort Evesham.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a 13th-century representation of the death of Simon de Montfort|Death of Simon de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]]]]\n\nDisagreements between the barons and the king intensified.

Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the [[Statutes of Mortmain]], Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when [[Philip IV of France]] confiscated the Duchy of [[Gascony]] in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting [[Model Parliament|assembly]] in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants.

[[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] claimed to rule [[North Wales]] \"entirely separate from\" England but Edward viewed him to be \"a rebel and disturber of the peace\". Edward's determination, military experience and skilful naval manoeuvres ended what was to him rebellion. The invasion was executed by one of the largest armies ever assembled by an English king, comprising Anglo-Norman cavalry and Welsh archers and laying the foundation for future victories in France. Llywelyn was driven into the mountains, later dying in battle. The [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] established England's authority over Wales, and Edward's son was proclaimed the first English [[Prince of Wales]] upon his birth. Edward spent vast sums on his two Welsh campaigns with a large portion of it spent on a network of castles.<ref name=\"EIODNB\" />\n\nEdward asserted that the [[List of Scottish monarchs|king of Scotland]] owed him feudal allegiance, and intended to unite the two nations by marrying his son [[Edward II of England|Edward]] to [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]], the sole heir of King [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].<ref name=\"EIODNB\" /> When Margaret died in 1290, [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|competition for the Scottish crown]] ensued. By invitation of Scottish magnates, Edward I resolved the dispute, ruling in favour of [[John Balliol]], who duly swore loyalty to him and became king. Edward insisted that he was Scotland's sovereign and possessed the right to hear appeals against Balliol's judgements, undermining Balliol's authority. Balliol allied with France in 1295; Edward invaded Scotland the following year, deposing and exiling Balliol.<ref name=\"EIODNB\" />\n\nEdward was less successful in Gascony, which was overrun by the French. With his resources depleting, Edward was forced to reconfirm the Charters, including Magna Carta, to obtain the necessary funds. In 1303 the French king restored Gascony to Edward by signing the [[Treaty of Paris (1303)|Treaty of Paris]]. Meanwhile, [[William Wallace]] rose in Balliol's name and recovered most of Scotland.

These were entered in another agreement to be effected only after the transfer of territory by November 1361 but both sides prevaricated over their commitments for the following nine years. Hostages from the Valois family were held in London while John returned to France to raise his ransom.

Edmund was married to Isabella, a daughter of King Peter of Castile and [[Mar\u00eda de Padilla]] and the sister of Constance of Castile, who was the second wife of Edmund's brother John of Gaunt. Both of Edmund's sons were killed in 1415. The younger, [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Richard]], became involved in the [[Southampton Plot]], a conspiracy to depose Henry V in favour of Richard's brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer. When Mortimer revealed the plot to the king, Richard was executed for treason. Richard's childless older brother [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward]] was killed at the Battle of Agincourt later the same year. [[Constance of York]] was Edmund's only daughter and was an ancestor of Queen [[Anne Neville]]. The increasingly interwoven Plantagenet relationships were demonstrated by Edmund's second marriage to [[Joan Holland]]. Her sister [[Alianore Holland, Countess of March|Alianore Holland]] was mother to Richard's wife, Anne Mortimer. [[Margaret Holland]], another of Joan's sisters, married [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John of Gaunt's son]]. She later married [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence|Thomas of Lancaster]], John of Gaunt's grandson by King Henry IV.

Within months of his father's death, Richard's childless uncle, Edward Duke of York, was killed at Agincourt. Richard was allowed to inherit the title of Duke of York in 1426. In 1432 he acquired the earldoms of March and Ulster on the death of his maternal uncle Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who had died campaigning with Henry V in France, and the earldom of Cambridge which had belonged to his father. Being descended from Edward III in both the maternal and the paternal line gave Richard a significant claim to the throne if the Lancastrian line should fail, and by [[cognatic primogeniture]] arguably a superior claim.<ref name=\"ODNBRoY\">{{harvnb|Watts|2011|}}</ref>  He emphasised the point by being the first to assume the Plantagenet surname in 1448.

She was the eldest daughter of Edward IV, and all their children were his cognatic heirs. Indeed, [[Polydore Vergil]] noted Henry VIII's pronounced resemblance to his grandfather Edward: \"For just as Edward was the most warmly thought of by the English people amongst all English kings, so this successor of his, Henry, was very much like him in general appearance, in greatness of mind and generosity and for that reason was the most acclaimed and approved of all.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2009|p=305}}</ref>\n\nThis did not deter [[Margaret of York|Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy]]{{mdash}}Edward's sister and Elizabeth's aunt{{mdash}}and members of the de la Pole family{{mdash}}children of Edward's sister and [[John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk]]{{mdash}} from frequent attempts to destabilise Henry's regime.<ref name=\"ODNBMoY\">{{harvnb|Jones|2008|}}</ref> Henry imprisoned Margaret's nephew [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward, Earl of Warwick]], the son of her brother George, in the Tower of London, but in 1487 Margaret financed a rebellion led by [[Lambert Simnel]] pretending to be Edward.

Edmund did not possess sufficient finances to maintain his status as a duke, so as a compromise he accepted the title of earl of Suffolk. Financial difficulties led to frequent legal conflicts and Edmund's indictment for murder in 1501. He fled with his brother Richard, while their remaining brother, William, was imprisoned in the Tower{{mdash}}where he would remain until his death 37 years later{{mdash}}as part of a general suppression of Edmund's associates [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] had been holding Edmund and in 1506 he returned him to Henry. Edmund was imprisoned in the Tower. In 1513, he was executed after Richard de la Pole, whom [[Louis XII of France]] had recognised as king of England the previous year, claimed the kingship in his own right.<ref name =EDLP>{{harvnb|Cunningham|2008|}}</ref> Richard, known as the White Rose, plotted an invasion of England for years but was killed in 1525 at the [[Battle of Pavia]] while fighting as the captain of the French [[landsknechts]] during [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France]]'s invasion of Italy.<ref name=RDLP>{{harvnb|Cunningham|2004a|}}</ref>\n\n===Pole===\n[[File:El cardenal Reginald Pole, por Sebastiano del Piombo.jpg|thumb|Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]]|upright|alt=Ancient oil painting of Cardinal Pole]]\n\nWarwick's sister, and therefore Edward IV's niece, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]], was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, the cause was more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Clarence]], was a legal bar to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to [[Sir Richard Pole]], his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the [[Earl of Salisbury|earldom of Salisbury]] and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from [[Anne Boleyn]], the only woman in 16th-century England to hold a peerage title in her own right.<ref name=Pole>{{harvnb|Pierce|2015|}}</ref>\n\nHer daughter [[Ursula Pole, Baroness Stafford|Ursula]] married the son of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]]. Buckingham's fall after arguments with the king over property, and Margaret's open support for [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Mary I of England|Princess Mary]] began the Poles' estrangement from the king. Hope of reconciliation was dashed by ''De unitate'', the letter that Margaret's son [[Reginald Pole]] wrote to Henry VIII, in which Reginald declared his opposition to the royal supremacy. In 1538 evidence came to light that Pole family members in England had been in communication with Reginald. Margaret's sons [[Geoffrey Pole|Geoffrey]] and [[Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu|Henry]] were arrested for treason along with several friends and associates, including Henry's wife and brother-in-law{{mdash}}[[Sir Edward Neville|Edward Neville]]. Among those arrested was the king's cousin [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter]], his wife and 11-year-old son. Courteney's wife was released two years later, but their son spent 15 years in the Tower until Queen Mary released him. Except for the surviving Geoffrey Pole, all the others implicated were beheaded.<ref name=Courteney>{{harvnb|Cooper|2008|}}</ref>\n\nMargaret was attainted. The possibility of an invasion involving Reginald via her south coast estates and her embittered relationship with Henry VIII precluded any chance of pardon. However, the decision to execute her seems a spontaneous, rather than a premeditated, act. According to the Calendar of State Papers her execution was botched at the hands of \"a wretched and blundering youth&nbsp;... who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner\". In 1886 she was beatified by Pope [[Leo XIII]] on the grounds she had laid down her life for the [[Holy See]] \"and for the truth of the orthodox Faith\".<ref name=Pole />\n\n===Stafford===\nEdward Stafford,  Duke of Buckingham, combined multiple lines of Plantagenet descent: from Edward III by his son Thomas of Woodstock, from Edward III via two of his Beaufort grandchildren, and from Edward I from Joan of Kent and the [[Holland family]]. His father failed in his rebellion against Richard III in 1483 but was restored to his inheritance on the reversal of his father's attainder late in 1485. His mother married Henry VII's uncle [[Jasper Tudor]], and his wardship was entrusted to the king's mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]. In 1502, during Henry VII's illness, there was debate as to whether Buckingham or Edmund de la Pole should act as regent for Henry VIII. There is no evidence of continuous hostility between Buckingham and Henry VIII, but there is little doubt of the duke's dislike of [[Thomas Wolsey]], whom he believed to be plotting to ruin the old nobility. Therefore, Henry VIII instructed Wolsey to watch Buckingham, his brother [[Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]], and three other peers. Neither Henry VIII nor his father planned to destroy Buckingham because of his lineage and Henry VIII even allowed Buckingham's son and heir, [[Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford]], to marry Ursula Pole, giving the Staffords a further line of royal blood descent. Buckingham himself was arrested in April 1521; he was found guilty on 16 May and executed the next day. Evidence was provided that the duke had been listening to prophecies that he would be king and that the Tudor family lay under God's curse for the execution of Warwick. This was said to explain Henry VIII's failure to produce a male heir. Much of this evidence consisted of ill-judged comments, speculation and bad temper, but it underlined the threat presented by Buckingham's descent.<ref name=Stafford>{{harvnb|Davies|2008|}}</ref>\n\n===Tudor succession===\n{{Main|Succession to Elizabeth I of England}}\nAs late as 1600, with the Tudor succession in doubt, older Plantagenet lines remained as possible claimants to a disputed throne, and religious and dynastic factors gave rise to complications. [[Thomas Wilson (record keeper)|Thomas Wilson]] wrote in his report ''The State of England, Anno Domini 1600'' that there were 12 \"competitors\" for the succession. At the time of writing (about 1601), Wilson had been working on intelligence matters for [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Lord Buckhurst]] and [[Sir Robert Cecil]].<ref name=WilsonTom>{{harvnb|Kelsey|2008|}}</ref>\nThe alleged competitors included five descendants of Henry VII and Elizabeth, including the eventual successor [[James I of England]], but also seven from older Plantagenet lines:<ref name=Pro>{{harvnb|Public Records Office|1870|}}</ref>\n\n* [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon]]\n* [[George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon]]\n* [[Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland]]\n* [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]]\n* [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]]\n* [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma]]\n* [[Philip III of Spain]] and his infant daughter\n\n[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice of the King's Bench]], argued that by 1626 the House of Plantagenet could not be considered to remain in existence in a speech during the Oxford Peerage case, which was to rule on who should inherit the [[Earl of Oxford|earldom of Oxford]]. It was referred by [[Charles I of England]] to the [[House of Lords]], who called for judicial assistance. Crewe said:\n\n<blockquote>I have labored to make a covenant with myself, that affection may not press upon judgement; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it.

The name Plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses: the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevins]], who were also [[counts of Anjou]]; the main body of the Plantagenets following the loss of Anjou; and the Plantagenets' two [[cadet branch]]es, the houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]]. The family held the [[English throne]] from 1154, with the accession of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], until 1485, when [[Richard III]] died in battle.\n\nUnder the Plantagenets, England was transformed \u2013 although this was only partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as [[Magna Carta]]. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was no longer just the most powerful man in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, and the establishment of English as the primary language.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Plantagenets were defeated in the [[Hundred Years' War]] and beset with social, political and economic problems. Popular revolts were commonplace, triggered by the denial of numerous freedoms. English nobles raised private armies, engaged in private feuds and openly defied [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].\n\nThe rivalry between the House of Plantagenet's two cadet branches of York and Lancaster brought about the [[Wars of the Roses]], a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, when the reign of the Plantagenets and the [[England in the Middle Ages|English Middle Ages]] both met their end with the death of King Richard III. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; five months later, he married [[Elizabeth of York]], thus ending the Wars of the Roses, and giving rise to the [[House of Tudor|Tudor dynasty]]. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid some of the problems that had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. The resulting stability allowed for the [[English Renaissance]], and the advent of [[early modern Britain]].\n\n==Terminology==\n\n===''Plantagenet''===\n[[File:Henry II Plantagenet.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ancient depiction of the first Plantagenet King Henry the 2nd of England|upright|[[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189) is considered by some to be the first Plantagenet king of England.]]\n\n[[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]], adopted Plantagenet as his family name in the 15th century. ''Plantegenest'' (or ''Plante Genest'') had been a 12th-century nickname for his ancestor [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]], [[Count of Anjou]] and [[Duke of Normandy]]. One of many popular theories suggests the blossom of [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]], a bright yellow (\"gold\") flowering plant, [[Genisteae|genista]] in [[medieval Latin]], as the source of the nick-name.<ref name=plant2007>{{harvnb|Plant|2007}}</ref> \n\nIt is uncertain why Richard chose this specific name, although during the [[Wars of the Roses]] it emphasised Richard's status as Geoffrey's patrilineal descendant. The retrospective usage of the name for all of Geoffrey's male-line descendants was popular during the subsequent [[Tudor dynasty]], perhaps encouraged by the further legitimacy it gave to Richard's great-grandson, [[Henry VIII]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|2001|p=206}}</ref> It was only in the late 17th century that it passed into common usage among historians.<ref name=Wilson>{{harvnb|Keefe|2008|}}</ref>\n\n===''Angevins''===\n{{Further|Angevin kings of England|Angevin Empire}}\n{{wikt-lang|Fr|Angevin}} is French for \"from [[Anjou]]\". The three Angevin kings were [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. \"Angevin\" can also refer to the period of history in which they reigned. Many historians identify the Angevins as a distinct English royal house. \"Angevin\" is also used in reference to any sovereign or government derived from Anjou. As a noun, it refers to any native of Anjou or an Angevin ruler, and specifically to other [[counts and dukes of Anjou]], including the ancestors of the three kings who formed the English royal house; their cousins, who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]]; and to unrelated members of the French royal family who were later granted the titles and formed different dynasties, such as the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[House of Valois-Anjou|Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref> Consequently, there is disagreement between those who consider [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] to be the first Plantagenet monarch, and those who do not distinguish between Angevins and Plantagenets and therefore consider the first Plantagenet to be Henry II.<ref>{{harvnb|BlockmansHoppenbrouwers|2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007a|pp=15\u201323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined by [[Kate Norgate]] in 1887. There was no known contemporary collective name for all of the territories under the rule of the Angevin Kings of England. This led to circumlocutions such as \"our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be\" or \"the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father\". The \"Empire\" portion of \"Angevin Empire\" has been controversial, especially as these territories were not subject to any unified laws or systems of governance, and each retained its own laws, traditions, and feudal relationships. In 1986 a convention of historians concluded that there had not been an Angevin state, and therefore no \"[[Angevin Empire]]\", but that the term {{lang|fr|espace Plantagenet}} (French for \"Plantagenet area\") was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2\u20135}}</ref> Nonetheless, historians have continued to use \"Angevin Empire\".{{#tag:ref|For instance, David Crouch in ''[https://books.google.ie/books?id=Yb9cOQAACAAJ William Marshal: Court, Career, and Chivalry in the Angevin Empire, 1147\u20131219]'' (Longman, 1990); Ralph V.

In 1060 the couple inherited the title via [[cognatic kinship]] from [[House of Ingelger|an Angevin family]] that was descended from a noble named [[Ingelger]], whose recorded history dates from 870.<ref name=Davies190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries, power struggles occurred between rulers in northern and western France including those of Anjou, [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and the kings of France. In the early 12th century Geoffrey of Anjou married [[Empress Matilda]], [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]]'s only surviving legitimate child and heir to the English throne. As a result of this marriage, Geoffrey's son [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] inherited the English throne as well as Norman and Angevin titles, thus marking the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>\n\nThe marriage was the third attempt of Geoffrey's father, [[Fulk V, Count of Anjou]], to build a political alliance with Normandy. He first espoused his daughter, [[Matilda of Anjou|Alice]], to [[William Adelin]], Henry I's heir. After William drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]'' Fulk married another of his daughters, [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]], to [[William Clito]], son of Henry I's older brother, [[Robert Curthose]]. Henry I had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to Normandy. Finally Fulk achieved his goal through the marriage of Geoffrey and Matilda. Fulk then passed his titles to Geoffrey and became [[King of Jerusalem]].<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}.</ref>\n\n==Angevin kings==\n{{See also|Angevin kings of England}}\n\n===Arrival in England===\n{{further|The Anarchy}}\n[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Map of King Henry the second's continental holdings in 1154 covering parts of today's France|[[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s continental holdings in 1154 (in various shades of red), forming part of the \"[[Angevin Empire]]\"]]\n\nWhen Henry II was born in 1133, his grandfather, Henry I, was reportedly delighted, saying that the boy was \"the heir to the kingdom\".<ref name=\"Gillingham 2001 11\u201312\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> The birth reduced the risk that the king's realm would pass to his son-in-law's family, which might have occurred if the marriage of Matilda and Geoffrey had proved childless. The birth of a second son, also named [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], increased the likelihood that, in accordance with French custom, Henry would receive the English maternal inheritance and Geoffrey the Angevin paternal inheritance. This would separate the realms of England and Anjou.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2001 11\u201312\"/> In order to secure an orderly succession, Geoffrey and Matilda sought more power from Henry I, but quarrelled with him after the king refused to give them power that might be used against him. When he died in December 1135, the couple were in Anjou, allowing Matilda's cousin [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]] to seize the crown of England. Stephen's contested accession initiated the widespread civil unrest later called the Anarchy.<ref name=Schama2000p117>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=117}}</ref>\n\nCount Geoffrey had little interest in England. Instead he commenced a ten-year war for the duchy of Normandy, but it became clear that to bring this conflict to a successful conclusion Stephen would need to be challenged in England so in 1139 Matilda and her half-brother, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert]] invaded England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=15}}</ref> From the age of nine, Henry was repeatedly sent to England to be the male figurehead of the campaigns, since it became apparent that he would become king if England was conquered. In 1141 Stephen was captured at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] and later exchanged for Robert who had also been captured. Geoffrey continued the conquest of Normandy and in 1150 transferred the duchy to Henry while retaining the primary role in the duchy's government.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\nThree events allowed the Angevins' successful termination of the conflict:\n* Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the division of his realm between Henry and Henry's younger brother Geoffrey, who would have inherited Anjou. According to [[William of Newburgh]], who wrote in the 1190s, Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou for as long as he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen. Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore an oath that the young Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=18}}</ref> [[W. L. Warren]] cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source, it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would consider such an oath binding and it would break the inheritance practice of the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1973|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> The young Geoffrey died in 1158, before receiving Anjou, but he had become [[count of Nantes]] when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler.

Consequently, the Angevins acquired the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=60\u201361}}</ref>\n* Stephen's wife and elder son, [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]],  died in 1153 leading to the [[Treaty of Wallingford]]. The treaty agreed the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142, recognised Henry as Stephen's heir, guaranteed Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]] his father's estates and allowed Stephen to be king for life.

Becket's defiance as Archbishop alienated the king and his counsellors. Henry and Becket had repeated disputes over issues such as church tenures, the marriage of Henry's brother, and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket and other English bishops to recognise sixteen ancient customs in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], governing relations between the king, his courts and the church. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry tried to ruin him by filing legal cases relating to Becket's previous tenure as chancellor. Becket fled and remained in exile for five years. Relations later improved, and Becket returned, but they declined again when Henry's son was crowned as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]], which Becket perceived as a challenge to his authority. Becket later excommunicated those who had offended him. When he received this news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Four of Henry's knights killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a failed arrest attempt. Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death throughout Christian Europe.

Henry later gave Ireland to his youngest son, John.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=28\u201329}}</ref> In 1172 Henry gave John the castles of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]], [[Loudun]] and [[Mirebeau]] as a wedding gift. This angered Henry's eighteen-year-old son, [[Henry the Young King]], who believed these were his. A [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|rebellion]] by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons ensued. [[Louis VII of France]] supported the rebellion. [[William the Lion]], king of the Scots, and others joined the revolt.

This resulted in further conflict. The younger Henry rebelled again, but died of [[dysentery]]. Geoffrey died in 1186 after an accident in a tournament. In 1189, Richard and [[Philip II of France]] reasserted their various claims exploiting the aging Henry's failing health. Henry was forced to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard his sole heir. The old King died two days later, defeated and miserable.

Opinion of Richard has fluctuated. Although he was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners, he had rejected and humiliated the sister of the king of France, deposed the king of Cyprus and later sold the island, he made enemies on the [[Third Crusade]] such as [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]] by showing disrespect to his banners as well as refusing to share the spoils of war, and was rumoured to have arranged the assassination of [[Conrad of Montferrat]].

In Richard's absence, Philip II overran large portions of Normandy and John acquired control of Richard's English lands. After returning to England, Richard forgave John and re-established his authority in England.

The pope offered Henry's brother [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], but the military cost of displacing the incumbent [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick]] was prohibitive. [[Matthew Paris]] wrote that Richard stated: \"You might as well say, 'I make you a present of the moon \u2013 step up to the sky and take it down'.\" Instead, Henry purchased the kingdom for his son Edmund, which angered many powerful barons. The barons led by Henry's brother-in-law Simon de Montfort forced him to agree to the [[Provisions of Oxford]], under which his debts were paid in exchange for substantial reforms. In France, with the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]], Henry formally surrendered the territory of his Angevin ancestors to [[Louis IX of France]], receiving in return the title duke of Aquitaine and the territory of Gascony as a vassal of the French king.<ref name=\"RidgewayH3ONDB\"/>\n\n[[File:Montfort Evesham.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a 13th-century representation of the death of Simon de Montfort|Death of Simon de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]]]]\n\nDisagreements between the barons and the king intensified.

Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the [[Statutes of Mortmain]], Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when [[Philip IV of France]] confiscated the Duchy of [[Gascony]] in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting [[Model Parliament|assembly]] in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants.

[[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] claimed to rule [[North Wales]] \"entirely separate from\" England but Edward viewed him to be \"a rebel and disturber of the peace\". Edward's determination, military experience and skilful naval manoeuvres ended what was to him rebellion. The invasion was executed by one of the largest armies ever assembled by an English king, comprising Anglo-Norman cavalry and Welsh archers and laying the foundation for future victories in France. Llywelyn was driven into the mountains, later dying in battle. The [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] established England's authority over Wales, and Edward's son was proclaimed the first English [[Prince of Wales]] upon his birth. Edward spent vast sums on his two Welsh campaigns with a large portion of it spent on a network of castles.<ref name=\"EIODNB\" />\n\nEdward asserted that the [[List of Scottish monarchs|king of Scotland]] owed him feudal allegiance, and intended to unite the two nations by marrying his son [[Edward II of England|Edward]] to [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]], the sole heir of King [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].<ref name=\"EIODNB\" /> When Margaret died in 1290, [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|competition for the Scottish crown]] ensued. By invitation of Scottish magnates, Edward I resolved the dispute, ruling in favour of [[John Balliol]], who duly swore loyalty to him and became king. Edward insisted that he was Scotland's sovereign and possessed the right to hear appeals against Balliol's judgements, undermining Balliol's authority. Balliol allied with France in 1295; Edward invaded Scotland the following year, deposing and exiling Balliol.<ref name=\"EIODNB\" />\n\nEdward was less successful in Gascony, which was overrun by the French. With his resources depleting, Edward was forced to reconfirm the Charters, including Magna Carta, to obtain the necessary funds. In 1303 the French king restored Gascony to Edward by signing the [[Treaty of Paris (1303)|Treaty of Paris]]. Meanwhile, [[William Wallace]] rose in Balliol's name and recovered most of Scotland.

To reach agreement, clauses were removed that would have had Edward renounce his claim to the French crown in return for territory in Aquitaine and the town of Calais. These were entered in another agreement to be effected only after the transfer of territory by November 1361 but both sides prevaricated over their commitments for the following nine years. Hostages from the Valois family were held in London while John returned to France to raise his ransom.

Edmund was married to Isabella, a daughter of King Peter of Castile and [[Mar\u00eda de Padilla]] and the sister of Constance of Castile, who was the second wife of Edmund's brother John of Gaunt. Both of Edmund's sons were killed in 1415. The younger, [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Richard]], became involved in the [[Southampton Plot]], a conspiracy to depose Henry V in favour of Richard's brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer. When Mortimer revealed the plot to the king, Richard was executed for treason. Richard's childless older brother [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward]] was killed at the Battle of Agincourt later the same year. [[Constance of York]] was Edmund's only daughter and was an ancestor of Queen [[Anne Neville]]. The increasingly interwoven Plantagenet relationships were demonstrated by Edmund's second marriage to [[Joan Holland]]. Her sister [[Alianore Holland, Countess of March|Alianore Holland]] was mother to Richard's wife, Anne Mortimer. [[Margaret Holland]], another of Joan's sisters, married [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John of Gaunt's son]].

Within months of his father's death, Richard's childless uncle, Edward Duke of York, was killed at Agincourt. Richard was allowed to inherit the title of Duke of York in 1426. In 1432 he acquired the earldoms of March and Ulster on the death of his maternal uncle Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who had died campaigning with Henry V in France, and the earldom of Cambridge which had belonged to his father. Being descended from Edward III in both the maternal and the paternal line gave Richard a significant claim to the throne if the Lancastrian line should fail, and by [[cognatic primogeniture]] arguably a superior claim.<ref name=\"ODNBRoY\">{{harvnb|Watts|2011|}}</ref>  He emphasised the point by being the first to assume the Plantagenet surname in 1448.

She was the eldest daughter of Edward IV, and all their children were his cognatic heirs. Indeed, [[Polydore Vergil]] noted Henry VIII's pronounced resemblance to his grandfather Edward: \"For just as Edward was the most warmly thought of by the English people amongst all English kings, so this successor of his, Henry, was very much like him in general appearance, in greatness of mind and generosity and for that reason was the most acclaimed and approved of all.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2009|p=305}}</ref>\n\nThis did not deter [[Margaret of York|Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy]]{{mdash}}Edward's sister and Elizabeth's aunt{{mdash}}and members of the de la Pole family{{mdash}}children of Edward's sister and [[John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk]]{{mdash}} from frequent attempts to destabilise Henry's regime.<ref name=\"ODNBMoY\">{{harvnb|Jones|2008|}}</ref> Henry imprisoned Margaret's nephew [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward, Earl of Warwick]], the son of her brother George, in the Tower of London, but in 1487 Margaret financed a rebellion led by [[Lambert Simnel]] pretending to be Edward.

Edmund did not possess sufficient finances to maintain his status as a duke, so as a compromise he accepted the title of earl of Suffolk. Financial difficulties led to frequent legal conflicts and Edmund's indictment for murder in 1501. He fled with his brother Richard, while their remaining brother, William, was imprisoned in the Tower{{mdash}}where he would remain until his death 37 years later{{mdash}}as part of a general suppression of Edmund's associates [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] had been holding Edmund and in 1506 he returned him to Henry. Edmund was imprisoned in the Tower. In 1513, he was executed after Richard de la Pole, whom [[Louis XII of France]] had recognised as king of England the previous year, claimed the kingship in his own right.<ref name =EDLP>{{harvnb|Cunningham|2008|}}</ref> Richard, known as the White Rose, plotted an invasion of England for years but was killed in 1525 at the [[Battle of Pavia]] while fighting as the captain of the French [[landsknechts]] during [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France]]'s invasion of Italy.<ref name=RDLP>{{harvnb|Cunningham|2004a|}}</ref>\n\n===Pole===\n[[File:El cardenal Reginald Pole, por Sebastiano del Piombo.jpg|thumb|Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]]|upright|alt=Ancient oil painting of Cardinal Pole]]\n\nWarwick's sister, and therefore Edward IV's niece, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]], was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, the cause was more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Clarence]], was a legal bar to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to [[Sir Richard Pole]], his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the [[Earl of Salisbury|earldom of Salisbury]] and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from [[Anne Boleyn]], the only woman in 16th-century England to hold a peerage title in her own right.<ref name=Pole>{{harvnb|Pierce|2015|}}</ref>\n\nHer daughter [[Ursula Pole, Baroness Stafford|Ursula]] married the son of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]]. Buckingham's fall after arguments with the king over property, and Margaret's open support for [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Mary I of England|Princess Mary]] began the Poles' estrangement from the king. Hope of reconciliation was dashed by ''De unitate'', the letter that Margaret's son [[Reginald Pole]] wrote to Henry VIII, in which Reginald declared his opposition to the royal supremacy. In 1538 evidence came to light that Pole family members in England had been in communication with Reginald. Margaret's sons [[Geoffrey Pole|Geoffrey]] and [[Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu|Henry]] were arrested for treason along with several friends and associates, including Henry's wife and brother-in-law{{mdash}}[[Sir Edward Neville|Edward Neville]]. Among those arrested was the king's cousin [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter]], his wife and 11-year-old son. Courteney's wife was released two years later, but their son spent 15 years in the Tower until Queen Mary released him. Except for the surviving Geoffrey Pole, all the others implicated were beheaded.<ref name=Courteney>{{harvnb|Cooper|2008|}}</ref>\n\nMargaret was attainted. The possibility of an invasion involving Reginald via her south coast estates and her embittered relationship with Henry VIII precluded any chance of pardon. However, the decision to execute her seems a spontaneous, rather than a premeditated, act. According to the Calendar of State Papers her execution was botched at the hands of \"a wretched and blundering youth&nbsp;... who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner\". In 1886 she was beatified by Pope [[Leo XIII]] on the grounds she had laid down her life for the [[Holy See]] \"and for the truth of the orthodox Faith\".<ref name=Pole />\n\n===Stafford===\nEdward Stafford,  Duke of Buckingham, combined multiple lines of Plantagenet descent: from Edward III by his son Thomas of Woodstock, from Edward III via two of his Beaufort grandchildren, and from Edward I from Joan of Kent and the [[Holland family]]. His father failed in his rebellion against Richard III in 1483 but was restored to his inheritance on the reversal of his father's attainder late in 1485. His mother married Henry VII's uncle [[Jasper Tudor]], and his wardship was entrusted to the king's mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]. In 1502, during Henry VII's illness, there was debate as to whether Buckingham or Edmund de la Pole should act as regent for Henry VIII. There is no evidence of continuous hostility between Buckingham and Henry VIII, but there is little doubt of the duke's dislike of [[Thomas Wolsey]], whom he believed to be plotting to ruin the old nobility. Therefore, Henry VIII instructed Wolsey to watch Buckingham, his brother [[Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]], and three other peers. Neither Henry VIII nor his father planned to destroy Buckingham because of his lineage and Henry VIII even allowed Buckingham's son and heir, [[Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford]], to marry Ursula Pole, giving the Staffords a further line of royal blood descent. Buckingham himself was arrested in April 1521; he was found guilty on 16 May and executed the next day. Evidence was provided that the duke had been listening to prophecies that he would be king and that the Tudor family lay under God's curse for the execution of Warwick. This was said to explain Henry VIII's failure to produce a male heir. Much of this evidence consisted of ill-judged comments, speculation and bad temper, but it underlined the threat presented by Buckingham's descent.<ref name=Stafford>{{harvnb|Davies|2008|}}</ref>\n\n===Tudor succession===\n{{Main|Succession to Elizabeth I of England}}\nAs late as 1600, with the Tudor succession in doubt, older Plantagenet lines remained as possible claimants to a disputed throne, and religious and dynastic factors gave rise to complications. [[Thomas Wilson (record keeper)|Thomas Wilson]] wrote in his report ''The State of England, Anno Domini 1600'' that there were 12 \"competitors\" for the succession. At the time of writing (about 1601), Wilson had been working on intelligence matters for [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Lord Buckhurst]] and [[Sir Robert Cecil]].<ref name=WilsonTom>{{harvnb|Kelsey|2008|}}</ref>\nThe alleged competitors included five descendants of Henry VII and Elizabeth, including the eventual successor [[James I of England]], but also seven from older Plantagenet lines:<ref name=Pro>{{harvnb|Public Records Office|1870|}}</ref>\n\n* [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon]]\n* [[George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon]]\n* [[Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland]]\n* [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]]\n* [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]]\n* [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma]]\n* [[Philip III of Spain]] and his infant daughter\n\n[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice of the King's Bench]], argued that by 1626 the House of Plantagenet could not be considered to remain in existence in a speech during the Oxford Peerage case, which was to rule on who should inherit the [[Earl of Oxford|earldom of Oxford]]. It was referred by [[Charles I of England]] to the [[House of Lords]], who called for judicial assistance. Crewe said:\n\n<blockquote>I have labored to make a covenant with myself, that affection may not press upon judgement; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it.

Enriquez''' (November 24, 1942 &ndash; August 31, 1994), also known as Doc E, was a social psychologist and the Father of [[Filipino psychology]] \"''Ama ng Sikolohiyang Pilipino\"''. He was born on November 24, 1942 at Santol, Balagtas formally Bigaa, Bulacan. He was the youngest of 5 children to Arsenio Libiran Enriquez and Rosario Galvez Gaspar. He is the founder of the ''Pambansang Samahan sa Sikolohiyang Pilipino'', (corporate name: National Association for Sikolohiyang Pilipino, Inc.). \n\nThrough his efforts and discoveries, the concept of psychology has gradually been acknowledged by more people in the Philippines and other non-western cultures. The research model he used provided valuable information on culture-as-target and culture-as-source approach which have a tremendous influence in regulating practical applications.<ref name=\":1\" /> Before Enriquez, the study of psychology in the Philippines was not productive due to a language barrier; a large amount of psychological literature from Western history was only available in English. Enriquez's work inspired Filipino researchers with the concept of Western research methods in psychology and have broadened the view of [[cross-cultural psychology]].\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFilipino psychology remains a controversial topic. From the perspective of future development, Filipino psychology will pay more attention to individual and feminist treatments. The current therapeutic methods given in Filipino psychology are more group-oriented instead of individual-based thus individual patients will not receive precise treatments and follow-up diagnosis corresponding to their conditions. There is still an issue of unstandardized testing instruments in terms of therapeutic techniques which lack proper regulations.<ref name=\":1\" /> In spite of its imperfections, the growth of Filipino psychology has contributed to the increased social acceptance for psychological disorders and initiative for seeking effective treatments.\n\n== Education  ==\nEnriquez earned his B.A. in Philosophy from the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1961. In 1966, he attended [[Northwestern University|Northwestern University in Evanston]], Illinois, to pursue a Masters, and later a Doctorate degree in social psychology. He then returned to the Philippines in 1971 to continue teaching psychology. [[Filipino psychology]] was created because he noticed that scholars and intellectuals in the Philippines were dissatisfied with the Western-oriented take on psychology as their models did not fit with Filipino culture and behavior. As such, he focused more on a Filipino-oriented teaching model in his teaching and research including using Filipino to lecture and exam.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pe\u2010Pua|first=Rogelia|last2=Protacio\u2010Marcelino|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=2000|title=Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology): A legacy of Virgilio G.

Enriquez''' (November 24, 1942 &ndash; August 31, 1994), also known as Doc E, was a social psychologist and the Father of [[Filipino psychology]] \"''Ama ng Sikolohiyang Pilipino\"''. He was born on November 24, 1942 at Santol, Balagtas formally Bigaa, Bulacan. He was the youngest of 5 children to Arsenio Libiran Enriquez and Rosario Galvez Gaspar. He is the founder of the ''Pambansang Samahan sa Sikolohiyang Pilipino'', (corporate name: National Association for Sikolohiyang Pilipino, Inc.). \n\nThrough his efforts and discoveries, the concept of psychology has gradually been acknowledged by more people in the Philippines and other non-western cultures. The research model he used provided valuable information on culture-as-target and culture-as-source approach which have a tremendous influence in regulating practical applications.<ref name=\":1\" /> Before Enriquez, the study of psychology in the Philippines was not productive due to a language barrier; a large amount of psychological literatures from Western history was only available in English. Enriquez's work inspired Filipino researchers with the concept of Western research methods in psychology and have broadened the view of [[cross-cultural psychology]].\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFilipino psychology remains a controversial topic. From the perspective of future development, Filipino psychology will pay more attention to individual and feminist treatments. The current therapeutic methods given in Filipino psychology are more group-oriented instead of individual based thus individual patients will not receive precise treatments and follow-up  diagnosis corresponding to their conditions. There is still an issue of unstandardized testing instruments in terms of therapeutic techniques which lack proper regulations.<ref name=\":1\" /> In spite of its imperfections, the growth of Filipino psychology has contributed to the increased social acceptance for psychological disorders and initiative for seeking effective treatments.\n\n== Education  ==\nEnriquez earned his B.A. in Philosophy from the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1961. In 1966, he attended [[Northwestern University|Northwestern University in Evanston]], Illinois, to pursue a Masters, and later a Doctorate degree in social psychology. He then returned to the Philippines in 1971 to continue teaching psychology. [[Filipino psychology]] was created because he noticed that scholars and intellectuals in the Philippines were dissatisfied with the Western-oriented take on psychology as their models did not fit with Filipino culture and behaviour. As such, he focused more on a Filipino-oriented teaching model in his teaching and research including using Filipino to lecture and exam.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pe\u2010Pua|first=Rogelia|last2=Protacio\u2010Marcelino|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=2000|title=Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology): A legacy of Virgilio G.

He also said that a Filipino can better understand himself and in turn, is able to improve his life more.

Gravity is weaker in Pandora, thereby giving rise to gigantism. There is a strong magnetic field, causing plants to develop 'magnetotropism'. A particularly intriguing quality of flora and fauna in Pandora is their ability to communicate with each other. This is explained in the movie as a phenomenon called 'signal transduction', pertaining to how plants perceive a signal and respond to it.\n\n===In video games===\nVideo games frequently feature fictional plants as items that can be collected by the player, or occasionally appear as non-player characters. \n\n* The [[Monster Hunter]] series has multiple fictional flowers and plants that can be gathered by the player character, including nulberries, might seeds, flowferns, and dragonstrike nuts.\n*'''Sunflower''' from the [[Plants vs Zombies]] series it's a flower which is used to collect sunlight for you, a point which is extremely useful to place other defensive plants.\n* The [[Legend of Zelda]] series, plants play a significant role.

Mongul first uses it in \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", a story by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] that was first published in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985) and later adapted into the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1 (2004\u201305)|episode of the same name]] and for one episode of \"[[Supergirl (2015 TV series)|Supergirl]]\" called \"For the Girl Who Has Everything\", where in that episode the plant was sent by Kryptonian [[Non (comics)]]. Described in the original story by Mongul as \"something between a plant and an intelligent fungus\", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of [[symbiosis]], and feeds from the victim's \"[[bio-aura]]\". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of \"shrugging off\" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling too do so unaided.<ref name=ActionAnnual11>[[Moore, Alan]] (w), [[Gibbons, Dave]] (a). \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985). [[DC Comics]].</ref>\n\nThe Black Mercy is typically depicted as consisting of dark green, thorned vines that attach themselves to a humanoid victim's upper torso, with a set of pink flowers, each with a long, red, tentacle-like [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]], growing in the center of the victim's chest. When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can be pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/> Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though [[Oliver Queen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline when they are both trapped by the same plant, as this meant that the two were sharing an illusion and Hal's strength of will caused Oliver to experience what ''Hal'' believed was his friend's greatest desire rather than Oliver making the choice himself.<ref name=APerfectLife>[[Johns, Geoff]] (w), [[Pacheco, Carlos]] (p), Merino, Jesus (i). \"A Perfect Life: Chapters 1-2\", ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (Vol. 4) #7-8 (February\u2013March 2006).

When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Jordan was caught in the same illusion as Oliver Queen, which resulted in Jordan creating what ''he'' believed would be Queen's perfect life rather than Queen experiencing his own idea of a perfect life, allowing Queen to see through its simulation and thus awaken from it.<ref name=APerfectLife/>\n\n==In mythology==\n* '''[[Aglaophotis]]''': A type of Peony said to be magical\n*'''[[Austras koks]]''': a tree which grows from the start of the Sun's daily journey across the sky in [[Latvian mythology]]\n* '''Barnacle tree''': mythical tree believed in the [[Middle Ages]] to have barnacles that opened to reveal [[Barnacle goose|geese]].

Gravity is weaker in Pandora, thereby giving rise to gigantism. There is a strong magnetic field, causing plants to develop 'magnetotropism'. A particularly intriguing quality of flora and fauna in Pandora is their ability to communicate with each other. This is explained in the movie as a phenomenon called 'signal transduction', pertaining to how plants perceive a signal and respond to it.\n\n===In video games===\nVideo games frequently feature fictional plants as items that can be collected by the player, or occasionally appear as non-player characters. \n\n* The [[Monster Hunter]] series has multiple fictional flowers and plants that can be gathered by the player character, including nulberries, might seeds, flowferns, and dragonstrike nuts.\n*'''Sunflower''' from the [[Plants vs Zombies]] series it's a flower which is used to collect sunlight for you, a point which is extremely useful to place other defensive plants.\n* The [[Legend of Zelda]] series, plants play a significant role.

In [[Breath of the Wild]] in particular, the game is full of flowers and herbs that convey different abilities to [[Link]], including the '''Silent Princess''', [[Princess Zelda]]'s favourite flower.

Mongul first uses it in \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", a story by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] that was first published in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985) and later adapted into the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1 (2004\u201305)|episode of the same name]] and for one episode of \"[[Supergirl (2015 TV series)|Supergirl]]\" called \"For the Girl Who Has Everything\", where in that episode the plant was sent by Kryptonian [[Non (comics)]]. Described in the original story by Mongul as \"something between a plant and an intelligent fungus\", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of [[symbiosis]], and feeds from the victim's \"[[bio-aura]]\". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of \"shrugging off\" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling too do so unaided.<ref name=ActionAnnual11>[[Moore, Alan]] (w), [[Gibbons, Dave]] (a). \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985). [[DC Comics]].</ref>\n\nThe Black Mercy is typically depicted as consisting of dark green, thorned vines that attach themselves to a humanoid victim's upper torso, with a set of pink flowers, each with a long, red, tentacle-like [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]], growing in the center of the victim's chest. When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can be pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/> Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though [[Oliver Queen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline when they are both trapped by the same plant, as this meant that the two were sharing an illusion and Hal's strength of will caused Oliver to experience what ''Hal'' believed was his friend's greatest desire rather than Oliver making the choice himself.<ref name=APerfectLife>[[Johns, Geoff]] (w), [[Pacheco, Carlos]] (p), Merino, Jesus (i). \"A Perfect Life: Chapters 1-2\", ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (Vol. 4) #7-8 (February\u2013March 2006). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the video game, ''[[Injustice 2]]'' Supergirl mentions Black Mercy in pre-battle dialogue with Scarecrow. She states dealing with him is no different than dealing with Black Mercy, causing Scarecrow to ask her what is Black Mercy out of curiosity, causing Supergirl to describe it as an evil space plant.\n\nCharacters who have experienced the Black Mercy include:\n*'''Superman''' sees himself on a still-intact Krypton with his biological parents, married to a retired actress named Lyla, and a son named Van.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/> \n*'''Batman''' envisions a life in which his parents were not murdered during his childhood, and he is married to [[Kathy Kane]].<ref name=ActionAnnual11/>\n*'''Mongul''' envisions a life in which he successfully kills Superman, before setting out across the universe, killing all of his enemies, entire populations kneeling before him amid his destruction of countless galaxies.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/><ref>[[Jurgens, Dan]] (w), [[Zircher, Patrick]] (a). \"Revenge, Part I\".

When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Green Arrow was caught along with Hal Jordan, with the result that he saw what Hal believed would be his perfect life.<ref name=APerfectLife/>\n*'''Hal Jordan''' envisions a life in which his parents and his siblings are present in his life, and Sinestro is a friend who fights by his side as a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Jordan was caught in the same illusion as Oliver Queen, which resulted in Jordan creating what ''he'' believed would be Queen's perfect life rather than Queen experiencing his own idea of a perfect life, allowing Queen to see through its simulation and thus awaken from it.<ref name=APerfectLife/>\n\n==In mythology==\n* '''[[Aglaophotis]]''': A type of Peony said to be magical\n*'''[[Austras koks]]''': a tree which grows from the start of the Sun's daily journey across the sky in [[Latvian mythology]]\n* '''Barnacle tree''': mythical tree believed in the [[Middle Ages]] to have barnacles that opened to reveal [[Barnacle goose|geese]].

Season 1 Anime English Dub Review | work=The Fandom Post | date=February 16, 2016 | accessdate=April 26, 2016 | last=Smith | first=G.B. | quote=Maki is a shy girl who covers up that shyness with haughtiness and aloofness, all of which is conveyed well by veteran actress Caitlin Glass, who will be most familiar from her many roles in dubs made in Texas. It's a recognizable voice from her, not in any strange range or pitch, but most important is the tone and feel of the voice, which brings us Maki's aloofness covering up her shyness very well. She sounds reluctant but really does want to have friends, even with all the inconveniences that come with them.}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016 || ''[[No-Rin]]'' || Wakadanna || || <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-12-11/funimation-announces-no-rin-english-dub-cast/.96421|title=Funimation Announces No-Rin English Dub Cast|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016 || ''[[Dimension W]]'' || Red || Ep. 4 || <ref>{{cite episode | at=Closing credits | title=The Mystery Hidden in Lake Yasogami | work=Funimation  | series=Dimension W | serieslink=Dimension W  | number=4 | year=2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016 || ''[[Garo: The Animation]]'' || Aurelia || Ep. 4 || <ref>{{cite episode | at=Closing credits | title=Bloodville | work=Funimation  | series=Garo: The Animation | serieslink=Garo: The Animation | number=4 | year=2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{dts|2016|05|04|format=y}}\u2013Present || ''[[My Hero Academia]]'' || Mina Ashido || || <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-27/funimation-offers-english-broadcast-dub-for-my-hero-academia-anime/.101530|title=Funimation Offers English Broadcast Dub for My Hero Academia Anime (Updated)|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=March 27, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n|2016\n|''[[Sh\u014dnen Maid]]''\n|Antaro\n|ADR Director\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/HueHueAnime/status/739807078483693568|title=How do you make an anime puppy any cuter than it already is?

It's a recognizable voice from her, not in any strange range or pitch, but most important is the tone and feel of the voice, which brings us Maki's aloofness covering up her shyness very well. She sounds reluctant but really does want to have friends, even with all the inconveniences that come with them.}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016 || ''[[No-Rin]]'' || Wakadanna || || <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-12-11/funimation-announces-no-rin-english-dub-cast/.96421|title=Funimation Announces No-Rin English Dub Cast|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016 || ''[[Dimension W]]'' || Red || Ep. 4 || <ref>{{cite episode | at=Closing credits | title=The Mystery Hidden in Lake Yasogami | work=Funimation  | series=Dimension W | serieslink=Dimension W  | number=4 | year=2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016 || ''[[Garo: The Animation]]'' || Aurelia || Ep. 4 || <ref>{{cite episode | at=Closing credits | title=Bloodville | work=Funimation  | series=Garo: The Animation | serieslink=Garo: The Animation | number=4 | year=2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{dts|2016|05|04|format=y}}\u2013Present || ''[[My Hero Academia]]'' || Mina Ashido || || <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-27/funimation-offers-english-broadcast-dub-for-my-hero-academia-anime/.101530|title=Funimation Offers English Broadcast Dub for My Hero Academia Anime (Updated)|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=March 27, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n|2016\n|''[[Sh\u014dnen Maid]]''\n|Antaro\n|ADR Director\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/HueHueAnime/status/739807078483693568|title=How do you make an anime puppy any cuter than it already is?
