Also in the 17th century [[Sir Thomas Molyneux, 1st Baronet|Thomas Molyneux]] made observations. The [[Clare Island Survey]] (1909\u201311) organised by [[Robert Lloyd Praeger]] was the first comprehensive biological survey carried out in the world. It became a model for studies elsewhere.\n\n==Composition of the fauna==\nDetails of the composition of the Irish fauna by group are given by Ferriss, S. E., Smith, K. G. and Inskipp, T.
