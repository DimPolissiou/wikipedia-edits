As a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' on the insistence of her mother. Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action drama&nbsp;[[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance&nbsp;''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.

As a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' on the insistence of her mother. Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action drama&nbsp;[[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance&nbsp;''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.

He was formally known as Count ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'' Luchino Visconti di Modrone, and his family is a branch of the [[Visconti of Milan]]. In his early years, he was exposed to art, music and theatre: he studied cello with the Italian cellist and composer [[Lorenzo de Paolis]] (1890\u20131965) and met the composer [[Giacomo Puccini]], the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the writer [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Visconti joined the [[Italian Communist Party]].\n\nVisconti made no secret of his [[bisexuality]]. His last partner was the [[Austria]]n actor [[Helmut Berger]], who played Martin in Visconti's film ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/damned-1970-2 |title= The Damned |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n.

He died in Rome of another stroke at the age of 69, on 17 March 1976. There is a museum dedicated to the director's work in [[Ischia]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Films===\nHe began his filmmaking career as an assistant director on [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935) and ''[[Partie de campagne]]'' (1936) through the intercession of their common friend [[Coco Chanel]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay|last=Bacon|first=Henry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521599603|location=Cambridge|pages=6}}</ref> After a short tour of the United States, where he visited Hollywood, he returned to Italy to be Renoir's assistant again, this time for ''[[Tosca (1941 film)|Tosca]]'' (1941), a production that was interrupted and later completed by German director [[Karl Koch (director)|Karl Koch]].\n\nTogether with [[Roberto Rossellini]], Visconti joined the ''[[Salon (gathering)|salotto]]'' of [[Vittorio Mussolini]] (the son of [[Benito Mussolini|Benito]], who was then the national arbitrator for cinema and other arts). Here he presumably also met [[Federico Fellini]]. With Gianni Puccini, [[Antonio Pietrangeli]] and [[Giuseppe De Santis]], he wrote the screenplay for his first film as director: ''[[Ossessione]]'' (''Obsession'', 1943), one of the first [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] movies and an unofficial adaptation of the novel ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay|last=Bacon|first=Henry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521599603|location=Cambridge|pages=14}}</ref>''.''\n\nIn 1948, he wrote and directed ''[[La terra trema]]'' (''The Earth Trembles''), based on the novel ''I Malavoglia'' by [[Giovanni Verga]]. \nVisconti continued working throughout the 1950s, but he veered away from the neorealist path with his 1954 film, ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'', shot in colour. Based on the novella by [[Camillo Boito]], it is set in Austrian-occupied Venice in 1866. In this film, Visconti combines [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[romanticism]] as a way to break away from neorealism. However, as one biographer notes, \"Visconti without [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] is like [[Fritz Lang|Lang]] without [[expressionism]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] without [[Formalist film theory|formalism]]\".<ref>Nowell-Smith, p. 9.</ref> He describes the film as the \"most Viscontian\" of all Visconti's films. Visconti returned to neorealism once more with ''[[Rocco and His Brothers|Rocco e i suoi fratelli]]'' (''Rocco and His Brothers'', 1960), the story of Southern Italians who migrate to Milan hoping to find financial stability. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the [[2nd Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1961\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |title=2nd Moscow International Film Festival (1961) |accessdate=4 November 2012 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210653/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Visconti's films became more personal. ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (''The Leopard'', 1963) is based on [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa|Lampedusa]]'s [[The Leopard|novel of the same name]] about the decline of the Sicilian aristocracy at the time of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. It starred American actor [[Burt Lancaster]] in the role of Prince Don Fabrizio. This film was distributed in America and Britain by [[Twentieth-Century Fox]], which deleted important scenes. Visconti repudiated the Twentieth-Century Fox version.\n\nIt was not until ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969) that Visconti received a nomination for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Screenplay. The film, one of Visconti's better known works, concerns a German industrialist's family which begins to disintegrate during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] consolidation of power in the 1930s. Its decadence and lavish beauty are characteristic of Visconti's aesthetic.\n\nVisconti's final film was ''[[The Innocent (1976 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1976), in which he returns to his recurring interest in infidelity and betrayal.\n\n===Theatre===\nVisconti was also a celebrated theatre and [[opera]] director. During the years 1946 to 1960 he directed many performances of the [[Rina Morelli]]-[[Paolo Stoppa]] Company with actor [[Vittorio Gassman]] as well as many celebrated productions of operas.\n\nVisconti's love of opera is evident in the 1954 ''Senso'', where the beginning of the film shows scenes from the fourth act of ''[[Il trovatore]]'', which were filmed at the [[Teatro La Fenice]] in Venice. Beginning when he directed a production at Milan's [[Teatro alla Scala]] of ''[[La vestale]]'' in December 1954, his career included a famous revival of ''[[La traviata]]'' at [[La Scala]] in 1955 with [[Maria Callas]] and an equally famous ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' (also at La Scala) in 1957 with Callas. A significant 1958 [[Royal Opera House]] (London) production of Verdi's five-act Italian version of ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (with [[Jon Vickers]]) followed, along with a ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' in [[Spoleto]] in 1958 and a famous black-and-white ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with scenery and costumes by [[Filippo Sanjust]] at the Royal Opera House in 1964. In 1966 Visconti's luscious ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' for the [[Vienna State Opera]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] was critically acclaimed. On the other hand, his austere 1969 ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' with the singers clothed in geometrical costumes provoked controversy.\n\n===Filmography===\n\n====Feature films====\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

Here he presumably also met [[Federico Fellini]]. With Gianni Puccini, [[Antonio Pietrangeli]] and [[Giuseppe De Santis]], he wrote the screenplay for his first film as director: ''[[Ossessione]]'' (''Obsession'', 1943), one of the first [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] movies and an unofficial adaptation of the novel ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay|last=Bacon|first=Henry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521599603|location=Cambridge|pages=14}}</ref>''.''\n\nIn 1948, he wrote and directed ''[[La terra trema]]'' (''The Earth Trembles''), based on the novel ''I Malavoglia'' by [[Giovanni Verga]]. \nVisconti continued working throughout the 1950s, but he veered away from the neorealist path with his 1954 film, ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'', shot in colour. Based on the novella by [[Camillo Boito]], it is set in Austrian-occupied Venice in 1866. In this film, Visconti combines [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[romanticism]] as a way to break away from neorealism. However, as one biographer notes, \"Visconti without [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] is like [[Fritz Lang|Lang]] without [[expressionism]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] without [[Formalist film theory|formalism]]\".<ref>Nowell-Smith, p. 9.</ref> He describes the film as the \"most Viscontian\" of all Visconti's films. Visconti returned to neorealism once more with ''[[Rocco and His Brothers|Rocco e i suoi fratelli]]'' (''Rocco and His Brothers'', 1960), the story of Southern Italians who migrate to Milan hoping to find financial stability. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the [[2nd Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1961\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |title=2nd Moscow International Film Festival (1961) |accessdate=4 November 2012 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210653/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Visconti's films became more personal. ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (''The Leopard'', 1963) is based on [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa|Lampedusa]]'s [[The Leopard|novel of the same name]] about the decline of the Sicilian aristocracy at the time of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. It starred American actor [[Burt Lancaster]] in the role of Prince Don Fabrizio. This film was distributed in America and Britain by [[Twentieth-Century Fox]], which deleted important scenes. Visconti repudiated the Twentieth-Century Fox version.\n\nIt was not until ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969) that Visconti received a nomination for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Screenplay. The film, one of Visconti's better known works, concerns a German industrialist's family which begins to disintegrate during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] consolidation of power in the 1930s. Its decadence and lavish beauty are characteristic of Visconti's aesthetic.\n\nVisconti's final film was ''[[The Innocent (1976 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1976), in which he returns to his recurring interest in infidelity and betrayal.\n\n===Theatre===\nVisconti was also a celebrated theatre and [[opera]] director. During the years 1946 to 1960 he directed many performances of the [[Rina Morelli]]-[[Paolo Stoppa]] Company with actor [[Vittorio Gassman]] as well as many celebrated productions of operas.\n\nVisconti's love of opera is evident in the 1954 ''Senso'', where the beginning of the film shows scenes from the fourth act of ''[[Il trovatore]]'', which were filmed at the [[Teatro La Fenice]] in Venice. Beginning when he directed a production at Milan's [[Teatro alla Scala]] of ''[[La vestale]]'' in December 1954, his career included a famous revival of ''[[La traviata]]'' at [[La Scala]] in 1955 with [[Maria Callas]] and an equally famous ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' (also at La Scala) in 1957 with Callas. A significant 1958 [[Royal Opera House]] (London) production of Verdi's five-act Italian version of ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (with [[Jon Vickers]]) followed, along with a ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' in [[Spoleto]] in 1958 and a famous black-and-white ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with scenery and costumes by [[Filippo Sanjust]] at the Royal Opera House in 1964. In 1966 Visconti's luscious ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' for the [[Vienna State Opera]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] was critically acclaimed.
