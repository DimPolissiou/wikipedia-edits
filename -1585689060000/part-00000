{"title_page": "War cabinet", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2009}}\nA '''war cabinet''' is a committee formed by a government in a time of war.   It is usually a subset of the full executive cabinet of ministers. It is also quite common for a war cabinet to have senior military officers and opposition politicians as members.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n=== First World War ===\n{{main|Lloyd George ministry}}\n[[File:The Times history of the war (1914) (14577979888).jpg|thumb|upright|The 1916 War Cabinet]]\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], lengthy cabinet discussions came to be seen as a source of vacillation in Britain's war effort. In December 1916 it was proposed that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]] should delegate decision-making to a small, three-man committee chaired by the Secretary of State for War, [[David Lloyd George]]. Asquith initially agreed (provided he retained the right to chair the committee if he chose) before changing his mind after being infuriated by an article in ''The Times'' which portrayed the proposed change as a defeat for him. The political crisis grew from this point until Asquith was forced to resign as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]; he was succeeded by [[David Lloyd George]] who thereupon formed a small war cabinet. The original members of the war cabinet were:\n\n*David Lloyd George\n*[[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon of Kedleston]] ([[Lord President of the Council]])\n*[[Bonar Law]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]])\n*[[Arthur Henderson]] (December 1916 \u2013 August 1917)\n*[[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]] (December 1916 \u2013 April 1918)\n\nLloyd George, Curzon and Bonar Law served throughout the life of the war cabinet.  Later members included:\n\n*[[Jan Smuts]] (June 1917 \u2013 January 1919)\n*[[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]] (May 1917 \u2013 January 1919)\n*[[Edward Carson]] (July 1917 \u2013 January 1918)\n*[[Austen Chamberlain]] (April 1918 \u2013 October 1919)\n*[[Eric Campbell Geddes|Sir Eric Geddes]] (January 1919 \u2013 October 1919)\n\nUnlike a normal peacetime cabinet, few of these men had departmental responsibilities \u2013 Bonar Law, and then Chamberlain, served as chancellors of the exchequer, but the rest had no specific portfolio.  Among others, the Foreign Secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], was never a member of the war cabinet, nor were the service ministers [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] and Sir [[Edward Carson]] (the latter did join, but only after leaving the Admiralty).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/edward-carson-joins-cabinet-after-reshuffle|title=Edward Carson joins cabinet after reshuffle - Century Ireland|website=Rte.ie|accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom the spring (in the northern hemisphere) of 1917, the [[Imperial War Cabinet]] was formed.  It had representation from the [[Dominion]]s. Its members were:\n\n* Lloyd George\n* Sir [[Robert Borden]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]]\n* [[Louis Botha]], [[Prime Minister of South Africa]]\n* [[Billy Hughes]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]]\n* [[William Massey]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]\n* [[Jan Smuts]]\n* the British [[Secretary of State for India]] and other senior ministers from Britain and the [[dominion]]s.\n\n===Second World War===<!-- This section is linked from [[Bill of attainder]] -->\nGermany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] early on 1 September 1939, and after to-ing and fro-ing with [[French Foreign Minister]] [[Georges Bonnet#Final attempts to stop war|Georges Bonnet]], an ultimatum was presented to the Germans and on its expiry war was declared at 11am on 3 September 1939.\n\n==== Chamberlain war ministry ====\n{{main|Chamberlain war ministry}}\nOn 3 September 1939, [[Neville Chamberlain]] announced his War Cabinet.\n\n*Prime Minister: [[Neville Chamberlain]] (Cons)\n*Lord Privy Seal: [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] (Cons)\n*Chancellor of the Exchequer: [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] (Nat. Liberal)\n*Foreign Secretary: [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Viscount Halifax]] (Cons)\n*Secretary of State for War: [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] (Nat. Liberal)\n*Secretary of State for Air: [[Kingsley Wood|Sir Kingsley Wood]] (Cons)\n*First Lord of the Admiralty: [[Winston Churchill]] (Cons)\n*Minister for the Coordination of Defence: [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Lord Chatfield]] (Nat.)\n*Minister without Portfolio: [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Lord Hankey]] (Nat. )\n\nDominated largely by Conservative ministers who served under Chamberlain's National Government between 1937 and 1939, the additions of Lord Hankey (a former Cabinet Secretary from the First World War) and Winston Churchill (strong anti-appeaser) seemed to give the Cabinet more balance. Unlike Lloyd George's War Cabinet, the members of this one were also heads of Government Departments.\n\nIn January 1940, after disagreements with the Chiefs of Staff, Hore-Belisha resigned from the National Government, refusing a move to the post of [[President of the Board of Trade]]. He was succeeded by [[Oliver Stanley]].\n\nIt was originally the practice for the Chiefs of Staff to attend all military discussions of the Chamberlain War Cabinet.  Churchill became uneasy with this, as he felt that when they attended they did not confine their comments to purely military issues.  To overcome this, a Military Co-ordination Committee was set up, consisting of the three Service ministers normally chaired by Lord Chatfield.  This together with the Service chiefs would co-ordinate the strategic ideas of 'top hats' and 'brass' and agree strategic proposals to put forward to the War Cabinet.  Unfortunately, except when chaired by the Prime Minister, the Military Co-ordinating Committee lacked sufficient authority to override a Minister \"fighting his corner\".  When Churchill took over from  Chatfield, whilst continuing to represent the Admiralty, this introduced additional problems, and did little to improve the pre-existing ones.  Chamberlain announced a further change in arrangements in the [[Norway debate]], but this (and the Military Co-ordination Committee) was overtaken by events, the Churchill War Cabinet being run on rather different principles.<ref>[[Martin Gilbert]], ''Finest Hour, Winston S Churchill 1939\u20131941'', Book Club Associates, London 1983 page 40</ref>\n\n==== Churchill war ministry ====\n{{main|Churchill war ministry}}\nWhen he became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Winston Churchill]] formed a war cabinet, initially consisting of the following members:\n\n* Prime Minister & Minister of Defence: [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]])\n* Lord President of the Council: [[Neville Chamberlain]] (Conservative)\n* Lord Privy Seal: [[Clement Attlee]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]])\n* Foreign Secretary: [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] (Conservative)\n* Minister without Portfolio: [[Arthur Greenwood]] (Labour)\n\nChurchill strongly believed that the War Cabinet should be kept to a relatively small number of individuals to allow efficient execution of the war effort. Even so, there were a number of ministers who, though they were not members of the war cabinet, were \"Constant Attenders\".<ref>Winston Churchill, ''The Hinge of Fate'', p.78. Boston, [[Houghton Mifflin]] 1950. {{ISBN|0-395-41058-4}}</ref> As the War Cabinet considered issues that pertained to a given branch of the service or government due input was obtained from the respective body.\n\nThe War Cabinet would undergo a number of changes in composition over the next five years. On 19 February 1942 a reconstructed War Cabinet was announced by Churchill consisting of the following members:<ref>Winston Churchill,''The Hinge of Fate'', p.76.

It is usually a subset of the full executive cabinet of ministers. It is also quite common for a war cabinet to have senior military officers and opposition politicians as members.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n=== First World War ===\n{{main|Lloyd George ministry}}\n[[File:The Times history of the war (1914) (14577979888).jpg|thumb|upright|The 1916 War Cabinet]]\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], lengthy cabinet discussions came to be seen as a source of vacillation in Britain's war effort. In December 1916 it was proposed that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]] should delegate decision-making to a small, three-man committee chaired by the Secretary of State for War, [[David Lloyd George]]. Asquith initially agreed (provided he retained the right to chair the committee if he chose) before changing his mind after being infuriated by an article in ''The Times'' which portrayed the proposed change as a defeat for him. The political crisis grew from this point until Asquith was forced to resign as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]; he was succeeded by [[David Lloyd George]] who thereupon formed a small war cabinet. The original members of the war cabinet were:\n\n*David Lloyd George\n*[[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon of Kedleston]] ([[Lord President of the Council]])\n*[[Bonar Law]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]])\n*[[Arthur Henderson]] (December 1916 \u2013 August 1917)\n*[[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]] (December 1916 \u2013 April 1918)\n\nLloyd George, Curzon and Bonar Law served throughout the life of the war cabinet.  Later members included:\n\n*[[Jan Smuts]] (June 1917 \u2013 January 1919)\n*[[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]] (May 1917 \u2013 January 1919)\n*[[Edward Carson]] (July 1917 \u2013 January 1918)\n*[[Austen Chamberlain]] (April 1918 \u2013 October 1919)\n*[[Eric Campbell Geddes|Sir Eric Geddes]] (January 1919 \u2013 October 1919)\n\nUnlike a normal peacetime cabinet, few of these men had departmental responsibilities \u2013 Bonar Law, and then Chamberlain, served as chancellors of the exchequer, but the rest had no specific portfolio.  Among others, the Foreign Secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], was never a member of the war cabinet, nor were the service ministers [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] and Sir [[Edward Carson]] (the latter did join, but only after leaving the Admiralty).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/edward-carson-joins-cabinet-after-reshuffle|title=Edward Carson joins cabinet after reshuffle - Century Ireland|website=Rte.ie|accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom the spring (in the northern hemisphere) of 1917, the [[Imperial War Cabinet]] was formed.  It had representation from the [[Dominion]]s. Its members were:\n\n* Lloyd George\n* Sir [[Robert Borden]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]]\n* [[Louis Botha]], [[Prime Minister of South Africa]]\n* [[Billy Hughes]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]]\n* [[William Massey]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]\n* [[Jan Smuts]]\n* the British [[Secretary of State for India]] and other senior ministers from Britain and the [[dominion]]s.\n\n===Second World War===<!-- This section is linked from [[Bill of attainder]] -->\nGermany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] early on 1 September 1939, and after to-ing and fro-ing with [[French Foreign Minister]] [[Georges Bonnet#Final attempts to stop war|Georges Bonnet]], an ultimatum was presented to the Germans and on its expiry war was declared at 11am on 3 September 1939.\n\n==== Chamberlain war ministry ====\n{{main|Chamberlain war ministry}}\nOn 3 September 1939, [[Neville Chamberlain]] announced his War Cabinet.\n\n*Prime Minister: [[Neville Chamberlain]] (Cons)\n*Lord Privy Seal: [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] (Cons)\n*Chancellor of the Exchequer: [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] (Nat. Liberal)\n*Foreign Secretary: [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Viscount Halifax]] (Cons)\n*Secretary of State for War: [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] (Nat. Liberal)\n*Secretary of State for Air: [[Kingsley Wood|Sir Kingsley Wood]] (Cons)\n*First Lord of the Admiralty: [[Winston Churchill]] (Cons)\n*Minister for the Coordination of Defence: [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Lord Chatfield]] (Nat.)\n*Minister without Portfolio: [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Lord Hankey]] (Nat. )\n\nDominated largely by Conservative ministers who served under Chamberlain's National Government between 1937 and 1939, the additions of Lord Hankey (a former Cabinet Secretary from the First World War) and Winston Churchill (strong anti-appeaser) seemed to give the Cabinet more balance. Unlike Lloyd George's War Cabinet, the members of this one were also heads of Government Departments.\n\nIn January 1940, after disagreements with the Chiefs of Staff, Hore-Belisha resigned from the National Government, refusing a move to the post of [[President of the Board of Trade]]. He was succeeded by [[Oliver Stanley]].\n\nIt was originally the practice for the Chiefs of Staff to attend all military discussions of the Chamberlain War Cabinet.  Churchill became uneasy with this, as he felt that when they attended they did not confine their comments to purely military issues.  To overcome this, a Military Co-ordination Committee was set up, consisting of the three Service ministers normally chaired by Lord Chatfield.  This together with the Service chiefs would co-ordinate the strategic ideas of 'top hats' and 'brass' and agree strategic proposals to put forward to the War Cabinet.  Unfortunately, except when chaired by the Prime Minister, the Military Co-ordinating Committee lacked sufficient authority to override a Minister \"fighting his corner\".  When Churchill took over from  Chatfield, whilst continuing to represent the Admiralty, this introduced additional problems, and did little to improve the pre-existing ones.  Chamberlain announced a further change in arrangements in the [[Norway debate]], but this (and the Military Co-ordination Committee) was overtaken by events, the Churchill War Cabinet being run on rather different principles.<ref>[[Martin Gilbert]], ''Finest Hour, Winston S Churchill 1939\u20131941'', Book Club Associates, London 1983 page 40</ref>\n\n==== Churchill war ministry ====\n{{main|Churchill war ministry}}\nWhen he became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Winston Churchill]] formed a war cabinet, initially consisting of the following members:\n\n* Prime Minister & Minister of Defence: [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]])\n* Lord President of the Council: [[Neville Chamberlain]] (Conservative)\n* Lord Privy Seal: [[Clement Attlee]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]])\n* Foreign Secretary: [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] (Conservative)\n* Minister without Portfolio: [[Arthur Greenwood]] (Labour)\n\nChurchill strongly believed that the War Cabinet should be kept to a relatively small number of individuals to allow efficient execution of the war effort. Even so, there were a number of ministers who, though they were not members of the war cabinet, were \"Constant Attenders\".<ref>Winston Churchill, ''The Hinge of Fate'', p.78. Boston, [[Houghton Mifflin]] 1950. {{ISBN|0-395-41058-4}}</ref> As the War Cabinet considered issues that pertained to a given branch of the service or government due input was obtained from the respective body.\n\nThe War Cabinet would undergo a number of changes in composition over the next five years. On 19 February 1942 a reconstructed War Cabinet was announced by Churchill consisting of the following members:<ref>Winston Churchill,''The Hinge of Fate'', p.76. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company 1950. {{ISBN|0-395-41058-4}}</ref>\n\n*Prime Minister and Minister of Defence [[Winston Churchill]] (Conservative)\n*Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs: [[Clement Attlee]] (Labour)\n*Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons: [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] (Labour)\n*Lord President of the Council: [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] (National)\n*Foreign Secretary: [[Anthony Eden]] (Conservative)\n*Minister of Production: [[Oliver Lyttelton]] (Conservative)\n*Minister of Labour: [[Ernest Bevin]] (Labour)\n\nThis War Cabinet was consistent with Churchill's view that members should also hold \"responsible offices and not mere advisors at large with nothing to do but think and talk and take decisions by compromise or majority\"<ref>Winston Churchill, ''The Hinge of Fate'', p.75.

It is evident when comparing the number of eggs produced to the number of adults that emerge each year that there is a large mortality between egg and adult stages.

Males and females of the species have differing numbers of adminicula on the pupa and thus can be sexed prior to emergence as an adult. Additionally, female pupa are larger than those of males. Before the adult moth can emerge from the host tree, the pupa must make its way to the entrance of the tunnel. It does this by bending and straightening which causes the adminicula to catch on any indentations in the tree trunk and thus propels its way up the tunnel. It proceeds in this fashion until part of the pupa is protruding on the surface of the tree and stays in this position until the adult moth emerges.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Adult ===\nAdults emerge between mid-June and July.<ref name=\":1\" /> Females spend the first several hours after emergence on the tree from which they emerged and typically do not fly until after they have mated. Conversely, males fly almost immediately after emergence and begin to look for a mate. Within seconds of emergence and prior to flying, adults expel liquid waste that can reach up to 70% of their body volume.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Newland|first=D.E|date=|title=Ecology and predation of Sesia apiformis (Clerck, 1759)(Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)|url=|journal=Entomologist's Gazette|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAdult hornet moths have clear wings that span 34\u201350&nbsp;mm.

The moth is as large as a hornet and even has the hornet's rather jerky flight when disturbed, but it has more yellow and lacks the waist between the [[abdomen]] and the [[thorax]].

The Five Dimensions)\n* [[Sir Lancelot (singer)|Sir Lancelot]]\n* [[Don Williams]]\n* [[Jimmy Buffett]]\n* [[Sam Cooke]]\n* [[Nina & Frederik]]\n* [[Pat Rolle]]\n* [[Carly Simon]]\n* [[Laura Veirs]], on her 2011 album ''Tumble Bee''\n* [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], while playing a medley of his own \"[[Can't Stand Losing You]] / [[Reggatta de Blanc]]\" while still with [[The Police]] in 1983\n* [[Ray Conniff]] Orchestra, on the album ''Happiness Is'' (1966)\n* [[James Last Orchestra]], on the album ''Music From Across The Way'' (1971)\n* The Jukebox Band, on the TV show ''[[Shining Time Station]]'', episode \"Bully for Mr. Conductor\"\n* [[Desmond Dekker]], on the [[Putamayo]] album ''Caribbean Playground''.\n* [[Lil Ugly Mane]], in a section of \"Side Two-A\" on the album ''Third Side of Tape''\n* [[Jonas Ekfeldt|Robin Cook aka Jonas Ekfeldt]]\n* [[Fisherman's Friends]], on the album ''Sole Mates''\n\n===In other languages===\nThis song has been translated into many languages. For example, in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], there exist several translations, some of which are quite well known. One Bengali version of the song became an important anthem for the [[Naxalite]] revolutionary movement in the 1970s and thus has significance for Bengali intellectuals in [[Kolkata]] society. The Bangladeshi band [[Souls (band)|Souls]] also sang their own translated version in early 1990s, which instantly became a hit in Bangladesh.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe song was covered with lyrics in Swedish by [[Schytts]] as ''Jamaica farv\u00e4l'', scoring a 1979 [[Svensktoppen]] hit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/Diverse/AppData/Isidor/files/2023/3477.txt|title=Svensktoppen 1979|website=Sverigesradio.se|accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> [[Streaplers]] recorded a 1967 Swedish-language version of the song, with the lyrics \"L\u00e5ngt l\u00e5ngt bort\".

Who knows?\u201d (https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/ex-head-sky-news-nick-pollard-papers-get-more-stories-because-broadcast-much-more-complicated/)\n\"It's interesting to see the BBC jumping through hoops of their own making on this. Last Thursday they clearly made a decision to be very, very conservative and stuck with one caption saying..\u201d\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/nick-pollard-the-man-who-put-sky-on-top-302864.html\n\n==Prominent life events==\nNick Pollard led an in-depth investigation of the 2012 Jimmy Savile scandal, which involved hundreds of reports of sexual abuse by Savile arising six months after his death in October 2011. Pollard was delegated with the task of investigating Newsnight\u2019s decision to cancel the airing of Savile\u2019s investigation in order to avoid contending with the Christmas tribute set to occur in December. The conclusion derived from The Pollard Report leads back to BBC\u2019s \u201ccritical lack of leadership and coordination\u201d that cultivated a silo mentality in the workplace. In a 2013 interview, Pollard says he didn\u2019t successfully get to the bottom of the inquiry because his sources claimed they were unable to remember many important events. BBC and The Guardian published statements praising Nick Pollard for his insightful cooperation with the investigation. \n\n==Legacy==\t\nPollard was titled \u201cThe most gifted TV journalist of his generation\u201d in 2004. The TV veteran cemented his legacy when becoming editor of News at Ten (ITN)  and being head of  Sky News (1996-2006) for 10 years. His last year was one of his strongest years after its coverage on the Buncefield oil depot explosion, a tsunami and the 7 July Bombing. This was also a changing year because in October of 2006, Sky News was given a channel relaunch. In his last year at Sky News, he handed the head position to John Ryley. \n\n==References==\nhttps://www.pressgazette.co.uk/ex-head-sky-news-nick-pollard-papers-get-more-stories-because-broadcast-much-more-complicated/\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/nick-pollard-the-man-who-put-sky-on-top-302864.html\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/22/pollard-report-patten-wields-knif\nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/pollard_review/pollard_response.pdfhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/nick-pollard-report-leveson-bbc \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pollard \nhttps://www.pressgazette.co.uk/most-gifted-tv-journalist-pollard-in-shock-exit-from-sky-news-tough-ryley-moves-in/ \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/06/nick-pollard-sky-news-bbc-news \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/06/nick-pollard-sky-news-bbc-news\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-pollard-367a415/?originalSubdomain=uk\nhttps://twitter.com/skynewshead?lang=en \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-media}}\n{{Succession box|title=Head of [[Sky News]]|before= |after= [[John Ryley]] |years= 1996 \u2013 June 2006 }}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pollard, Nick}}\n[[Category:British male journalists]]\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Jimmy Savile]]\n[[Category:People from Birkenhead]]\n[[Category:People educated at Birkenhead School]]\n[[Category:BBC newsreaders and journalists]]\n[[Category:ITN newsreaders and journalists]]\n[[Category:Sky News]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n\n\n{{UK-journalist-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2015}}\n'''George Nicholas Pollard''' (born 15 November 1950) is a British journalist and the former head of [[Sky News]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nPollard was born in [[Birkenhead]] and educated at [[Birkenhead School]],<ref name=adair>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-culture/liverpool-arts/film/2003/06/04/could-do-better-92534-13030380/|title='Could Do Better'|work=Liverpool Daily Post|location=Liverpool|accessdate=16 October 2012|last=Adair|first=Kirsti|date=4 June 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616031848/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-culture/liverpool-arts/film/2003/06/04/could-do-better-92534-13030380/#|archive-date=16 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> an [[independent school]] in the town.\n\n==Career in journalism==\nPollard started his career in journalism as a reporter at the ''Birkenhead News'', and later worked for the [[BBC]] from 1977 to 1980 in Liverpool and London.<ref name=adair/>\n\n===ITN===\nHe was executive producer at [[ITN]] from 1987 to 1992 on the ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]''.
