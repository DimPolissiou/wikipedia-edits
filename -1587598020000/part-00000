Letters ''a'' and ''b'' '''alternate''' in ''w'' if after removing from ''w'' all letters but the copies of ''a'' and ''b'' we either obtain a word ''abab''... or a word ''baba''.... In this context, we say that [[W|''w'']] is ''G''<nowiki/>'s '''word-representant''', or that ''w'' '''represents''' ''G''. For example, the [[cycle graph]] labeled by ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''s'' in clock-wise direction is word-representable because it can be represented by ''szxsyxzy''. The smallest (by the number of&nbsp; vertices) non-word-representable graph is the [[wheel graph]] ''W''<sub>5</sub>, which is the only non-word-representable graph on 6 vertices.\n\nThe definition of a word-representable graph works both in labelled and unlabelled cases since any labelling of a graph is equivalent to any other labelling. Also, the class of word-representable graphs is [[Hereditary property|hereditary]]. Word-representable graphs generalise several important classes of graphs such as [[Circle graph|circle graphs]], [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graphs]] and [[Comparability graph|comparability graphs]]. Various generalisations of the theory of word-representable graphs accommodate representation of ''any'' graph.\n\n==History==\n\nSergey Kitaev introduced the theory of word-representable graphs in 2004 based on joint research with Steven Seif<ref name=\"KS08\">S.

These fields are [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], [[computer science]], [[combinatorics on words]], and [[scheduling]]. Word-representable graphs are especially important in graph theory, since they generalise several important classes of graphs, e.g. [[Circle graph|circle graphs]], [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graphs]] and [[Comparability graph|comparability graphs]].\n\n==Early results==\n\nIt was shown in <ref name=\"KP08\" /> that a graph ''G'' is word-representable iff it is '''k-representable''' for some ''k'', that is, ''G'' can be represented by a word having ''k'' copies of each letter. Moreover, if a graph is ''k''-representable then it is also (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-representable. Thus, the notion of the '''representation number of a graph''', as the ''minimum'' ''k'' such that a graph is word-representable, is well-defined. Non-word-representable graphs have the representation number \u221e. Graphs with representation number 1 are precisely the set of [[Complete graph|complete graphs]], while graphs with representation number 2 are precisely the class of [[Circle graph|circle]] non-complete graphs. In particular, [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Forest.html forests] (except for single [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] on at most 2 vertices), [[Ladder graph|ladder graphs]] and [[Cycle graph|cycle graphs]] have representation number 2. No classification for graphs with representation number 3 is known. However, there are examples of such graphs, e.g. [[Petersen graph|Petersen's graph]] and [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrismGraph.html prisms]. Moreover, 3-[[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of any graph is 3-representable. In particular, for every graph ''G'' there exists a 3-representable graph ''H'' that contains ''G'' as a [[Graph minor|minor]] <ref name=\"KP08\" />. \n\nA graph ''G'' is '''permutationally representable''' if it can be represented by a word of the form ''p''<sub>1</sub>''p''<sub>2</sub>...''p<sub>k</sub>'', where ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is a [[permutation]]. On can also say that ''G'' is '''permutationally ''k''-representable'''. A graph is permutationally representable iff it is a [[Comparability graph|comparability graph]] <ref name=\"KS08\" />. A graph is word-representable implies that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is permutationally representable (i.e. is a [[comparability graph]]) <ref name=\"KS08\" />. Converse to the last statement is not true <ref name=\":0\" />. However, the fact that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is a [[comparability graph]] implies that the [[Clique problem|Maximum Clique problem]] is polynomially solvable on word-representable graphs <ref name=\":1\" /> <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. \n\n==Semi-transitive orientations==\n\nSemi-transitive orientations provide a powerful tool to study word-representable graphs. A directed graph is '''semi-transitively oriented''' iff it is [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AcyclicGraph.html acyclic] and for any directed path ''u''<sub>1</sub>\u2192''u''<sub>2</sub>\u2192 ...\u2192''u<sub>t</sub>'', ''t'' \u2265 2, either there is no edge from ''u''<sub>1</sub> to ''u<sub>t</sub>'' or all edges ''u<sub>i</sub>'' \u2192 ''u<sub>j</sub>'' exist for 1 \u2264 ''i'' < ''j'' \u2264 ''t''. A key theorem in the theory of word-representable graphs states that a graph is word-representable iff it admits a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As a corollary to the proof of the key theorem one obtain an upper bound on word-representants: Each non-complete word-representable graph ''G'' is 2(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03ba''(''G''))-representable, where ''\u03ba''(''G'') is the size of a maximal clique in ''G'' <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As an immediate corollary of the last statement, one has that the [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Recognition_problem recognition problem] of word-representability is in [[NP (complexity)|NP]]. In 2014, [http://fc.isima.fr/~limouzy/ Vincent Limouzy] observed that it is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete problem]] to recognise whether a given graph is word-representable <ref name=\"KL15\" /> <ref name=\":2\" />. Another important corollary to the key theorem is that any [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graph]] is word-representable. The last fact implies that many classical graph problems are NP-hard on word-representable graphs. \u00a0 \n\n==Overview of selected results==\n\n===Non-word-representable graphs===\n\n[[Wheel graph|Wheel graphs]] ''W''<sub>2''n''+1</sub>, for ''n'' \u2265 2, are not word-representable and ''W''<sub>5</sub> is the minimum (by the number of vertices) non-word-representable graph. Taking any non-comparability graph and adding an apex (a vertex connected to any other vertex), we obtain a non-word-representable graph, which then can produce infinitely many non-word-representable graphs <ref name=\"KL15\" />. Any graph produced in this way will necessarily have a triangle (a cycle of length 3), and a vertex of degree at least 5. Non-word-representable graphs of maximum degree 4 exist <ref>[[arxiv:1307.1810|A. Collins, S. Kitaev, and V. Lozin. New results on word-representable graphs, Discr. Appl.

Also, necessary and sufficient conditions for an orientation of a split graph to be semi-transitive are given in <ref name=\"KLMW2017\" />, while in <ref name=\"CKS2019\" /> [[Threshold graph|threshold graphs]] are shown to be word-representable and the split graphs are used to show that gluing two word-representable graphs in any clique of size at least 2 may, or may not result in a word-representable graph, which solved a long-standing open problem.\n\n===Graphs representable by pattern avoiding words===\n\nA graph is '''''p''-representable''' if it can be represented by a word avoiding a [[Permutation pattern|pattern]] ''p''. For example, 132-representable graphs are those that can be represented by words ''w''<sub>1</sub>w<sub>2</sub>...''w<sub>n</sub>'' where there are no 1 \u2264 ''a'' < ''b'' < ''c'' \u2264 ''n'' such that ''w<sub>a</sub>'' < ''w<sub>c</sub>'' < ''w<sub>b</sub>''.

Enumeration and Extensions of Word-representants, arXiv:1909.00019.]]</ref> of the notion of a word-representable graph are based on the observation by [https://www.math.ucsd.edu/memorials/jeffrey-remmel/ Jeff Remmel] that non-edges are defined by occurrences of the pattern 11 (two consecutive equal letters) in a word representing a graph, while edges are defined by avoidance of this pattern. For example, instead of the pattern 11, one can use the pattern 112, or the pattern, 1212, or any other binary pattern where the assumption that the alphabet is ordered can be made so that a letter in a word corresponding to 1 in the pattern is less than that corresponding to 2 in the pattern. Letting ''u'' be an ordered binary pattern we thus get the notion of a '''''u''-representable graph'''. So, word-representable graphs are just the class of 11-representable graphs. Intriguingly, '''any graph''' can be ''u''-represented assuming ''u'' is of length at least 3 <ref name=\"K2017\">[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgt.22097 S. Kitaev.

That is, we can say that if there are up to ''k'' occurrence of ''p'' formed by letters ''a'' and ''b'', then there is an edge between ''a'' and ''b''. This gives the notion of a ''k''-''p''-representable graph, and ''k''-11-representable graphs are studied in <ref name=\"CKKK2019\">[[arxiv:1803.01055|G.-S. Cheon, J. Kim, M. Kim, and A. Pyatkin.

The key results in <ref name=\"CKKK2019\" /> are that '''any''' graph is 2-11-representable and that word-representable graphs are a proper subclass of 1-11-representable graphs. Whether or not any graph is 1-11-representable is a challenging open problem.\n\nFor yet another type of relevant generalisation, [[Hans Zantema]] suggested the notion of a '''''k''-semi-transitive orientation''' refining the notion of a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"AGKZ2019\" />.

Letters ''a'' and ''b'' '''alternate''' in ''w'' if after removing from ''w'' all letters but the copies of ''a'' and ''b'' we either obtain a word ''abab''... or a word ''baba''.... In this context, we say that [[W|''w'']] is ''G''<nowiki/>'s '''word-representant''', or that ''w'' '''represents''' ''G''. For example, the [[cycle graph]] labeled by ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''s'' in clock-wise direction is word-representable because it can be represented by ''szxsyxzy''. The smallest (by the number of&nbsp; vertices) non-word-representable graph is the [[wheel graph]] ''W''<sub>5</sub>, which is the only non-word-representable graph on 6 vertices.\n\nThe definition of a word-representable graph works both in labelled and unlabelled cases since any labelling of a graph is equivalent to any other labelling. Also, the class of word-representable graphs is [[Hereditary property|hereditary]]. Word-representable graphs generalise several important classes of graphs such as [[Circle graph|circle graphs]], [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graphs]] and [[Comparability graph|comparability graphs]].

These fields are [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], [[computer science]], [[combinatorics on words]], and [[scheduling]]. Word-representable graphs are especially important in graph theory, since they generalise several important classes of graphs, e.g. [[Circle graph|circle graphs]], [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graphs]] and [[Comparability graph|comparability graphs]].\n\n==Early results==\n\nIt was shown in <ref name=\"KP08\" /> that a graph ''G'' is word-representable iff it is '''k-representable''' for some ''k'', that is, ''G'' can be represented by a word having ''k'' copies of each letter. Moreover, if a graph is ''k''-representable then it is also (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-representable. Thus, the notion of the '''representation number of a graph''', as the ''minimum'' ''k'' such that a graph is word-representable, is well-defined. Non-word-representable graphs have the representation number \u221e. Graphs with representation number 1 are precisely the set of [[Complete graph|complete graphs]], while graphs with representation number 2 are precisely the class of [[Circle graph|circle]] non-complete graphs. In particular, [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Forest.html forests] (except for single [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] on at most 2 vertices), [[Ladder graph|ladder graphs]] and [[Cycle graph|cycle graphs]] have representation number 2. No classification for graphs with representation number 3 is known. However, there are examples of such graphs, e.g. [[Petersen graph|Petersen's graph]] and [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrismGraph.html prisms]. Moreover, 3-[[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of any graph is 3-representable. In particular, for every graph ''G'' there exists a 3-representable graph ''H'' that contains ''G'' as a [[Graph minor|minor]] <ref name=\"KP08\" />. \n\nA graph ''G'' is '''permutationally representable''' if it can be represented by a word of the form ''p''<sub>1</sub>''p''<sub>2</sub>...''p<sub>k</sub>'', where ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is a [[permutation]]. On can also say that ''G'' is '''permutationally ''k''-representable'''. A graph is permutationally representable iff it is a [[Comparability graph|comparability graph]] <ref name=\"KS08\" />. A graph is word-representable implies that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is permutationally representable (i.e. is a [[comparability graph]]) <ref name=\"KS08\" />. Converse to the last statement is not true <ref name=\":0\" />. However, the fact that the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of each vertex is a [[comparability graph]] implies that the [[Clique problem|Maximum Clique problem]] is polynomially solvable on word-representable graphs <ref name=\":1\" /> <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. \n\n==Semi-transitive orientations==\n\nSemi-transitive orientations provide a powerful tool to study word-representable graphs. A directed graph is '''semi-transitively oriented''' iff it is [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AcyclicGraph.html acyclic] and for any directed path ''u''<sub>1</sub>\u2192''u''<sub>2</sub>\u2192 ...\u2192''u<sub>t</sub>'', ''t'' \u2265 2, either there is no edge from ''u''<sub>1</sub> to ''u<sub>t</sub>'' or all edges ''u<sub>i</sub>'' \u2192 ''u<sub>j</sub>'' exist for 1 \u2264 ''i'' < ''j'' \u2264 ''t''. A key theorem in the theory of word-representable graphs states that a graph is word-representable iff it admits a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As a corollary to the proof of the key theorem one obtain an upper bound on word-representants: Each non-complete word-representable graph ''G'' is 2(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03ba''(''G''))-representable, where ''\u03ba''(''G'') is the size of a maximal clique in ''G'' <ref name=\"HKP16\" />. As an immediate corollary of the last statement, one has that the [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Recognition_problem recognition problem] of word-representability is in [[NP (complexity)|NP]]. In 2014, [http://fc.isima.fr/~limouzy/ Vincent Limouzy] observed that it is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete problem]] to recognise whether a given graph is word-representable <ref name=\"KL15\" /> <ref name=\":2\" />. Another important corollary to the key theorem is that any [[Graph coloring|3-colorable graph]] is word-representable. The last fact implies that many classical graph problems are NP-hard on word-representable graphs. \u00a0 \n\n==Overview of selected results==\n\n===Non-word-representable graphs===\n\n[[Wheel graph|Wheel graphs]] ''W''<sub>2''n''+1</sub>, for ''n'' \u2265 2, are not word-representable and ''W''<sub>5</sub> is the minimum (by the number of vertices) non-word-representable graph. Taking any non-comparability graph and adding an apex (a vertex connected to any other vertex), we obtain a non-word-representable graph, which then can produce infinitely many non-word-representable graphs <ref name=\"KL15\" />. Any graph produced in this way will necessarily have a triangle (a cycle of length 3), and a vertex of degree at least 5. Non-word-representable graphs of maximum degree 4 exist <ref>[[arxiv:1307.1810|A. Collins, S. Kitaev, and V. Lozin. New results on word-representable graphs, Discr. Appl.

Also, necessary and sufficient conditions for an orientation of a split graph to be semi-transitive are given in <ref name=\"KLMW2017\" />, while in <ref name=\"CKS2019\" /> [[Threshold graph|threshold graphs]] are shown to be word-representable and the split graphs are used to show that gluing two word-representable graphs in any clique of size at least 2 may, or may not result in a word-representable graph, which solved a long-standing open problem.\n\n===Graphs representable by pattern avoiding words===\n\nA graph is '''''p''-representable''' if it can be represented by a word avoiding a [[Permutation pattern|pattern]] ''p''. For example, 132-representable graphs are those that can be represented by words ''w''<sub>1</sub>w<sub>2</sub>...''w<sub>n</sub>'' where there are no 1 \u2264 ''a'' < ''b'' < ''c'' \u2264 ''n'' such that ''w<sub>a</sub>'' < ''w<sub>c</sub>'' < ''w<sub>b</sub>''. In <ref name=\"GKZ2017\">[[arxiv:1602.08965|A. Gao, S. Kitaev, and P. Zhang. On 132-representable graphs. Australasian J.

Enumeration and Extensions of Word-representants, arXiv:1909.00019.]]</ref> of the notion of a word-representable graph are based on the observation by [https://www.math.ucsd.edu/memorials/jeffrey-remmel/ Jeff Remmel] that non-edges are defined by occurrences of the pattern 11 (two consecutive equal letters) in a word representing a graph, while edges are defined by avoidance of this pattern. For example, instead of the pattern 11, one can use the pattern 112, or the pattern, 1212, or any other binary pattern where the assumption that the alphabet is ordered can be made so that a letter in a word corresponding to 1 in the pattern is less than that corresponding to 2 in the pattern. Letting ''u'' be an ordered binary pattern we thus get the notion of a '''''u''-representable graph'''. So, word-representable graphs are just the class of 11-representable graphs. Intriguingly, '''any graph''' can be ''u''-represented assuming ''u'' is of length at least 3 <ref name=\"K2017\">[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgt.22097 S. Kitaev. Existence of u-representation of graphs, Journal of Graph Theory 85 (2017) 3, 661\u2212668.]</ref>.   \n\nAnother way to generalise the notion of a word-representable graph, again suggested by [https://www.math.ucsd.edu/memorials/jeffrey-remmel/ Jeff Remmel], is to introduce the \"degree of tolerance\" ''k'' for occurrences of a pattern ''p'' defining edges/non-edges. That is, we can say that if there are up to ''k'' occurrence of ''p'' formed by letters ''a'' and ''b'', then there is an edge between ''a'' and ''b''. This gives the notion of a ''k''-''p''-representable graph, and ''k''-11-representable graphs are studied in <ref name=\"CKKK2019\">[[arxiv:1803.01055|G.-S. Cheon, J. Kim, M. Kim, and A. Pyatkin. On ''k''-11-representable graphs. J. Combin. 10 (2019) 3, 491\u2212513.]]</ref>. Note that 0-11-representable graphs are precisely word-representable graphs. The key results in <ref name=\"CKKK2019\" /> are that '''any''' graph is 2-11-representable and that word-representable graphs are a proper subclass of 1-11-representable graphs. Whether or not any graph is 1-11-representable is a challenging open problem.\n\nFor yet another type of relevant generalisation, [[Hans Zantema]] suggested the notion of a '''''k''-semi-transitive orientation''' refining the notion of a semi-transitive orientation <ref name=\"AGKZ2019\" />. The idea here is restricting ourselves to considering ''only'' directed paths of length not exceeding ''k'' while allowing violations of semi-transitivity on longer paths. \n\n==Open problems==\n\nSome of interesting open problems on word-representable graphs are as follows:\n\n*Characterise (non-)word-representable planar graphs.\n*Characterise word-representable near-triangulations containing the complete graph ''K''<sub>4</sub> (such a characterisation is known for ''K''<sub>4</sub>-free planar graphs <ref name=\"Glen2019\">[[arxiv:1605.01688|M.

As the author of ''A Tour in the United States of America'' (1784), he used the name '''John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth'''. \n\nLeaving America during the Revolutionary War, Stuart spent the rest of his life in England and the West Indies.\n==Background and early life==\nStuart was born in Scotland in 1745 and began life there as John Smyth or John Ferdinand Smyth. He later wrote that he was the son of R. Wentworth Smyth, a gentleman who had fought in the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]] and also the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|later one of 1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, as his second wife. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], a son of Charles II, and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth|Thomas, Lord Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and her son Wentworth had been adopted by a Colonel Smyth, an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth, becoming the Colonel\u2019s heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref> Consequently, Stuart\u2019s father grew up in France.

By the 1770s, he had became a planter, renting plantations rather than owning them.<ref name=AJC/> The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to Great Britain, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution|Loyalist forces]]. He served in several regiments in the rank of captain. He later wrote that at one time he commanded an armed sloop in [[Chesapeake Bay]] and at another raised a company of men for frontier work. More than once he was taken prisoner, and was shackled for eighteen months.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nAt New York, at about the end of 1777, Captain Smyth wrote his ''Narrative or Journal of Capt. John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth, of the Queen's Rangers'', setting out his adventures, and was critical of the \u201cdeluded and mistaken\u201d rebels. This was printed in 1778.<ref>''Narrative or Journal of Capt.

In May 1779 he brought proceedings on various grounds against his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Graves Simcoe]], but they were found to be \u201cMalicious, Frivolous, Vexatious, & Groundless\u201d. Simcoe claimed that Captain Smyth \u201cavoided military service whenever possible\u201d. He was sick in quarters at a muster on 24 June 1779, and not far into 1780, he returned to England, on the grounds of ill health.<ref name=AJC/>\n\n==England and West Indies==\nStuart remained an officer on half-pay for the duration of the American War. Commissioners had been appointed to assist loyalists who had suffered losses by the war, and in 1780 they awarded Stuart a temporary allowance of \u00a3100 a year, increasing this to \u00a3200 in 1781 and to \u00a3300 in 1783. He made an application to the Privy Council to be granted [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]] in [[the Bahamas]], in view of his claimed losses of 3,300 acres in Virginia and Maryland, but he was not believed and this was rejected. His half-pay came to an end in 1783.<ref name=AJC/>\n\nIn 1784, allegations were made against Stuart to the claims commissioners, and his allowance was suspended. Stuart then wrote his book ''A Tour in the United States of America'',<ref name=dnb/> which was published by [[George Robinson (1737\u20131801)|George Robinson]] in 1784, agreeing to pay \u00a3160 for the printing. This, however, brought his account of himself to a wide public, and people who had known him in North America challenged it.<ref name=AJC/> \n\nIn 1785, Stuart went out to Jamaica, where he was appointed a Major \u201cin that Island only\u201d, but only remained there for sixteen days, as the result of a [[hurricane]].<ref name=AJC/>\n\nIn 1793, he adopted the name of Stuart, to mark his claim to descent from the [[House of Stuart]], and went on arguing his case to the government, without success.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn 1795, Stuart accepted a post as assistant barrack-master-general in [[San Domingo]] and to get there joined [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Hugh Cloberry Christian|Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian]] on an expedition to the [[West Indies]]. He was shipwrecked three times in 1795 and 1796 and was present at the British capture of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Martinique]]. In San Domingo, although not employed as a medical officer, he prescribed five grains of tartarised antimony and a tablespoonful of soft sugar for the treatment of [[yellow fever]], later claiming that this had proved a good treatment.<ref name=monthly/> On his return to England, Stuart continued to pursue his financial claims unsuccessfully, but continued to write in support of them.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn 1803, while Stuart was barrack-master at [[Billericay]], he suffered a severe beating which knocked out several of his teeth. In the final years of his life, he was barrack-master at [[Landguard Fort]], near [[Felixstowe]] in Suffolk. In 1814, Stuart retired from this work and settled in Vernon Place, [[Bloomsbury Square]].<ref name=monthly/>\n\n==Marriages and death==\nOn 23 October 1778, while he was Captain Smyth of the [[Queen's Rangers]], against her father\u2019s wishes Stuart married Abigail Haugewout, the 23-year-old daughter of Leffert Haugewout, a loyalist farmer of [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]]. They set up house in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] and had one daughter, Elizabeth, born in October 1780, but by then Smyth had gone to live in England. His pregnant wife did not go with him and lived on until 1828, on a farm of fifteen acres in Hempstead which her father gave her. In 1797, Stuart returned on a visit and met his wife in New York.

He made an application to the Privy Council to be granted [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]] in [[the Bahamas]], in view of his claimed losses of 3,300 acres in Virginia and Maryland, but he was not believed and this was rejected. His half-pay came to an end in 1783.<ref name=AJC/>\n\nIn 1784, allegations were made against Stuart to the claims commissioners, and his allowance was suspended. Stuart then wrote his book ''A Tour in the United States of America'',<ref name=dnb/> which was published by [[George Robinson (1737\u20131801)|George Robinson]] in 1784, agreeing to pay \u00a3160 for the printing.

He was shipwrecked three times in 1795 and 1796 and was present at the British capture of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Martinique]].

They set up house in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] and had one daughter, Elizabeth, born in October 1780, but by then Smyth had gone to live in England.

Later, when David's drug dealer is arrested, he finds himself holding a huge stash of narcotics and calls Dylan for help; Dylan correctly guesses that the arrested dealer is going to lead the cops to David and forces a reluctant David to flush all of the drugs down the toilet, saving David's butt because the cops don't have anything to arrest him for when they burst into the apartment. A tearful David talks to Dylan, Kelly and Donna and says he knows he needs help and is going to get some. A dangerous affair begins between Brandon and Lucinda, while her true colors are shown when she begins teaching an anthropology class of human sexuality and preaches the need for multiple partners for she sees sex as her own personal weapon.

The next day, Dylan goes to a bank and gives Kevin full power-of-attorney control over his money. But it is revealed in a climatic twist to the viewers that both of Kelly's and Jim's original suspicions about Kevin and Suzanne were entirely correct; both Suzanne and Kevin really are career criminals and con artists who have been plotting this whole time to steal all of Dylan's inheritance money and flee to Brazil with it.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - a [[naval orange]] and the main protagonist of the show. He is thought to be incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises (even his \"Nya Nya\" and his \"motorboat\"), and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths. Orange's laugh is recognizable and likes to make puns and jokes.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - a Bartlet pear and the deuteragonist of the show. He is the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series. As a result, Pear has confirmed to try to perform extreme things to deny the idea of him being boring.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel. His catchphrase is \"Neato burrito!\"\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is a cute marshmallow Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances. Marshmallow says, \"Yay!\" a lot and has a cheeky giggle.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods, although he usually fails at his tasks.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment. Grapefruit is also in love with Passion, although she doesn't like him.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies,\" a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, usually punctuated with \"Ew!,\" as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble!

This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone\n#Dumbo}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

The Christmas version of the game was released in December 2011 and the free version of the game, Kitchen Carnage Lite, was released March 2, 2012.\n\nThe aim of the game is to throw different items across the kitchen into a series of blenders before the time runs out. The player is given [[apple]]s and [[banana]]s at the start. When the second level is reached, [[tomato]]es are added. Level 3 adds [[cantaloupe]]s, level 4 [[pineapple]]s, level 5 [[strawberry|strawberries]] and level 6 adds Fred FiggleCorns.\n\n===''Splatter Up''===\n{{Main|Annoying Orange: Splatter Up}}\n''[[Annoying Orange: Splatter Up]]'' is the second game by the Annoying Orange, after ''Kitchen Carnage''.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - a [[naval orange]] and the main protagonist of the show. He is thought to be incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises (even his \"Nya Nya\" and his \"motorboat\"), and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths. Orange's laugh is recognizable and likes to make puns and jokes.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - a Bartlet pear and the deuteragonist of the show. He is the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series. As a result, Pear has confirmed to try to perform extreme things to deny the idea of him being boring.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel. His catchphrase is \"Neato burrito!\"\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is a cute marshmallow Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances. Marshmallow says, \"Yay!\" a lot and has a cheeky giggle.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods, although he usually fails at his tasks.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment. Grapefruit is also in love with Passion, although she doesn't like him.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies,\" a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four.

Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team.

While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble!

This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone\n#Dumbo}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

The Christmas version of the game was released in December 2011 and the free version of the game, Kitchen Carnage Lite, was released March 2, 2012.\n\nThe aim of the game is to throw different items across the kitchen into a series of blenders before the time runs out. The player is given [[apple]]s and [[banana]]s at the start. When the second level is reached, [[tomato]]es are added. Level 3 adds [[cantaloupe]]s, level 4 [[pineapple]]s, level 5 [[strawberry|strawberries]] and level 6 adds Fred FiggleCorns.\n\n===''Splatter Up''===\n{{Main|Annoying Orange: Splatter Up}}\n''[[Annoying Orange: Splatter Up]]'' is the second game by the Annoying Orange, after ''Kitchen Carnage''. The game is based on baseball, and the player slides a finger while a fruit enters the home plate. The faster the player slides, the farther he gets. The game sprites are the same as the ''Kitchen Carnage'' game, the only one that does not appear in this game but appear in ''Kitchen Carnage'' is Fred Figglecorn.\n\n==Pay withdrawal lawsuit==\nOn December 23, 2014, Dane Boedigheimer announced that ''The Annoying Orange'' has not been funded by Collective Digital Studios since November 2014. This has led Boedigheimer to take legal action to get paid. Due to this, the series has had a notably smaller budget since then.\n\n==TV series==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Country / region\n! Series premiere\n!

It is located in the central part of the state, northeast of [[Apache Junction, Arizona|Apache Junction]]. It is the last surviving stagecoach stop along the [[Apache Trail]]. According to the Gross Management Department of Arizona's main [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Tortilla Flat is presumed to be Arizona's smallest official \"community\" having a U.S. Post Office and voter's precinct. The town has a population of 6. Tortilla Flat can be reached by vehicles on [[Arizona State Route 88|State Route 88]], via [[Apache Junction, Arizona|Apache Junction]].\n\nOriginally a camping ground for the [[Prospecting|prospector]]s who searched for [[gold]] in the [[Superstition Mountains]] in the mid-to-late 19th century, Tortilla Flat was later a freight camp for the construction of [[Theodore Roosevelt Dam]]. From this time (1904) on, Tortilla Flat has had a small (<100 people) but continuous population. A flood in 1942 badly damaged the town, resulting in many residents moving away. Today Tortilla Flat is owned and operated by Alvin Ross, a farmer from Indiana who purchased the town in 1998. The town is made up primarily of a small store and restaurant, which were constructed in the late 1980s after a fire consumed the existing store and restaurant on the same site. Several hiking trails into the Superstition Mountains begin near Tortilla Flat.\n\n[[File:TortillaFlat-Restaurant1.JPG|thumb|250px|Restaurant at Tortilla Flat]]\n\n==History==\nBased on available records Tortilla Flat got its start because of the road construction to Roosevelt Dam in 1904. There was a need for a stagecoach stop for freight haulers on their way to the construction site at Roosevelt Dam and Tortilla Flat served that purpose. Shortly following the construction of the road, Roosevelt Dam became a big tourist attraction. At that point Tortilla Flat was a stage stop for tourists and mail carriers through the 1930s.\n\nTortilla Flat took its name from a nearby butte shaped like a [[tortilla]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8BoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BKIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1249%2C9959181 | title=Whimsical names mark Arizona towns | work=Reading Eagle | date=April 15, 2001 | accessdate=April 23, 2015 | author=Blackwood, Alisa | pages=E11}}</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Forest Service|Forest Service]] records show [[Tonto National Forest]] being established in 1905 as kind of a \"package deal\" with the [[Salt River Project|Salt River Reclamation Project]]. The Forest Service was needed to manage the land and protect watershed for the dams because cattle grazing had denuded the land. The freight camp at Tortilla Flat, as well as the other camps along the road to the dam, were, therefore, on U.S. Forest Service land.

It is located in the central part of the state, northeast of [[Apache Junction, Arizona|Apache Junction]]. It is the last surviving stagecoach stop along the [[Apache Trail]]. According to the Gross Management Department of Arizona's main [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Tortilla Flat is presumed to be Arizona's smallest official \"community\" having a U.S. Post Office and voter's precinct. The town has a population of 6. Tortilla Flat can be reached by vehicles on [[Arizona State Route 88|State Route 88]], via [[Apache Junction, Arizona|Apache Junction]].\n\nOriginally a camping ground for the [[Prospecting|prospector]]s who searched for [[gold]] in the [[Superstition Mountains]] in the mid-to-late 19th century, Tortilla Flat was later a freight camp for the construction of [[Theodore Roosevelt Dam]]. From this time (1904) on, Tortilla Flat has had a small (<100 people) but continuous population. A flood in 1942 badly damaged the town, resulting in many residents moving away. Today Tortilla Flat is owned and operated by Alvin Ross, a farmer from Indiana who purchased the town in 1998. The town is made up primarily of a small store and restaurant, which were constructed in the late 1980s after a fire consumed the existing store and restaurant on the same site. Several hiking trails into the Superstition Mountains begin near Tortilla Flat.\n\n[[File:TortillaFlat-Restaurant1.JPG|thumb|250px|Restaurant at Tortilla Flat]]\n\n==History==\nBased on available records Tortilla Flat got its start because of the road construction to Roosevelt Dam in 1904. There was a need for a stagecoach stop for freight haulers on their way to the construction site at Roosevelt Dam and Tortilla Flat served that purpose. Shortly following the construction of the road, Roosevelt Dam became a big tourist attraction. At that point Tortilla Flat was a stage stop for tourists and mail carriers through the 1930s.\n\nTortilla Flat took its name from a nearby butte shaped like a [[tortilla]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8BoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BKIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1249%2C9959181 | title=Whimsical names mark Arizona towns | work=Reading Eagle | date=April 15, 2001 | accessdate=April 23, 2015 | author=Blackwood, Alisa | pages=E11}}</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Forest Service|Forest Service]] records show [[Tonto National Forest]] being established in 1905 as kind of a \"package deal\" with the [[Salt River Project|Salt River Reclamation Project]]. The Forest Service was needed to manage the land and protect watershed for the dams because cattle grazing had denuded the land. The freight camp at Tortilla Flat, as well as the other camps along the road to the dam, were, therefore, on U.S. Forest Service land. Folks who decided to make Tortilla Flat their permanent residence kept up the lease on the land in later years whenever it came due.\n\n==Historic bridges==\n{{Gallery\n|title=Historic Mormon Flat and Boulder Creek Bridges in Tortilla Flat, Arizona\n|width=180px\n|height=200px\n|align=center\n|lines=4\n|File: Tortilla Flat-Mormon Flat Bridge-1924.JPG|Historic '''Mormon Flat Bridge''' built in 1924 and located on Highway 88 over Willow Creek, 3.8 miles west of Tortilla Flat.

The field includes [[medical diagnosis]] and treatment of [[congenital heart defect]]s, [[coronary artery disease]], [[heart failure]], [[valvular heart disease]] and [[electrophysiology]]. [[Physician]]s who specialize in this field of medicine are called '''cardiologists''', a specialty of [[internal medicine]]. Pediatric cardiologists are [[pediatrician]]s who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called '''[[cardiothoracic surgeon]]s''' or '''cardiac surgeons''', a specialty of [[general surgery]].\n\nAlthough the cardiovascular system is inextricably linked to blood, cardiology is relatively unconcerned with [[hematology]] and its diseases. Some obvious exceptions that affect the function of the heart would be blood tests ([[electrolyte]] disturbances, [[troponin]]s), decreased oxygen carrying capacity ([[anemia]], [[hypovolemic shock]]), and [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]].\n\n== Specializations ==\nAll cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist (often simply called \"cardiologist\") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of [[cardiothoracic surgery]]. For example, [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] (CABG), [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] and [[valve replacement]] are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However the insertion of stents and pacemakers is performed by cardiologists\n\n===Adult cardiology===\nCardiology is a specialty of [[internal medicine]]. To be a cardiologist in the [[United States]], a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the United States by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]] are [[cardiac electrophysiology]], [[echocardiography]], [[interventional cardiology]], and [[nuclear cardiology]]. Recognized subspecialties in the United States by the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS) include [[clinical cardiac electrophysiology]] and [[interventional cardiology]].\n<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardiologists in Delhi NCR |url=https://www.credihealth.com/doctors/delhi-ncr/cardiology|date=26 March 2019 |work=Full Details Information}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Specialties & Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=23 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813083503/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|archive-date=2015-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> While in India, a person needs to undergo three years of residency in General Medicine or Pediatrics after [[M.B.B.S]] and then three years of residency in Cardiology to be a D.M/[[Diplomate of National Board]] (DNB) in Cardiology.\n\nPer [[doximity]], adult cardiologists make an average of $436,849 in the United States.<ref name=r1>Hamblin, James (January 27, 2015) [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/physician-salaries/384846/ What Doctors Make]. theatlantic.com</ref>\n\n==== Cardiac electrophysiology ====\n{{Main|Cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\n[[Cardiac electrophysiology]] is the [[science]] of elucidating, diagnosing, and treating the electrical activities of the [[heart]].  The term is usually used to describe studies of such phenomena by invasive (intracardiac) catheter recording of spontaneous activity as well as of cardiac responses to [[programmed electrical stimulation|programmed electrical stimulation (PES)]]. These studies are performed to assess complex [[arrhythmias]], elucidate symptoms, evaluate abnormal [[electrocardiograms]], assess risk of developing arrhythmias in the future, and design treatment.  These procedures increasingly include therapeutic methods (typically [[radiofrequency ablation]], or [[cryoablation]]) in addition to diagnostic and prognostic procedures.  Other therapeutic modalities employed in this field include [[antiarrhythmic drug]] therapy and implantation of [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] and automatic [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] (AICD).<ref name=Fauci>Fauci, Anthony, et al. ''Harrison's Textbook of Medicine''. New York: McGraw Hill, 2009.</ref><ref>Braunwald, Eugene, ed. ''Heart Disease, 6th edition.'' Philadelphia: Saunders, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe cardiac [[electrophysiology study]] (EPS) typically measures the response of the injured or cardiomyopathic myocardium to PES on specific pharmacological regimens in order to assess the likelihood that the regimen will successfully prevent potentially fatal sustained [[ventricular tachycardia|ventricular tachycardia (VT)]] or [[ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation VF]] (VF) in the future. Sometimes a ''series'' of EPS drug trials must be conducted to enable the cardiologist to select the one regimen for long-term treatment that best prevents or slows the development of VT or VF following PES. Such studies may also be conducted in the presence of a newly implanted or newly replaced cardiac pacemaker or AICD.<ref name=Fauci />\n\n===== Clinical cardiac electrophysiology =====\n{{Main|Clinical cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\n[[Clinical cardiac electrophysiology]] is a branch of the medical specialty of cardiology and is concerned with the study and treatment of rhythm disorders of the heart. Cardiologists with expertise in this area are usually referred to as electrophysiologists. Electrophysiologists are trained in the mechanism, function, and performance of the electrical activities of the heart. Electrophysiologists work closely with other cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to assist or guide therapy for heart rhythm disturbances ([[arrhythmias]]). They are trained to perform interventional and surgical procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nThe training required to become an electrophysiologist is long and requires 7 to 8 years after medical school (within the U.S.). Three years of internal medicine residency, three years of Clinical Cardiology fellowship, and one to two (in most instances) years of clinical cardiac electrophysiology.\n\n==== Cardiogeriatrics ====\n{{Main|Cardiogeriatrics}}\n\n[[Cardiogeriatrics]], or geriatric cardiology, is the branch of cardiology and geriatric medicine that deals with the cardiovascular disorders in elderly people.\n\nCardiac disorders such as [[coronary heart disease]], including [[myocardial infarction]], [[heart failure]], [[cardiomyopathy]], and [[arrhythmia]]s such as [[atrial fibrillation]], are common and are a major cause of mortality in elderly people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/agingtrends/06olderpersons.pdf|title=Trends in Causes of Death among Older Persons in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Vascular disorders such as [[atherosclerosis]] and [[peripheral arterial disease]] cause significant morbidity and mortality in aged people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Golomb Beatrice A.|last2=Dang Tram T.|last3=Criqui Michael H.|date=2006-08-15|title=Peripheral Arterial Disease|journal=Circulation|volume=114|issue=7|pages=688\u2013699|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.593442|pmid=16908785}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yazdanyar|first=Ali|last2=Newman|first2=Anne B.|date=2010-11-01|title=The Burden of Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly: Morbidity, Mortality, and Costs|journal=Clinics in Geriatric Medicine|volume=25|issue=4|pages=563\u2013vii|doi=10.1016/j.cger.2009.07.007|issn=0749-0690|pmc=2797320|pmid=19944261}}</ref>\n\n==== Echocardiography ====\n{{Main|Echocardiography}}\n\nEchocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart.\n\nEchocardiography has become routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes).\n\nEchocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.\n\n==== Interventional cardiology ====\n{{Main|Interventional cardiology}}\n\nInterventional cardiology is a branch of cardiology that deals specifically with the catheter based treatment of structural heart diseases. A large number of procedures can be performed on the heart by catheterization. This most commonly involves the insertion of a sheath into the femoral artery (but, in practice, any large peripheral artery or vein) and cannulating the heart under X-ray visualization (most commonly [[Fluoroscopy]]).\n\nThe main advantages of using the interventional cardiology or radiology approach are the avoidance of the scars and pain, and long post-operative recovery. Additionally, interventional cardiology procedure of primary angioplasty is now the gold standard of care for an acute [[Myocardial infarction]]. This procedure can also be done proactively, when areas of the vascular system become occluded from [[Atherosclerosis]]. The Cardiologist will thread this sheath through the vascular system to access the heart. This sheath has a balloon and a tiny wire mesh tube wrapped around it, and if the cardiologist finds a blockage or [[Stenosis]], they can inflate the balloon at the occlusion site in the vascular system to flatten or compress the plaque against the vascular wall. Once that is complete a [[Stent]] is placed as a type of scaffold to hold the vasculature open permanently.\n\n=== Preventive Cardiology and Cardiac Rehabilitation ===\nIn recent times, the focus is gradually shifting to Preventive cardiology due to increased Cardiovascular Disease burden at an early age. As per WHO, 37% of all premature deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases and out of this, 82% are in low and middle income countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)|title=Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Clinical cardiology is the sub specialty of Cardiology which looks after preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation. Preventive cardiology also deals with routine preventive checkup though non invasive tests specifically [[Electrocardiography]], Stress Tests, Lipid Profile and General Physical examination to detect any cardiovascular diseases at an early age while cardiac rehabilitation is the upcoming branch of cardiology which helps a person regain his overall strength and live a normal life after a cardiovascular event.\n\n===Pediatric cardiology===\n[[Helen B. Taussig]] is known as the founder of pediatric cardiology. She became famous through her work with [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], a congenital heart defect in which oxygenated and deoxygenated blood enters the circulatory system resulting from a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD) right beneath the aorta. This condition causes newborns to have a bluish-tint, [[cyanosis]], and have a deficiency of oxygen to their tissues, [[hypoxemia]]. She worked with [[Alfred Blalock]]<nowiki/> and [[Vivien Thomas]] at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] where they experimented with dogs to look at how they would attempt to surgically cure these \"blue babies.\" They eventually figured out how to do just that by the [[anastomosis]] of the systemic artery to the pulmonary artery and called this the [[Blalock\u2013Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Anne M.|date=2008-07-16|title=The Blalock-Taussig-Thomas Collaboration|journal=JAMA|volume=300|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.300.3.328|issn=0098-7484|pages=328\u201330|pmid=18632547}}</ref>\n\nTetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, persistent truncus arteriosus, and Ebsteins anomaly are various congenital cyanotic heart diseases. Congenital cyanotic heart diseases is where something is wrong with the heart of a newborn and it is not oxygenating the blood efficiently.\n[[File:Heart tetralogy fallot.svg|left|thumb|Tetralogy of Fallot]]\n\n==== Tetralogy of Fallot ====\n[[Tetralogy of Fallot]] is the most common congenital heart disease arising in 1\u20133 cases per 1,000 births. The cause of this defect is a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD) and an [[overriding aorta]]. These two defects combined causes deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and going right back into the [[circulatory system]]. The [[modified Blalock-Taussig shunt]] is usually used to fix the circulation. This procedure is done by placing a graft between the subclavian artery and the ipsilateral pulmonary artery to restore the correct blood flow.\n\n==== Pulmonary Atresia ====\n[[Pulmonary atresia|Pulmonary Atresia]] happens in 7\u20138 per 100,000 births and is characterized by the aorta branching out of the right ventricle. This causes the deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the circulatory system. Surgeries can fix this by redirecting the aorta and fixing the right ventricle and pulmonary artery connection.\n\nThere are two types of pulmonary atresia, classified by whether or not the baby also has a [[ventricular septal defect]].<ref name=\"Medscape2015\">{{cite web |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/892980-overview |title=Ventricular Septal Defects: Background, Anatomy, Pathophysiology |vauthors = Ramaswamy P, Webber HS|date= |website=Medscape |publisher=WebMD LLC |access-date=August 22, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/pulmonaryatresia.html |title=Facts about Pulmonary Atresia: Types of Pulmonary Atresia|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=CDC |publisher=USA.gov |access-date=August 22, 2017 }}</ref>\n* Pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum: This type of pulmonary atresia is associated with complete and intact [[septum]] between the ventricles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect: This type of pulmonary atresia happens when a ventricular septal defect allows blood to flow into and out of the right ventricle.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) ====\n[[Double outlet right ventricle]] is when both great arteries, the pulmonary artery and the aorta, are connected to the right ventricle. There is usually a VSD in different particular places depending on the variations of DORV, typically 50% are subaortic and 30%. The surgeries that can be done to fix this defect can vary due to the different physiology and blood flow in the defected heart. One way it can be cured is by a VSD closure and placing conduits to restart the blood flow between the left ventricle and the aorta and between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Another way is systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt in cases associated with [[Pulmonic stenosis|pulmonary stenosis]]. Also, a [[Atrial septostomy|balloon atrial septostomy]] can be done to fix DORV with the Taussig-Bing anomaly.\n\n==== Transposition of Great Arteries ====\n[[File:D-tga-575px.jpg|thumb|Dextro-transposition of the Great Arteries]]\nThere are two different types of [[Transposition of the great vessels|transposition of the great arteries]], [[Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries|Dextro-transposition of the great arteries]] and [[Levo-Transposition of the great arteries|Levo-transposition of the great arteries]], depending on where the chambers and vessels connect. Dextro-transposition happens in about 1 in 4,000 newborns and is when the right ventricle pumps blood into the aorta and deoxygenated blood enters the blood stream. The temporary procedure is to create an [[atrial septal defect]] (ASD). A permanent fix is more complicated and involves redirecting the pulmonary return to the right atrium and the systemic return to the left atrium, which is known as the [[Senning procedure]]. The [[Rastelli procedure]] can also be done by rerouting the left ventricular outflow, dividing the pulmonary trunk, and placing a conduit in between the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk. Levo-transposition happens in about 1 in 13,000 newborns and is characterized by the left ventricle pumping blood into the lungs and the right ventricle pumping the blood into the aorta. This may not produce problems at the beginning, but will eventually due to the different pressures each ventricle uses to pump blood. Switching the left ventricle to be the systemic ventricle and the right ventricle to pump blood into the pulmonary artery can repair levo-transposition.\n\n==== Persistent Truncus Arteriosis ====\n[[Persistent truncus arteriosus]] is when the [[truncus arteriosus]] fails to split into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. This occurs in about 1 in 11,000 live births and allows both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood into the body. The repair consists of a VSD closure and the Rastelli procedure.\n\n==== Ebstein Anomaly ====\n[[Ebstein's anomaly]] is characterized by a right atrium that is significantly enlarged and a heart that is shaped like a box. This is very rare and happens in less than 1% of congenital heart disease cases.

Simplified, the heart is a circuit of the [[Circulatory system|Circulation]].\nWhile plenty is known about the healthy heart, the bulk of study in cardiology is in disorders of the heart and restoration, and where possible, of function.\n\nThe heart is a muscle that squeezes blood and functions like a pump.\nEach part of the heart is susceptible to failure or dysfunction and the heart can be divided into the mechanical and the electrical parts.\n\nThe electrical part of the heart is centered on the periodic contraction (squeezing) of the [[myocardium|muscle cells]] that is caused by the [[cardiac pacemaker]] located in the [[sinoatrial node]].\nThe study of the electrical aspects is a sub-field of [[electrophysiology]] called [[cardiac electrophysiology]] and is epitomized with the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG).\nThe [[action potential]]s generated in the pacemaker propagate throughout the heart in a specific pattern. The system that carries this potential is called the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system]].\nDysfunction of the electrical system manifests in many ways and may include [[Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome]], [[ventricular fibrillation]], and [[heart block]].\n\nThe mechanical part of the heart is centered on the [[fluid mechanics|fluidic movement]] of [[blood]] and the functionality of the heart as a [[pump]].\nThe mechanical part is ultimately the purpose of the heart and many of the disorders of the heart disrupt the ability to move blood.\nFailure to move sufficient blood can result in failure in other organs and may result in death if severe.\n[[Heart failure]] is one condition in which the mechanical properties of the heart have failed or are failing, which means insufficient blood is being circulated.\n\n=== Coronary circulation ===\n{{Main|Coronary circulation}}\n\n[[Coronary circulation]] is the circulation of blood in the [[blood vessel]]s of the [[heart]] muscle ([[myocardium]]). The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the [[myocardium]] are known as coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include the [[great cardiac vein]], the [[middle cardiac vein]], the [[small cardiac vein]] and the [[anterior cardiac veins]].\n\nAs the left and right coronary arteries run on the surface of the heart, they can be called epicardial coronary arteries. These arteries, when healthy, are capable of autoregulation to maintain coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]].  These relatively narrow vessels are commonly affected by [[atherosclerosis]] and can become blocked, causing [[Angina pectoris|angina]] or a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. (See also: [[circulatory system]].) The coronary arteries that run deep within the myocardium are referred to as subendocardial.\n\nThe coronary arteries are classified as \"end circulation\", since they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium; there is very little redundant blood supply, which is why blockage of these vessels can be so critical.\n\n=== Cardiac examination ===\n{{Main|Cardiac examination}}\n\nThe [[cardiac examination]] (also called the \"precordial exam\"), is performed as part of a [[physical examination]], or when a patient presents with [[chest pain]] suggestive of a cardiovascular [[pathology]]. It would typically be modified depending on the [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] and integrated with other examinations especially the [[respiratory examination]].\n\nLike all medical examinations, the cardiac examination follows the standard structure of inspection, palpation and auscultation.\n\n== Heart disorders ==\n{{Main|List of heart disorders}}\n\nCardiology is concerned with the normal functionality of the heart and the deviation from a healthy heart.\nMany disorders involve the heart itself but some are outside of the heart and in the vascular system.\nCollectively, the two together are termed the cardiovascular system and diseases of one part tend to affect the other.\n\n<ref>{{cite news|title= Cardiologists in Delhi NCR |url=https://www.credihealth.com/doctors/delhi-ncr/cardiology|date=26 March 2019 |work=Full Details Information}}</ref>\n\n=== Hypertension ===\n{{Main|Hypertension}}\n\n[[Hypertension]], also known as \"high blood pressure\"\", is a [[Chronic (medicine)|long term]] [[Disease|medical condition]] in which the [[blood pressure]] in the [[artery|arteries]] is persistently elevated.<ref name=Nai2014>{{cite book|last1=Naish|first1=Jeannette|last2=Court|first2=Denise Syndercombe|title=Medical sciences|date=2014|isbn=9780702052491|page=562|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K21_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA562}}</ref> High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms.<ref name=CDC2015>{{cite web|title=High Blood Pressure Fact Sheet|url=https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_bloodpressure.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=February 19, 2015}}</ref> Long term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for [[coronary artery disease]], [[stroke]], [[heart failure]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[vision loss]], and [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lackland|first1=DT|last2=Weber|first2=MA|title=Global burden of cardiovascular disease and stroke: hypertension at the core|journal=The Canadian Journal of Cardiology|date=May 2015|volume=31|issue=5|pages=569\u201371|pmid=25795106|doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2015.01.009}}</ref><ref name=WHO2011a>{{cite book|last1=Mendis|first1=Shanthi|last2=Puska|first2=Pekka|last3=Norrving|first3=Bo|title=Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241564373|page=38|edition=1st|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Causes -->\nLifestyle factors can increase the risk of hypertension.

The field includes [[medical diagnosis]] and treatment of [[congenital heart defect]]s, [[coronary artery disease]], [[heart failure]], [[valvular heart disease]] and [[electrophysiology]]. [[Physician]]s who specialize in this field of medicine are called '''cardiologists''', a specialty of [[internal medicine]]. Pediatric cardiologists are [[pediatrician]]s who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called '''[[cardiothoracic surgeon]]s''' or '''cardiac surgeons''', a specialty of [[general surgery]].\n\nAlthough the cardiovascular system is inextricably linked to blood, cardiology is relatively unconcerned with [[hematology]] and its diseases. Some obvious exceptions that affect the function of the heart would be blood tests ([[electrolyte]] disturbances, [[troponin]]s), decreased oxygen carrying capacity ([[anemia]], [[hypovolemic shock]]), and [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]].\n\n== Specializations ==\nAll cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist (often simply called \"cardiologist\") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of [[cardiothoracic surgery]]. For example, [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] (CABG), [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] and [[valve replacement]] are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However the insertion of stents and pacemakers is performed by cardiologists\n\n===Adult cardiology===\nCardiology is a specialty of [[internal medicine]]. To be a cardiologist in the [[United States]], a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the United States by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]] are [[cardiac electrophysiology]], [[echocardiography]], [[interventional cardiology]], and [[nuclear cardiology]]. Recognized subspecialties in the United States by the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS) include [[clinical cardiac electrophysiology]] and [[interventional cardiology]].\n<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardiologists in Delhi NCR |url=https://www.credihealth.com/doctors/delhi-ncr/cardiology|date=26 March 2019 |work=Full Details Information}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Specialties & Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=23 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813083503/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|archive-date=2015-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> While in India, a person needs to undergo three years of residency in General Medicine or Pediatrics after [[M.B.B.S]] and then three years of residency in Cardiology to be a D.M/[[Diplomate of National Board]] (DNB) in Cardiology.\n\nPer [[doximity]], adult cardiologists make an average of $436,849 in the United States.<ref name=r1>Hamblin, James (January 27, 2015) [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/physician-salaries/384846/ What Doctors Make]. theatlantic.com</ref>\n\n==== Cardiac electrophysiology ====\n{{Main|Cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\n[[Cardiac electrophysiology]] is the [[science]] of elucidating, diagnosing, and treating the electrical activities of the [[heart]].  The term is usually used to describe studies of such phenomena by invasive (intracardiac) catheter recording of spontaneous activity as well as of cardiac responses to [[programmed electrical stimulation|programmed electrical stimulation (PES)]]. These studies are performed to assess complex [[arrhythmias]], elucidate symptoms, evaluate abnormal [[electrocardiograms]], assess risk of developing arrhythmias in the future, and design treatment.  These procedures increasingly include therapeutic methods (typically [[radiofrequency ablation]], or [[cryoablation]]) in addition to diagnostic and prognostic procedures.  Other therapeutic modalities employed in this field include [[antiarrhythmic drug]] therapy and implantation of [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] and automatic [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] (AICD).<ref name=Fauci>Fauci, Anthony, et al. ''Harrison's Textbook of Medicine''. New York: McGraw Hill, 2009.</ref><ref>Braunwald, Eugene, ed. ''Heart Disease, 6th edition.'' Philadelphia: Saunders, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe cardiac [[electrophysiology study]] (EPS) typically measures the response of the injured or cardiomyopathic myocardium to PES on specific pharmacological regimens in order to assess the likelihood that the regimen will successfully prevent potentially fatal sustained [[ventricular tachycardia|ventricular tachycardia (VT)]] or [[ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation VF]] (VF) in the future. Sometimes a ''series'' of EPS drug trials must be conducted to enable the cardiologist to select the one regimen for long-term treatment that best prevents or slows the development of VT or VF following PES. Such studies may also be conducted in the presence of a newly implanted or newly replaced cardiac pacemaker or AICD.<ref name=Fauci />\n\n===== Clinical cardiac electrophysiology =====\n{{Main|Clinical cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\n[[Clinical cardiac electrophysiology]] is a branch of the medical specialty of cardiology and is concerned with the study and treatment of rhythm disorders of the heart. Cardiologists with expertise in this area are usually referred to as electrophysiologists. Electrophysiologists are trained in the mechanism, function, and performance of the electrical activities of the heart. Electrophysiologists work closely with other cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to assist or guide therapy for heart rhythm disturbances ([[arrhythmias]]). They are trained to perform interventional and surgical procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nThe training required to become an electrophysiologist is long and requires 7 to 8 years after medical school (within the U.S.). Three years of internal medicine residency, three years of Clinical Cardiology fellowship, and one to two (in most instances) years of clinical cardiac electrophysiology.\n\n==== Cardiogeriatrics ====\n{{Main|Cardiogeriatrics}}\n\n[[Cardiogeriatrics]], or geriatric cardiology, is the branch of cardiology and geriatric medicine that deals with the cardiovascular disorders in elderly people.\n\nCardiac disorders such as [[coronary heart disease]], including [[myocardial infarction]], [[heart failure]], [[cardiomyopathy]], and [[arrhythmia]]s such as [[atrial fibrillation]], are common and are a major cause of mortality in elderly people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/agingtrends/06olderpersons.pdf|title=Trends in Causes of Death among Older Persons in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Vascular disorders such as [[atherosclerosis]] and [[peripheral arterial disease]] cause significant morbidity and mortality in aged people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Golomb Beatrice A.|last2=Dang Tram T.|last3=Criqui Michael H.|date=2006-08-15|title=Peripheral Arterial Disease|journal=Circulation|volume=114|issue=7|pages=688\u2013699|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.593442|pmid=16908785}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yazdanyar|first=Ali|last2=Newman|first2=Anne B.|date=2010-11-01|title=The Burden of Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly: Morbidity, Mortality, and Costs|journal=Clinics in Geriatric Medicine|volume=25|issue=4|pages=563\u2013vii|doi=10.1016/j.cger.2009.07.007|issn=0749-0690|pmc=2797320|pmid=19944261}}</ref>\n\n==== Echocardiography ====\n{{Main|Echocardiography}}\n\nEchocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart.\n\nEchocardiography has become routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes).\n\nEchocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.\n\n==== Interventional cardiology ====\n{{Main|Interventional cardiology}}\n\nInterventional cardiology is a branch of cardiology that deals specifically with the catheter based treatment of structural heart diseases. A large number of procedures can be performed on the heart by catheterization. This most commonly involves the insertion of a sheath into the femoral artery (but, in practice, any large peripheral artery or vein) and cannulating the heart under X-ray visualization (most commonly [[Fluoroscopy]]).\n\nThe main advantages of using the interventional cardiology or radiology approach are the avoidance of the scars and pain, and long post-operative recovery. Additionally, interventional cardiology procedure of primary angioplasty is now the gold standard of care for an acute [[Myocardial infarction]]. This procedure can also be done proactively, when areas of the vascular system become occluded from [[Atherosclerosis]]. The Cardiologist will thread this sheath through the vascular system to access the heart. This sheath has a balloon and a tiny wire mesh tube wrapped around it, and if the cardiologist finds a blockage or [[Stenosis]], they can inflate the balloon at the occlusion site in the vascular system to flatten or compress the plaque against the vascular wall. Once that is complete a [[Stent]] is placed as a type of scaffold to hold the vasculature open permanently.\n\n=== Preventive Cardiology and Cardiac Rehabilitation ===\nIn recent times, the focus is gradually shifting to Preventive cardiology due to increased Cardiovascular Disease burden at an early age. As per WHO, 37% of all premature deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases and out of this, 82% are in low and middle income countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)|title=Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Clinical cardiology is the sub specialty of Cardiology which looks after preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation. Preventive cardiology also deals with routine preventive checkup though non invasive tests specifically [[Electrocardiography]], Stress Tests, Lipid Profile and General Physical examination to detect any cardiovascular diseases at an early age while cardiac rehabilitation is the upcoming branch of cardiology which helps a person regain his overall strength and live a normal life after a cardiovascular event.\n\n===Pediatric cardiology===\n[[Helen B. Taussig]] is known as the founder of pediatric cardiology. She became famous through her work with [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], a congenital heart defect in which oxygenated and deoxygenated blood enters the circulatory system resulting from a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD) right beneath the aorta. This condition causes newborns to have a bluish-tint, [[cyanosis]], and have a deficiency of oxygen to their tissues, [[hypoxemia]]. She worked with [[Alfred Blalock]]<nowiki/> and [[Vivien Thomas]] at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] where they experimented with dogs to look at how they would attempt to surgically cure these \"blue babies.\" They eventually figured out how to do just that by the [[anastomosis]] of the systemic artery to the pulmonary artery and called this the [[Blalock\u2013Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Anne M.|date=2008-07-16|title=The Blalock-Taussig-Thomas Collaboration|journal=JAMA|volume=300|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.300.3.328|issn=0098-7484|pages=328\u201330|pmid=18632547}}</ref>\n\nTetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, persistent truncus arteriosus, and Ebsteins anomaly are various congenital cyanotic heart diseases. Congenital cyanotic heart diseases is where something is wrong with the heart of a newborn and it is not oxygenating the blood efficiently.\n[[File:Heart tetralogy fallot.svg|left|thumb|Tetralogy of Fallot]]\n\n==== Tetralogy of Fallot ====\n[[Tetralogy of Fallot]] is the most common congenital heart disease arising in 1\u20133 cases per 1,000 births. The cause of this defect is a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD) and an [[overriding aorta]]. These two defects combined causes deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and going right back into the [[circulatory system]]. The [[modified Blalock-Taussig shunt]] is usually used to fix the circulation. This procedure is done by placing a graft between the subclavian artery and the ipsilateral pulmonary artery to restore the correct blood flow.\n\n==== Pulmonary Atresia ====\n[[Pulmonary atresia|Pulmonary Atresia]] happens in 7\u20138 per 100,000 births and is characterized by the aorta branching out of the right ventricle. This causes the deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the circulatory system. Surgeries can fix this by redirecting the aorta and fixing the right ventricle and pulmonary artery connection.\n\nThere are two types of pulmonary atresia, classified by whether or not the baby also has a [[ventricular septal defect]].<ref name=\"Medscape2015\">{{cite web |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/892980-overview |title=Ventricular Septal Defects: Background, Anatomy, Pathophysiology |vauthors = Ramaswamy P, Webber HS|date= |website=Medscape |publisher=WebMD LLC |access-date=August 22, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/pulmonaryatresia.html |title=Facts about Pulmonary Atresia: Types of Pulmonary Atresia|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=CDC |publisher=USA.gov |access-date=August 22, 2017 }}</ref>\n* Pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum: This type of pulmonary atresia is associated with complete and intact [[septum]] between the ventricles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect: This type of pulmonary atresia happens when a ventricular septal defect allows blood to flow into and out of the right ventricle.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) ====\n[[Double outlet right ventricle]] is when both great arteries, the pulmonary artery and the aorta, are connected to the right ventricle. There is usually a VSD in different particular places depending on the variations of DORV, typically 50% are subaortic and 30%. The surgeries that can be done to fix this defect can vary due to the different physiology and blood flow in the defected heart. One way it can be cured is by a VSD closure and placing conduits to restart the blood flow between the left ventricle and the aorta and between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Another way is systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt in cases associated with [[Pulmonic stenosis|pulmonary stenosis]]. Also, a [[Atrial septostomy|balloon atrial septostomy]] can be done to fix DORV with the Taussig-Bing anomaly.\n\n==== Transposition of Great Arteries ====\n[[File:D-tga-575px.jpg|thumb|Dextro-transposition of the Great Arteries]]\nThere are two different types of [[Transposition of the great vessels|transposition of the great arteries]], [[Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries|Dextro-transposition of the great arteries]] and [[Levo-Transposition of the great arteries|Levo-transposition of the great arteries]], depending on where the chambers and vessels connect. Dextro-transposition happens in about 1 in 4,000 newborns and is when the right ventricle pumps blood into the aorta and deoxygenated blood enters the blood stream. The temporary procedure is to create an [[atrial septal defect]] (ASD). A permanent fix is more complicated and involves redirecting the pulmonary return to the right atrium and the systemic return to the left atrium, which is known as the [[Senning procedure]]. The [[Rastelli procedure]] can also be done by rerouting the left ventricular outflow, dividing the pulmonary trunk, and placing a conduit in between the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk. Levo-transposition happens in about 1 in 13,000 newborns and is characterized by the left ventricle pumping blood into the lungs and the right ventricle pumping the blood into the aorta. This may not produce problems at the beginning, but will eventually due to the different pressures each ventricle uses to pump blood. Switching the left ventricle to be the systemic ventricle and the right ventricle to pump blood into the pulmonary artery can repair levo-transposition.\n\n==== Persistent Truncus Arteriosis ====\n[[Persistent truncus arteriosus]] is when the [[truncus arteriosus]] fails to split into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. This occurs in about 1 in 11,000 live births and allows both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood into the body. The repair consists of a VSD closure and the Rastelli procedure.\n\n==== Ebstein Anomaly ====\n[[Ebstein's anomaly]] is characterized by a right atrium that is significantly enlarged and a heart that is shaped like a box. This is very rare and happens in less than 1% of congenital heart disease cases. The surgical repair varies depending on the severity of the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bhat|first=Venkatraman|title=Illustrated Imaging Essay on Congenital Heart Diseases: Multimodality Approach Part III: Cyanotic Heart Diseases and Complex Congenital Anomalies|journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research|doi=10.7860/jcdr/2016/21443.8210|pmc=5020285|pmid=27630924|volume=10|issue=7|year=2016|pages=TE01\u201310}}</ref>\n\nPediatric cardiology is a sub-specialty of [[pediatrics]].

Simplified, the heart is a circuit of the [[Circulatory system|Circulation]].\nWhile plenty is known about the healthy heart, the bulk of study in cardiology is in disorders of the heart and restoration, and where possible, of function.\n\nThe heart is a muscle that squeezes blood and functions like a pump.\nEach part of the heart is susceptible to failure or dysfunction and the heart can be divided into the mechanical and the electrical parts.\n\nThe electrical part of the heart is centered on the periodic contraction (squeezing) of the [[myocardium|muscle cells]] that is caused by the [[cardiac pacemaker]] located in the [[sinoatrial node]].\nThe study of the electrical aspects is a sub-field of [[electrophysiology]] called [[cardiac electrophysiology]] and is epitomized with the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG).\nThe [[action potential]]s generated in the pacemaker propagate throughout the heart in a specific pattern. The system that carries this potential is called the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system]].\nDysfunction of the electrical system manifests in many ways and may include [[Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome]], [[ventricular fibrillation]], and [[heart block]].\n\nThe mechanical part of the heart is centered on the [[fluid mechanics|fluidic movement]] of [[blood]] and the functionality of the heart as a [[pump]].\nThe mechanical part is ultimately the purpose of the heart and many of the disorders of the heart disrupt the ability to move blood.\nFailure to move sufficient blood can result in failure in other organs and may result in death if severe.\n[[Heart failure]] is one condition in which the mechanical properties of the heart have failed or are failing, which means insufficient blood is being circulated.\n\n=== Coronary circulation ===\n{{Main|Coronary circulation}}\n\n[[Coronary circulation]] is the circulation of blood in the [[blood vessel]]s of the [[heart]] muscle ([[myocardium]]). The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the [[myocardium]] are known as coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include the [[great cardiac vein]], the [[middle cardiac vein]], the [[small cardiac vein]] and the [[anterior cardiac veins]].\n\nAs the left and right coronary arteries run on the surface of the heart, they can be called epicardial coronary arteries. These arteries, when healthy, are capable of autoregulation to maintain coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]].  These relatively narrow vessels are commonly affected by [[atherosclerosis]] and can become blocked, causing [[Angina pectoris|angina]] or a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. (See also: [[circulatory system]].) The coronary arteries that run deep within the myocardium are referred to as subendocardial.\n\nThe coronary arteries are classified as \"end circulation\", since they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium; there is very little redundant blood supply, which is why blockage of these vessels can be so critical.\n\n=== Cardiac examination ===\n{{Main|Cardiac examination}}\n\nThe [[cardiac examination]] (also called the \"precordial exam\"), is performed as part of a [[physical examination]], or when a patient presents with [[chest pain]] suggestive of a cardiovascular [[pathology]]. It would typically be modified depending on the [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] and integrated with other examinations especially the [[respiratory examination]].\n\nLike all medical examinations, the cardiac examination follows the standard structure of inspection, palpation and auscultation.\n\n== Heart disorders ==\n{{Main|List of heart disorders}}\n\nCardiology is concerned with the normal functionality of the heart and the deviation from a healthy heart.\nMany disorders involve the heart itself but some are outside of the heart and in the vascular system.\nCollectively, the two together are termed the cardiovascular system and diseases of one part tend to affect the other.\n\n<ref>{{cite news|title= Cardiologists in Delhi NCR |url=https://www.credihealth.com/doctors/delhi-ncr/cardiology|date=26 March 2019 |work=Full Details Information}}</ref>\n\n=== Hypertension ===\n{{Main|Hypertension}}\n\n[[Hypertension]], also known as \"high blood pressure\"\", is a [[Chronic (medicine)|long term]] [[Disease|medical condition]] in which the [[blood pressure]] in the [[artery|arteries]] is persistently elevated.<ref name=Nai2014>{{cite book|last1=Naish|first1=Jeannette|last2=Court|first2=Denise Syndercombe|title=Medical sciences|date=2014|isbn=9780702052491|page=562|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K21_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA562}}</ref> High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms.<ref name=CDC2015>{{cite web|title=High Blood Pressure Fact Sheet|url=https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_bloodpressure.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=February 19, 2015}}</ref> Long term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for [[coronary artery disease]], [[stroke]], [[heart failure]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[vision loss]], and [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lackland|first1=DT|last2=Weber|first2=MA|title=Global burden of cardiovascular disease and stroke: hypertension at the core|journal=The Canadian Journal of Cardiology|date=May 2015|volume=31|issue=5|pages=569\u201371|pmid=25795106|doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2015.01.009}}</ref><ref name=WHO2011a>{{cite book|last1=Mendis|first1=Shanthi|last2=Puska|first2=Pekka|last3=Norrving|first3=Bo|title=Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241564373|page=38|edition=1st|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Causes -->\nLifestyle factors can increase the risk of hypertension.

The representatives from the 56 ethnic groups danced a vigorous folk dance.\n\n===Parade of nations===\n{{see also|2008 Summer Olympics national flag bearers}}\nThe athletes taking part in the XXIX Olympiad parade of nations marched out to the centre of the stadium.\n\nIn accordance with Olympic tradition, the national team of [[Greece]], which hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics|last Summer Olympics]], in [[Athens]], entered first, in honor of Greece's status as the birthplace of the Olympics, while the host country came last.  Traditionally nations are ordered in [[alphabetic order]] of the national language of the host country (or if there is more than one, the more dominant of the languages of the host city); as [[Hanzi|Chinese writing]] is not alphabetic, the teams paraded by [[stroke order]] of the first character of their respective countries' names in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]].<ref name=OpeningCeremonyPlan/>\n\nCountries with the same number of strokes in the first character are sorted by the order of the five basic strokes in Chinese characters (\u4e00,\u4e28,\u4e3f,\u4e36 and \u4e59). If the name of two or more countries has the same first character, then they are ordered according to the stroke order of the second character. For example, Latvia ({{zh|\u62c9\u8131\u7ef4\u4e9a}}), Great Britain ({{zh|\u82f1\u56fd}}), and British Virgin Islands ({{zh|\u82f1\u5c5e\u7ef4\u5c14\u4eac\u7fa4\u5c9b}}) were the 114th, 115th and 116th to enter respectively while the first characters of their names are all eight strokes. However, the stroke order of Latvia's first character (\u62c9) is \u4e00\u4e28\u4e00\u4e36\u4e00\u4e36\u4e3f\u4e00 while that of Great Britain is \u4e00\u4e28\u4e28\u4e28\u4e59\u4e00\u4e3f\u4e36. Latvia's third stroke (\u4e00) is before that of Great Britain (\u4e28), which gave Latvia precedence to Great Britain. Great Britain and the British Virgin Islands share the same first character, \u82f1. However the second one in Great Britain's name is \u56fd, which has 8 strokes, while the second in British Virgin Islands is \u5c5e, which has 12 strokes. Thus Great Britain entered before British Virgin Islands. [[Guinea]] ({{zh|c=\u51e0\u5185\u4e9a}}) was the second country to enter following Greece as it only takes two strokes to write the first character in the country's name (\u51e0). [[Australia]] ({{zh|c=\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a}}) marched 202nd, just ahead of [[Zambia]] ({{zh|c=\u8d5e\u6bd4\u4e9a}}), which was the last country to march before China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200807/s2318161.htm?tab=sport|title=Olympics athletes march to be done to different drum|work=ABC Radio Australia|date=29 July 2008| accessdate=21 August 2009 }}</ref> The first characters of these countries' names ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:\u6fb3|\u6fb3]]}} and {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:\u8d5e|\u8d5e]]}}) are written with 15 and 16 strokes respectively.\n\nAnnouncers in the stadium read off the names of the marching nations in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] (the official languages of the Olympics), and [[Standard Chinese]] with music accompanying the athletes as they marched into the stadium. The leading signs of delegations, carried by young Chinese women in red dresses, had their names printed in these three languages: the Chinese version in traditional [[Chinese calligraphy]]; and above it in the other two languages, using a Roman alphabetic typeface that mimicked brush calligraphy.\n\nChinese names of most states were condensed to their short forms when possible. For example, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (\u6ce2\u65af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u9ed1\u585e\u54e5\u7ef4\u90a3) entered as \u6ce2\u9ed1 ''Bohei'' in Chinese, while [[Saudi Arabia]] (\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f) entered as simply \u6c99\u7279 ''Shate''. One exception was the [[North Macedonia|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]], which entered in Chinese as its full designation (\u524d\u5357\u65af\u62c9\u592b\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u5171\u548c\u56fd) because of the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] (though the country was sorted according to its short name, \u9a6c\u5176\u987f). China entered as ''People's Republic of China/R\u00e9publique populaire de Chine'' in English and French, but simply as \u4e2d\u56fd ''Zhongguo'' in Chinese, [[Names of China|the most common short name]]. \u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a ([[Indonesia]]) was used instead of \u5370\u5c3c, \u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a ([[Malaysia]]) was used instead of \u9a6c\u56fd, and \u5361\u5854\u5c14 ([[Qatar]]) was used instead of \u5361\u8fbe.\n\nThe athletes marched along the tracks toward the center of the stadium, which was encircled by white-capped Chinese cheerleaders welcoming each contingent. As they did so, they would step on colored ink before treading on the Chinese painting done earlier by the children and the performance artists.\n\nThroughout the entire Parade of Nations, the Olympic athletes were treated to live traditional music ensembles, hand-picked by the Chinese Olympic committee from around the world.  Each ensemble represented a continent from the five Olympic rings.  The groups included Chinese orchestra, Scottish bagpipers Mains of Fintry Pipe Band ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081227085032/http://www.mofpb.co.uk/ Fintry Pipe Band]), Aboriginal musicians and dancers from Australia (William Barton),<ref>[http://www.williambarton.com.au/ williambarton.com.au]</ref> South African drummers (Drum Cafe),<ref>[http://www.drumcafe.com drumcafe.com]</ref> and North American mariachi group Mariachi Mujer 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mariachimujer2000.com/ |title=mariachimujer2000.com |access-date=3 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823231021/http://www.mariachimujer2000.com/ |archive-date=23 August 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nUnlike in previous years, North and South Korea did not send a unified team; their athletes marched in separately as [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea, {{zh|c=\u97e9\u56fd}}) and the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea, {{zh|c=\u671d\u9c9c\u6c11\u4e3b\u4e3b\u4e49\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd}}).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article4482499.ece | title=North and South Korea to march separately in Olympics opening ceremony| first=Sophie | last=Tedmanson | date=8 August 2008 | accessdate=9 August 2008 | newspaper=Times of London}}</ref> Taiwan marched under the name \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\" ({{zh|c=\u4e2d\u534e\u53f0\u5317|p=Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 T\u00e1ib\u011bi}}) as per a 1989 agreement and in the Olympics since then \u2013 and the Chinese media has followed suit, referring to Taiwan as ''Zhonghua Taibei'' instead of the previously used and controversial ''Zhongguo Taibei'' ({{zh|c=\u4e2d\u56fd\u53f0\u5317|p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 T\u00e1ib\u011bi}}, literally \"Taipei, China\").<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2008/07/25/2003418502 | title=Taiwan's Olympic title fuels controversy | first=Shih|last=Hsiu-Chuan|first2=Ko|last2=Shu-Ling|date=25 July 2008 | accessdate=9 August 2008 | newspaper=[[Taipei Times]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080809045516/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2008/07/25/2003418502| archivedate= 9 August 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/writers/brian_cazeneuve/08/08/li.ning/ | title=China makes its opening statement |first=Brian|last=Cazeneuve | date=8 August 2008 | accessdate=9 August 2008 | publisher=CNN| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915212442/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/writers/brian_cazeneuve/08/08/li.ning/| archivedate= 15 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese contingent, which was last, was led by [[Yao Ming]] and [[Lin Hao (9-year-old earthquake survivor)|Lin Hao]], the 9-year-old [[primary school]] student who had rescued two schoolmates during the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/ceremonies/headlines/n214518587.shtml|title=Yao Ming and boy from quake zone lead Team China into opening ceremony|accessdate=21 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428182834/http://en.beijing2008.cn/ceremonies/headlines/n214518587.shtml|archive-date=28 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mvn.com/olympics/2008/08/09/beijings-opening-ceremony-finds-a-hero/|title=Beijing's Opening Ceremony Finds a Hero|first=Mary|last=Hughes|date=9 August 2008|work=Most Valuable Network, MA|accessdate=21 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906235722/http://mvn.com/olympics/2008/08/09/beijings-opening-ceremony-finds-a-hero/|archive-date=6 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Speeches by the presidents===\n[[Liu Qi (politician, born 1942)|Liu Qi]], the head of the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee, gave a speech in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] welcoming the athletes.

ceremony, as described by author James Schiffman:\n\n<blockquote>The march of the athletes showed a clear example of CCTV proudly emphasizing a cultural particularity that NBC strained to contain within the bounds of the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness.  As the athletes began marching into the stadium, Bob Costas explained why Guinea followed Greece: \"There is no alphabet here. So if you're expecting one nation to follow another, the way they generally do at an opening ceremony, think again.\" Matt Lauer added \"You're out of luck. So we're going to have the graphics at the bottom of the screen which will give you an idea, if you look to the right, which countries are approaching the tunnel.\" In this way, the NBC commentators' coverage intoned that China was not doing things the way they were generally done, and as a viewer, you might be \"out of luck\" if not for the graphics that NBC provided.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Schiffman|first1=James R.|title=Mass Media and Representation: A Critical Comparison of the CCTV and NBC Presentations of the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Summer Games|chapter=A Critical Comparison of the CCTV And NBC Presentations|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|location=Atlanta|degree=PhD|id=Document No. 3515336{{ProQuest|1034289199}}|isbn=9781267397072|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|page=262}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, the Opening Ceremonies in Beijing became the most watched Olympic Opening Ceremony ever held in a non-U.S. city by an American audience,<ref name=\"ap\">{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2008-08-09-1580718105_x.htm |title=Opening night is a big TV draw for NBC |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=9 August 2008 |first=David |last=Bauder |work=USA Today |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> a record previously held by the [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer Games of 1994]].<ref name=Lillehammer>{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/32-6-million-watch-opening-winter-olympics-wbna35384274 |title=32.6 million watch opening of Winter Olympics |agency=Associated Press |date=13 February 2010 |work=NBC News |accessdate=27 March 2010  }}</ref> It was the biggest television event in the U.S. in 2008 since the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], and it also surpassed the ratings for the [[80th Academy Awards|2008 Academy Awards]] ceremony and that year's finale of ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref name=\"ap\" />\n\nIn the United States, NBC concluded its broadcast with a message saying that their coverage of the opening ceremony was dedicated in memory of [[Jim McKay]], longtime Olympics broadcaster with rival [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]], who died on 7 June.<ref name=\"McKay\">{{YouTube|id=24ci2kuINoU|title=Olympics 2008 Opening Ceremony Intro and Ending **Courtesy of NBC**}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|first2=Frank|last2=Litsky|title=Jim McKay, ABC Sportscaster, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/sports/08mckay.html?hp=&pagewanted=print|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 June 2008 |authorlink=Richard Sandomir |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> ABC \"loaned\" McKay to NBC to serve as a special correspondent during their coverage of the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Salt Lake City Olympics]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=Pyt0MI8OSdQ|title=2002 Salt Lake City Opening Ceremonies \u2013 Intro}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Olympics}}\n{{commonscat-inline|2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}\n* [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]]\n* [[2008 Summer Olympics national flag bearers]]\n* [[Four Great Inventions]] <!-- basis of the theatrical portion of the ceremonies -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20080809145103/http://en.beijing2008.cn:80/ceremonies/headlines/openingceremony/ 2008 Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony}}\n* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/2524984/Beijing-Olympics-How-the-opening-ceremony-unfolded.html Sequence of events]\n*{{youtube|bufV3EgyPGU|Full Opening Ceremony from Beijing 2008}}\n\n{{Olympic Games opening ceremonies|state=collapsed}}\n{{EmmyAward VarietySpecial (Live)}}\n{{Zhang Yimou}}\n{{Portal bar|Olympics|China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony}}\n[[Category:2008 Summer Olympics|Opening Ceremony]]\n[[Category:Olympics opening ceremonies]]\n[[Category:Ceremonies in China]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox news event\n| title = 2008 Summer Olympics<br />opening ceremony\n| image_name = 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony 2.jpg\n| image_size =\n| caption = Fireworks during the opening ceremony\n| date = {{start date|df=yes|2008|08|08}}\n| time = 20:00 \u2013 00:09 [[China Standard Time|CST]] ([[UTC+08:00]])\n| place = [[Beijing]], [[China]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|39|59|30|N|116|23|26|E|region:CN-11_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| also known as =\n| filmed by = [[China Central Television|CCTV]] and [[Olympic Broadcasting Services|OBS]]\n| participants =\n| awards =\n| url = {{YouTube|bufV3EgyPGU|Full opening ceremony on the IOC YouTube channel}}\n}}\n{{2008 Summer Olympics}}\nThe '''2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony''' was held at the [[Beijing National Stadium]], also known as the ''Bird's Nest''.

The drums, running like a time machine, form giant digits (in both Arabic and Chinese numerals) to count down the seconds to the Games. The digits is formed in ten-second intervals starting from sixty before switching over to the final ten seconds. At the end, a huge fireworks display is set off from the top of the stadium.\n\n===Welcoming ceremony \u2013 The Song-Fou===\nThe 2,008 drummers play the bronze Fou drums and sing the quote from [[The Analects of Confucius]] written 2000 years ago: \"Isn\u2019t it delightful to have friends coming from afar?\u201d to welcome friends from all over the world.\n\n===Footprints of History and Olympic Rings===\nThe firework footprints were set off at the rate of one every second; each represented one of the 29 Olympiads, signifying the Beijing Olympics as the XXIX Olympiad of the modern era. The 29th footprint arrived at Bird's Nest and transformed into Star [[Olympic Rings]]. Next, the rings were lift up by twenty \"Dunhuang fairies\" (Buddhist apsaras of the Mogao Caves).\n\n===National flag-raising ceremony===\n[[File:2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony 6.jpg|thumb|China's national flag carried into the National Stadium]]\nAttention was then turned to 56 young children representing the [[List of ethnic groups in China|56 ethnic groups of modern China]], and donning respective costumes.

[[Ceramic art|Ceramics]], [[Chinese ceramics|porcelain]] vessels and other [[Chinese fine art]]s artifacts were beamed on a giant [[LED]] [[scroll]], representing the first of the Four Great Inventions of China, paper, and displaying animated graphics, slowly unfurling. At its center was a piece of white canvas paper, which then ushered in a performance of black-costumed dancers whose hands hid brushes that had been dipped in ink.  They performed a dance while leaving their trails on the block of white paper, reminiscent of Chinese [[ink and wash painting]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/09/content_9063343.htm|title=Feature: Chinese culture shines at dazzling Olympics opening ceremony|date=9 August 2008|agency=Xinhua| accessdate=21 August 2009 }}</ref> This was accompanied by the sounds of the [[guqin]], China's ancient seven-string zither, as played by Chen Leiji (S: \u9648\u96f7\u6fc0, T: \u9673\u96f7\u6fc0, P: ''Ch\u00e9n L\u00e9ij\u012b'').

The character was shown, consecutively, in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscription]], [[Seal script]] and [[Regular script|KaisScript]] (Modern Chinese script).

This was followed by a procession of men, in blue costumes, who with huge oars formed formations of [[Junk (ship)|junks]], symbolizing the expeditions of [[Zheng He]]. A performer holding another great Chinese invention, the [[compass]], in its ancient form a metal spoon floating in a fluid suspensible vessel, danced in the center of the giant LED scroll that showed images of sailing junks and maps of Zheng He's [[Treasure voyages|seven voyages]] on Maritime Silk Road in the [[Ming Dynasty]].\n\n===5.

Accompanied by the music of ''Kunqu'', one of the oldest extant Chinese operas, the giant scroll expands and shows several beautiful classic ancient paintings from Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties.  At this point, two rows of huge royal dragon pillars called ''huabiao'' (S: \u534e\u8868, T: \u83ef\u8868, P: ''Hu\u00e1bi\u01ceo'') emerged and stretched skyward, with the performers dancing to the ancient tune ''[[Pipa#Repertoire|Ch\u016bnji\u0101ng Hu\u0101 Yu\u00e8y\u00e8]]'' (\u6625\u6c5f\u82b1\u6708\u591c), as pink and orange fireworks were set off overhead.\n\n===6.

They formed the bird's nest shape of the [[Beijing National Stadium]].

They demonstrated martial arts while combining to form geometric mass human formations.  A skit was shown with schoolchildren drawing and coloring on the paper scroll and chanting poetry. These were the same children representing the 56 ethnic groups of China.  They symbolized a Green Olympics (to protect the world).  As their sequence drew to an end, the giant white paper was lifted vertically to reveal a drawing of mountains and waters with a smiling face as the sun.  Then, there was a light presentation showing brightly coloured flying birds, symbolizing the rebirth of the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and the bird-nest stadium itself.\n\n===8.

The representatives from the 56 ethnic groups danced a vigorous folk dance.\n\n===Parade of nations===\n{{see also|2008 Summer Olympics national flag bearers}}\nThe athletes taking part in the XXIX Olympiad parade of nations marched out to the centre of the stadium.\n\nIn accordance with Olympic tradition, the national team of [[Greece]], which hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics|last Summer Olympics]], in [[Athens]], entered first, in honor of Greece's status as the birthplace of the Olympics, while the host country came last.  Traditionally nations are ordered in [[alphabetic order]] of the national language of the host country (or if there is more than one, the more dominant of the languages of the host city); as [[Hanzi|Chinese writing]] is not alphabetic, the teams paraded by [[stroke order]] of the first character of their respective countries' names in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]].<ref name=OpeningCeremonyPlan/>\n\nCountries with the same number of strokes in the first character are sorted by the order of the five basic strokes in Chinese characters (\u4e00,\u4e28,\u4e3f,\u4e36 and \u4e59). If the name of two or more countries has the same first character, then they are ordered according to the stroke order of the second character. For example, Latvia ({{zh|\u62c9\u8131\u7ef4\u4e9a}}), Great Britain ({{zh|\u82f1\u56fd}}), and British Virgin Islands ({{zh|\u82f1\u5c5e\u7ef4\u5c14\u4eac\u7fa4\u5c9b}}) were the 114th, 115th and 116th to enter respectively while the first characters of their names are all eight strokes. However, the stroke order of Latvia's first character (\u62c9) is \u4e00\u4e28\u4e00\u4e36\u4e00\u4e36\u4e3f\u4e00 while that of Great Britain is \u4e00\u4e28\u4e28\u4e28\u4e59\u4e00\u4e3f\u4e36. Latvia's third stroke (\u4e00) is before that of Great Britain (\u4e28), which gave Latvia precedence to Great Britain. Great Britain and the British Virgin Islands share the same first character, \u82f1. However the second one in Great Britain's name is \u56fd, which has 8 strokes, while the second in British Virgin Islands is \u5c5e, which has 12 strokes. Thus Great Britain entered before British Virgin Islands. [[Guinea]] ({{zh|c=\u51e0\u5185\u4e9a}}) was the second country to enter following Greece as it only takes two strokes to write the first character in the country's name (\u51e0). [[Australia]] ({{zh|c=\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a}}) marched 202nd, just ahead of [[Zambia]] ({{zh|c=\u8d5e\u6bd4\u4e9a}}), which was the last country to march before China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200807/s2318161.htm?tab=sport|title=Olympics athletes march to be done to different drum|work=ABC Radio Australia|date=29 July 2008| accessdate=21 August 2009 }}</ref> The first characters of these countries' names ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:\u6fb3|\u6fb3]]}} and {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wikt:\u8d5e|\u8d5e]]}}) are written with 15 and 16 strokes respectively.\n\nAnnouncers in the stadium read off the names of the marching nations in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] (the official languages of the Olympics), and [[Standard Chinese]] with music accompanying the athletes as they marched into the stadium. The leading signs of delegations, carried by young Chinese women in red dresses, had their names printed in these three languages: the Chinese version in traditional [[Chinese calligraphy]]; and above it in the other two languages, using a Roman alphabetic typeface that mimicked brush calligraphy.\n\nChinese names of most states were condensed to their short forms when possible. For example, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (\u6ce2\u65af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u9ed1\u585e\u54e5\u7ef4\u90a3) entered as \u6ce2\u9ed1 ''Bohei'' in Chinese, while [[Saudi Arabia]] (\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f) entered as simply \u6c99\u7279 ''Shate''. One exception was the [[North Macedonia|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]], which entered in Chinese as its full designation (\u524d\u5357\u65af\u62c9\u592b\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u5171\u548c\u56fd) because of the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] (though the country was sorted according to its short name, \u9a6c\u5176\u987f). China entered as ''People's Republic of China/R\u00e9publique populaire de Chine'' in English and French, but simply as \u4e2d\u56fd ''Zhongguo'' in Chinese, [[Names of China|the most common short name]]. \u5370\u5ea6\u5c3c\u897f\u4e9a ([[Indonesia]]) was used instead of \u5370\u5c3c, \u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a ([[Malaysia]]) was used instead of \u9a6c\u56fd, and \u5361\u5854\u5c14 ([[Qatar]]) was used instead of \u5361\u8fbe.\n\nThe athletes marched along the tracks toward the center of the stadium, which was encircled by white-capped Chinese cheerleaders welcoming each contingent.

within the bounds of the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness.  As the athletes began marching into the stadium, Bob Costas explained why Guinea followed Greece: \"There is no alphabet here. So if you're expecting one nation to follow another, the way they generally do at an opening ceremony, think again.\" Matt Lauer added \"You're out of luck. So we're going to have the graphics at the bottom of the screen which will give you an idea, if you look to the right, which countries are approaching the tunnel.\" In this way, the NBC commentators' coverage intoned that China was not doing things the way they were generally done, and as a viewer, you might be \"out of luck\" if not for the graphics that NBC provided.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Schiffman|first1=James R.|title=Mass Media and Representation: A Critical Comparison of the CCTV and NBC Presentations of the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Summer Games|chapter=A Critical Comparison of the CCTV And NBC Presentations|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|location=Atlanta|degree=PhD|id=Document No. 3515336{{ProQuest|1034289199}}|isbn=9781267397072|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|page=262}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, the Opening Ceremonies in Beijing became the most watched Olympic Opening Ceremony ever held in a non-U.S. city by an American audience,<ref name=\"ap\">{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2008-08-09-1580718105_x.htm |title=Opening night is a big TV draw for NBC |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=9 August 2008 |first=David |last=Bauder |work=USA Today |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> a record previously held by the [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer Games of 1994]].<ref name=Lillehammer>{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/32-6-million-watch-opening-winter-olympics-wbna35384274 |title=32.6 million watch opening of Winter Olympics |agency=Associated Press |date=13 February 2010 |work=NBC News |accessdate=27 March 2010  }}</ref> It was the biggest television event in the U.S. in 2008 since the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], and it also surpassed the ratings for the [[80th Academy Awards|2008 Academy Awards]] ceremony and that year's finale of ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref name=\"ap\" />\n\nIn the United States, NBC concluded its broadcast with a message saying that their coverage of the opening ceremony was dedicated in memory of [[Jim McKay]], longtime Olympics broadcaster with rival [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]], who died on 7 June.<ref name=\"McKay\">{{YouTube|id=24ci2kuINoU|title=Olympics 2008 Opening Ceremony Intro and Ending **Courtesy of NBC**}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|first2=Frank|last2=Litsky|title=Jim McKay, ABC Sportscaster, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/sports/08mckay.html?hp=&pagewanted=print|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 June 2008 |authorlink=Richard Sandomir |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> ABC \"loaned\" McKay to NBC to serve as a special correspondent during their coverage of the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Salt Lake City Olympics]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=Pyt0MI8OSdQ|title=2002 Salt Lake City Opening Ceremonies \u2013 Intro}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Olympics}}\n{{commonscat-inline|2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}\n* [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]]\n* [[2008 Summer Olympics national flag bearers]]\n* [[Four Great Inventions]] <!-- basis of the theatrical portion of the ceremonies -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20080809145103/http://en.beijing2008.cn:80/ceremonies/headlines/openingceremony/ 2008 Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony}}\n* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/2524984/Beijing-Olympics-How-the-opening-ceremony-unfolded.html Sequence of events]\n*{{youtube|bufV3EgyPGU|Full Opening Ceremony from Beijing 2008}}\n\n{{Olympic Games opening ceremonies|state=collapsed}}\n{{EmmyAward VarietySpecial (Live)}}\n{{Zhang Yimou}}\n{{Portal bar|Olympics|China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony}}\n[[Category:2008 Summer Olympics|Opening Ceremony]]\n[[Category:Olympics opening ceremonies]]\n[[Category:Ceremonies in China]]\n", "name_user": "SmashStar30", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCountdown", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony"}

One's sense of self-efficacy can play a major role in how one approaches goals, tasks, and challenges.<ref name=\"Luszczynska, A. 2005 pp. 127\" /> The theory of self-efficacy lies at the center of Bandura's social cognitive theory, which emphasizes the role of [[observational learning]] and social experience in the [[Personality development|development of personality]].  The main concept in social cognitive theory is that an individual's actions and reactions, including social behaviors and cognitive processes, in almost every situation are influenced by the actions that individual has observed in others.  Because self-efficacy is developed from external experiences and self-perception and is influential in determining the outcome of many events, it is an important aspect of social cognitive theory.

Social learning depends on how individuals either succeed or fail at dynamic interactions within groups, and promotes the development of individual emotional and practical skills as well as accurate perception of self and acceptance of others. According to this theory, people learn from one another through observation, imitation, and modeling.  Self-efficacy reflects an individual's understanding of what skills he/she can offer in a group setting.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ormrod, J.E.|year=1999|title=Human learning|edition=3rd|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Prentice-Hall}}</ref> \n\n===Self-concept theory===\n{{Main|Self-concept}}\nSelf-concept theory seeks to explain how people perceive and interpret their own existence from clues they receive from external sources, focusing on how these impressions are organized and how they are active throughout life. Successes and failures are closely related to the ways in which people have learned to view themselves and their relationships with others. This theory describes self-concept as learned (i.e., not present at birth); organized (in the way it is applied to the self); and dynamic (i.e., ever-changing, and not fixed at a certain age).<ref>{{cite journal|author=McAdam, E.

If the locus is internal (dispositional), feelings of self-esteem and self-efficacy will be enhanced by success and diminished by failure.  \n* [[wikt:Stability|Stability]] describes whether the cause is perceived as static or dynamic over time.  It is closely related to expectations and goals, in that when people attribute their failures to stable factors such as the difficulty of a task, they will expect to fail in that task in the future.\n* Controllability describes whether a person feels actively in control of the cause. Failing at a task one thinks one cannot control can lead to feelings of humiliation, shame, and/or anger.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heider, Fritz|year=1958|title=The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations|location=New York|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n==How it affects human function==\n\n=== Choices regarding behavior ===\nPeople generally avoid tasks where self-efficacy is low, but undertake tasks where self-efficacy is high. When self-efficacy is significantly beyond actual ability, it leads to an overestimation of the ability to complete tasks. On the other hand, when self-efficacy is significantly lower than actual ability, it discourages growth and skill development. Research shows that the optimum level of self-efficacy is slightly above ability; in this situation, people are most encouraged to tackle challenging tasks and gain experience.<ref name=\"FF\">[[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi, M.]], ''Finding Flow,'' 1997</ref> Self-efficacy is made of dimensions like magnitude, strength, and generality to explain how one believes they will perform on a specific task.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Lyman W. |last2=Bigley |first2=Gregory A. |last3=Steers |first3=Richard M. |title=Motivation and Work Behavior |date=2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin |page=131\u2013132 |edition=7th }}</ref>\n\n=== Motivation ===\nHigh self-efficacy can affect [[motivation]] in both positive and negative ways. In general, people with high self-efficacy are more likely to make efforts to complete a task, and to persist longer in those efforts, than those with low self-efficacy.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep2501_6|title = Goal Setting and Self-Efficacy During Self-Regulated Learning|journal = Educational Psychologist|volume = 25|pages = 71\u201386|year = 1990|last1 = Schunk|first1 = Dale H.|url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/D_Schunk_Goal_1990.pdf}}</ref> The stronger the self-efficacy or mastery expectations, the more active the efforts.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Bandura | first=Albert\n | author-link=Albert Bandura\n | year=1977\n | title=Social Learning Theory\n | publisher=Alexandria, VA: Prentice Hall\n | page=247\n | isbn= 978-0-13-816744-8\n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXvuAAAAMAAJ\n | format=\n}}\n</ref> However, those with low self-efficacy sometimes experience incentive to learn more about an unfamiliar subject, where someone with a high self-efficacy may not prepare as well for a task. \n\nA negative effect of low self-efficacy is that it can lead to a state of learned helplessness. [[Learned helplessness]] was studied by [[Martin Seligman]] in an experiment in which shocks were applied to animals. Through the experiment, it was discovered that the animals placed in a cage where they could escape shocks by moving to a different part of the cage did not attempt to move if they had formerly been placed in a cage in which escape from the shocks was not possible. Low self-efficacy can lead to this state in which it is believed that no amount of effort will make a difference in the success of the task at hand.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seifert|first1=Kelvin|title=Educational Psychology|date=2011|pages=119|edition=Third|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6w0r87qmrz7vg0/Educational%20Psychology.pdf?dl=0#pageContainer116|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Work performance ===\nSelf-efficacy theory has been embraced by management scholars and practitioners because of its applicability in the workplace. Overall, self-efficacy is positively and strongly related to work-related performance. This relationship, though, depends on task complexity. For more complex tasks, the relationships between self-efficacy and work performance is weaker than for easier work-related tasks. The implications of this research is that managers should provide accurate descriptions of tasks and provide clear and concise instructions and they should provide the necessary supporting elements for employees to be successful. \n\n=== Thought patterns and responses ===\nSelf-efficacy has several effects on thought patterns and responses:\n* Low self-efficacy can lead people to believe tasks to be harder than they actually are. This often results in poor task planning, as well as increased stress. \n* People become erratic and unpredictable when engaging in a task in which they have low self-efficacy. \n* People with high self-efficacy tend to take a wider view of a task in order to determine the best plan. \n* Obstacles often stimulate people with high self-efficacy to greater efforts, where someone with low self-efficacy will tend toward discouragement and giving up.\n* A person with high self-efficacy will attribute failure to external factors, where a person with low self-efficacy will blame low ability. For example, someone with high self-efficacy in regards to mathematics may attribute a poor test grade to a harder-than-usual test, illness, lack of effort, or insufficient preparation. A person with a low self-efficacy will attribute the result to poor mathematical ability. See [[Attribution Theory]].\n\n=== Health behaviors ===\nChoices affecting health, such as [[smoking]], [[physical exercise]], dieting, condom use, dental hygiene, seat belt use, and breast self-examination, are dependent on self-efficacy.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Conner, M.|editor2=P. Norman|year=2005|title=Predicting health behaviour|edition=2nd ed. rev.|location=Buckingham, England|publisher=Open University Press}}</ref> Self-efficacy beliefs are cognitions that determine whether health behavior change will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and failures. Self-efficacy influences how high people set their health goals (e.g., \"I intend to reduce my smoking\", or \"I intend to quit smoking altogether\").  A number of studies on the adoption of health practices have measured self-efficacy to assess its potential to initiate behavior change.<ref name=\"Luszczynska, A. 2005 pp. 127\" /> With increased self-efficacy, individuals have greater confidence in their ability and thus are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors. Greater engagement in healthy behaviors, result in positive patient health outcomes such as improved quality of life.\n\n=== Relationship to loss of control ===\n{{Further|Locus of control}}\nBandura showed that difference in self-efficacy correlates to fundamentally different world views.<ref>Karyn Ainsworth, Fall Quarter Seminar Paper: [https://web.archive.org/web/20060619202533/http://academic.evergreen.edu:80/a/ainkar18/teachinglearningpaper.htm What is Teaching? / What is Learning?]</ref><ref>Diffusion of the Internet within a Graduate School of Education, 2.

For example, a student with high self-efficacy who does poorly on an exam will likely attribute the failure to the fact that they did not study enough. However, a student with low self-efficacy who does poorly on an exam is likely to believe the cause of that failure was due to the test being too difficult or challenging, which the student does not control.\n\n===Factors affecting self-efficacy===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Enactive attainment]] -->\n\nBandura identifies four factors affecting self-efficacy.\n# Experience, or \"enactive attainment\" \u2013 The experience of mastery is the most important factor determining a person's self-efficacy. Success raises self-efficacy, while failure lowers it. According to psychologist [[Erik Erikson]]: \"Children cannot be fooled by empty praise and condescending encouragement. They may have to accept artificial bolstering of their self-esteem in lieu of something better, but what I call their accruing ego identity gains real strength only from wholehearted and consistent recognition of real accomplishment, that is, achievement that has meaning in their culture.\"\n# Modeling, or \"[[Wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] experience\" \u2013 Modeling is experienced as, \"If they can do it, I can do it as well\". When we see someone succeeding, our own self-efficacy increases; where we see people failing, our self-efficacy decreases. This process is most effectual when we see ourselves as similar to the model. Although not as influential as direct experience, [[Modelling (psychology)|modeling]] is particularly useful for people who are particularly unsure of themselves.\n# Social persuasion \u2013 Social persuasion generally manifests as direct encouragement or discouragement from another person. Discouragement is generally more effective at decreasing a person's self-efficacy than encouragement is at increasing it.\n# Physiological factors \u2013 In stressful situations, people commonly exhibit signs of distress: shakes, aches and pains, fatigue, fear, nausea, etc. Perceptions of these responses in oneself can markedly alter self-efficacy. Getting '[[butterflies in the stomach]]' before public speaking will be interpreted by someone with low self-efficacy as a sign of inability, thus decreasing self-efficacy further, where high self-efficacy would lead to interpreting such physiological signs as normal and unrelated to ability. It is one's belief in the implications of physiological response that alters self-efficacy, rather than the physiological response itself.<ref>The YouTube video \"Self Efficacy\" can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnACsrdGZAI and summarizes many of the factors affecting self-efficacy that are described above. It additionally provides detailed examples that can clarify any confusion.</ref>\n\n==Genetic and environmental determinants==\n\nIn a Norwegian twin study, the [[heritability]] of self-efficacy in adolescents was estimated at 75 percent. The remaining variance, 25 percent, was due to environmental influences not shared between family members. The shared family environment did not contribute to individual differences in self-efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Waaktaar | first1 = Trine | last2 = Torgersen | first2 = Svenn |authorlink2=Svenn Torgersen | year = 2013 | title = Self-Efficacy Is Mainly Genetic, Not Learned: A Multiple-Rater Twin Study on the Causal Structure of General Self-Efficacy in Young People | url = | journal = Twin Research and Human Genetics | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 651\u2013660 | doi=10.1017/thg.2013.25| pmid = 23601253 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==Theoretical models of behavior==\nA theoretical model of the effect of self-efficacy on [[Norm (sociology)|transgressive]] behavior was developed and verified in research with school children.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.1.125 | title=Sociocognitive self-regulatory mechanisms governing transgressive behavior| journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume=80| pages=125\u2013135| year=2001| last1=Bandura| first1=Albert| last2=Caprara| first2=Gian Vittorio| last3=Barbaranelli| first3=Claudio| last4=Pastorelli| first4=Concetta| last5=Regalia| first5=Camillo|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Sociocognitive-self-regulatory-mechanisms-governing-Bandura-Caprara/a85a2852b9a5eca29d1ad5a02df87bdab39a3c71}}</ref>\n\n===Prosociality and moral disengagement===\n\nProsocial behavior (such as helping others, sharing, and being kind and cooperative) and [[moral disengagement]] (manifesting in behaviors such as [[making excuses]] for bad behavior, avoiding responsibility for consequences, and [[blaming the victim]]) are negatively correlated.<ref>Kwak, K., & Bandura, A.

One study examined foreign language students' beliefs about learning, goal attainment, and motivation to continue with language study.

Self-efficacy is the belief in one's efficacy.\n;Self-efficacy versus Self-esteem\n:Self-efficacy is the perception of one's own ability to reach a goal; self-esteem is the sense of self-worth. For example, a person who is a terrible rock climber would probably have poor self-efficacy with regard to rock climbing, but this will not affect self-esteem if the person doesn\u2019t rely on rock climbing to determine self-worth.<ref name=PajaresOutline>{{cite web|last=Pajares |first=Frank|year=2002|title= Self-efficacy beliefs in academic contexts: An outline|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227023200/http://www.des.emory.edu:80/mfp/efftalk.html|publisher=Emory University}}</ref> On the other hand, one might have enormous confidence with regard to rock climbing, yet set such a high standard, and base enough of self-worth on rock-climbing skill, that self-esteem is low.<ref>Prof. Albert Bandura quoted in ''The Wall Street Journal'' 29 April 2008: D1</ref> Someone who has high self-efficacy in general but is poor at rock climbing might have misplaced confidence, or believe that improvement is possible.\n;Self-efficacy versus [[Confidence]]\n:According to [[Albert Bandura]], \"the construct of self-efficacy differs from the colloquial term 'confidence.' Confidence is a nonspecific term that refers to strength of belief but does not necessarily specify what the certainty is about. I can be supremely confident that I will fail at an endeavor. Perceived self-efficacy refers to belief in one's agentive capabilities, that one can produce given levels of attainment. A self-efficacy belief, therefore, includes both an affirmation of a capability level and the strength of that belief.\n;Self-efficacy versus Self-concept\n:Self-efficacy comprises beliefs of personal capability to perform specific actions. Self-concept is measured more generally and includes the evaluation of such competence and the feelings of self-worth associated with the behaviors in question.<ref name=PajaresOutline/> In an academic situation, a student's confidence in their ability to write an essay is self-efficacy.

The main concept in social cognitive theory is that an individual's actions and reactions, including social behaviors and cognitive processes, in almost every situation are influenced by the actions that individual has observed in others.  Because self-efficacy is developed from external experiences and self-perception and is influential in determining the outcome of many events, it is an important aspect of social cognitive theory.

According to this theory, people learn from one another through observation, imitation, and modeling.  Self-efficacy reflects an individual's understanding of what skills he/she can offer in a group setting.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ormrod, J.E.|year=1999|title=Human learning|edition=3rd|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Prentice-Hall}}</ref> \n\n===Self-concept theory===\n{{Main|Self-concept}}\nSelf-concept theory seeks to explain how people perceive and interpret their own existence from clues they receive from external sources, focusing on how these impressions are organized and how they are active throughout life. Successes and failures are closely related to the ways in which people have learned to view themselves and their relationships with others. This theory describes self-concept as learned (i.e., not present at birth); organized (in the way it is applied to the self); and dynamic (i.e., ever-changing, and not fixed at a certain age).<ref>{{cite journal|author=McAdam, E. K.|year=1986|title=Cognitive behavior therapy and its application with adolescents|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.1016/S0140-1971(86)80024-0|pmid=3700776}}</ref>\n\n===Attribution theory===\n{{Main|Attribution (psychology)}}\nAttribution theory focuses on how people attribute events and how those beliefs interact with self-perception. Attribution theory defines three major elements of cause:\n\n* Locus is the location of the perceived cause.  If the locus is internal (dispositional), feelings of self-esteem and self-efficacy will be enhanced by success and diminished by failure.  \n* [[wikt:Stability|Stability]] describes whether the cause is perceived as static or dynamic over time.  It is closely related to expectations and goals, in that when people attribute their failures to stable factors such as the difficulty of a task, they will expect to fail in that task in the future.\n* Controllability describes whether a person feels actively in control of the cause. Failing at a task one thinks one cannot control can lead to feelings of humiliation, shame, and/or anger<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heider, Fritz|year=1958|title=The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations|location=New York|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n==How it affects human function==\n\n=== Choices regarding behavior ===\nPeople generally avoid tasks where self-efficacy is low, but undertake tasks where self-efficacy is high. When self-efficacy is significantly beyond actual ability, it leads to an overestimation of the ability to complete tasks. On the other hand, when self-efficacy is significantly lower than actual ability, it discourages growth and skill development. Research shows that the optimum level of self-efficacy is slightly above ability; in this situation, people are most encouraged to tackle challenging tasks and gain experience.<ref name=\"FF\">[[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi, M.]], ''Finding Flow,'' 1997</ref> Self-efficacy is made of dimensions like magnitude, strength, and generality to explain how one believes they will perform on a specific task.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Lyman W. |last2=Bigley |first2=Gregory A. |last3=Steers |first3=Richard M. |title=Motivation and Work Behavior |date=2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin |page=131\u2013132 |edition=7th }}</ref>\n\n=== Motivation ===\nHigh self-efficacy can affect [[motivation]] in both positive and negative ways. In general, people with high self-efficacy are more likely to make efforts to complete a task, and to persist longer in those efforts, than those with low self-efficacy.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep2501_6|title = Goal Setting and Self-Efficacy During Self-Regulated Learning|journal = Educational Psychologist|volume = 25|pages = 71\u201386|year = 1990|last1 = Schunk|first1 = Dale H.|url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/D_Schunk_Goal_1990.pdf}}</ref> The stronger the self-efficacy or mastery expectations, the more active the efforts.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Bandura | first=Albert\n | author-link=Albert Bandura\n | year=1977\n | title=Social Learning Theory\n | publisher=Alexandria, VA: Prentice Hall\n | page=247\n | isbn= 978-0-13-816744-8\n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXvuAAAAMAAJ\n | format=\n}}\n</ref> However, those with low self-efficacy sometimes experience incentive to learn more about an unfamiliar subject, where someone with a high self-efficacy may not prepare as well for a task. \n\nA negative effect of low self-efficacy is that it can lead to a state of learned helplessness. [[Learned helplessness]] was studied by [[Martin Seligman]] in an experiment in which shocks were applied to animals. Through the experiment, it was discovered that the animals placed in a cage where they could escape shocks by moving to a different part of the cage did not attempt to move if they had formerly been placed in a cage in which escape from the shocks was not possible. Low self-efficacy can lead to this state in which it is believed that no amount of effort will make a difference in the success of the task at hand.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seifert|first1=Kelvin|title=Educational Psychology|date=2011|pages=119|edition=Third|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6w0r87qmrz7vg0/Educational%20Psychology.pdf?dl=0#pageContainer116|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Work performance ===\nSelf-efficacy theory has been embraced by management scholars and practitioners because of its applicability in the workplace. Overall, self-efficacy is positively and strongly related to work-related performance. This relationship, though, depends on task complexity. For more complex tasks, the relationships between self-efficacy and work performance is weaker than for easier work-related tasks. The implications of this research is that managers should provide accurate descriptions of tasks and provide clear and concise instructions and they should provide the necessary supporting elements for employees to be successful. \n\n=== Thought patterns and responses ===\nSelf-efficacy has several effects on thought patterns and responses:\n* Low self-efficacy can lead people to believe tasks to be harder than they actually are. This often results in poor task planning, as well as increased stress. \n* People become erratic and unpredictable when engaging in a task in which they have low self-efficacy. \n* People with high self-efficacy tend to take a wider view of a task in order to determine the best plan. \n* Obstacles often stimulate people with high self-efficacy to greater efforts, where someone with low self-efficacy will tend toward discouragement and giving up.\n* A person with high self-efficacy will attribute failure to external factors, where a person with low self-efficacy will blame low ability. For example, someone with high self-efficacy in regards to mathematics may attribute a poor test grade to a harder-than-usual test, illness, lack of effort, or insufficient preparation. A person with a low self-efficacy will attribute the result to poor mathematical ability. See [[Attribution Theory]].\n\n=== Health behaviors ===\nChoices affecting health, such as [[smoking]], [[physical exercise]], dieting, condom use, dental hygiene, seat belt use, and breast self-examination, are dependent on self-efficacy.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Conner, M.|editor2=P. Norman|year=2005|title=Predicting health behaviour|edition=2nd ed. rev.|location=Buckingham, England|publisher=Open University Press}}</ref> Self-efficacy beliefs are cognitions that determine whether health behavior change will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and failures. Self-efficacy influences how high people set their health goals (e.g., \"I intend to reduce my smoking\", or \"I intend to quit smoking altogether\").  A number of studies on the adoption of health practices have measured self-efficacy to assess its potential to initiate behavior change.<ref name=\"Luszczynska, A. 2005 pp. 127\" /> With increased self-efficacy, individuals have greater confidence in their ability and thus are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors. Greater engagement in healthy behaviors, result in positive patient health outcomes such as improved quality of life.\n\n=== Relationship to loss of control ===\n{{Further|Locus of control}}\nBandura showed that difference in self-efficacy correlates to fundamentally different world views.<ref>Karyn Ainsworth, Fall Quarter Seminar Paper: [https://web.archive.org/web/20060619202533/http://academic.evergreen.edu:80/a/ainkar18/teachinglearningpaper.htm What is Teaching? / What is Learning?]</ref><ref>Diffusion of the Internet within a Graduate School of Education, 2.

For example, a student with high self-efficacy who does poorly on an exam will likely attribute the failure to the fact that they did not study enough. However, a student with low self-efficacy who does poorly on an exam is likely to believe the cause of that failure was due to the test being too difficult or challenging, which the student does not control.\n\n===Factors affecting self-efficacy===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Enactive attainment]] -->\n\nBandura identifies four factors affecting self-efficacy.\n# Experience, or \"enactive attainment\" \u2013 The experience of mastery is the most important factor determining a person's self-efficacy. Success raises self-efficacy, while failure lowers it. According to psychologist [[Erik Erikson]]: \"Children cannot be fooled by empty praise and condescending encouragement. They may have to accept artificial bolstering of their self-esteem in lieu of something better, but what I call their accruing ego identity gains real strength only from wholehearted and consistent recognition of real accomplishment, that is, achievement that has meaning in their culture.\"\n# Modeling, or \"[[Wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] experience\" \u2013 Modeling is experienced as, \"If they can do it, I can do it as well\". When we see someone succeeding, our own self-efficacy increases; where we see people failing, our self-efficacy decreases. This process is most effectual when we see ourselves as similar to the model. Although not as influential as direct experience, [[Modelling (psychology)|modeling]] is particularly useful for people who are particularly unsure of themselves.\n# Social persuasion \u2013 Social persuasion generally manifests as direct encouragement or discouragement from another person. Discouragement is generally more effective at decreasing a person's self-efficacy than encouragement is at increasing it.\n# Physiological factors \u2013 In stressful situations, people commonly exhibit signs of distress: shakes, aches and pains, fatigue, fear, nausea, etc. Perceptions of these responses in oneself can markedly alter self-efficacy. Getting '[[butterflies in the stomach]]' before public speaking will be interpreted by someone with low self-efficacy as a sign of inability, thus decreasing self-efficacy further, where high self-efficacy would lead to interpreting such physiological signs as normal and unrelated to ability. It is one's belief in the implications of physiological response that alters self-efficacy, rather than the physiological response itself.<ref>The YouTube video \"Self Efficacy\" can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnACsrdGZAI and summarizes many of the factors affecting self-efficacy that are described above. It additionally provides detailed examples that can clarify any confusion.</ref>\n\n==Genetic and environmental determinants==\n\nIn a Norwegian twin study, the [[heritability]] of self-efficacy in adolescents was estimated at 75 percent. The remaining variance, 25 percent, was due to environmental influences not shared between family members. The shared family environment did not contribute to individual differences in self-efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Waaktaar | first1 = Trine | last2 = Torgersen | first2 = Svenn |authorlink2=Svenn Torgersen | year = 2013 | title = Self-Efficacy Is Mainly Genetic, Not Learned: A Multiple-Rater Twin Study on the Causal Structure of General Self-Efficacy in Young People | url = | journal = Twin Research and Human Genetics | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 651\u2013660 | doi=10.1017/thg.2013.25| pmid = 23601253 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==Theoretical models of behavior==\nA theoretical model of the effect of self-efficacy on [[Norm (sociology)|transgressive]] behavior was developed and verified in research with school children.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.1.125 | title=Sociocognitive self-regulatory mechanisms governing transgressive behavior| journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume=80| pages=125\u2013135| year=2001| last1=Bandura| first1=Albert| last2=Caprara| first2=Gian Vittorio| last3=Barbaranelli| first3=Claudio| last4=Pastorelli| first4=Concetta| last5=Regalia| first5=Camillo|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Sociocognitive-self-regulatory-mechanisms-governing-Bandura-Caprara/a85a2852b9a5eca29d1ad5a02df87bdab39a3c71}}</ref>\n\n===Prosociality and moral disengagement===\n\nProsocial behavior (such as helping others, sharing, and being kind and cooperative) and [[moral disengagement]] (manifesting in behaviors such as [[making excuses]] for bad behavior, avoiding responsibility for consequences, and [[blaming the victim]]) are negatively correlated.<ref>Kwak, K., & Bandura, A.

Self-efficacy is the belief in one's efficacy.\n;Self-efficacy versus Self-esteem\n:Self-efficacy is the perception of one's own ability to reach a goal; self-esteem is the sense of self-worth. For example, a person who is a terrible rock climber would probably have poor self-efficacy with regard to rock climbing, but this will not affect self-esteem if the person doesn\u2019t rely on rock climbing to determine self-worth.<ref name=PajaresOutline>{{cite web|last=Pajares |first=Frank|year=2002|title= Self-efficacy beliefs in academic contexts: An outline|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227023200/http://www.des.emory.edu:80/mfp/efftalk.html|publisher=Emory University}}</ref> On the other hand, one might have enormous confidence with regard to rock climbing, yet set such a high standard, and base enough of self-worth on rock-climbing skill, that self-esteem is low.<ref>Prof. Albert Bandura quoted in ''The Wall Street Journal'' 29 April 2008: D1</ref> Someone who has high self-efficacy in general but is poor at rock climbing might have misplaced confidence, or believe that improvement is possible.\n;Self-efficacy versus [[Confidence]]\n:According to [[Albert Bandura]], \"the construct of self-efficacy differs from the colloquial term 'confidence.' Confidence is a nonspecific term that refers to strength of belief but does not necessarily specify what the certainty is about. I can be supremely confident that I will fail at an endeavor. Perceived self-efficacy refers to belief in one's agentive capabilities, that one can produce given levels of attainment. A self-efficacy belief, therefore, includes both an affirmation of a capability level and the strength of that belief.\n;Self-efficacy versus Self-concept\n:Self-efficacy comprises beliefs of personal capability to perform specific actions. Self-concept is measured more generally and includes the evaluation of such competence and the feelings of self-worth associated with the behaviors in question.<ref name=PajaresOutline/> In an academic situation, a student's confidence in their ability to write an essay is self-efficacy. Self-concept, on the other hand, could be how a student's level of intelligence affects their beliefs regarding their worth as a person.\n;Self-efficacy as part of core self-evaluations\n:Timothy A. Judge ''et al.'' (2002) has argued that the concepts of [[locus of control]], [[neuroticism]], generalized self-efficacy (which differs from Bandura's theory of self-efficacy) and [[self-esteem]] are so strongly correlated and exhibit such a high degree of theoretical overlap that they are actually aspects of the same higher order construct, which he calls [[core self-evaluations]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Judge|first=Timothy A.|author2=Erez, Amir |author3=Bono, Joyce E. |author4= Thoresen, Carl J. |title=Are measures of self-esteem, neuroticism, locus of control, and generalized self-efficacy indicators of a common core construct?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2002|volume=83|issue=3|pages=693\u2013710|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.3.693|pmid=12219863|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d3ff6fcbfc9c8213aee215756c24b1889ce40040}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=35em|\n* [[Albert Bandura]]\n* [[Core self-evaluations]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Hope]]\n* [[Illusory superiority]]\n* [[Information seeking]]\n* [[Outline of self]]\n* [[People skills]]\n* [[Positive psychology]]\n* [[Self]]\n* [[Work self-efficacy]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;General\n*{{Citation\n | last=Bandura | first=Albert\n | author-link=Albert Bandura\n | year=1997\n | title=Self-efficacy: The exercise of control\n | publisher=New York: Freeman\n | page=604\n | isbn= 978-0-7167-2626-5\n | url=https://books.google.com/?id=eJ-PN9g_o-EC\n}} ([[Self-Efficacy (book)|see article]])\n*{{Citation\n | last=Bandura | first=Albert\n | author-link=Albert Bandura\n | year=2001\n | title=Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective\n | journal=Annual Review of Psychology\n | volume=52\n | issue=1\n | pages=1\u201326\n | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1\n | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319213324/http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/Bandura2001ARPr.PDF\n | pmid=11148297\n}}\n*{{citation|author=Baron, A.
