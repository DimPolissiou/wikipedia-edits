It is a [[cobblestone architecture|cobblestone]] building dating to the 1830s.\n\nAt the time of its construction it was a [[stagecoach]] stop on the busy east-west route paralleling the [[Lake Ontario]] shoreline. It remained in use as an inn into the mid-20th century despite the loss of stagecoach traffic to the railroads in the decades after its construction. It is believed to be the largest cobblestone building in the state. In 2007 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==Building==\n\nThe inn is located on the northwest corner of the junction of Route 104 and Oak Orchard River Road ([[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]] [[County Route 53 (Orleans County, New York)|Route 53]]). It is roughly {{convert|800|ft|m}} west of where the highway crosses the [[Oak Orchard River]], and thus the ground around it slopes gently eastward. The building itself is on a {{convert|1.3|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[Land grading|graded]] lot, elevating it slightly above the intersection. There are houses to the west along either side of the road and woods to the east as it slopes to the river.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nThe building itself is a two-story L-shaped structure seven [[bay (architecture)|bays]] on the long leg, paralleling Oak Orchard River Road, and four on the short. It is faced in cobblestones, five rows per [[Medina, New York|Medina]] [[sandstone]] [[Quoin (architecture)|quoin]], with a [[hip roof|hipped roof]] pierced by a single central brick chimney with stepped [[parapet]] walls at the north and west ends. There is a wide plain [[frieze]] below the overhanging [[eave]]s. Besides the quoins, the sills, lintels, and [[water table]] are all sandstone as well. On the east side are two modern wooden porches at entrances along that wall. There is visible evidence of the roofs that once sheltered both.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nFrom the main entrance on the south wall a long central entrance hall runs north to a long four-bay room and then ends in a group of service-related rooms. The second floor has, in addition to its small guest rooms, a similar room in that space. The interior retains much of its original plaster and Greek Revival woodwork. The main staircase has its original stringers, [[newel]]s and [[balustrade]].<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThere is little documentation of the building's history. The arrangement of the cobblestone facing is consistent with the middle period of the style, 1836\u20131845. The interior layout with the large public dining room on the first floor (probably expanded later on by removing a few rooms) suggests the inn did a lot of business on a competitive stage route. It is believed to be the largest cobblestone building of the hundreds documented in New York.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n\nTraffic on the stage routes declined first with the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] to the south, and then the rise of the railroads in the mid-19th century. The inn survived by becoming primarily a restaurant, and saw its business revive in the  days of automobile tourism in the 1920s in that capacity. In the mid-20th century, that business declined when the [[New York State Thruway]] was built to the south in [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]]. After being vacant for a while, the inn was [[adaptive reuse|converted]] into a residence. It has remained in that use, with no alterations, since then.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\" />\n        \n\nThe Inn was also recently featured in the television show The Dead Files. Episode name, Drawn to Evil, season 7,episode 13. Current owners claim a serious haunting and the show goes into detail about the Inns long history.\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Orleans County, New York]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4N6B_Cobblestone_Inn_Oak_Orchard_New_York Cobblestone Inn, Oak Orchard, New York - Cobblestone Buildings on Waymarking.com]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New York}}\n\n[[Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Cobblestone architecture]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1837]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Orleans County, New York]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orleans County, New York]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Cobblestone Inn\n  | nrhp_type = \n  | image = Cobblestone Inn, Oak-Orchard-on-the-Ridge, NY.jpg\n  | alt = A large building faced in small brownish stones with two wooden front decks and a common stair, seen from slightly below\n  | caption = East elevation and south profile, 2010\n  | location= [[Oak Orchard, New York|Oak-Orchard-on-the-Ridge]], [[New York (state)|NY]]\n  | nearest_city = [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]]\n  | coordinates = {{coord|43|16|28|N|78|19|59|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin = New York#USA\n  | area = {{convert|1.3|acre|m2}}<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=102048|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Cobblestone Inn|date=December 2006|accessdate=2009-06-14|author=Robert T.
