He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can \"do it without thinking\". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later.<ref>\"Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me\"&nbsp;\u2014 ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview</ref>\n\n[[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for \"this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.\"<ref name=\"falk\" />\n\nRenowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.<ref name=\"RADA\">[https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]''.

He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, \"Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life.\"<ref name=\"falk\" /> Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by [[Thomas Harris]]. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]'' would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anthony Hopkins regrets playing Hannibal Lecter thrice.

He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can \"do it without thinking\". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later.<ref>\"Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me\"&nbsp;\u2014 ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview</ref>\n\n[[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for \"this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.\"<ref name=\"falk\" />\n\nRenowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.<ref name=\"RADA\">[https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]''.

When I was a kid I'd tell the girls around the street the story about [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and I'd go 'th-th-th' (the sucking noise which he reproduced in ''The Silence of the Lambs''). As a result, they'd run away screaming.\"<ref name=\"RT Interview\">[https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/sir-anthony-hopkins-reveals-scary-12079267 \"Anthony Hopkins reveals his scary Hannibal Lecter was born on the streets of Port Talbot when he was a boy\"].

His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' featured an impersonation of comedian [[Tommy Cooper]].

In the same year, as part of the restoration process for the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', Hopkins was approached to re-record lines from a scene that was being added back to the film; this scene featured [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Tony Curtis]], with Hopkins recommended by Olivier's widow, [[Joan Plowright]] to perform her late husband's part thanks to his talent for mimicry.<ref name=\"Universal Pictures\">{{cite web|title=Restoration of \"Spartacus\" \u2013 \"Spartacus\" Production Notes|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2009/spartacus/|publisher=Universal Pictures|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he directed ''[[August (1996 film)|August]]'', an adaptation of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' set in Wales.

The technique was highly developed during the [[Nasrid dynasty]], [[Merinid dynasty]] and [[Zayyanid dynasty]] who gave it more importance around the 14th century and introduced blue, green and yellow colours. Red was added in the 17th century. The old enamels with the natural colours were used until the beginning of the 20th century and the colours had probably not evolved much since the period of Merinids. The cities of [[Fes]] and [[Meknes]] in [[Morocco]], remain the centers of this art.\n\nPatrons of the art used zellige historically to decorate their homes as a statement of luxury and the sophistication of the inhabitants. Zellige is typically a series of patterns utilizing colourful [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. This framework of expression arose from the need of [[Islamic art]]ists to create spatial decorations that [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided depictions of living things]], consistent with the teachings of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].\n\n== Clays for Zellige ==\n[[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes in Morocco are still the production centers for zellige tiles due to the [[Miocene]] grey clay of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]].
