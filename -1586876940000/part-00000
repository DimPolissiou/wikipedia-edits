To strengthen trading and power, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became Danish in 1814, and was fully integrated in the Danish state in 1953 under the [[Constitution of Denmark]]. In 1973, Greenland joined the [[European Economic Community]] with Denmark. However, in a [[1982 Greenlandic European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] in 1982, a majority of the population voted for Greenland to withdraw from the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], which was effected in 1985.

The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] had maintained a strict monopoly of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenlandic trade]], allowing only small scale [[troaking]] with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the [[Landsr\u00e5dene]], recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern [[welfare state]] with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom.

Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation \u2014 or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies \"succeeded\" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity. A movement developed in favour of independence, reaching its peak in the 1970s.<ref>Loukacheva, Natalia (2007).

The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small shrubs, which are regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]'') along with gray-leaf willow (''[[Salix glauca]]''), rowan (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]'') and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\n\nGreenland's flora consists of about 500 species of \"higher\" plants, i.e. [[flowering plant]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[lycopodiophyta]]. Of the other groups, the [[lichen]]s are the most diverse, with about 950 species; there are 600-700 species of fungi; [[moss]]es and [[bryophyte]]s are also found. Most of Greenland's higher plants have [[wikt:Special:Search/circumpolar|circumpolar]] or [[circumboreal]] distributions; only a dozen species of [[saxifrage]] and [[hawkweed]] are [[endemic]].

About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.\n\nGreenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and [[zinc]] mine that year.

Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called ''[[tupilak]]'' or a \"spirit object.\" Traditional art-making practices thrive in the ''Ammassalik''.<ref name=ingo20>[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 20</ref> [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.<ref>[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 21</ref>\n\nGreenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] bands and artists include [[Sume (band)|Sume]] (classic rock), [[Chilly Friday]] (rock), [[Nanook]] (rock), [[Siissisoq]] (rock), [[Nuuk Posse]] (hip hop) and [[Rasmus Lyberth]] (folk), who performed in the [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979|Danish national final for the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest]], performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter [[Simon Lynge]] is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional [[Inuit music]], largely revolving around singing and drums.\n\n===Sport===\n{{Main|Sport in Greenland}}\nSport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 109</ref> Popular sports include [[association football]], [[track and field]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[skiing]]. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,<ref name=\"handball\">[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 110</ref> and [[Greenland national handball team|Greenland's men's national team]] was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001.\n\nGreenland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public. Although the environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there is a golf course in Nuuk.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Greenlandic cuisine}}\nThe national dish of Greenland is [[suaasat]]. Meat from marine mammals, game, birds, and fish play a large role in the Greenlandic diet.

When it re-established contact with Greenland in the early 17th&nbsp;century, Denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island. In 1721, a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary [[Hans Egede]] was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there. This expedition is part of the Dano-Norwegian colonization of the Americas. After 15&nbsp;years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son [[Paul Egede]] in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary.

Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling [[cryolite]] from the mine at [[Ivittuut]].

The Danish [[Sl\u00e6depatruljen Sirius|Sirius Patrol]] guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dogsleds. They detected several German [[weather station]]s and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, [[Albert Speer]] briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the [[United States Armed Forces]].<ref>[[Albert Speer|Speer, Albert]]. ''Inside the Third Reich,'' 1971</ref>\n\nGreenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] had maintained a strict monopoly of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenlandic trade]], allowing only small scale [[troaking]] with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the [[Landsr\u00e5dene]], recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern [[welfare state]] with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom.

The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap [[2014 Greenlandic general election|2014]] and [[2018 Greenlandic general election|2018]] elections.\n\nThe non-binding [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|2008 referendum on self-governance]] favoured increased self-governance by 21,355 votes to 6,663.\n\nIn 1985, [[Greenland\u2013European Union relations|Greenland left the European Economic Community]] (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member.

About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.\n\nGreenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and [[zinc]] mine that year.

A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the [[The Helicopter Museum (Weston)|Helicopter Museum]], [[Weston Museum]], and the [[Grand Pier, Weston-super-Mare|Grand Pier]].

Mining families also came across the [[Bristol Channel]] from South Wales by [[steamboat|paddle steamer]]. To cater for them, [[Birnbeck Pier]] was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday [[amusement arcade]]s, tea rooms, [[amusement ride]]s and a [[photography|photographic]] studio.

Large detached villas, for the middle classes, were built on the southern slopes of Worlebury Hill. Semi-detached and terraced housing was built on the low \"moorland\" behind the sea front in an area known as South Ward. Many of these houses have now been converted into [[bedsit]]s. Most of the houses built in the Victorian era are built from stone and feature details made from [[Bath Stone]], influenced by local architect [[Hans Price]].\n\nIn 1885, the first transatlantic telegraph cable of the [[Commercial Cable Company]] was brought ashore and the company started a long association with the town, ending in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cial.org.uk/cable13.htm|title=The Commercial Cable Company, early development as told by the president and others|publisher=John Crellin|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel in the spring of 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to [[Brean Down]] (just south west of Weston, on the other side of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swehs.co.uk/archives/news03su.pdf|title=Marconi \u2013 the Father of Radio|last=Phillips|first=Barrie|year=1996|work=Supplement to Histalec News NO.3|publisher=South Western Electricity Historical Society|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nA second railway, the [[Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway]], opened on 1 December 1897, connecting Weston to [[Clevedon]].<ref name=maggswcp>Maggs, Colin G.

The growth continued until the second half of the 20th century, when tourism declined and some local industries closed. A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the [[The Helicopter Museum (Weston)|Helicopter Museum]], [[Weston Museum]], and the [[Grand Pier, Weston-super-Mare|Grand Pier]]. The [[PS Waverley|Paddle Steamer ''Waverley'']] and [[MV Balmoral (1949)|MV ''Balmoral'']] offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and [[Severn Estuary]]. Cultural venues include [[The Playhouse, Weston-super-Mare|The Playhouse]], the [[Winter Gardens Pavilion, Weston-super-Mare|Winter Gardens]] and the [[The Blakehay Theatre, Weston-super-Mare|Blakehay Theatre]].\n\nPartly owing to the large [[tidal range]] in the Bristol Channel, the low tide mark in [[Weston Bay]] is about {{convert|1|mi|km}} from the seafront. Although the beach itself is sandy, low tide uncovers areas of thick mud, hence the colloquial name, [[Weston-Super-Mud]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Weston super Mare|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=703|work=Vision of Britain|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weston super Mare|url=http://www.bristolnomads.org.uk/location_reports/s_bristol_channel/wsm.htm|publisher=Bristol Nomads|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Miles of Golden Sands|url=http://www.weston-super-mare.com/Beach-GoldenSands|publisher=Weston super Mare|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> These [[mudflat]]s are very dangerous to walk in and are crossed by the mouth of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]].

Weston owes its growth and prosperity to the [[Victorian era]] boom in seaside holidays. Construction of the first hotel in the village started in 1808; it was called \"Reeves\" (now the Royal Hotel).<ref name=\"somharbours\">{{cite book |title=Somerset harbours, including the port of Bristol |last=Farr |first=Grahame Edgar |authorlink= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=76\u201379 }}</ref> Along with nearby [[Burnham-on-Sea]], Weston benefited from proximity to [[Bristol]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[South Wales]]. The first attempt at an artificial harbour was made in the late 1820s at the islet of Knightstone and a slipway built from Anchor Head towards Birnbeck Island.<ref name=\"somharbours\"/>\n\n[[File:Birnbeck Pier and Island.jpg |thumb |alt=Structure supported on metal legs crossing the sea to an island which has some buildings on it.

With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] and further afield, on works outings and [[bank holiday]]s. Mining families also came across the [[Bristol Channel]] from South Wales by [[steamboat|paddle steamer]]. To cater for them, [[Birnbeck Pier]] was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday [[amusement arcade]]s, tea rooms, [[amusement ride]]s and a [[photography|photographic]] studio.

Large detached villas, for the middle classes, were built on the southern slopes of Worlebury Hill. Semi-detached and terraced housing was built on the low \"moorland\" behind the sea front in an area known as South Ward. Many of these houses have now been converted into [[bedsit]]s. Most of the houses built in the Victorian era are built from stone and feature details made from [[Bath Stone]], influenced by local architect [[Hans Price]].\n\nIn 1885, the first transatlantic telegraph cable of the [[Commercial Cable Company]] was brought ashore and the company started a long association with the town, ending in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cial.org.uk/cable13.htm|title=The Commercial Cable Company, early development as told by the president and others|publisher=John Crellin|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel in the spring of 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to [[Brean Down]] (just south west of Weston, on the other side of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swehs.co.uk/archives/news03su.pdf|title=Marconi \u2013 the Father of Radio|last=Phillips|first=Barrie|year=1996|work=Supplement to Histalec News NO.3|publisher=South Western Electricity Historical Society|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nA second railway, the [[Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway]], opened on 1 December 1897, connecting Weston to [[Clevedon]].<ref name=maggswcp>Maggs, Colin G.

The [[Odeon Cinema, Weston-super-Mare|Odeon Cinema]] by [[Thomas Cecil Howitt]] is notable for fully retaining many [[Art Deco]] features both internally and externally, and retaining its original [[theatre organ]], a [[John Compton (organ builder)|Compton]] from 1935.

{"title_page": "Self-made man", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n'''\"Self-made man\"''' is a classic phrase coined on February 11, 1832, by [[Henry Clay]] in the United States Senate, to describe individuals whose success lay within the individuals themselves, not with outside conditions. [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], has been described as the greatest exemplar of the self-made man. Inspired by Franklin's autobiography, [[Frederick Douglass]] developed the concept of the self-made man in a [[Self-Made Men|series of lectures]] that spanned decades starting in 1859. Originally, the term referred to an individual who arises from a poor or otherwise [[disadvantaged]] background to eminence in financial, political or other areas by nurturing qualities, such as perseverance and hard work, as opposed to achieving these goals through [[Inheritance|inherited fortune]], family connections, or other privileges. By the mid-1950s, success in the United States generally implied \"business success\".\n\nIn the intellectual and [[cultural history of the United States]], the idea of the self-made man as an archetype or cultural ideal has been criticized by some as being a [[myth]] or a [[cult]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File: Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Duplessis 1778.jpg|left|thumb|'' Benjamin Franklin'', c. 1785.

The joint stock companies of the North, as I understand them, are nothing more than associations, sometimes of hundreds, by means of which the small earnings of many are brought into a common stock; and the associates, obtaining corporate privileges, are enabled to prosecute, under one superintending head, their business to better advantage. Nothing can be more essentially democratic, or better devised to counterpoise the influence of individual wealth. In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me is in the hands of enterprising self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor. Comparisons are odious, and, but in defence, would not be made by me. But is there more tendency to aristocracy in a manufactory, supporting hundreds of freemen, or in a cotton plantation, with its not less numerous slaves, sustaining, perhaps, only two white families-that of the master and the overseer?}}</ref>{{rp|100}}\n\nThe essential doctrine behind the self-made man is that success lies within the person himself and not with outside conditions.

The brain receives 60-70% of its required energy from ketone bodies when blood glucose levels are low. These bodies are transported into the brain by monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 2. Therefore, ketone bodies are a way to move energy from the liver to other cells. The liver does not have the critical enzyme,  succinyl CoA transferase, to process ketone bodies, and therefore cannot undergo ketolysis.<ref name=\"pmid27983603\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The result is that the liver only produces ketone bodies, but does not use a significant amount of them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=J D McGarry|last2=Foster|first2=and D.

Coenzyme A is recycled at this step.\n* When the body has no free carbohydrates available, fat must be broken down into acetyl-CoA in order to get energy. Under these conditions, acetyl-CoA cannot be metabolized through the citric acid cycle because the citric acid cycle intermediates (mainly [[oxaloacetate]]) have been depleted to feed the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway. The resulting accumulation of acetyl-CoA activates ketogenesis.\n\n[[Insulin]] and [[glucagon]] are key regulating hormones of ketogenesis. Both hormones regulate [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] and [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]]. Hormone-sensitive lipase produces diglycerides from triglycerides, freeing a fatty acid molecule for oxidation. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the production of [[malonyl-CoA]] from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA reduces the activity of [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]], an enzyme that brings fatty acids into the [[mitochondria]] for [[\u03b2-oxidation]]. Insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase and activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby reducing the amount of starting materials for fatty acid oxidation and inhibiting their capacity to enter the mitochondria. Glucagon activates hormone-sensitive lipase and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby stimulating ketone body production, and making passage into the mitochondria for \u03b2-oxidation easier.<ref name=\":2\" /> Insulin also inhibits [[HMG-CoA lyase]], further inhibiting ketone body production. Similarly, [[cortisol]], [[catecholamines]], [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[thyroid hormones]] can increase the amount of ketone bodies produced, by activating [[lipolysis]] (the mobilization of fatty acids out of [[adipose tissue|fat tissue]]) and thereby increasing the concentration of fatty acids available for \u03b2-oxidation.<ref name=\"pmid27983603\" />\n\n[[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor alpha]] (PPAR\u03b1) also has the ability to regulate ketogenesis, as it has some control over a number of genes involved in ketogenesis. For example, [[monocarboxylate transporter 1]], which is involved in transporting ketone bodies over membranes (including the [[blood-brain barrier]]), is regulated by PPAR\u03b1, thus affecting ketone body transportation into the brain.  Carnitine palmitoyltransferase is also regulated by PPAR\u03b1, which can affect fatty acid transportation into the mitochondria.<ref name=\"pmid27983603\" />\n\n==Pathology==\nBoth acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are [[acid]]ic, and, if levels of these ketone bodies are too high, the [[pH]] of the blood drops, resulting in [[ketoacidosis]]. Ketoacidosis is known to occur in untreated [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]] (see [[diabetic ketoacidosis]]) and in [[alcoholic]]s after prolonged binge-drinking without intake of sufficient carbohydrates (see [[alcoholic ketoacidosis]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nKetogenesis can be ineffective in people with beta oxidation defects.<ref name=Fukao/>\n\nIndividuals with diabetes mellitus can experience overproduction of ketone bodies due to a lack of insulin. Without insulin to help extract glucose from the blood, tissues the levels of malonyl-CoA are reduced, and it becomes easier for fatty acids to be transported into mitochondria, causing the accumulation of excess acetyl-CoA. The accumulation of acetyl-CoA in turn produces excess ketone bodies through ketogenesis.<ref name=\":1\" /> The result is a rate of ketone production higher than the rate of ketone disposal, and a decrease in blood pH.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThere are some health benefits to ketone bodies and ketogenesis as well.

Towers are distinguished from [[guyed mast|masts]] by their lack of [[guy-wires]] and are therefore, along with tall buildings, self-supporting structures.\n\nTowers are specifically distinguished from \"[[building]]s\" in that they are not built to be habitable but to serve other functions. The principal function is the use of their [[height]] to enable various functions to be achieved including: visibility of other features attached to the tower such as [[clock towers]]; as part of a larger structure or device to increase the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes as in a fortified building such as a [[castle]]; as a structure for [[Observation tower|observation]] for leisure purposes; or as a structure for [[telecommunication]] purposes. Towers can be stand alone structures or be supported by adjacent buildings or can be a feature on top of a large structure or building.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Old English]] ''torr'' is from [[Latin]] ''turris'' via [[Old French]] ''tor''. The Latin term together with [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 was loaned from a pre-Indo-European Mediterranean language, connected with the [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] toponym\n\u0392\u03bf\u03c5-\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03c2. With the [[Lydian language|Lydian]] toponyms \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1, \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1, it has been connected with the ethnonym [[Tyrrhenians|\u03a4\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9]] as well as with ''Tusci'' (from ''*Turs-ci''), the Greek and Latin names for the [[Etruscans]] (Kretschmer Glotta 22, 110ff.)\n\n==History==\nTowers have been used by mankind since prehistoric times. The oldest known may be the circular stone tower in walls of [[PPNA Wall of Jericho|Neolithic Jericho]] (8000 BC). Some of the earliest towers were [[ziggurat]]s, which existed in [[Sumerian architecture]] since the 4th millennium BC. The most famous ziggurats include the Sumerian [[Ziggurat of Ur]], built the 3rd millennium BC, and the [[Etemenanki]], one of the most famous examples of [[Art and architecture of Assyria|Babylonian architecture]]. The latter was built in [[Babylon]] during the 2nd millennium BC and was considered the tallest tower of the ancient world.\n\nSome of the earliest surviving examples are the [[broch]] structures in northern [[Scotland]], which are conical [[towerhouse]]s. These and other examples from [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures emphasised the use of a tower in fortification and sentinel roles.

Towers are distinguished from [[guyed mast|masts]] by their lack of [[guy-wires]] and are therefore, along with tall buildings, self-supporting structures.\n\nTowers are specifically distinguished from \"[[building]]s\" in that they are not built to be habitable but to serve other functions. The principal function is the use of their [[height]] to enable various functions to be achieved including: visibility of other features attached to the tower such as [[clock towers]]; as part of a larger structure or device to increase the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes as in a fortified building such as a [[castle]]; as a structure for [[Observation tower|observation]] for leisure purposes; or as a structure for [[telecommunication]] purposes. Towers can be stand alone structures or be supported by adjacent buildings or can be a feature on top of a large structure or building.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Old English]] ''torr'' is from [[Latin]] ''turris'' via [[Old French]] ''tor''. The Latin term together with [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 was loaned from a pre-Indo-European Mediterranean language, connected with the [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] toponym\n\u0392\u03bf\u03c5-\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03c2. With the [[Lydian language|Lydian]] toponyms \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1, \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1, it has been connected with the ethnonym [[Tyrrhenians|\u03a4\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9]] as well as with ''Tusci'' (from ''*Turs-ci''), the Greek and Latin names for the [[Etruscans]] (Kretschmer Glotta 22, 110ff.)\n\n==History==\nTowers have been used by mankind since prehistoric times. The oldest known may be the circular stone tower in walls of [[PPNA Wall of Jericho|Neolithic Jericho]] (8000 BC). Some of the earliest towers were [[ziggurat]]s, which existed in [[Sumerian architecture]] since the 4th millennium BC. The most famous ziggurats include the Sumerian [[Ziggurat of Ur]], built the 3rd millennium BC, and the [[Etemenanki]], one of the most famous examples of [[Art and architecture of Assyria|Babylonian architecture]]. The latter was built in [[Babylon]] during the 2nd millennium BC and was considered the tallest tower of the ancient world.\n\nSome of the earliest surviving examples are the [[broch]] structures in northern [[Scotland]], which are conical [[towerhouse]]s. These and other examples from [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures emphasised the use of a tower in fortification and sentinel roles. For example, the name of the Moroccan city of [[Mogador]], founded in the first millennium BC, is derived from the Phoenician word for [[watchtower]] ('migdol'). The Romans utilised octagonal towers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691|title=Diocletian's Palace|first=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith|last=Map|website=The Megalithic Portal}}</ref> as elements of [[Diocletian's Palace]] in [[Croatia]], which monument dates to approximately 300 AD, while the [[Servian Walls]] (4th century BC) and the [[Aurelian Walls]] (3rd century AD) featured square ones.

The theater reopened in 2002 in [[Clarendon, Texas]].]]\n\nAfter 1945 rising car ownership and suburban and rural population led to a boom in drive-in theaters, with hundreds being opened each year. More couples were reunited and having children, resulting in the [[Baby boom|Baby Boom]], and more cars were being purchased following the end of wartime fuel rationing. By 1951, the number of drive-in movie theaters in the United States had increased from its 1947 total of 155 to 4,151.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=|title=DRIVE-IN THEATRES, TECHNOLOGY, AND CULTURAL CHA|last=Fox|first=Mark A.|date=June 1, 2018|work=Gale Academic Onefile}}</ref>\n\nThe drive-in's peak popularity came in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly in rural areas, with over 4,000 drive-ins spread across the United States in 1958.<ref name=\"LJN\" /> They were a cheaper alternative to in-door cinema theaters because not only did they save the gas of driving out to the city and then back home, but the cost of building and maintaining a drive-in theater was cheaper than that of an in-door theater, resulting in lower overall cost of attendance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Among its advantages was the fact that older adults with children could take care of their infant while watching a movie, while youth found drive-ins ideal for a first date. Unlike indoor cinema theaters, there was an air of informality which was appealing to people of all ages, but specifically to families. The drive-in\u2019s success was rooted in its reputation of being a family-friendly place. Parents were able to bring their children to the theater, often in pajamas, without having to worry about bothering other movie-goers, and were also able to spend time together without paying the expenses of babysitters. Drive-ins catered to their known audience, offering luxuries such as bottle warmers and diaper vending machines, and later miniature golf courses, swimming pools, and even motels on the land with windows facing the screens so that viewers could watch the films from their beds.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the 1950s, the greater privacy afforded to patrons gave drive-ins a reputation as immoral, and they were labeled \"passion pits\" in the media. The 1978 movie ''Grease'' portrays the local drive-in as a preferred spot for trysts.\n\nAt their height, some drive-ins used attention-grabbing gimmicks to boost attendance. They ranged from drawings for prizes and free admission, small airplane runways,  helicopter or [[hot air balloon]] rides,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://driveinadventures.wordpress.com/tag/farmingdale-drive-in/|title=farmingdale drive-in - Drive-In Theater Adventures|author=|date=|website=DriveInAdventures.Wordpress.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> unusual attractions such as a small petting zoo or cage of monkeys, personal appearances by actors to open their movies, or musical groups to play before the show. Some drive-ins held Sunday religious services, or charged a flat price per car on slow nights like Wednesdays or Sundays. On \"buck\" nights during the 1950s and 1960s, the admission price was one dollar per car.\n\nAs revenue was more limited than regular theaters since showings could only begin at twilight, there were abortive attempts to create suitable conditions for daylight viewing such as large tent structures, but nothing viable was developed.\n\n[[File:SnackBarAd.jpg|thumb|right|A snack bar ad shown at a drive-in]]\nOne of the largest drive-in theaters was the Johnny All-Weather Drive-In in [[Copiague, New York]]. Covering over 29 acres, it could park 2,500 vehicles. It had a full-service restaurant with seating on the roof, and a trolley system to take children and adults to a playground and a large indoor theater for bad weather or for those who wanted to watch in air-conditioned comfort.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Ci0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA119&dq=popular+science+1930#v=onepage&q=popular%20science%201930&f=true \n | title = Million-Dollar Drive-In Offers Films, Fun and Food | work = Popular Science | date = September 1957 | pages = 119\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n=== Decline (1970s\u20131990s) ===\n[[File:Hollywood Drive In New York.JPG|thumb|[[Hollywood Drive-in]] located in [[Averill Park, New York]]; closing credits roll for ''[[Aliens in the Attic]]'', 2009]]\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, drive-in attendance began to decline as the result of improvements and changes to home entertainment, from [[color television]] to [[cable TV]], [[VCR]]s and [[video rental]]. Additionally, the [[1970s energy crisis]] led to the widespread adoption of [[daylight saving time]] (which caused drive-in movies to start an hour later) and lower use of automobiles, making it increasingly difficult for drive-ins to remain profitable.\n\nWhile some drive-ins had been showing various [[exploitation film]]s since the 1950s, by the 1970s several venues switched from showing family-friendly fare to R-rated and X-rated films as a way to offset declining patronage and revenue, while other venues that still catered to families, began to show R-rated or pornographic movies in late night time slots to bring in extra income.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  This allowed censored materials to be viewed by a wider audience, including those for whom viewing was still illegal in some states, and it was also reliant upon varying local ordinances controlling such material. It also required a relatively remote location away from the heavier populated areas of towns and cities.\n\nThe [[Stagflation|runaway inflation]] and real estate interest rate hikes in the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|late 1970s and early 1980s]], made the large land tracts used by drive-ins increasingly expensive, and thus far too valuable for continued use as drive-ins. Many Drive-ins operated solely on weekends, while some were open only during the summer months; they were also subject to the whim of nature, as adverse weather often resulted in poor attendance or cancellations. By the late 1980s, the total number of drive-ins still operating in both the US and Canada fell to less than two hundred.\n\nMany former drive-in movie sites remain, with several re-purposed as storage or [[flea market]] sites, often after residential housing or other higher value uses came to rural or sparsely populated areas where the drive-ins were located. Former drive-in properties in Michigan have become industrial parks, shopping centers, indoor theaters, and even churches (as with the Former Woodland Drive-In in Grand Rapids, MI). In Philadelphia, the South City Drive In became the location of the original Spectrum in the late 1960s, with a small portion of its old property line extending into what would become the (now-demolished) Veterans Stadium complex. (Today that small portion, combined with the original Spectrum location, is part of [[Xfinity Live! Philadelphia]]). Another example of a drive in-turned-flea market is Spotlight 88 in [[North Sewickley Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania]], which ended business as a drive-in after an F3 tornado destroyed much of the property on May 31, 1985. As a joke after the tornado hit, the owners put up in the \"now-showing\" sign ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. It was most likely copied from a [[Taylor, Michigan]] Drive in called Ecorse Drive-In. On July 16, 1980, a freak [[derecho]] storm with 150&nbsp;mph straight line winds <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dtx/stories/1980derecho.php|title=NWS Detroit/Pontiac -- July 16th, 1980, Derecho|work=noaa.gov}}</ref> swept the Drive-In away leaving only the \"now-showing\" sign with the letters \"Now Playing Gone with the Wind\". The screen was rebuilt, but business never recovered; by 1989, it was sold and now is the site of a [[Kroger]] grocery store.\n\n=== Revival and new drive-in formats (late 1990s-2000s) ===\n[[File:SuperiorDriveIn.JPG|thumb|left|A newly built drive-in screen near [[Superior, Iowa]], 2009]]\n[[Image:Stars and Stripes Drive-In, Lubbock, TX IMG 4752.JPG|thumb|right|Stars & Stripes Drive-in at 5101 Highway 84 West in [[Lubbock, Texas]], 2010]]\nBeginning in the late 1970s, and extending through the mid-1990s, those drive-ins still operating acquired a quasi-novelty status, catering to the wave of \"boomer [[nostalgia]]\" and loyal patrons. This \"retro\" appeal eventually led to a revival of sorts by the end of the 1990s.\n\nThis resurgence of the drive-in industry led to the inception of the \"do-it-yourself\" drive-in beginning in 2001, which utilized contemporary tools such as LCD projectors and micro-radio transmitters. The first was the Liberation Drive-In in [[Oakland, California]], which sought to reclaim under-utilized urban spaces such as vacant parking lots in the downtown area. The following years have seen the rise of the \"guerrilla drive-in\" movement, in which groups of dedicated individuals orchestrate similar outdoor film and video screenings. Showings are often organized online, and participants meet at specified locations to watch films projected on bridge pillars or warehouses. The content featured at these screenings has frequently been independent or experimental films, cult movies, or otherwise alternative programming. Aside from Oakland's Liberation, the best-known \"guerrilla\" drive-ins include the Santa Cruz Guerilla Drive-In in [[Santa Cruz, California]], North Bay Mobile Drive-In in [[Novato, California]], [[Mobmov|MobMov]] in [[San Francisco, California]] and [[Hollywood]], and more recently the Guerilla Drive-In Victoria in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. \n\nA similar, more recent concept is that of the \"boutique\" drive-in, which caters to a smaller audience, generally 30 to 50 vehicles (with some also offering seats in front of the screen), while food trucks are often used as concession stands. Unlike the \"guerrilla\" format however, this type of drive-in also generally presents mainstream fare, both current releases and popular classics. A key feature of this format is the focus on the \"vintage\" aesthetics of the drive-in. \n\nFaced with the closure of Hull's Drive In in [[Lexington, Virginia]], in 1999, the non-profit group Hull's Angels formed to raise funds, buy the property and operate the theater as a non-profit venture specializing in family-friendly films. Hull's continues to be the nation's only non-profit drive-in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/56467701.html?dids=56467701:56467701&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current|title=The Best Picture Show; Drive-In Movie Fans Band Together To Keep a Screen From Going Dark|last=Philp|first=Rowan|date=17 July 2000|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy 2006, there were around 500 drive-in theaters open in the United States, counting both regularly-operating venues (around 400) and those that held showings sporadically, usually during summertime, the highest number since the mid-1970s. The industry also saw a rebound in Canada and Australia during the early 2000s.\n\nDrive-in theaters began seeing a slight resurgence in early 2020 amid \"social distancing\" rules mandated to keep people safe from the worldwide 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. <ref>{{cite web |language=en |author=Claire Voon |title=Social Distancing Is Bringing Drive-In Theaters Back to Life |date=10 April 2020 |website=Atlas Obscura |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/drive-in-theaters-adapt-to-coronavirus?utm_source=Atlas+Obscura+Daily+Newsletter&utm_campaign=06138930ed-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_14&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f36db9c480-06138930ed-71142717&mc_cid=06138930ed&mc_eid=da5ec35174}}</ref>\n\n=== Present and digital conversion (late 2000s onwards) ===\nBeginning in the second half of the 2000s, the drive-in saw another decline because of the oil crisis and a worsening economy. Reduced use of automobiles and more people moving out of suburban and rural areas during the 2010s have also put the future of the drive-in at risk, with numbers again on the decline. By 2013, drive-ins comprised only 1.5% of total movie screens in the United States, with 389 theaters in operation nationwide mostly located in the South and the West Coast (at the industry's height, about 25% of the nation's movie screens were at drive-ins).<ref name=\"LJN\" /> A figure of 348 operating drive-ins was published for the United States in March 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2013/06/drive-in-theaters-in-america|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000049/http://www.theawl.com/2013/06/drive-in-theaters-in-america|archivedate=2013-12-04|accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/235155/there-are-barely-any-drive-in-movie-theaters-left-unless-you-live-in-south-dakota/|title=There are barely any drive-in movie theaters left in the US|last=Epstein|first=Adam|date=|website=QZ.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> \n\nIn fall 2014, retro-themed burger chain [[Johnny Rockets]] announced that it would team up with USA Drive-Ins to open 200 drive-ins by 2018 serving Johnny Rocket's food at the concession stands,<ref>{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Vanessa | date=October 1, 2014 | title=At Johnny Rockets, the Future of Retro is Drive In Movies |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-01/at-johnny-rockets-the-future-of-retro-is-drive-in-movies  |magazine=[[Business Week]] | access-date=}}</ref> but the plan never came to fruition as did a proposed \"Project Drive-In\" scheme by Honda, which would have donated digital projectors. By 2018, less than 300 drive-in theaters were reported to operate worldwide, with only a handful outside North America.\n\nThe ongoing conversion of film distribution from celluloid to digital is also putting additional pressure on drive-in theaters.  Most small drive-ins lack the finances (beginning at $70,000 per screen) needed to convert to digital projection.<ref name=\"LJN\" />  The low volume of ticket sales from the lack of multiple showings also makes it hard for many drive-ins to justify the cost of installing digital projection. Conversion of the projection booth to digital is more complex for drive-in theaters. The projector needs a more powerful bulb due to an increased screen size and light pollution. In addition, digital projection equipment may require an Internet connection, and the booth must be retrofitted with special glass, more vents and stronger air conditioning as well as heat in northern climates.<ref name=\"LJN\" />\n\nWith installation of [[Jumbotron]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Linton Drive-In To Be Resurrected And Open By August [2012]|url=http://www.wbiw.com/local/archive/2012/07/old-linton-drivein-to-be-resur.php|publisher=WBIW|access-date=2013-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905101740/http://www.wbiw.com/local/archive/2012/07/old-linton-drivein-to-be-resur.php|archive-date=2015-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> or similar digital display equipment in drive-in theatres, restrictions of the projector booth can be avoided; that is, no projector is needed.\n\nThe move to digital conversion took its toll on the industry. Just 305 drive-in theaters were still open as of October, 2019, many of which were smaller 'boutique' operations that never converted to digital projectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.northeast.aaa.com/daily/life/drive-in-movie-theaters-northeast/|title=Headlights, Camera, Action: Drive-In Movie Theaters in the Northeast|date=2019-11-28|website=Your AAA Network|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref>\n\nThe largest drive-in theater in the world, the [[Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop]] (opened 1963), doubles as the world's largest daily flea market.\n\n== Drive-in theaters around the world ==\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe drive-in theater also became popular in Australia during the 1950s and 60s.

As these drive-ins were based on the American trend, they would often serve American-style food at snack bars. It is believed that at the height of their popularity in the mid-1960s, there were around 330 drive-in theaters in Australia.

Some drive-ins have small [[playgrounds]] for children and a few picnic tables or benches.\n\nThe screen can be as simple as a wall that is painted white, or it can be a steel [[truss|truss structure]] with a complex finish. Originally, the movie's [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound]] was provided by [[Loudspeaker|speakers]] on the screen and later by individual speakers hung from the window of each car, which were attached by wire. These systems were superseded by the more economical and easier to maintain method of [[radio broadcasting|broadcasting]] the soundtrack at a low output power on [[AM broadcasting|AM]] or [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] to be picked up by a car radio. This also allows the soundtrack to be picked up in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] by the audience on an in-car stereo system which is typically higher quality and fidelity than the simple speakers used in the old systems.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early drive-ins (before WWII) ===\nA partial drive-in theater \u2013 Theatre de Guadalupe \u2013 was opened in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], on April 23, 1915:\n<blockquote>Seven hundred people may be comfortably seated in the auditorium.

More couples were reunited and having children, resulting in the [[Baby boom|Baby Boom]], and more cars were being purchased following the end of wartime fuel rationing. By 1951, the number of drive-in movie theaters in the United States had increased from its 1947 total of 155 to 4,151.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=|title=DRIVE-IN THEATRES, TECHNOLOGY, AND CULTURAL CHA|last=Fox|first=Mark A.|date=June 1, 2018|work=Gale Academic Onefile}}</ref>\n\nThe drive-in's peak popularity came in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly in rural areas, with over 4,000 drive-ins spread across the United States in 1958.<ref name=\"LJN\" /> They were a cheaper alternative to in-door cinema theaters because not only did they save the gas of driving out to the city and then back home, but the cost of building and maintaining a drive-in theater was cheaper than that of an in-door theater, resulting in lower overall cost of attendance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Among its advantages was the fact that older adults with children could take care of their infant while watching a movie, while youth found drive-ins ideal for a first date. Unlike indoor cinema theaters, there was an air of informality which was appealing to people of all ages, but specifically to families. The drive-in\u2019s success was rooted in its reputation of being a family-friendly place. Parents were able to bring their children to the theater, often in pajamas, without having to worry about bothering other movie-goers, and were also able to spend time together without paying the expenses of babysitters. Drive-ins catered to their known audience, offering luxuries such as bottle warmers and diaper vending machines, and later miniature golf courses, swimming pools, and even motels on the land with windows facing the screens so that viewers could watch the films from their beds.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the 1950s, the greater privacy afforded to patrons gave drive-ins a reputation as immoral, and they were labeled \"passion pits\" in the media. The 1978 movie ''Grease'' portrays the local drive-in as a preferred spot for trysts.\n\nAt their height, some drive-ins used attention-grabbing gimmicks to boost attendance. They ranged from drawings for prizes and free admission, small airplane runways,  helicopter or [[hot air balloon]] rides,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://driveinadventures.wordpress.com/tag/farmingdale-drive-in/|title=farmingdale drive-in - Drive-In Theater Adventures|author=|date=|website=DriveInAdventures.Wordpress.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> unusual attractions such as a small petting zoo or cage of monkeys, personal appearances by actors to open their movies, or musical groups to play before the show. Some drive-ins held Sunday religious services, or charged a flat price per car on slow nights like Wednesdays or Sundays. On \"buck\" nights during the 1950s and 1960s, the admission price was one dollar per car.\n\nAs revenue was more limited than regular theaters since showings could only begin at twilight, there were abortive attempts to create suitable conditions for daylight viewing such as large tent structures, but nothing viable was developed.\n\n[[File:SnackBarAd.jpg|thumb|right|A snack bar ad shown at a drive-in]]\nOne of the largest drive-in theaters was the Johnny All-Weather Drive-In in [[Copiague, New York]]. Covering over 29 acres, it could park 2,500 vehicles.

Additionally, the [[1970s energy crisis]] led to the widespread adoption of [[daylight saving time]] (which caused drive-in movies to start an hour later) and lower use of automobiles, making it increasingly difficult for drive-ins to remain profitable.\n\nWhile some drive-ins had been showing various [[exploitation film]]s since the 1950s, by the 1970s several venues switched from showing family-friendly fare to R-rated and X-rated films as a way to offset declining patronage and revenue, while other venues that still catered to families, began to show R-rated or pornographic movies in late night time slots to bring in extra income.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  This allowed censored materials to be viewed by a wider audience, including those for whom viewing was still illegal in some states, and it was also reliant upon varying local ordinances controlling such material. It also required a relatively remote location away from the heavier populated areas of towns and cities.\n\nThe [[Stagflation|runaway inflation]] and real estate interest rate hikes in the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|late 1970s and early 1980s]], made the large land tracts used by drive-ins increasingly expensive, and thus far too valuable for continued use as drive-ins. Many Drive-ins operated solely on weekends, while some were open only during the summer months; they were also subject to the whim of nature, as adverse weather often resulted in poor attendance or cancellations. By the late 1980s, the total number of drive-ins still operating in both the US and Canada fell to less than two hundred.\n\nMany former drive-in movie sites remain, with several re-purposed as storage or [[flea market]] sites, often after residential housing or other higher value uses came to rural or sparsely populated areas where the drive-ins were located. Former drive-in properties in Michigan have become industrial parks, shopping centers, indoor theaters, and even churches (as with the Former Woodland Drive-In in Grand Rapids, MI). In Philadelphia, the South City Drive In became the location of the original Spectrum in the late 1960s, with a small portion of its old property line extending into what would become the (now-demolished) Veterans Stadium complex. (Today that small portion, combined with the original Spectrum location, is part of [[Xfinity Live! Philadelphia]]). Another example of a drive in-turned-flea market is Spotlight 88 in [[North Sewickley Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania]], which ended business as a drive-in after an F3 tornado destroyed much of the property on May 31, 1985. As a joke after the tornado hit, the owners put up in the \"now-showing\" sign ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. It was most likely copied from a [[Taylor, Michigan]] Drive in called Ecorse Drive-In. On July 16, 1980, a freak [[derecho]] storm with 150&nbsp;mph straight line winds <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dtx/stories/1980derecho.php|title=NWS Detroit/Pontiac -- July 16th, 1980, Derecho|work=noaa.gov}}</ref> swept the Drive-In away leaving only the \"now-showing\" sign with the letters \"Now Playing Gone with the Wind\". The screen was rebuilt, but business never recovered; by 1989, it was sold and now is the site of a [[Kroger]] grocery store.\n\n=== Revival and new drive-in formats (late 1990s-2000s) ===\n[[File:SuperiorDriveIn.JPG|thumb|left|A newly built drive-in screen near [[Superior, Iowa]], 2009]]\n[[Image:Stars and Stripes Drive-In, Lubbock, TX IMG 4752.JPG|thumb|right|Stars & Stripes Drive-in at 5101 Highway 84 West in [[Lubbock, Texas]], 2010]]\nBeginning in the late 1970s, and extending through the mid-1990s, those drive-ins still operating acquired a quasi-novelty status, catering to the wave of \"boomer [[nostalgia]]\" and loyal patrons. This \"retro\" appeal eventually led to a revival of sorts by the end of the 1990s.\n\nThis resurgence of the drive-in industry led to the inception of the \"do-it-yourself\" drive-in beginning in 2001, which utilized contemporary tools such as LCD projectors and micro-radio transmitters. The first was the Liberation Drive-In in [[Oakland, California]], which sought to reclaim under-utilized urban spaces such as vacant parking lots in the downtown area. The following years have seen the rise of the \"guerrilla drive-in\" movement, in which groups of dedicated individuals orchestrate similar outdoor film and video screenings. Showings are often organized online, and participants meet at specified locations to watch films projected on bridge pillars or warehouses. The content featured at these screenings has frequently been independent or experimental films, cult movies, or otherwise alternative programming. Aside from Oakland's Liberation, the best-known \"guerrilla\" drive-ins include the Santa Cruz Guerilla Drive-In in [[Santa Cruz, California]], North Bay Mobile Drive-In in [[Novato, California]], [[Mobmov|MobMov]] in [[San Francisco, California]] and [[Hollywood]], and more recently the Guerilla Drive-In Victoria in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. \n\nA similar, more recent concept is that of the \"boutique\" drive-in, which caters to a smaller audience, generally 30 to 50 vehicles (with some also offering seats in front of the screen), while food trucks are often used as concession stands. Unlike the \"guerrilla\" format however, this type of drive-in also generally presents mainstream fare, both current releases and popular classics. A key feature of this format is the focus on the \"vintage\" aesthetics of the drive-in. \n\nFaced with the closure of Hull's Drive In in [[Lexington, Virginia]], in 1999, the non-profit group Hull's Angels formed to raise funds, buy the property and operate the theater as a non-profit venture specializing in family-friendly films. Hull's continues to be the nation's only non-profit drive-in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/56467701.html?dids=56467701:56467701&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current|title=The Best Picture Show; Drive-In Movie Fans Band Together To Keep a Screen From Going Dark|last=Philp|first=Rowan|date=17 July 2000|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy 2006, there were around 500 drive-in theaters open in the United States, counting both regularly-operating venues (around 400) and those that held showings sporadically, usually during summertime, the highest number since the mid-1970s. The industry also saw a rebound in Canada and Australia during the early 2000s.\n\nDrive-in theaters began seeing a slight resurgence in early 2020 amid \"social distancing\" rules mandated to keep people safe from the worldwide 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. <ref>{{cite web |language=en |author=Claire Voon |title=Social Distancing Is Bringing Drive-In Theaters Back to Life |date=10 April 2020 |website=Atlas Obscura |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/drive-in-theaters-adapt-to-coronavirus?utm_source=Atlas+Obscura+Daily+Newsletter&utm_campaign=06138930ed-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_14&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f36db9c480-06138930ed-71142717&mc_cid=06138930ed&mc_eid=da5ec35174}}</ref>\n\n=== Present and digital conversion (late 2000s onwards) ===\nBeginning in the second half of the 2000s, the drive-in saw another decline because of the oil crisis and a worsening economy. Reduced use of automobiles and more people moving out of suburban and rural areas during the 2010s have also put the future of the drive-in at risk, with numbers again on the decline. By 2013, drive-ins comprised only 1.5% of total movie screens in the United States, with 389 theaters in operation nationwide mostly located in the South and the West Coast (at the industry's height, about 25% of the nation's movie screens were at drive-ins).<ref name=\"LJN\" /> A figure of 348 operating drive-ins was published for the United States in March 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2013/06/drive-in-theaters-in-america|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000049/http://www.theawl.com/2013/06/drive-in-theaters-in-america|archivedate=2013-12-04|accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/235155/there-are-barely-any-drive-in-movie-theaters-left-unless-you-live-in-south-dakota/|title=There are barely any drive-in movie theaters left in the US|last=Epstein|first=Adam|date=|website=QZ.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> \n\nIn fall 2014, retro-themed burger chain [[Johnny Rockets]] announced that it would team up with USA Drive-Ins to open 200 drive-ins by 2018 serving Johnny Rocket's food at the concession stands,<ref>{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Vanessa | date=October 1, 2014 | title=At Johnny Rockets, the Future of Retro is Drive In Movies |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-01/at-johnny-rockets-the-future-of-retro-is-drive-in-movies  |magazine=[[Business Week]] | access-date=}}</ref> but the plan never came to fruition as did a proposed \"Project Drive-In\" scheme by Honda, which would have donated digital projectors. By 2018, less than 300 drive-in theaters were reported to operate worldwide, with only a handful outside North America.\n\nThe ongoing conversion of film distribution from celluloid to digital is also putting additional pressure on drive-in theaters.  Most small drive-ins lack the finances (beginning at $70,000 per screen) needed to convert to digital projection.<ref name=\"LJN\" />  The low volume of ticket sales from the lack of multiple showings also makes it hard for many drive-ins to justify the cost of installing digital projection. Conversion of the projection booth to digital is more complex for drive-in theaters. The projector needs a more powerful bulb due to an increased screen size and light pollution. In addition, digital projection equipment may require an Internet connection, and the booth must be retrofitted with special glass, more vents and stronger air conditioning as well as heat in northern climates.<ref name=\"LJN\" />\n\nWith installation of [[Jumbotron]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Linton Drive-In To Be Resurrected And Open By August [2012]|url=http://www.wbiw.com/local/archive/2012/07/old-linton-drivein-to-be-resur.php|publisher=WBIW|access-date=2013-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905101740/http://www.wbiw.com/local/archive/2012/07/old-linton-drivein-to-be-resur.php|archive-date=2015-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> or similar digital display equipment in drive-in theatres, restrictions of the projector booth can be avoided; that is, no projector is needed.\n\nThe move to digital conversion took its toll on the industry. Just 305 drive-in theaters were still open as of October, 2019, many of which were smaller 'boutique' operations that never converted to digital projectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.northeast.aaa.com/daily/life/drive-in-movie-theaters-northeast/|title=Headlights, Camera, Action: Drive-In Movie Theaters in the Northeast|date=2019-11-28|website=Your AAA Network|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref>\n\nThe largest drive-in theater in the world, the [[Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop]] (opened 1963), doubles as the world's largest daily flea market.\n\n== Drive-in theaters around the world ==\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe drive-in theater also became popular in Australia during the 1950s and 60s. In Australia, the number of drive-in's steadily increased after the first theater was opened. The Hoyts Skyline was the first drive in<!--not a mistake--> in Australia, opening in Melbourne in 1954. The first show that played at the Skyline was ''On the Riviera.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maas.museum/inside-the-collection/2016/02/09/remembering-australias-drive-ins/|title=Remembering Australia's Drive-ins|website=Inside the Collection|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref> The drive-in was extremely successful, and four more opened within the year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=Ben|title=The Comfort Lies in All the Things You Can Do': The Australian Drive-in--Cinema of Distraction.|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|volume=33|issue=1|pages=153\u2013164|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1999.3301_153.x|year=1999}}</ref> They opened all across Australia, in Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales. As these drive-ins were based on the American trend, they would often serve American-style food at snack bars. It is believed that at the height of their popularity in the mid-1960s, there were around 330 drive-in theaters in Australia. As of 2016, there were only a dozen drive in theaters remaining in Australia. \n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies|Film}}\n* [[List of drive-in theaters]]\n* [[Outdoor cinema]]\n* [[Inflatable movie screen]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| title = Drive-in | date = 2001 | encyclopedia = The Film Encyclopedia | edition = 4th | editor = Ephraim Katz | publisher= HarperCollins | location = New York}}\n* {{cite book| title = The American Drive-In Movie Theater | first = Don | last = Sanders | first2 = Susan | last2 = Sanders | date = October 2003 | publisher= Motorbooks International | isbn = 0-7603-1707-0}}\n* {{cite book| title = Cinema Under the Stars: America's Love Affair With the Drive-In Movie Theater | first = Elizabeth | last = McKeon | first2 = Linda | last2 =Everett | first3 = Liz | last3 =McKeon | date = December 1998 | publisher= Cumberland House | isbn = 1-58182-002-X}}\n* {{cite book| title = Drive-in Movie Memories | last = Sanders | first = Don and | last2 = Sanders | first2 = Susan | publisher= Middleton: Carriage House | date = 2000}}\n* {{cite book| title = Drive-in Theaters: a History from Their Inception in 1933 | last = Segrave | first = Kerry | publisher= Jefferson: McFarland and Company, Inc. | date = 1992}}\n* {{cite web | title = The Drive-in Theater History Page | url= http://www.driveintheater.com/history | work = Drive in Theater | date = 2007-04-20}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Drive-in theaters}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2013/08/12/088631-honda-launches-project-drive-to-save-drive-ins-across-country.html | title = Honda Launches Project Drive-In to Save Drive-Ins Across the Country | accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date = 2013-08-12}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4332896.stm  | work = BBC  | title = Drive-in theatres refuse to fade away | accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date = 2005-10-13 | first = Matthew | last = Davis}}\n* {{cite magazine | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1223368,00.html  | magazine = Time Magazine | title = Movies that star the stars | accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date =2006-08-07 | first = Lisa | last = Mclaughlin }}\n* {{cite web | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/30/DDAIR9BH32.DTL&hw=mobmov&sn=001&sc=1000  | work = San Francisco Chronicle | title = MobMov creates a new guerrilla theater while reviving drive-in culture| accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date = 2007-07-30 | first = Karen | last = Solomon}}\n* {{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89813618 | title = For Drive-In Theaters, an Unexpected Revival | first = Nancy  | last = Mullane | work = [[All Things Considered]] | publisher = NPR | accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date = 2008-04-21}}\n* {{cite web | url = https://archive.org/details/DriveInMovieAds  | title = A freely downloadable collection of drive-in intermission advertisements}}\n* {{cite journal | url = http://southernspaces.org/2008/starlit-screens-preserving-place-and-public-drive-theaters | title = Starlit Screens: Preserving Place and Public at Drive-In Theaters | first = Robin  | last = Conner | first2 = Paul   | last2 = Johnson | journal = Southern Spaces  | accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date =  2008-10-10 | doi = 10.18737/M7B60Q }}\n* {{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/09/11/drivein.theater/index.html  | title = Will the endangered American drive-in fade to black? | work = CNN  | accessdate = 2009-09-14 | date = 2009-09-11 | first = David | last = Banks}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://www.driveintheatre-ownersassociation.org | title = United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association | accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date = }}\n* {{cite web | first = Richard | last = Kuipers | url =http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/drive-ins | title = Australian Drive-In theatres | quote =  their depiction in Australian films | work = Australian Screen | publisher = National Film and Sound Archive of Australia | accessdate = 2019-09-05 | date = }}\n* {{cite web | url = http://drive-ins.com/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190120012008/http://drive-ins.com/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-01-20 | work = Drive-ins.com | title = searchable archive of over 5000 drive-in movie theaters past and present | accessdate = 2019-01-20 | date = }}\n* {{cite web | url = https://sites.google.com/site/jeffreylitton/garden-state-drive-in-chronology  | title = Garden State Drive In Chronology | accessdate = 2019-09-05  | date = | first = Jeffrey | last = Litton}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://www.driveinmovie.com/mainmenu.htm  | work = DriveInMovie.com | title = lists all currently open drive-in theaters in the U.S., Canada and Australia.
