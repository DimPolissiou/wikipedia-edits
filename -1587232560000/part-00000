The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] television program \"Foreign Correspondent\" also claimed that as Chairman of the NPC, Harris spent more than A$231,000 on luxury items, holidays and a property in Melbourne. Harris maintained a luxury penthouse suite on the 51st floor of Nauru House in [[Melbourne]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1208385.htm Four Corners: \"Island Raiders\"], 27 September 2004</ref>\n\n==Presidential terms of office==\n\nHarris first became President on 27 April 1999 and remained in that post until 20 April 2000 when he was replaced by [[Bernard Dowiyogo]], who retained that office until Harris resumed the presidency on 29 March 2001 following a vote of no-confidence in Dowiyogo. The situation assumed farcical proportions in January 2003, when both men held the office twice. Dowiyogo eventually retained the presidency, although his death in March 2003 prompted another round of uncertainty. Harris was finally reelected President on 15 August 2003.\n\nHarris was quoted as saying he was re-elected by the nation's parliament because the MPs \"didn't see the light\" with his predecessor, [[Ludwig Scotty]]. Harris broke the Nauruan government's deadlock when he was able to pass legislation through parliament in 2003.\n\nHis government was responsible for the housing of Australian asylum seekers on the island and also Nauru's admission to the [[United Nations]] and full membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Mr. Harris was criticized by the Nauruan opposition party ([[Naoero Amo]]) and the international community for corruption and violations of [[human rights]].\n\nHarris received monthly kidney dialysis treatment for his [[diabetes]] in [[Melbourne]]. His health was a major concern for at least the last 5 years of his life because diabetes ended the life of one of his political opponents, [[Bernard Dowiyogo]], at the age of 57 in early 2003. In December 2003, Harris collapsed in Nauru's parliament building and was revived by Dr. [[Kieren Keke]].\n\nOn 22 June 2004, due to a political defection, he was ousted as President, and Ludwig Scotty succeeded him.\n\n==Post-Presidency and controversies==\n\nIn parliamentary elections later in 2004, Scotty's supporters won a majority of the seats and Harris made no further attempts to be reelected president. In the [[2007 Nauruan parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] held on 25 August 2007, Harris was the only opposition member of parliament to be re-elected; Scotty's supporters won an even larger victory and it was believed that Harris might have no political supporters in Parliament.<ref>Sean Dorney, [http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/26/2015462.htm?section=Justin \"Scotty Govt wins landslide Nauru election\"], abc.net.au, 26 August 2007.</ref>\n\nAfter Nauru's main police station was burned on 7 March 2008 by protesters in Harris' Aiwo constituency who were upset by phosphate dust, the government accused Harris of instigating the protesters.<ref name=\"RNZI_38477\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=38477 |title=Nauru Government says that former President behind unrest |date=10 March 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarris's periods as President of Nauru were sometimes owing to his alliance with the influential [[Kinza Clodumar]], himself a former President, but also exercising considerable negotiating weight in the [[Parliament of Nauru]].\n\n==April 2008 election and loss of parliamentary seat==\n\nIn the [[2008 Nauruan parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] held on 26 April 2008, Harris stood again but lost his seat; supporters of President [[Marcus Stephen]] won a majority.<ref name=\"RNZI_39395\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=39395 |title=Provisional results in Nauru indicate government returned with increased majority |date=27 April 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> After 31 years in Parliament, this was the first time he lost his seat.<ref name=Death/>\n\n==Death==\nHarris suffered a [[heart attack]] on 4 July 2008 and died as a result on the morning of 5 July.

However, he won the resultant by-election with a convincing majority.<ref name=PIM3>[https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-334967780/view?partId=nla.obj-335099517#page/n19/mode/1up A bouncer!] ''Pacific Islands Monthly'', August 1977, p20</ref> Harris was elected Deputy Speaker of the Parliament in 1978.

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] television program \"Foreign Correspondent\" also claimed that as Chairman of the NPC, Harris spent more than A$231,000 on luxury items, holidays and a property in Melbourne. Harris maintained a luxury penthouse suite on the 51st floor of Nauru House in [[Melbourne]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1208385.htm Four Corners: \"Island Raiders\"], 27 September 2004</ref>\n\n==Presidential terms of office==\n\nHarris first became President on 27 April 1999 and remained in that post until 20 April 2000 when he was replaced by [[Bernard Dowiyogo]], who retained that office until Harris resumed the presidency on 29 March 2001 following a vote of no-confidence in Dowiyogo. The situation assumed farcical proportions in January 2003, when both men held the office twice. Dowiyogo eventually retained the presidency, although his death in March 2003 prompted another round of uncertainty. Harris was finally reelected President on 15 August 2003.\n\nHarris was quoted as saying he was re-elected by the nation's parliament because the MPs \"didn't see the light\" with his predecessor, [[Ludwig Scotty]]. Harris broke the Nauruan government's deadlock when he was able to pass legislation through parliament in 2003.\n\nHis government was responsible for the housing of Australian asylum seekers on the island and also Nauru's admission to the [[United Nations]] and full membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Mr. Harris was criticized by the Nauruan opposition party ([[Naoero Amo]]) and the international community for corruption and violations of [[human rights]].\n\nHarris received monthly kidney dialysis treatment for his [[diabetes]] in [[Melbourne]]. His health was a major concern for at least the last 5 years of his life because diabetes ended the life of one of his political opponents, [[Bernard Dowiyogo]], at the age of 57 in early 2003. In December 2003, Harris collapsed in Nauru's parliament building and was revived by Dr. [[Kieren Keke]].\n\nOn 22 June 2004, due to a political defection, he was ousted as President, and Ludwig Scotty succeeded him.\n\n==Post-Presidency and controversies==\n\nIn parliamentary elections later in 2004, Scotty's supporters won a majority of the seats and Harris made no further attempts to be reelected president. In the [[2007 Nauruan parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] held on 25 August 2007, Harris was the only opposition member of parliament to be re-elected; Scotty's supporters won an even larger victory and it was believed that Harris might have no political supporters in Parliament.<ref>Sean Dorney, [http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/26/2015462.htm?section=Justin \"Scotty Govt wins landslide Nauru election\"], abc.net.au, 26 August 2007.</ref>\n\nAfter Nauru's main police station was burned on 7 March 2008 by protesters in Harris' Aiwo constituency who were upset by phosphate dust, the government accused Harris of instigating the protesters.<ref name=\"RNZI_38477\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=38477 |title=Nauru Government says that former President behind unrest |date=10 March 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarris's periods as President of Nauru were sometimes owing to his alliance with the influential [[Kinza Clodumar]], himself a former President, but also exercising considerable negotiating weight in the [[Parliament of Nauru]].\n\n==April 2008 election and loss of parliamentary seat==\n\nIn the [[2008 Nauruan parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] held on 26 April 2008, Harris stood again but lost his seat; supporters of President [[Marcus Stephen]] won a majority.<ref name=\"RNZI_39395\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=39395 |title=Provisional results in Nauru indicate government returned with increased majority |date=27 April 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> After 31 years in Parliament, this was the first time he lost his seat.<ref name=Death/>\n\n==Death==\nHarris suffered a [[heart attack]] on 4 July 2008 and died as a result on the morning of 5 July.

The son of Nauruan parliamentarian [[Lawrence Stephen]], Stephen was educated at [[St Bede's College (Mentone)|St Bedes College]] and [[RMIT University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Initially playing [[Australian rules football]], he opted to pursue the sport of [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], in which he represented Nauru at the [[Summer Olympics]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] between 1990 and 2002, winning seven Commonwealth gold medals.\n\nAfter his retirement from weightlifting, Stephen worked at the Bank of Nauru before being elected to parliament at the [[2003 Nauruan parliamentary election|2003 elections]]. Having occupied various portfolios in the Nauruan government under President [[Ren\u00e9 Harris]], Stephen was sworn in as president after moving a no confidence motion against his predecessor, [[Ludwig Scotty]]. His term as president was marked by allegations of corruption and accusations of a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], as well as the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] and a suspension from parliament by the Nauruan Supreme Court in 2008. Two separate elections were called in April and June 2010 after accusations of bribery of government members of parliament, with another state of emergency declared in the period between elections. Stephen resigned from the presidency in November 2011 after further allegations of corruption were raised by opposition factions, and was succeeded by [[Freddie Pitcher]], but was re-appointed to the Cabinet in June 2012 by Pitcher's successor as president, [[Sprent Dabwido]].

Stephen also appointed [[Frederick Pitcher]] as Finance Minister, and his Administration inherited the austerity measures associated with the outgoing Scotty Administration.\n\nRegarding constitutional affairs, however, one of the major issues facing the new Stephen Administration was the process of constitutional revision consultations, started by former President [[Ludwig Scotty]]. These centred mainly on proposals to elect the President of Nauru by direct, popular election, rather than indirectly by the [[Parliament of Nauru]], and which would thus restrict somewhat the frequent recourse to the [[vote of no confidence]], which has been a feature of Nauru's political life for many years. Since Marcus Stephen came to office in circumstances involving the overturning of the previous government's Parliamentary majority in just such a manner, it remained to be seen what the Stephen Administration's formal position and practice on this issue would be.\n\nAt a personal level, the appointment of Marcus Stephen as President of Nauru at the age of 38, together with a youthful ministerial team, marked somewhat of a generational shift from some of the political figures who have dominated Nauruan politics in recent years; e.g., he was nearly 40 years younger than [[Derog Gioura]], who served as President of Nauru in 2003, having entered the Parliament of Nauru in 1968, before the birth of Stephen. However, the appointment of youthful heads of state in the Republic of Nauru is by no means unknown; [[Bernard Dowiyogo]] assumed the office of President of Nauru at the even younger age of 30 in 1976. It may be added that since Stephen's Presidency was to last a few years, his actual experience of office was to grow to be much longer than that of several previous holders of the same office.\n\n====2008====\n\n====Political turmoil====\n\nIn March 2008 moves in the Parliament of Nauru to unseat the Administration of Marcus Stephen by means of a [[vote of no confidence]] were thwarted by the resignation of the Speaker, [[Riddell Akua]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-19-07.htm |accessdate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225551/http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-19-07.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 |title=Home Page &#124; Pacific Islands Report }}</ref> Unrest on the island which involved threats to export trade and the torching of a police station were events which occurred shortly prior to Parliamentary moves to remove President Stephen and his Administration from office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-14-03.htm |accessdate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191402/http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-14-03.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 |title=Home Page &#124; Pacific Islands Report }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the first three months of Stephen's Presidency there was thus widespread unrest in the country.\n\n=====Stephen and Speaker of Parliament accusations=====\n\nOn 22 March, the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, [[David Adeang]], called a Parliamentary session, allegedly without informing government ministers, who therefore did not attend. Opposition MPs, Adeang included, constituted a majority of legislators present, and passed a ruling outlawing dual [[Nauruan nationality law|citizenship]] for Members of Parliament. The ruling, if applied, would have affected senior Cabinet ministers Dr. [[Kieren Keke]] and [[Frederick Pitcher]]. Had they been compelled to resign from Parliament, the Opposition would have controlled a majority of seats in Parliament. The government rejected the legitimacy of the ruling, stating that it was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] because of the lack of parliamentary [[quorum]].<ref name=\"RNZI_38778\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=38778 |title=Nauru government rejects citizenship ruling |date=26 March 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> President Marcus Stephen accused Adeang and the Opposition of passing the ruling \"after dark on Easter Saturday\", \"under candelight\".<ref name=\"RNZI_38761\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=38761 |title=Nauru President frustrated over parliament developments |date=25 March 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref> On 31 March, Adeang claimed that the Stephen Administration had mounted a coup d'\u00e9tat because the loyalty of the police to the rule of Parliamentary law was no longer present, after the police refused to eject Keke and Pitcher from the chamber of the Parliament.\n\n=====Coup allegations=====\n\nThe Stephen Administration, in response, denied the claim of a coup d'\u00e9tat, stating that they were awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on the issue.<ref name=\"RNZI_38870\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=38870 |title=Nauru Government says Speaker lying over quorum claim |date=31 March 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe crisis continued into early April 2008, with Adeang stating that he would consider the Supreme Court's ruling as \"just an opinion\", and Keke responding that the Supreme Court, not the Speaker, had the jurisdiction to determine a member of Parliament's eligibility.<ref name=\"RNZI_38970\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=38970 |title=Nauru MP says Speaker continues to make mockery of Parliament |date=4 April 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=====Supreme Court ruling=====\n\nA ruling by the Supreme Court in April 2008 that the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru had erred in seeking to exclude from Parliament two key ministers, who also made up the Government's majority, was seen to have enhanced the constitutionality of the Stephen Administration's make up.<ref name=\"RNZI_39001\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=39001, |title=Nauru Government claims strong backing in ruling by Chief Justice |date=7 April 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nRelations between the Stephen Administration and Adeang remained under severe strain, however, and the Administration's ministers continued to exercise executive powers without the support of an absolute parliamentary majority.\n\n=====Stephen suspended from Parliament=====\n\nBy 10 April, the tenuous connection between the rule of the Stephen Administration and the Parliament of Nauru was further diminished.

The government refused the offer, Stephen later explaining: \"It would have been disastrous for Nauru. It we had defaulted on one payment, we would have lost the phosphate industry.

Stephen, and Justice Minister [[Mathew Batsiua]], asked for an Australian investigation into money allegedly paid by Gatex to members of the opposition, which they suggested might constitute bribes. Nauru's Director of Public Prosecutions stated there had been \"attempts to bring about a change of government by bribery of members of parliament\", and Stephen released documents \"showing opposition members on salaries of less than $150 a week spending significant sums of cash on boats, cars, voters and trips\". The allegations were that Gatex had bribed opposition members, both through personal donations and by financing their election campaigns, in the hopes that the opposition would win power and sign the deal enabling the loan which the Stephen administration had rejected. The allegation was also that Getax had bribed non-Cabinet government MPs in an attempt to undermine Stephen's parliamentary majority and bring down his government, and that these actions had resulted in the early 2010 parliamentary deadlock, the 2010 elections and the accompanying political crisis. Nauru's Commissioner of Police \"lacked the resources to mount an investigation that would span Singapore, Australia and Nauru\"; hence Nauru's request to Australia. In response to the request, the [[Australian Federal Police]] began an investigation into the allegation that Getax had bribed Nauruan opposition MPs.<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\"/><ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/federal-police-to-probe-claims-nauru-bribery-claims-against-gold-coast-company/story-e6frg6nf-1225943446106 \"Federal Police to probe claims Nauru bribery claims against Gold Coast company\"], ''The Australian'', 26 October 2010</ref>\n\nA few days after that, [[Ludwig Scotty]] accepted the position of Speaker in Parliament, enabling a presidential election to take place.

Initially playing [[Australian rules football]], he opted to pursue the sport of [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], in which he represented Nauru at the [[Summer Olympics]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] between 1990 and 2002, winning seven Commonwealth gold medals.\n\nAfter his retirement from weightlifting, Stephen worked at the Bank of Nauru before being elected to parliament at the [[2003 Nauruan parliamentary election|2003 elections]]. Having occupied various portfolios in the Nauruan government under President [[Ren\u00e9 Harris]], Stephen was sworn in as president after moving a no confidence motion against his predecessor, [[Ludwig Scotty]]. His term as president was marked by allegations of corruption and accusations of a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], as well as the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] and a suspension from parliament by the Nauruan Supreme Court in 2008. Two separate elections were called in April and June 2010 after accusations of bribery of government members of parliament, with another state of emergency declared in the period between elections. Stephen resigned from the presidency in November 2011 after further allegations of corruption were raised by opposition factions, and was succeeded by [[Freddie Pitcher]], but was re-appointed to the Cabinet in June 2012 by Pitcher's successor as president, [[Sprent Dabwido]].

Previously, each [[President of Nauru]] had concurrently acted as his own Foreign Affairs Minister, although this was customary rather than a constitutional requirement. Stephen also appointed [[Frederick Pitcher]] as Finance Minister, and his Administration inherited the austerity measures associated with the outgoing Scotty Administration.\n\nRegarding constitutional affairs, however, one of the major issues facing the new Stephen Administration was the process of constitutional revision consultations, started by former President [[Ludwig Scotty]]. These centred mainly on proposals to elect the President of Nauru by direct, popular election, rather than indirectly by the [[Parliament of Nauru]], and which would thus restrict somewhat the frequent recourse to the [[vote of no confidence]], which has been a feature of Nauru's political life for many years. Since Marcus Stephen came to office in circumstances involving the overturning of the previous government's Parliamentary majority in just such a manner, it remained to be seen what the Stephen Administration's formal position and practice on this issue would be.\n\nAt a personal level, the appointment of Marcus Stephen as President of Nauru at the age of 38, together with a youthful ministerial team, marked somewhat of a generational shift from some of the political figures who have dominated Nauruan politics in recent years; e.g., he was nearly 40 years younger than [[Derog Gioura]], who served as President of Nauru in 2003, having entered the Parliament of Nauru in 1968, before the birth of Stephen. However, the appointment of youthful heads of state in the Republic of Nauru is by no means unknown; [[Bernard Dowiyogo]] assumed the office of President of Nauru at the even younger age of 30 in 1976. It may be added that since Stephen's Presidency was to last a few years, his actual experience of office was to grow to be much longer than that of several previous holders of the same office.\n\n====2008====\n\n====Political turmoil====\n\nIn March 2008 moves in the Parliament of Nauru to unseat the Administration of Marcus Stephen by means of a [[vote of no confidence]] were thwarted by the resignation of the Speaker, [[Riddell Akua]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-19-07.htm |accessdate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225551/http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-19-07.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 |title=Home Page &#124; Pacific Islands Report }}</ref> Unrest on the island which involved threats to export trade and the torching of a police station were events which occurred shortly prior to Parliamentary moves to remove President Stephen and his Administration from office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-14-03.htm |accessdate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191402/http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/March/03-14-03.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 |title=Home Page &#124; Pacific Islands Report }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the first three months of Stephen's Presidency there was thus widespread unrest in the country.\n\n=====Stephen and Speaker of Parliament accusations=====\n\nOn 22 March, the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, [[David Adeang]], called a Parliamentary session, allegedly without informing government ministers, who therefore did not attend. Opposition MPs, Adeang included, constituted a majority of legislators present, and passed a ruling outlawing dual [[Nauruan nationality law|citizenship]] for Members of Parliament. The ruling, if applied, would have affected senior Cabinet ministers Dr. [[Kieren Keke]] and [[Frederick Pitcher]]. Had they been compelled to resign from Parliament, the Opposition would have controlled a majority of seats in Parliament.

Stephen, and Justice Minister [[Mathew Batsiua]], asked for an Australian investigation into money allegedly paid by Gatex to members of the opposition, which they suggested might constitute bribes. Nauru's Director of Public Prosecutions stated there had been \"attempts to bring about a change of government by bribery of members of parliament\", and Stephen released documents \"showing opposition members on salaries of less than $150 a week spending significant sums of cash on boats, cars, voters and trips\". The allegations were that Gatex had bribed opposition members, both through personal donations and by financing their election campaigns, in the hopes that the opposition would win power and sign the deal enabling the loan which the Stephen administration had rejected. The allegation was also that Getax had bribed non-Cabinet government MPs in an attempt to undermine Stephen's parliamentary majority and bring down his government, and that these actions had resulted in the early 2010 parliamentary deadlock, the 2010 elections and the accompanying political crisis. Nauru's Commissioner of Police \"lacked the resources to mount an investigation that would span Singapore, Australia and Nauru\"; hence Nauru's request to Australia.

There is an emphasis on fish, vegetables, and lentils served with the staple rice.\n\nMany Bengali food traditions draw from previously middle class activities, such as [[Adda (South Asian)|adda]], or the ''[[Annaprashana]]''.\n\nBengali cuisine is known for its varied use of flavours, as well as the spread of its confectioneries and desserts. It has the only traditionally developed [[full course dinner|multi-course]] tradition from the [[cuisine of the Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine]], with food served in [[course (food)|courses]] rather than all at once.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Influence of widows===\nIn Hindu patriarchal tradition, widows are not allowed to eat foods that would not be classified as \"bitter\", necessitating experiment and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2005/545/545%20rukmini%20bhaya%20nair1.htm|title=Are we what we eat?|last=Nair|first=Rukmini|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> While most Bengali [[caste]]s ate meat and fish, this was barred for widows. Widows also could not use \"heating\" foods such as [[shallot]] and [[garlic]], but [[ginger]] was allowed. This style found a core place in Bengali curries in general, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Expensive spices such as [[saffron]], [[cinnamon]] or [[clove]]s were used very sparingly -- if at all. Nuts, dry fruits, milk and milk products (such as [[cream]], [[ghee]] or [[curd]]) were similarly scarce.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|date=Winter 1995|title=What Bengali Widows Cannot Eat|url=http://www.granta.com/Magazine/52|url-status=dead|journal=Granta|issue=52|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220063949/http://www.granta.com/Magazine/52|archive-date=20 December 2011|access-date=28 November 2011}}</ref> These economic and social restrictions influenced Bengali widows to create a brand new set of meals that utilized only vegetables and cheap spices.\n\n===Partition of Bengal and India===\nThe large-scale displacement along religious lines as a result of the [[Partition of India|partition]] led to changes in meal-taking, as to adhere to religious restrictions. In Bangladesh, [[Mughlai cuisine|Mughlai food]] is common, and includes foods that are taboo in West Bengal, such as beef [[kebab]]. Additionally, more traditionally Islamic sweets such as [[Zarda (food)|zarda]] and firni-payesh are eaten. In rural Bangladesh, many people eat [[Nymphaeaceae|makna]] fried, popped, or raw. As a whole, Bangladesh's cuisine mainly remained traditional due to its geopolitical isolation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Food_Habits|title=Food Habits - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bengalcuisine.in/history|title=Historical Sketch {{!}} Bengal Cuisine|website=bengalcuisine.in|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn West Bengal, the only restriction is beef, which applies only to Hindus, but due to recent laws also affect Muslim communities.

Food taken during adda consists usually of mishti or [[Confectionery|sweetmeats]], tea, and coffee, although heartier meats such as fried fish may be brought out as well.\n\nThe adda first saw its rise during the colonial era, for [[Guild|guild members]] to meet and talk about a range of topics:<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/india/1122129/adda-a-brief-history-of-the-bengali-fine-art-of-discussion/|title=A brief history of Adda\u2014the Bengali fine art of discussion|last=Chakravarti|first=Sudeep|website=Quartz India|language=en|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref><blockquote>\"You could be discussing Charles and Camilla's marriage this moment, and the next moment you're swinging over to the latest cricket series between India and Pakistan, and then swing back to the recent controversy over [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]].\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Trachtenberg|first=Peter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/travel/tmagazine/the-chattering-masses.html|title=The Chattering Masses|date=2005-05-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> </blockquote>Being a hobby for artisans, women were largely secluded from adda, a sentiment that has begun to disappear with the democratization of adda and women occupying a larger space in social life. For this reason, adda was seen as a refuge \"...from the home, a neutral rendezvous away from both the perceived drudgery of the workplace and domesticity\".<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nIn the post-colonial era, the adda has been fading due to the more rigid structure of work and exploitative perceptions of unnecessary laziness. This has inspired a sizeable movement of Bengalis who believe it integral to the idea of ''lyadh'', or doing nothing to relax and recharge.<ref name=\":8\" /> However, adda does still exist, being attended during vacation time or after work at clubs or coffee shops. The tradition even has an equivalent to the Greek [[symposium]], as students may meet for a study session over food or have a teacher teach in a more relaxed environment.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Gaonkar|first=Dilip Parameshwar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCghDtjik3IC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=Roughly+speaking,+it+is+the+practice+of+friends+getting+together+for+long,+informal+and+unrigorous+conversations&source=bl&ots=bpo9QZKXik&sig=ACfU3U03f_lKX73qYqnPfBmsq6-ZcIjX9g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdncaRg9nnAhW7kHIEHcjDDNEQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Roughly%20speaking,%20it%20is%20the%20practice%20of%20friends%20getting%20together%20for%20long,%20informal%20and%20unrigorous%20conversations&f=false|title=Alternative Modernities|date=2001|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8223-2714-1|location=|pages=123-126|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nBengali cuisine can be subdivided into four different types of dishes, ''charbya'' ({{Lang-bn|\u099a\u09be\u09b0\u09ac\u09cd\u09af}}), or food that is chewed, such as rice or fish; ''cho\u1e63ya'' ({{Lang-bn|\u099a\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09af}}), or food that is sucked, such as ambal and tak; ''lehya'' ({{Lang-bn|\u09b2\u09c7\u09b9\u09cd\u09af}}), or foods that are meant to be licked, like [[chutney]]; and ''peya'' ({{Lang-bn|\u09aa\u09c7\u09af\u09bc\u09c7}}), which includes drinks, mainly milk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahapedia.org/our-food-their-food-historical-overview-of-the-bengali-platter|title=Our Food Their Food: A Historical Overview of the Bengali Platter {{!}} Sahapedia|website=sahapedia.org|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Regional specialties ==\n\n===Specialties of Dhaka===\n{{Main|Bangladeshi cuisine|List of Bangladeshi dishes|List of Bangladeshi spices}}\nThe [[Nawab of Dhaka|Nawabs of Dhaka]] had brought Mughlai cuisine to Bengal, and with it, many Islamic elements that were wholly retained by Bangladesh's culinary community.

The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and ''masalchis'' (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth diminished, they became interspersed into the local population. These cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of spices (most notably ''[[Saffron|jafran]]'' and [[mace (spice)|mace]]), the extensive use of ''[[ghee]]'', and marinating meat with yoghurt and chilli.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalindia.net/indian-food/mughlai.html|title=All That You Ever Wanted To Know About Mughlai Cuisine!|website=culturalindia.net|language=en|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Food-Mutton-Chaanp.jpg|thumb|right|Mutton Chaanp]]In [[Bangladesh]], this food has become common fare for the population while in West Bengal, they have remained the food of professional chefs.

These collective western influences are seen in the foods created to satisfy the tastes of the western rulers. The result is a unique cuisine, local ingredients adapted to French and [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] cooking techniques\u2014characterised by creamy sauces, the restrained use of spices, and new techniques such as baking. English and Jewish bakers such as Flury's and Nahoum's dominated the confectionery industry which migrated from British tables to everyday Bengali ones, resulting in unique creations such as the ''p\u00ea\u0163is'' (savory turnovers, from the English \"pasty\"). Another enduring contribution to Bengali cuisine is ''pau ru\u0163i'', or Western-style bread. Raj-era cuisine lives on especially in the variety of finger foods popularised in the 'pucca' clubs of Kolkata, such as ''mutton chop'', ''kabiraji cutlet'' or ''fish orly''.\n\nThe British also influenced food in a somewhat different way. Many British families in India hired local cooks, and through them discovered local foods. The foods had to be toned down or modified to suit the tastes of the \"[[Sahib#Colonial and modern use|memsahibs]]\". The most distinct influence is seen in the desserts, many of which were created specifically to satisfy the British\u2014most notably the very popular sweet ''le\u0111ikeni'' named after the first Vicereine [[Lady Canning]]; it is a derivative of the ''pantua'' created for an event hosted by her.\n\n===Odia Influence===\nDuring the 19th century many Odia cooks migrated to Bengal to work in the households of affluent Bengali families. They were also hired to cook in marriages and other family ceremonies. Odia Brahmin cooks from [[Puri]] who worked in [[Jagannath Temple]], known as ''thakurs'' in [[Bengal]] were in great demand. Introduction of [[Odia people|Odia]] cooks into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] kitchens brought in subtle but significant changes to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] cuisine. Many of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] classic dishes were originally from Odisha but were refined in Bengali kitchens by Odia cooks. In fact some researchers say that dishes like ''[[Rasgulla|rasogola]]'' (Bengali ''rosogolla''), ''[[Kanika (food)|kanika]]'' (Bengali ''misti pulao'') and ''[[Mutton curry|mangsa kawsha]]'' (Bengali ''kosha mangsho'') were first introduced to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] kitchens by [[Odia language|Odia]] cooks although this is contested by other researchers.<ref>http://alexis.org.in/face-off-the-rasgulla-battle-between-west-bengal-and-odisha/</ref><ref>https://www.cntraveller.in/story/odisha-indias-underrated-food-destination/</ref> Even to this date most of the cooks in Bengali kitchens and hotels are Odia cooks.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/spotlight/odia-cooks-to-bring-back-forgotten-bengali-recipes/articleshow/63761843.cms</ref>\n\n===Chinese influence===\n[[File:Pork Roll - Sun Yat-sen Street - Kolkata 2013-03-03 5307.JPG|thumbnail|Chinese pork roll]]\n\nThe [[Chinese of Kolkata]] originally settled into a village called [[Achipur]] south of Kolkata in the late 18th century, later moving into the city and finally into its present home in [[Tangra, Calcutta|Tangra]] at the eastern edge of Kolkata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beautifulbengal.com/bengali-recipies.html|title=Bengali cuisine,Historical influences,Characteristics of Bengali cuisine,Cooking styles,Common Bengali Recipe Styles,Culinary Influences,Bengali meals,Mish\u0163i (sweets),Snacks|website=beautifulbengal.com|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref> The Chinese-origin people of Kolkata form a substantial and successful community with a distinct identity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Chapter 1|title=Shodhganga|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/61925/10/10_chapter%201.pdf|journal=Bit Stream}}</ref> With this identity came Chinese food, available at almost every street corner in Kolkata at present, due to the taste, quick cooking procedure, and no similarity with the original Chinese recipe other than the use of soy sauce.

The courses progress broadly from lighter to richer and heavier and goes through various tastes and taste cleansers. Rice remains common throughout the meal and is the main constituent of the meal, until the ''cha\u0163ni'' ([[chutney]]) course.<ref name=\"Walker1997\">{{cite book|author=Harlan Walker|title=Food on the Move: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 1996|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uYqTiD7SbcQC|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-0-907325-79-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uYqTiD7SbcQC/page/n289 288]\u2013293}}</ref>\n\n===First course or starter===\n[[File:Vegetables Curry - Kolkata 2011-02-24 1725.JPG|thumb|Shukto]]\nThe starting course is made from bitter vegetables or herbs, often deep fried in oil or steamed with cubed potatoes. Portions are usually tiny\u2014a spoonful or so to be had with rice\u2014and this course is considered to be both a palate-cleanser and of great medicinal value. The ingredients used for this course change seasonally, but commonly used ones are ''k\u00f4rola''  or ''uchhe'' (forms of [[bitter gourd]]) which are available nearly all year round, or tender ''[[neem]]'' leaves in spring.\n\nA thick soupy mixture of vegetables in a ginger-mustard sauce called ''Shukto'' in [[West Bengal]] usually follows the bitter starting course, but sometimes replaces it as a starter altogether. Eaten in much bigger portions, ''Shukto'' is usually eaten in summer. It is a complex dish, featuring a fine balance of many different tastes and textures and is often a critical measure of a Bengali cook's abilities in the kitchen.\n\n====Shak====\nThe first course is then followed by ''shak'' ([[leaf vegetables|leafy vegetables]]) such as [[spinach]], ''palong'' [[chard]], ''methi'' [[fenugreek]], or [[amaranth]] to name a few. The ''shak'' can be steamed or cooked in oil with other vegetables such as ''begun'' ([[aubergine]]). Steamed ''shak'' is sometimes accompanied by a pungent paste of fermented mustard seeds, spices and sometimes dried mangoes, dried Indian plum and olives which is called ''Kashundi''.\nMany varieties of the Shak (fried/ cooked leaves) are savored in Bengal. Methi Shak, Kormi Shak, Pui Shak, Ponka Shak, Kulekhara Shak, Sojne Shak(drum stick leaves), Hinche Shak, Neem Pata, Lau Shak, Kumro Shak, Sorshe Shak (also very common in North of India), Kochu Shak etc. are some of the varieties that are very commonly eaten in Bengali dishes.\nNeem Shak and Begun (Brinjal) is cooked in mustard oil (deep fried) and consumed with rice. This is a unique dish which is consumed as a normal food considering its bitter taste because of the Neem leaves.\n\n====Dal====\n[[File:Luchi&alurdom.jpg|thumb|Luchis with alur dom, cholar dal and sondesh.]]\nThe [[dal|\u0111al]] course is usually the most substantial course, especially in West Bengal. It is eaten with a generous portion of rice and a number of accompaniments. Common accompaniments to \u0111al are ''aaloo bhaate'' (potatoes mashed with rice), and ''bhaja'' (stir fried). ''Bhaja'' literally means 'fried'; most vegetables are good candidates but ''begun'' (aubergines), ''kumro'' (pumpkins), or ''alu'' (potatoes) like French fries, or shredded and fried, ''uchhe'', ''potol'' [[pointed gourd]] are common. ''Machh bhaja'' (fried fish) is also common, especially ''rui'' ([[rohu]]) and ''ilish'' ([[hilsa]]) fishes. ''Bhaja'' is sometimes coated in a ''[[Gram flour|beshon]]'' (chickpea flour) and ''posto'' ([[poppyseed]]) batter. A close cousin of ''bhaja'' is ''b\u00f4ra'' or deep-fried savoury balls usually made from ''poshto'' ([[poppyseed]]) paste or coconut mince. Another variant is fried [[pointed gourd]] as ''potoler dorma'' with [[roe (egg)|roe]]/[[prawn]].\n\nAnother accompaniment is a vegetable preparation usually made of multiple vegetables stewed slowly together without any added water. ''Labra'', ''chorchori'', ''ghonto'', or ''chanchra'' are all traditional [[#glossary|cooking styles]].  There also are a host of other preparations that do not come under any of these categories and are simply called ''t\u00f4rkari''\u2014the word merely means 'vegetable' in Bengali. Sometimes these preparations may have spare pieces of fish such as bits of the head or gills, or spare portions of meat. A ''[[charchari]]'' is a vegetable dish that is cooked without stirring, just to the point of charring.\n\nPickles such as raw mangoes pickled in mustard oil and spices or sweet and tangy tamarind pickles and lemon pickle are also served with the dal course. A variety of pickles are a permanent fixture of Bengali meal.\n\n===Main course===\n\nThe next course is the fish course. Generally, there is one fish course a day, because Bengalis tend to eat fish and generally derive the necessary protein intake from fish and dal. Meat was generally a once-a-week affair until the 1990s, but now with changing culture, meat is served more often in the household. Generally, the most common fish dish is the Jhol, where a thin gravy of fish is made with ginger, turmeric, chili and cumin (the basic group of spices), and fish and sometimes potato or other vegetables.[[File:Macher Jhol.JPG|thumb|A traditional Bengali fish meal \u2013 rice with [[Machher Jhol|m''acher jhol'']] (Literally translated to \"Fish's gravy\").]]Bengalis fame in cooking fish, both dried fish called \"Shutki\" (more present in East Bengali households) as well as fresh fish. Prawn or shrimp is often considered to be a kind of fish, and crabs are also a favourite of the Bengalis. Apart from it, mutton and chicken feature largely in the non-vegetarian menu, while the vegetarian menu contains homemade [[paneer|ponir]], gram flour \"dhoka\"(deep fried fermented gram flour dough balls).\n\nGenerally, one or two pieces of fish or meat are served during lunch, with rice, to balance out the meal.\n\n===Additional main course===\nThen comes the meat course. This course may be eaten occasionally for 2 reasons: the Hindu principle of ''[[ahimsa]]'', which is observed throughout the region, and cost, as meat is very costly. The divide among the Bengalis of Bangladesh and West Bengal is most evident when it comes to the meat course. Meat is readily consumed in urban parts of Bangladesh and some consider it the meal's main course. Beef is mainly consumed in some of the feasts and banquets in major cities like [[Dhaka]] and [[Chittagong]]. Because the consumption of beef is prohibited among Bengali Hindu communities, ''Khashi'' [[Goat#Meat|mutton]] is traditionally the meat of choice in West Bengal, but ''murgi'' [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and ''\u0111im'' [[egg (food)|eggs]] are also commonly consumed. At the time of Partition, it was rare for caste Hindus to eat chicken or even eggs from hens, choosing rather duck eggs if eggs were to be consumed. Although it is debatable as to whether chicken is more popular than ''khashi'' in West Bengal today, the proliferation of poultry farms and hatcheries makes chicken the cheaper alternative.\n\n====Chutney====\nNext comes the chutney course, which is typically tangy and sweet; the chutney is usually made of ''am'' [[mango]]es, tomatoes, ''anar\u00f4sh'' [[pineapple]], ''tetul'' [[tamarind]], ''pepe'' [[papaya]], or just a combination of fruits and dry fruits called mixed fruit chutney served in ''biye badi'' (marriage). The chutney is also the move towards the sweeter part of the meal and acts also as a palate cleanser, similar to the practice of serving sorbet in some Western cuisines.\n\n''Papo\u0157'' ([[papadum]]), a type of wafer, thin and flaky, is often made of [[dal|\u0111al]] or potatoes or ''shagu'' (''[[sago]]'') and is a usual accompaniment to the chutneys.\n\n===Dessert===\n[[File:Mishti Doi.jpg|thumb|Mishti Doi]]\nThe last item before the sweets is [[dahi (curd)|doi]] (yogurt). It is generally of two varieties, either natural flavour and taste or [[Mishti Doi]] \u2013 sweet yogurt, typically sweetened with charred sugar. This brings about a brown colour and a distinct flavour. Like the fish or sweets [[mishti doi]] is typically identified with Bengali cuisine.\n\nIn a daily meal it is likely that some of the courses might get missed, for instance, the 'Shak', the additional course, chutney, and papor. In some cases, the dessert might be missed as well. The courses overall are the same at home or at a social function (e.g. marriage feast). Rice, which is the staple across the meal gets replaced by 'luchi' or luchi stuffed with dal or mashed green peas. The replacement is a relatively recent phenomenon and has been seen in practice only from about the early 20th century.\n\n====Sweetmeats====\n[[File:Bengali Sweets.svg|thumb|Minimalist depiction of Bengali sweets]]\nSweetmeats, or ''mishti'' (Bengali: \u09ae\u09bf\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09bf) occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. It is an ancient custom among both [[Hindu]] and [[Bengali Muslim|Muslim Bengalis]] to distribute sweets during festivities. The confectionery industry has flourished because of its close association with social and religious ceremonies. Competition and changing tastes have helped to create many new sweets, and today this industry has grown within the country as well as across the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe sweets of Bengal are generally made of sweetened cottage cheese (''chhena''), unlike the use of ''khoa'' (reduced solidified milk) in Northern India. Flours of different cereals and [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] are used as well.\n\n=====Sh\u00f4ndesh=====\nMade from sweetened, finely ground fresh [[paneer|chhena (cottage cheese)]], sh\u00f4ndesh in all its variants is among the most popular Bengali sweets. The basic sh\u00f4ndesh has been considerably enhanced by the many famous confectioners of Bengal, and now several hundred different varieties exist, from the simple ''kachagolla'' to the complicated ''abar khabo'', ''j\u00f4lbh\u00f4ra'' or ''indrani''. Another variant is the ''k\u00f4rapak'' or hard mixture, which blends rice flour with the paneer to form a shell-like dough that lasts much longer.\n\n=====Rossogolla=====\n[[Rossogolla]], a Bengali traditional sweet, is one of the most widely consumed sweets in India.  It spread to Bengal in 1868. [[Channa]] based sweets were introduced in Eastern India from about the 18th century; as the process and technology involved in synthesizing \"Chhana\" was introduced to the Indians by the Dutch in the 1790s. The cottage cheese \"schmierkase\" was also known as Dutch cheese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rossogolla.zohosites.com/|title=History of Rossogolla|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref> The earlier versions of Rossogolla lacked binding capacity of the modern avatar that is well known and highly acclaimed today. This was due to the fact that the know-how involved in synthesizing such a sweet was unknown before being experimentally developed by [[Nobin Chandra Das]] and then constantly improved and further standardized by his successors. Furthermore, one must clearly understand that the \"chhana\" manufactured in those days was a coarse and granular variety and had low binding capacity. It was made by [[Citric acid|citric]] and [[ascorbic acid]] from natural fruit extracts. This type of \"chhana\" cannot be worked on to compact into any regular and firm shape for the purpose of sweet-making, leave alone making Rossogolla. This is because of a documented technological issue - [[lactic acid]] (extracted from [[whey]]) used to curdle [[milk]] now was introduced to India in the late 18th century by Dutch and Portuguese colonists (along with [[acetic acid]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rossogolla.zohosites.com/the-birth-of-a-legend.html|title=The Origin of Rossogolla|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref> - and it is this method that creates the fine, smooth modern \"chhana\" with high binding capacity - which is now the staple raw material for [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Confectionery|confectioners]].

[[Comilla]] is famous for its Rosh malai.\n\n=====Pantua=====\n''[[Pantua]]'' is somewhat similar to the r\u00f4shogolla, except that the cottage cheese balls are fried in either ''ghee'' (clarified butter) or oil until golden or deep brown before being put in syrup. There are similar tasting, but differently shaped versions of the Pantua e.g. Langcha (cylindrical) or Ledikeni. The latter was created in honour of [[Charlotte Canning, Countess Canning|Countess Charlotte Canning]] (wife of the then Governor General to India Charles Canning) by Bhim Nag, a sweet maker in Kolkata.\n\n''Pantua'' is similar to [[gulab jamun]], and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charmaine O'Brien |title=Flavours of Delhi: A Food Lover's Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeSXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT145 |date=3 February 2003 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-93-5118-237-5 |pages=145}}</ref>\n\n=====Ch\u00f4mch\u00f4m=====\n[[Cham cham|''Ch\u00f4mch\u00f4m'']], (\u099a\u09ae\u099a\u09ae) (originally from Porabari, [[Tangail District]] in Bangladesh) goes back about 150 years.Except that many variation of this [[Bangladeshi Cuisine|Bangladeshi dish]] are now available. It can also be preserved longer. Granules of ''maoa'' or dried milk can also be sprinkled over it.\n\n=====Pitha=====\n[[File:Pitha for Wedding- Pakan, Patishapta, Bharandash.jpg|thumb|right|Varieties of pithas (Pakan, Pati Shapta, etc.)]]\nIn both Bangladesh and West Bengal, the tradition of making different kinds of pan-fried, steamed or boiled sweets, lovingly known as ''pithe'' or the \"pitha\", still flourishes. These symbolise the coming of winter, and the arrival of a season where rich food can be included in the otherwise mild diet of the Bengalis. The richness lies in the creamy silkiness of the milk which is mixed often with molasses, or jaggery made of either date palm or sugarcane, and sometimes sugar. They are mostly divided into different categories based on the way they are created. Generally, rice flour goes into making the pithe.\n\nThey are usually fried or steamed; the most common forms of these cakes include ''[[Bhapa pitha|bhapa pi\u0163ha]]'' (steamed), ''pakan pitha'' (fried), and ''puli pitha'' (dumplings), among others. The other common pithas are ''chandrapuli'', ''gokul'', ''pati shapta'', ''chitai pi\u0163ha'', ''aski pithe'', ''muger puli'' and  ''dudh puli''.\n\nThe ''Pati Shapta'' variety is basically a thin-layered rice-flour crepes with a milk-custard creme-filling, similar to the hoppers or [[appam]]s of South India, or French crepes. In urban areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal, most houses hold Pi\u0163ha-festivals such as [[Nabanna]].\n\n====Other sweets====\nSeveral varieties of [[dahi (curd)|''doi'']] such as ''mish\u0163i doi'', [[custard]]s, and rice pudding (''khir'' or ''firni'')<ref name=\":1\" /> are also popular in West Bengal.\n\n''Sh\u00f4ndesh'', ''chhanar jilapi'', ''kalo jam'', ''raghobshai'', \"pantua\", \"jolbhora shondesh<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|title=Milk-- Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuor2vcVtiQC&pg=PA308|year=2000|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-06-4|page=308}}</ref>\", roshbhora\", \"lord chomchom\", ''payesh'', ''bundiya'', ''nalengurer sh\u00f4ndesh'', ''malpoa'', ''shor bhaja'', ''[[langcha]]'', ''[[babarsa]]'', and a variety of others are examples of sweets in Bengali cuisine.\n\n===Snacks===\n====Mu\u0157i====\nMu\u0157i (puffed rice) is made by heating sand in a pot, and then throwing in grains of rice. The rice may have been washed i brine to provide seasoning. The rice puffs up and is separated from the sand by a strainer. Mu\u0157i is very popular and is used in a wide variety of secular and religious occasions, or even just consumed plain. Muri is also often used as a replacement for or in combination with regular rice.\n\nA variant of mu\u0157i is khoi, which is popped rice. Both varieties are used to make many different snack foods.\n\n====Jhal-Mu\u0157i====\nOne of the most popular and iconic snack foods of Bengal, ''jhal'' literally means 'hot' or 'spicy'. Jhal-mu\u0157i is puffed rice with spices, vegetables and raw mustard oil. Depending on what is added, there are many kinds of jhal-mu\u0157i but the most common is a ''bh\u00f4rta'' made of chopped shallot, ''jira'' roasted ground cumin, ''bitnoon'' black salt ''l\u00f4ngka'' / ''morich'' chilis (either ''kacha'' 'ripe' or ''shukna'' 'dried'), mustard oil, ''dhone pata'' (fresh coriander leaves)\nand mudhi.\n\n====Moa====\nA moa is made by taking muri with [[jaggery|gur (jaggery)]] as a binder and forming it into a ball, made all over [[Bengal]]. Another popular kind of moa is ''[[Jaynagarer Moa]]'', a moa particularly made in [[Jaynagar]], which uses kanakchur khoi and nolen gur as binder. Nolen gur is fresh jaggery made from the sap of date palm. Moas are made specially during winter.\n\n====Chir\u0326e Bhaja====\nChir\u0326e Bhaja is made up of Flattened rice fried in sand and then strained in metal strainers, not tea strainer.\nIt is mostly consumed with fried peanuts, jhuri-bhaja and fried curry leaves.\n\n====Rolls====\nThough the culture of having several types of Rolls are not authentic Bengali cuisine but it has a partial Awadhi touch made in Bengali style. Usually common within office goers and students. Predominantly nonveg, it is prepared by lacha paratha wrapped with egg or stuffed with chicken, chicken tikka, mutton keema and so on, sometimes with paneer and onion on demand.\n[[File:Dahi puri, Doi phuchka.jpg|thumb|Phuchka]]\n\n====Kochuri-AlurDam/Dalpuri-Alupuri====\nKochuri consists of pulses stuffed in puri or luchi and paired with alur dam or cholar dal.\n\n====Phuchka====\nAlso known as Golgappa within North India, Kolkata's phuchka has its own flavour and taste. It is an appetizer where each small shell ({{Lang-bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b2\u0997\u09be\u09aa\u09cd\u09aa\u09be}}) is stuffed with potato smash and tamarind.\n\n====Chotpoti====\nChotpoti is a very popular snack food item in Bengal. It is mainly cooked whole yellow peas with various spices, and dressed with smashed fuchka, boiled egg, green chilies etc. It is serve with tamarind juice (tetuler tok).\n\n====Shingara====\nShingara is a snack created with potato and flour. This triangular shaped dish is made by making a cone using flour and pouring the cooked potato in it and after that, it is cooked in hot oil.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Bengali New Year Menu.jpg|Bengali New Year Menu\nFile:Bengali food cuisine.jpg| A typical Bengali meal \nFile:Bengali Non-vegetarian thali.jpg|Bengali Non-vegetarian thali\nFile:Bengali traditional food.jpg| A fancy arrangement of Bengali food \n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Bangladeshi cuisine]] \n*[[List of Bangladeshi dishes]]\n*[[List of Bangladeshi spices]]\n*[[Tempering (spices)|Chaunk]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOtf8GtTptAC&pg=PA158 | title=The migrant's table: meals and memories in Bengali-American households. | publisher=Temple University Press | year=2004 | isbn=1-59213-096-8 | accessdate=14 October 2011 | author=Ray, Krishnendu}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://traveltriangle.com/blog/kolkata-cuisine/ Kolkata Cuisine- Travel Triangle]\n{{Cuisine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bengali Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:North Indian cuisine]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{POV|date=May 2014}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2012}}\n}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{short description|The food of both West Bengal and Bangladesh}}\n{{Indian cuisine}}\n{{Culture of Bengal}}\n'''Bengali cuisine''' is a culinary style originating in [[Bengal region]] in the eastern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]], which is divided between [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Indian states]] of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]]'s [[Barak Valley]]. There is an emphasis on fish, vegetables, and lentils served with the staple rice.\n\nMany Bengali food traditions draw from previously middle class activities, such as [[Adda (South Asian)|adda]], or the ''[[Annaprashana]]''.\n\nBengali cuisine is known for its varied use of flavours, as well as the spread of its confectioneries and desserts. It has the only traditionally developed [[full course dinner|multi-course]] tradition from the [[cuisine of the Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine]], with food served in [[course (food)|courses]] rather than all at once.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Influence of widows===\nIn Hindu patriarchal tradition, widows are not allowed to eat foods that would not be classified as \"bitter\", necessitating experiment and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2005/545/545%20rukmini%20bhaya%20nair1.htm|title=Are we what we eat?|last=Nair|first=Rukmini|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> While most Bengali [[caste]]s ate meat and fish, this was barred for widows. Widows also could not use \"heating\" foods such as [[shallot]] and [[garlic]], but [[ginger]] was allowed. This style found a core place in Bengali curries in general, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Expensive spices such as [[saffron]], [[cinnamon]] or [[clove]]s were used very sparingly -- if at all. Nuts, dry fruits, milk and milk products (such as [[cream]], [[ghee]] or [[curd]]) were similarly scarce.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|date=Winter 1995|title=What Bengali Widows Cannot Eat|url=http://www.granta.com/Magazine/52|url-status=dead|journal=Granta|issue=52|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220063949/http://www.granta.com/Magazine/52|archive-date=20 December 2011|access-date=28 November 2011}}</ref> These economic and social restrictions influenced Bengali widows to create a brand new set of meals that utilized only vegetables and cheap spices.\n\n===Partition of Bengal and India===\nThe large-scale displacement along religious lines as a result of the [[Partition of India|partition]] led to changes in meal-taking, as to adhere to religious restrictions. In Bangladesh, [[Mughlai cuisine|Mughlai food]] is common, and includes foods that are taboo in West Bengal, such as beef [[kebab]]. Additionally, more traditionally Islamic sweets such as [[Zarda (food)|zarda]] and firni-payesh are eaten. In rural Bangladesh, many people eat [[Nymphaeaceae|makna]] fried, popped, or raw. As a whole, Bangladesh's cuisine mainly remained traditional due to its geopolitical isolation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Food_Habits|title=Food Habits - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bengalcuisine.in/history|title=Historical Sketch {{!}} Bengal Cuisine|website=bengalcuisine.in|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn West Bengal, the only restriction is beef, which applies only to Hindus, but due to recent laws also affect Muslim communities.

The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and ''masalchis'' (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth diminished, they became interspersed into the local population. These cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of spices (most notably ''[[Saffron|jafran]]'' and [[mace (spice)|mace]]), the extensive use of ''[[ghee]]'', and marinating meat with yoghurt and chilli.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalindia.net/indian-food/mughlai.html|title=All That You Ever Wanted To Know About Mughlai Cuisine!|website=culturalindia.net|language=en|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Food-Mutton-Chaanp.jpg|thumb|right|Mutton Chaanp]]In [[Bangladesh]], this food has become common fare for the population while in West Bengal, they have remained the food of professional chefs.

These collective western influences are seen in the foods created to satisfy the tastes of the western rulers. The result is a unique cuisine, local ingredients adapted to French and [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] cooking techniques\u2014characterised by creamy sauces, the restrained use of spices, and new techniques such as baking. English and Jewish bakers such as Flury's and Nahoum's dominated the confectionery industry which migrated from British tables to everyday Bengali ones, resulting in unique creations such as the ''p\u00ea\u0163is'' (savory turnovers, from the English \"pasty\"). Another enduring contribution to Bengali cuisine is ''pau ru\u0163i'', or Western-style bread. Raj-era cuisine lives on especially in the variety of finger foods popularised in the 'pucca' clubs of Kolkata, such as ''mutton chop'', ''kabiraji cutlet'' or ''fish orly''.\n\nThe British also influenced food in a somewhat different way. Many British families in India hired local cooks, and through them discovered local foods. The foods had to be toned down or modified to suit the tastes of the \"[[Sahib#Colonial and modern use|memsahibs]]\". The most distinct influence is seen in the desserts, many of which were created specifically to satisfy the British\u2014most notably the very popular sweet ''le\u0111ikeni'' named after the first Vicereine [[Lady Canning]]; it is a derivative of the ''pantua'' created for an event hosted by her.\n\n===Odia Influence===\nDuring the 19th century many Odia cooks migrated to Bengal to work in the households of affluent Bengali families. They were also hired to cook in marriages and other family ceremonies. Odia Brahmin cooks from [[Puri]] who worked in [[Jagannath Temple]], known as ''thakurs'' in [[Bengal]] were in great demand. Introduction of [[Odia people|Odia]] cooks into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] kitchens brought in subtle but significant changes to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] cuisine. Many of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] classic dishes were originally from Odisha but were refined in Bengali kitchens by Odia cooks. In fact some researchers say that dishes like ''[[Rasgulla|rasogola]]'' (Bengali ''rosogolla''), ''[[Kanika (food)|kanika]]'' (Bengali ''misti pulao'') and ''[[Mutton curry|mangsa kawsha]]'' (Bengali ''kosha mangsho'') were first introduced to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] kitchens by [[Odia language|Odia]] cooks although this is contested by other researchers.<ref>http://alexis.org.in/face-off-the-rasgulla-battle-between-west-bengal-and-odisha/</ref><ref>https://www.cntraveller.in/story/odisha-indias-underrated-food-destination/</ref> Even to this date most of the cooks in Bengali kitchens and hotels are Odia cooks.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/spotlight/odia-cooks-to-bring-back-forgotten-bengali-recipes/articleshow/63761843.cms</ref>\n\n===Chinese influence===\n[[File:Pork Roll - Sun Yat-sen Street - Kolkata 2013-03-03 5307.JPG|thumbnail|Chinese pork roll]]\n\nThe [[Chinese of Kolkata]] originally settled into a village called [[Achipur]] south of Kolkata in the late 18th century, later moving into the city and finally into its present home in [[Tangra, Calcutta|Tangra]] at the eastern edge of Kolkata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beautifulbengal.com/bengali-recipies.html|title=Bengali cuisine,Historical influences,Characteristics of Bengali cuisine,Cooking styles,Common Bengali Recipe Styles,Culinary Influences,Bengali meals,Mish\u0163i (sweets),Snacks|website=beautifulbengal.com|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref> The Chinese-origin people of Kolkata form a substantial and successful community with a distinct identity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Chapter 1|title=Shodhganga|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/61925/10/10_chapter%201.pdf|journal=Bit Stream}}</ref> With this identity came Chinese food, available at almost every street corner in Kolkata at present, due to the taste, quick cooking procedure, and no similarity with the original Chinese recipe other than the use of soy sauce.

The courses progress broadly from lighter to richer and heavier and goes through various tastes and taste cleansers. Rice remains common throughout the meal and is the main constituent of the meal, until the ''cha\u0163ni'' ([[chutney]]) course.<ref name=\"Walker1997\">{{cite book|author=Harlan Walker|title=Food on the Move: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 1996|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uYqTiD7SbcQC|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-0-907325-79-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uYqTiD7SbcQC/page/n289 288]\u2013293}}</ref>\n\n===First course or starter===\n[[File:Vegetables Curry - Kolkata 2011-02-24 1725.JPG|thumb|Shukto]]\nThe starting course is made from bitter vegetables or herbs, often deep fried in oil or steamed with cubed potatoes. Portions are usually tiny\u2014a spoonful or so to be had with rice\u2014and this course is considered to be both a palate-cleanser and of great medicinal value. The ingredients used for this course change seasonally, but commonly used ones are ''k\u00f4rola''  or ''uchhe'' (forms of [[bitter gourd]]) which are available nearly all year round, or tender ''[[neem]]'' leaves in spring.\n\nA thick soupy mixture of vegetables in a ginger-mustard sauce called ''Shukto'' in [[West Bengal]] usually follows the bitter starting course, but sometimes replaces it as a starter altogether. Eaten in much bigger portions, ''Shukto'' is usually eaten in summer. It is a complex dish, featuring a fine balance of many different tastes and textures and is often a critical measure of a Bengali cook's abilities in the kitchen.\n\n====Shak====\nThe first course is then followed by ''shak'' ([[leaf vegetables|leafy vegetables]]) such as [[spinach]], ''palong'' [[chard]], ''methi'' [[fenugreek]], or [[amaranth]] to name a few. The ''shak'' can be steamed or cooked in oil with other vegetables such as ''begun'' ([[aubergine]]). Steamed ''shak'' is sometimes accompanied by a pungent paste of fermented mustard seeds, spices and sometimes dried mangoes, dried Indian plum and olives which is called ''Kashundi''.\nMany varieties of the Shak (fried/ cooked leaves) are savored in Bengal. Methi Shak, Kormi Shak, Pui Shak, Ponka Shak, Kulekhara Shak, Sojne Shak(drum stick leaves), Hinche Shak, Neem Pata, Lau Shak, Kumro Shak, Sorshe Shak (also very common in North of India), Kochu Shak etc. are some of the varieties that are very commonly eaten in Bengali dishes.\nNeem Shak and Begun (Brinjal) is cooked in mustard oil (deep fried) and consumed with rice. This is a unique dish which is consumed as a normal food considering its bitter taste because of the Neem leaves.\n\n====Dal====\n[[File:Luchi&alurdom.jpg|thumb|Luchis with alur dom, cholar dal and sondesh.]]\nThe [[dal|\u0111al]] course is usually the most substantial course, especially in West Bengal. It is eaten with a generous portion of rice and a number of accompaniments. Common accompaniments to \u0111al are ''aaloo bhaate'' (potatoes mashed with rice), and ''bhaja'' (stir fried). ''Bhaja'' literally means 'fried'; most vegetables are good candidates but ''begun'' (aubergines), ''kumro'' (pumpkins), or ''alu'' (potatoes) like French fries, or shredded and fried, ''uchhe'', ''potol'' [[pointed gourd]] are common. ''Machh bhaja'' (fried fish) is also common, especially ''rui'' ([[rohu]]) and ''ilish'' ([[hilsa]]) fishes. ''Bhaja'' is sometimes coated in a ''[[Gram flour|beshon]]'' (chickpea flour) and ''posto'' ([[poppyseed]]) batter. A close cousin of ''bhaja'' is ''b\u00f4ra'' or deep-fried savoury balls usually made from ''poshto'' ([[poppyseed]]) paste or coconut mince. Another variant is fried [[pointed gourd]] as ''potoler dorma'' with [[roe (egg)|roe]]/[[prawn]].\n\nAnother accompaniment is a vegetable preparation usually made of multiple vegetables stewed slowly together without any added water. ''Labra'', ''chorchori'', ''ghonto'', or ''chanchra'' are all traditional [[#glossary|cooking styles]].  There also are a host of other preparations that do not come under any of these categories and are simply called ''t\u00f4rkari''\u2014the word merely means 'vegetable' in Bengali. Sometimes these preparations may have spare pieces of fish such as bits of the head or gills, or spare portions of meat. A ''[[charchari]]'' is a vegetable dish that is cooked without stirring, just to the point of charring.\n\nPickles such as raw mangoes pickled in mustard oil and spices or sweet and tangy tamarind pickles and lemon pickle are also served with the dal course. A variety of pickles are a permanent fixture of Bengali meal.\n\n===Main course===\n\nThe next course is the fish course. Generally, there is one fish course a day, because Bengalis tend to eat fish and generally derive the necessary protein intake from fish and dal. Meat was generally a once-a-week affair until the 1990s, but now with changing culture, meat is served more often in the household. Generally, the most common fish dish is the Jhol, where a thin gravy of fish is made with ginger, turmeric, chili and cumin (the basic group of spices), and fish and sometimes potato or other vegetables.[[File:Macher Jhol.JPG|thumb|A traditional Bengali fish meal \u2013 rice with [[Machher Jhol|m''acher jhol'']] (Literally translated to \"Fish's gravy\").]]Bengalis fame in cooking fish, both dried fish called \"Shutki\" (more present in East Bengali households) as well as fresh fish. Prawn or shrimp is often considered to be a kind of fish, and crabs are also a favourite of the Bengalis. Apart from it, mutton and chicken feature largely in the non-vegetarian menu, while the vegetarian menu contains homemade [[paneer|ponir]], gram flour \"dhoka\"(deep fried fermented gram flour dough balls).\n\nGenerally, one or two pieces of fish or meat are served during lunch, with rice, to balance out the meal.\n\n===Additional main course===\nThen comes the meat course. This course may be eaten occasionally for 2 reasons: the Hindu principle of ''[[ahimsa]]'', which is observed throughout the region, and cost, as meat is very costly. The divide among the Bengalis of Bangladesh and West Bengal is most evident when it comes to the meat course. Meat is readily consumed in urban parts of Bangladesh and some consider it the meal's main course. Beef is mainly consumed in some of the feasts and banquets in major cities like [[Dhaka]] and [[Chittagong]]. Because the consumption of beef is prohibited among Bengali Hindu communities, ''Khashi'' [[Goat#Meat|mutton]] is traditionally the meat of choice in West Bengal, but ''murgi'' [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and ''\u0111im'' [[egg (food)|eggs]] are also commonly consumed. At the time of Partition, it was rare for caste Hindus to eat chicken or even eggs from hens, choosing rather duck eggs if eggs were to be consumed. Although it is debatable as to whether chicken is more popular than ''khashi'' in West Bengal today, the proliferation of poultry farms and hatcheries makes chicken the cheaper alternative.\n\n====Chutney====\nNext comes the chutney course, which is typically tangy and sweet; the chutney is usually made of ''am'' [[mango]]es, tomatoes, ''anar\u00f4sh'' [[pineapple]], ''tetul'' [[tamarind]], ''pepe'' [[papaya]], or just a combination of fruits and dry fruits called mixed fruit chutney served in ''biye badi'' (marriage). The chutney is also the move towards the sweeter part of the meal and acts also as a palate cleanser, similar to the practice of serving sorbet in some Western cuisines.\n\n''Papo\u0157'' ([[papadum]]), a type of wafer, thin and flaky, is often made of [[dal|\u0111al]] or potatoes or ''shagu'' (''[[sago]]'') and is a usual accompaniment to the chutneys.\n\n===Dessert===\n[[File:Mishti Doi.jpg|thumb|Mishti Doi]]\nThe last item before the sweets is [[dahi (curd)|doi]] (yogurt). It is generally of two varieties, either natural flavour and taste or [[Mishti Doi]] \u2013 sweet yogurt, typically sweetened with charred sugar. This brings about a brown colour and a distinct flavour. Like the fish or sweets [[mishti doi]] is typically identified with Bengali cuisine.\n\nIn a daily meal it is likely that some of the courses might get missed, for instance, the 'Shak', the additional course, chutney, and papor. In some cases, the dessert might be missed as well. The courses overall are the same at home or at a social function (e.g. marriage feast). Rice, which is the staple across the meal gets replaced by 'luchi' or luchi stuffed with dal or mashed green peas. The replacement is a relatively recent phenomenon and has been seen in practice only from about the early 20th century.\n\n====Sweetmeats====\n[[File:Bengali Sweets.svg|thumb|Minimalist depiction of Bengali sweets]]\nSweetmeats, or ''mishti'' (Bengali: \u09ae\u09bf\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09bf) occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. It is an ancient custom among both [[Hindu]] and [[Bengali Muslim|Muslim Bengalis]] to distribute sweets during festivities. The confectionery industry has flourished because of its close association with social and religious ceremonies. Competition and changing tastes have helped to create many new sweets, and today this industry has grown within the country as well as across the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe sweets of Bengal are generally made of sweetened cottage cheese (''chhena''), unlike the use of ''khoa'' (reduced solidified milk) in Northern India. Flours of different cereals and [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] are used as well.\n\n=====Sh\u00f4ndesh=====\nMade from sweetened, finely ground fresh [[paneer|chhena (cottage cheese)]], sh\u00f4ndesh in all its variants is among the most popular Bengali sweets. The basic sh\u00f4ndesh has been considerably enhanced by the many famous confectioners of Bengal, and now several hundred different varieties exist, from the simple ''kachagolla'' to the complicated ''abar khabo'', ''j\u00f4lbh\u00f4ra'' or ''indrani''. Another variant is the ''k\u00f4rapak'' or hard mixture, which blends rice flour with the paneer to form a shell-like dough that lasts much longer.\n\n=====Rossogolla=====\n[[Rossogolla]], a Bengali traditional sweet, is one of the most widely consumed sweets in India.  It spread to Bengal in 1868. [[Channa]] based sweets were introduced in Eastern India from about the 18th century; as the process and technology involved in synthesizing \"Chhana\" was introduced to the Indians by the Dutch in the 1790s. The cottage cheese \"schmierkase\" was also known as Dutch cheese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rossogolla.zohosites.com/|title=History of Rossogolla|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref> The earlier versions of Rossogolla lacked binding capacity of the modern avatar that is well known and highly acclaimed today. This was due to the fact that the know-how involved in synthesizing such a sweet was unknown before being experimentally developed by [[Nobin Chandra Das]] and then constantly improved and further standardized by his successors. Furthermore, one must clearly understand that the \"chhana\" manufactured in those days was a coarse and granular variety and had low binding capacity. It was made by [[Citric acid|citric]] and [[ascorbic acid]] from natural fruit extracts. This type of \"chhana\" cannot be worked on to compact into any regular and firm shape for the purpose of sweet-making, leave alone making Rossogolla. This is because of a documented technological issue - [[lactic acid]] (extracted from [[whey]]) used to curdle [[milk]] now was introduced to India in the late 18th century by Dutch and Portuguese colonists (along with [[acetic acid]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rossogolla.zohosites.com/the-birth-of-a-legend.html|title=The Origin of Rossogolla|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref> - and it is this method that creates the fine, smooth modern \"chhana\" with high binding capacity - which is now the staple raw material for [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Confectionery|confectioners]]. At present, [[Nobin Chandra Das]] is referred to have invented the spongy variant of rossogolla<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/history-of-rasgulla-2327.html|title=History of Rasgulla|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=====Darbesh=====\n[[Laddu]] (or as it is known as \"darbesh\" in Bengal)is a very common sweet in West Bengal and Bangladesh, as well as the rest of the subcontinent, especially during celebrations and festivities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2013/oct/31/Sweet-shops-make-hay-in-Diwali-shine-532277.html|title=Sweet shops make hay in Diwali shine|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Food/as-good-as-home/article5288375.ece|title=As good as home|last=Dundoo|first=Sangeetha Devi|date=31 October 2013|work=The Hindu|access-date=18 February 2019|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> They are usually made out of flour, [[ghee]]/butter/oil and sugar.

This dessert resembles the [[rasgulla]] greatly. Though it is not a primarily Bengali sweet and originated from other places, Ras Malai is still very popular. [[Comilla]] is famous for its Rosh malai.\n\n=====Pantua=====\n''[[Pantua]]'' is somewhat similar to the r\u00f4shogolla, except that the cottage cheese balls are fried in either ''ghee'' (clarified butter) or oil until golden or deep brown before being put in syrup. There are similar tasting, but differently shaped versions of the Pantua e.g. Langcha (cylindrical) or Ledikeni. The latter was created in honour of [[Charlotte Canning, Countess Canning|Countess Charlotte Canning]] (wife of the then Governor General to India Charles Canning) by Bhim Nag, a sweet maker in Kolkata.\n\n''Pantua'' is similar to [[gulab jamun]], and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charmaine O'Brien |title=Flavours of Delhi: A Food Lover's Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeSXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT145 |date=3 February 2003 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-93-5118-237-5 |pages=145}}</ref>\n\n=====Ch\u00f4mch\u00f4m=====\n[[Cham cham|''Ch\u00f4mch\u00f4m'']], (\u099a\u09ae\u099a\u09ae) (originally from Porabari, [[Tangail District]] in Bangladesh) goes back about 150 years.Except that many variation of this [[Bangladeshi Cuisine|Bangladeshi dish]] are now available. It can also be preserved longer. Granules of ''maoa'' or dried milk can also be sprinkled over it.\n\n=====Pitha=====\n[[File:Pitha for Wedding- Pakan, Patishapta, Bharandash.jpg|thumb|right|Varieties of pithas (Pakan, Pati Shapta, etc.)]]\nIn both Bangladesh and West Bengal, the tradition of making different kinds of pan-fried, steamed or boiled sweets, lovingly known as ''pithe'' or the \"pitha\", still flourishes. These symbolise the coming of winter, and the arrival of a season where rich food can be included in the otherwise mild diet of the Bengalis. The richness lies in the creamy silkiness of the milk which is mixed often with molasses, or jaggery made of either date palm or sugarcane, and sometimes sugar. They are mostly divided into different categories based on the way they are created. Generally, rice flour goes into making the pithe.\n\nThey are usually fried or steamed; the most common forms of these cakes include ''[[Bhapa pitha|bhapa pi\u0163ha]]'' (steamed), ''pakan pitha'' (fried), and ''puli pitha'' (dumplings), among others. The other common pithas are ''chandrapuli'', ''gokul'', ''pati shapta'', ''chitai pi\u0163ha'', ''aski pithe'', ''muger puli'' and  ''dudh puli''.\n\nThe ''Pati Shapta'' variety is basically a thin-layered rice-flour crepes with a milk-custard creme-filling, similar to the hoppers or [[appam]]s of South India, or French crepes. In urban areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal, most houses hold Pi\u0163ha-festivals such as [[Nabanna]].\n\n====Other sweets====\nSeveral varieties of [[dahi (curd)|''doi'']] such as ''mish\u0163i doi'', [[custard]]s, and rice pudding (''khir'' or ''firni'')<ref name=\":1\" /> are also popular in West Bengal.\n\n''Sh\u00f4ndesh'', ''chhanar jilapi'', ''kalo jam'', ''raghobshai'', \"pantua\", \"jolbhora shondesh<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|title=Milk-- Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuor2vcVtiQC&pg=PA308|year=2000|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-06-4|page=308}}</ref>\", roshbhora\", \"lord chomchom\", ''payesh'', ''bundiya'', ''nalengurer sh\u00f4ndesh'', ''malpoa'', ''shor bhaja'', ''[[langcha]]'', ''[[babarsa]]'', and a variety of others are examples of sweets in Bengali cuisine.\n\n===Snacks===\n====Mu\u0157i====\nMu\u0157i (puffed rice) is made by heating sand in a pot, and then throwing in grains of rice. The rice may have been washed i brine to provide seasoning. The rice puffs up and is separated from the sand by a strainer. Mu\u0157i is very popular and is used in a wide variety of secular and religious occasions, or even just consumed plain. Muri is also often used as a replacement for or in combination with regular rice.\n\nA variant of mu\u0157i is khoi, which is popped rice. Both varieties are used to make many different snack foods.\n\n====Jhal-Mu\u0157i====\nOne of the most popular and iconic snack foods of Bengal, ''jhal'' literally means 'hot' or 'spicy'. Jhal-mu\u0157i is puffed rice with spices, vegetables and raw mustard oil. Depending on what is added, there are many kinds of jhal-mu\u0157i but the most common is a ''bh\u00f4rta'' made of chopped shallot, ''jira'' roasted ground cumin, ''bitnoon'' black salt ''l\u00f4ngka'' / ''morich'' chilis (either ''kacha'' 'ripe' or ''shukna'' 'dried'), mustard oil, ''dhone pata'' (fresh coriander leaves)\nand mudhi.\n\n====Moa====\nA moa is made by taking muri with [[jaggery|gur (jaggery)]] as a binder and forming it into a ball, made all over [[Bengal]]. Another popular kind of moa is ''[[Jaynagarer Moa]]'', a moa particularly made in [[Jaynagar]], which uses kanakchur khoi and nolen gur as binder. Nolen gur is fresh jaggery made from the sap of date palm. Moas are made specially during winter.\n\n====Chir\u0326e Bhaja====\nChir\u0326e Bhaja is made up of Flattened rice fried in sand and then strained in metal strainers, not tea strainer.\nIt is mostly consumed with fried peanuts, jhuri-bhaja and fried curry leaves.\n\n====Rolls====\nThough the culture of having several types of Rolls are not authentic Bengali cuisine but it has a partial Awadhi touch made in Bengali style. Usually common within office goers and students. Predominantly nonveg, it is prepared by lacha paratha wrapped with egg or stuffed with chicken, chicken tikka, mutton keema and so on, sometimes with paneer and onion on demand.\n[[File:Dahi puri, Doi phuchka.jpg|thumb|Phuchka]]\n\n====Kochuri-AlurDam/Dalpuri-Alupuri====\nKochuri consists of pulses stuffed in puri or luchi and paired with alur dam or cholar dal.\n\n====Phuchka====\nAlso known as Golgappa within North India, Kolkata's phuchka has its own flavour and taste. It is an appetizer where each small shell ({{Lang-bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b2\u0997\u09be\u09aa\u09cd\u09aa\u09be}}) is stuffed with potato smash and tamarind.\n\n====Chotpoti====\nChotpoti is a very popular snack food item in Bengal. It is mainly cooked whole yellow peas with various spices, and dressed with smashed fuchka, boiled egg, green chilies etc. It is serve with tamarind juice (tetuler tok).\n\n====Shingara====\nShingara is a snack created with potato and flour. This triangular shaped dish is made by making a cone using flour and pouring the cooked potato in it and after that, it is cooked in hot oil.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Bengali New Year Menu.jpg|Bengali New Year Menu\nFile:Bengali food cuisine.jpg| A typical Bengali meal \nFile:Bengali Non-vegetarian thali.jpg|Bengali Non-vegetarian thali\nFile:Bengali traditional food.jpg| A fancy arrangement of Bengali food \n</gallery>\n\n{{Bengalis}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Bangladeshi cuisine]]\n*[[List of Bangladeshi dishes]]\n*[[List of Bangladeshi spices]]\n*[[Tempering (spices)|Chaunk]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOtf8GtTptAC&pg=PA158 | title=The migrant's table: meals and memories in Bengali-American households. | publisher=Temple University Press | year=2004 | isbn=1-59213-096-8 | accessdate=14 October 2011 | author=Ray, Krishnendu}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://traveltriangle.com/blog/kolkata-cuisine/ Kolkata Cuisine- Travel Triangle]\n{{Cuisine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bengali Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:North Indian cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "Bug2266", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_cuisine"}

In some areas use of these terms may be regulated by law. For example, in the U.S. a product labeled as \"low fat\" must not contain more than 3 grams of fat per serving; and to be labeled \"fat free\" it must contain less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving.<ref>[https://www.thenutritionalsource.com/definitions-of-nutrient-content-claims/ Definitions of Nutrient Content Claims], [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005192448/https://www.thenutritionalsource.com/definitions-of-nutrient-content-claims/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Process==\nThe process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NCCdphp/dnpa/nutrition/pdf/r2p_energy_density.pdf|title=Low-Energy-Dense Foods|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's [[sugar]] with a [[sugar substitute]] as is common with diet soft drinks such as [[Coca-Cola]] (for example [[Diet Coke]]). In some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements. If you are doing on a low-fat diet, there are many benefit in this diet. Low-fat diets can help you lose weight by using calories on more filling food, and ward off serious medical conditions, including heart disease, high cholesterol, and diabetes.\n\nIn [[whole grain]] foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour. Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as [[resistant starch]] or [[dietary fiber]], to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.\n\n== Example of low-fat foods ==\n\nThe low-fat foods are those that have 30% of their calories or less from fats. So, if a food contains fewer than 3 gram of fat per 100 calories, it is a low fat food.

In some areas use of these terms may be regulated by law. For example, in the U.S. a product labeled as \"low fat\" must not contain more than 3 grams of fat per serving; and to be labeled \"fat free\" it must contain less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving.<ref>[https://www.thenutritionalsource.com/definitions-of-nutrient-content-claims/ Definitions of Nutrient Content Claims], [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005192448/https://www.thenutritionalsource.com/definitions-of-nutrient-content-claims/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Process==\nThe process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NCCdphp/dnpa/nutrition/pdf/r2p_energy_density.pdf|title=Low-Energy-Dense Foods|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's [[sugar]] with a [[sugar substitute]] as is common with diet soft drinks such as [[Coca-Cola]] (for example [[Diet Coke]]). In some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements. If you are doing on a low-fat diet, there are many benefit in this diet. Low-fat diets can help you lose weight by using calories on more filling food, and ward off serious medical conditions, including heart disease, high cholesterol, and diabetes.\n\nIn [[whole grain]] foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour. Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as [[resistant starch]] or [[dietary fiber]], to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.\n\n== Example of low-fat foods ==\n\nThe low-fat foods are those that have 30% of their calories or less from fats. So, if a food contains fewer than 3 gram of fat per 100 calories, it is a low fat food. Examples of cereals, grain, and pasta products are corn or whole wheat tortillas, oatmeal, backed cracker, whole grain versions of noodles, and pita bread. Examples of protein sources are beans, lentils, tofu, egg white, tuna, and peas. On the other hand, polysaturated such as omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids can be beneficial to the body.
