Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina'', p. 10. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.</ref>\n\nRuqayyah was married twice. She was married before August 610, at the age of only eight years, to her father's cousin, [[Utbah ibn Abu Lahab]]. Utbah's father, Abu Lahab, was a half-brother of Muhammad's father, Abdullah. The families were close not only because they were near kin but also because Utbah and his parents had lived for years as the immediate neighbours of Muhammad and Khadija. Nevertheless, three years after the wedding, Ruqayyah was divorced by her husband, and the reason is like this. Ruqayyah was a muslim since birth.<ref>Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 pp. 24-25.</ref><ref>Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk''. Translated by Landau-Tasseron, E. (1998).

Albany: State University of New York Press.</ref> When Muhammad began to preach openly in 613, the [[Quraysh]] reminded Muhammad that they had \"relieved him of his care for his daughters\" and decided to return them so that he would have to support them at his own expense. They told Utbah that they would give him \"the daughter of Aban ibn Sa'id ibn Al-As or the daughter of Sa'id ibn Al-As\" if he divorced Ruqayyah.<ref name=\"auto\"/> After Muhammad warned [[Ab\u016b Lahab]] (Utbah's father) that he would go to Hell, Abu Lahab said he would never speak to his son again unless he divorced Ruqayyah, which Utbah accordingly did.<ref>Ibn Saad/Bewley pp. 24-25.</ref><ref>Tabari/Landau-Tasseron pp. 161-162.</ref> The marriage had subsisted for three years, but due to the age of the bride, had never been consummated.<ref name=\"auto\">Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 314.</ref> \n\nBy 615, aged about thirteen, Ruqayyah was married to a prominent Muslim, [[Uthman ibn Affan]]. That same year, she accompanied him on the first [[Migration to Abyssinia]],<ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 146, 314.</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Ibn Saad/Bewley p. 25.</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">Tabari/Landau-Tasseron p. 162.</ref> where she suffered a miscarriage.

When [[Usama ibn Zayd]] was sent on an errand to their house, he found himself staring at her and at Uthman in turns.

(1881). ''History of the Caliphs'', p. 155. Calcutta: The Asiatic Society.</ref>\n\nRuqayyah fell ill in March 624. Uthman was excused from his military duties in order to nurse her.

Violators of so-called \"Bible bans\" have been punished by killing, imprisonment, forced labor, and banishment, as well as by burning or confiscating the Bible or Bibles used or distributed. Censorship of the Bible occurred in historical times and is still going on today.\n\nThe ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''{{efn|also called Index Romanus or \"Roman Index\"}} of the Catholic Church included various translations of the Bible. In most cases, the bans on pious lay people possessing or using Bibles were related to vernacular Bible editions. Clerics were never forbidden to possess the [[Vulgate]] Bible translation in the Latin language.\n\nFrom the point of view of Protestantism, the topic mostly refers to historical provisions of the Catholic Church against reading or possessing Bibles not of the Latin Vulgate translation, or in the case of the laity, possessing any Bibles at all, including the Vulgate. From a Catholic point of view, one rarely speaks of Bible bans, because in their view the attempts by the hierarchy to prevent opposing biblical interpretations were justified. From a Catholic point of view, the [[censorship]] of the Bible was justified both by restricting Bibles from those lacking instruction and by censoring translations thought to encourage deviations from official doctrines.<ref name=\"Baumgarten-Crusius1832\">\n[[Ludwig Friedrich Otto Baumgarten-Crusius]]: ''Lehrbuch der christlichen Dogmengeschichte.

The New Testament was written in [[Koine Greek|Koine]], a form of ancient Greek. The books were translated into several other languages, including [[Bible translations into Latin|Latin]]. From about A.D. 300 onward, Latin began to assert itself as the language of worship in [[Western Christianity]]. This was aided by the fact many European languages, called the [[Romance languages]], are all descended from Latin. In contrast the earliest written Western [[Germanic languages]] date only from the 6th century. From A.D. 382-420, a new translation was made into the Latin vernacular, the [[Vulgate]], which became the dominant translation for [[Western Christianity]] in the 7th-9th centuries. From about the 9th century it was regarded as the only valid Bible translation.{{efn|See [[Bible translations in the Middle Ages]]}} In [[Eastern Christianity]], on the other hand, Greek remained dominant.\n\n== Persecution by Antiochus Epiphanes ==\n[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], the Hellenistic king of the Seleucid Empire, made possession of the [[Torah]] a capital offense and burned the copies he could find.<ref>[[:s:Bible (King_James)/1 Maccabees#57|I Macccabees 1:57]]</ref> This and other persecutions sparked resistance led by the Macccabees.\n\n== Diocletianic persecution ==\nDuring the [[Diocletianic Persecution]], Bibles were targeted as part of a larger program intended to wipe out Christianity. On February 24, 303, Diocletian's first \"Edict against the Christians\" was published.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22; Clarke, 650; Potter, 337; de Ste Croix, \"Aspects\", 75; Williams, 176.</ref>{{efn|The edict might not actually have been an \"edict\" in the technical sense; Eusebius does not refer to it as such, and the passage in the ''Passio Felicis'' which includes the word ''edictum'' (\"''exiit edictum imperatorum et Caesarum super omnem faciem terrae''\") may simply have been written to echo [[Census of Quirinius#The Census in the New Testament|Luke 2:1]] (\"''exiit edictum a Caesare Augusto ut profiteretur universus orbis terrae''\").<ref>The [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] pre-[[Vulgate]] version is given here, from Corcoran, ''Empire'', 179&ndash;80.</ref> Elsewhere in the passion, the text is called a ''programma''.<ref>Corcoran, ''Empire'', 180.</ref> The text of the edict itself does not actually survive.<ref>Corcoran, ''Empire'', 179.</ref>}} Among other persecutions against Christians, Diocletian ordered the destruction of their scriptures and liturgical books across the entire Roman empire.<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.2.4; ''De Martyribus Palestinae'' praef. 1; and Optatus, Appendix 2; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22; Clarke, 650;  Liebeschuetz, 249&ndash;50; Potter, 337; de Ste Croix, \"Aspects\", 75.</ref>{{efn|This apparently included any house in which scriptures were found.<ref>de Ste Croix, \"Aspects\", 75.</ref>}}\n\n== During the middle ages ==\nBeginning in the 5th century, the laity were advised not to read the books of the Bible [[:wikt:indiscriminate|indiscriminately]], especially the Old Testament due to concern it could be more easily misunderstood than the New Testament.\n\nAt the end of the fifth century [[Pope Gelasius I]] described the reading of the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] (now termed [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] in Catholicism) as dangerous for Christians, but did not forbid it.<ref name=\"pierer1857\">[http://www.zeno.org/Pierer-1857/K/pierer-1857-002-0730 Bibelverbot] entry ([http://www.zeno.org/Pierer-1857/K/pierer-1857-002-0731 and following page]) in Pierer's Universal-Lexikon, Volume 2, by [[[[Heinrich August Pierer]]]], 1857, pages 730-731}}\n</ref>\n\nThe 210\u2013390 A.D.

Yet Christians were forbidden to use the Old Church Slavonic translation by [[Pope John X|John X]] in 920 and by the Lateran Synod of 1059, with the synod being confirmed by [[Pope Nicholas II|Nicholas II]] and [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]]. In a letter to [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislav II]] of Bohemia dated 2 January 1080, Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] revoked his predecessors' permission to use the [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic language]]. The reason he gave was that \"Not without reason has it pleased Almighty God that Holy Scripture should be a secret in certain places, lost, if it were plainly apparent to all men, [[:wikt:perchance|perchance]] it would be little esteemed and be subject to disrespect; or it might be falsely understood by those of mediocre learning, and lead to error.\"<ref>[https://www.truthmagazine.com/english-bible-translations-through-1611-a-d English Bible Translations Through 1611 A.

However, he noted that the desire to read and study the divine scriptures, was not to blame, but rather it was a recommended disposition. Since, however, the individual by himself apart from private meetings could hardly procure Bible texts, this ban was practically equivalent to a Bible ban for lay people.<ref name=\"Balz1977\">\nHorst Robert Balz, Gerhard Krause, Gerhard M\u00fcller, Siegfried M.

In one of them, it was said that all books in the Latin and German languages concerning the Holy Scripture were to be delivered to the bishop. The bishop then decided which books to return. After the 1210 council held in Paris,{{efn|See [[Amalrician]] for more on this council}} [[Peter of Corbeil]], Archbishop of Sens, issued a decree according to which all theological writings in Romance languages with the exception of saints' legends were to be delivered to the diocesan bishops. Since several cities or parishes had residents with differing languages and customs, it was decided at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] under Innocent III that suitable people were to be sought who performed the priestly ministry according to their respective customs.\n\nAfter the end of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the [[Council of Toulouse]] tightened the provisions against the [[Heretic (disambiguation)|heretics]] in this ecclesiastical province. The [[Inquisition]] was the first to work nationwide, and the University of Toulouse was founded, to which the Catholic Institute of Toulouse is also called.

Individuals like William Butler wanted to go even further and also limit Bible translations to the Latin language alone. In 1401, Parliament passed the ''[[De heretico comburendo]]'' law in order to suppress Wycliffe's followers and censor their books, including the Bible translation. At the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415, Wycliffe was finally proclaimed a heretic and condemned as \"that pestilent wretch of damnable memory, yea, the forerunner and disciple of anti-christ who, as the complement of his wickedness, invented a new translation of the Scriptures into his mother-tongue.\"<ref>[http://www.bible-researcher.com/wyclif1.html Schaff's account of Wyclif and the Lollards], quote from Arundel</ref> His helpers [[Nicholas Hereford]] and [[John Purvey]] were forced to recant their teachings, and his bones, as determined by the council were finally burned in 1428.

Under [[Isabella I of Castile]] and her husband [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the printing of vernacular Bibles was prohibited in Spanish state law. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] which they instituted ordered the destruction of [[Hebrew literature#Medieval era|all Hebrew books]] and all vernacular Bibles in 1497. This was five years after the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]]. In 1498, the Inquisition stated that it was impossible to translate the Bible into a modern language without making mistakes that would plunge unskilled and especially [[Converso|new converts]] into doubts about faith.\n\nThe complete translation of the Bible into a Romance language,{{efn|sometimes credited as a \"first,\" though it follows the Waldensian New Testament}} a transfer of the Vulgate into [[Valencian]], was made by the [[Carthusians|Carthusian]] order general [[Bonifaci Ferrer]] (1355-1417) and was printed in 1478.

This authorization was approved by [[Pope Alexander VI]]. In several theological and non-theological books from this period a [[printing patent]] is included in the publications. From this time also printing patents of the [[Patriarch of Venice]] can be found. With the censorship of January 4, 1486 and an executive order of January 10, the Elector-Archbishop [[Berthold von Henneberg|Berthold von Henneberg]] of Mainz can be considered a pioneer in censorship regulation in the German-speaking countries for [[Mainz]], [[Erfurt]], and [[Frankfurt]]. His censorship decisions did not concern secular topics, but instead targeted specific religious texts, especially translations from Latin and Greek into the German. Berthold was of the opinion that the German language was too poor to reproduce the precise and well-formulated Latin and Greek texts. Up to this time, no heretical writings had appeared printed in German, but since 1466 about ten relatively identical [[Bible translations into German#Pre-Lutheran German Bibles|German Bible translations]] were completed.

The sacred laws and canons, however, are composed by wise and eloquent men with such great care and skill, and their understanding is so difficult that the duration of human life, even for the most discerning, is scarcely sufficient to cope with them. Nevertheless, some cheeky and ignorant people have dared to translate those writings into such poor ordinary German that even scholars are seduced by their work into great misunderstandings.}}\n\nFor every book translated into German, a license from certain university professors had to be obtained before distribution. Otherwise, one would be excommunicated, the books would be confiscated and one would have to pay a fine of 100 gold [[florin]]s to the Elector-Archbishop. Due to a bull of [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]] from the year 1486 there was also a censorship authority set up involving the university in Cologne and operated by an official of the archbishop. [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] declared a preventive censorship with his bull of 1 June 1501. This extended to all the writings of the three religious electors [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Mainz]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Trier]] and the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Archdiocese of Magdeburg]], in which so many heretical books and treatises were printed. Pope [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] determined during the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] on May 3, 1515, in the bull ''Inter Sollicitudines'', that in all dioceses all books or writings to be printed had to be carefully examined and approved by the [[inquisitor]], bishop, or a bishop commissioned by the bishop. In case of [[contravention]], punishment would be the loss of the books by public burning, a fine of a hundred [[ducat]]s payable to the [[protonotary apostolic]] in Rome, threatened with no hope of estate, deprivation of permission to write for a year, ex-communication, and potentially the confiscation of one's estate upon death. [[Recidivism]] (\"if he is persistent\") could be dealt with by the offender's bishop by all legal means as [[Deterrence (penology)|deterrence ]] to others.\n\nIn 1490 a number of Hebrew Bibles and other Jewish books were burned in Andaluc\u00eda at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition.<ref>''The Spanish Inquisition'', Henry Kelsea, London, White Lion, 1965, p. 98</ref>\n\n== 16th century ==\nFrom 1516 to 1535, [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam published several editions of his ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]]''. It was a double edition with both a new Latin version as well as the first print of the Greek text, which was reconstructed in a few places by [[Translation#Back-translation|back-translating]] Latin into Greek. In 1517 [[Martin Luther|Luther]] published his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''. In 1521 he was excommunicated with the bull ''[[Decet Romanum Pontificem]]'', declared a heretic, and issued the [[Edict of Worms]]. In 1522, the first translation of [[Luther Bible#Luther's New Testament translation|Luther's New Testament]] was published. It was translated on the basis of the Greek text of Erasmus. In 1534 the entire Holy Scripture was printed, completing the ''[[Luther Bible]]''.\n\nAt the [[Council of Trent]], both Luther's and Erasmus's writings were put on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''. Later printed copies of the index explicitly banned their Bibles as well as any prior editions and in general all similar Bible editions.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DyjGPgWjMmoC&pg=PP69&lpg=PP69&dq=\"Biblia+cum+recognitione+Martini+Luteri\"&s Index auctorum, et librorum, qui ab officio sanctae Rom. et vniuersalis] by the Congregazione dell'Inquisizione, 1559</ref><ref name=\"librorum1559\">\n[http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/ILP-1559.htm#New Testaments Index Librorum Prohibitorum \u2013 NOV.

Later, Erasmus was classified in a milder index class, and as a result later Catholic Bible translations were able to be based on Erasmus's Greek New Testament.\n\nThe [[Edict of Worms]] against Luther was not enforced throughout the empire. In 1523, at the [[Diets of Nuremberg|Reichstag in Nuremberg]] the papal nuncio [[Francesco Chieregati]] asked for the Holy Roman Empire to enforce the clause of the Lateran Council against printing any book without the permission of the local bishop or his representative. He also wanted the Edict of Worms to be enforced. Instead, on March 6, 1523, it was decreed that until the demanded church council could be held, local rulers themselves should ensure that no new writings were printed or sold in their territories unless they had been approved by reasonable men. Other writings, especially those of an insulting nature, were to be banned under severe punishment.\n\nLikewise, the Nuremberg Diet of 1524 determined that the imperial estates should \"obey as much as possible\" the Edict of Worms, and otherwise repeated the order of 1523. Pope Clement VII complained to the emperor and to the kings of England and France concerning the decision of 1523. In a letter dated July 15, 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] insisted that the Edict of Worms was to be enforced. But he dropped this demand at the 1526 [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]]. Instead, it was decided on August 27 that, until the planned council, every imperial state in relation to the edict of Worms should \"live, govern and behave for itself, such as it hopes and trusts before God and the Emperor.\" \n\nThe 1529 [[Diet of Speyer (1529)|Diet of Speyer]] limited its decrees essentially to repeating the resolutions of 1523 Diet of Augsburg. On May 13, 1530, the papal nuncio gave the Emperor a memorandum which recommended that the Edict of Worms and the bull of Leo X was to be implemented by imperial decree and on pain of punishment. Following the [[Protestation at Speyer]] at the conclusion of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] on November 19, 1530, it was decided that nothing should be printed without specifying the printer and the printing location. The nuncio's request had failed.\n\nAs part of the 1541 [[Diet of Regensburg (1541)|Diet of Regensburg]] which set the terms of the [[Regensburg Interim]], the rule against publishing insults was repeated.\n\n=== England ===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of England changed his opinion about Bible translations multiple times. In a proclamation of 1530, he said that the [[prelate]]s, etc., believed there was no need to translate the Bible into English and put it into the hands of the ordinary people. The reading of Bible translations must be made dependent on the permission of the superiors. All printed English books concerning the Bible were banned and were to be delivered to the bishop within 14 days. New English books concerning Holy Scripture should not be printed without the permission of the bishop and the author. Yet after the danger of spreading heretical writings passes, the Bible ought to be translated. In the meantime, however, all English, French and Low German (including [[Dutch Low Saxon]]) versions must be delivered to the bishop, with the exception of any books corrected by the king and the bishops.\n\nThe Tyndale translation, the only one so far printed, continued to be banned on the basis of translation errors, [[annotation]]s, and extensive prologue. In 1534, the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York|Canterbury Convocation]] requested that the king [[Royal commission|commission]] a new translation of the Bible by suitable persons and authorize the reading of the new translation. Although the king did not designate translators, new translations appeared from 1535 and afterwards. In 1536 and 1538 [[Thomas Cromwell]] prescribed that [[Myles Coverdale#Coverdale's Translation of the Bible: 1535|Coverdale]]'s translation of the Bible was to be placed in every church. These Bibles were to be printed in a large size and [[Chained library|chained]] to prevent theft. This translation came to be called the \"[[Great Bible]]\" or \"Chained Bible.\" In contrast, Henry VIII complained in 1539 that people were abusing their permission to read the Bible.\n\nRegulations of 1538 and 1539 provided that no one should sell English books without the King's permission and that no one should print or import English Bibles with comments and prefaces unless they have been verified by authorized agencies. In 1540, Thomas Cromwell was executed for heresy and treason. In 1542 the Convocation negotiated about the shortcomings of existing Bible translations and started a new translation. In 1543, the king again forbade the Tyndale Bible and ordered all annotations removed from all the Bibles and New Testaments. It was also determined that without the King's permission, the [[Social class in the United Kingdom#Early modern|lower classes]] would no longer be allowed to read the even non-forbidden translations. The basis for this was that if allowed to read the Bible, they would end up abusing their privilege. In 1546, the last year of Henry VIII's reign, it was again decreed that no foreign-language English books concerning Christianity should be printed without express permission.\n\n==== During reign of Mary I ====\nIn England, the provisions of the bull ''Inter Solicitudines''{{efn|The Italian Wikipedia has an article on ''[[:it:Inter Solicitudines|Inter Solicitudines]]''}} (1515) under the reign of the Roman Catholic Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in the \"Reformation Decrees\" of the papal legate Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] in 1556 were published. As various books of heresy, rebellion, and treachery were brought in from abroad and secretly printed in the land, in 1558 Mary I determined that owners of such books should be regarded as rebels and punished under the martial law.\n\n=== Council of Trent ===\nAt the [[Council of Trent]], the Vulgate was declared ''authentic'' and ''alone applicable''.<ref>([[:s:Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent/Session IV/Canonical Scriptures|Fourth session on April 8, 1546]])</ref> It was also decided that in the in future, books dealing with religious subjects could not be printed, sold, or even kept without the name of the author and the approval of a bishop. The [[Imprimatur#Catholic Church|imprimatur]] notice must be printed at the beginning of the book. Bishops may not charge fees for providing the services of examining and approving books. During the negotiations in March and April of 1546 it was also discussed whether it was not appropriate to ban Bible translations into the vernacular. [[Pierre Van Der Worst]], bishop of [[Acqui Terme|Acqui]] thought that if the untrained were to read the Bible, it could easily give rise to misunderstandings and errors. He thought it would be enough for the women and ordinary people to become acquainted with the doctrines of Scripture through [[Homily|sermons]] at church. Cardinal [[Pedro Pacheco de Villena]] believed that all Spanish and French and most Italian bishops were against vernacular Bible translations. He referred to Spain's longstanding ban on translations, to the ban in France and to the fact that the University of Paris, which had 150 doctors, had not only spoken out against Bible translations, but also explained that the authors of such translations are like heretics because translations are a source of many heresies. In Germany, a part of the population had been brought to [[Apostasy in Christianity#Penalties|apostasy]] through vernacular translations. On the other hand, Cardinal [[Cristoforo Madruzzo]] of Trent replied that it was not the German translations of the Bible but the professors of the Greek and Hebrew languages who were to blame for the confusion. A ban would make the worst impression in Germany. In the end, no decision was reached on March 17th. Pacheco requested on April 1 to reject all ancient translations except the Vulgate, including the [[Septuagint]] and all Bible translations by heretics. [[Pietro Bertani]], Bishop of Fano replied that the Church has always tolerated various translations and that even the heretical translations are not necessarily to be rejected, just as the early church did not reject the translations of [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]] and [[Theodotion]]. [[Bartolom\u00e9 Carranza]] reported that many bishops and theologians spoke out in favor of allowing Bible translations. His argument in favor of vernacular translations came from the common practice in Spain and other countries to publicly read and preach from Gospels and epistles in the vernacular during [[Fiesta patronal|festivals]]. As this had occurred without danger, why not also translate additional parts of the Bible? Yet still, it would be best not to translate the whole Bible. The majority of the members of the Council agreed with him. Similarly, the [[Sorbonne#Paris Faculty of Theology|Paris Faculty of Theology]] expressed a similar opinion in 1526. As a result, Pacheco's claim was judged to be incorrect.\n\n=== ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' ===\nAround this time, the papal ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' began to be developed. At the 1548 [[Diet of Augsburg#Augsburg Interim|Diet of Augsburg]], which pronounced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]], the ordinance against insults was repeated and the previous provisions were extended to include the name of the author or poet. In addition, books were to be checked before printing by the \"ordinary authority of every place.\" There was a sentiment against that which was \"rebellious and [[:wikt:ignominious|ignominious]] or unruly or obnoxious to the Catholic Doctrine of the Holy Christian Church.\" The already printed books of Luther were to be suppressed. The Holy Roman Imperial [[Procurator fiscal|Fiscal]] official was to intervene against the offending authorities. After the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the Augsburg Interim and increased religious freedom by declaring ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'', the papal ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' was only observed as law in Catholic territories.\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\nIn the Netherlands up until 1550, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] issued a series of decrees intent on enforcing the 1521 [[Diet of Worms|Edict of Worms]]. He issued them by virtue of his sovereign power and did not refer to the decrees of the councils and popes. In contrast to his strictly secular method censorship, the [[Inquisition#Early Modern European history|Inquisition]] derived its ability to censor from papal authority. In addition to bans against individual authors and specific works, there was a language-related book ban against the translation of German, [[Flemish]], and French heresies into Dutch issued in 1526. Some general works of heretics were allowed to appear if the name was not mentioned. Additionally, individuals were allowed to possess Luther's writings in order to refute them. \n\nDuring the reign of [[Philip II of Spain]] (son of Charles V), the laws were not significantly expanded, although they were confirmed and honed. During his time the possession or reading of forbidden books was sufficient evidence that one was a heretic. Such heretics were usually allowed to save themselves by [[abjuration]] if it was a first offense. Punishments could include consequences to \"body or goods, according to circumstances\" (1524), [[exile]] (1526), and the death penalty (1529, 1531). The prescribed method of execution differed by sex. Men had their heads placed on stakes following their beheading, while women were to be buried alive. Burning was only for [[Recidivism|recidivists]]. \n\nThe list of banned books grew over time. Relatively short untitled lists were produced in 1526, 1529 and 1540. There are also historical references to a condemnation catalog issued by the [[KU Leuven|University of Leuven]] faculty in 1546 and 1550. Parts of these earlier lists of banned books were later incorporated into Spanish banned book catalogs and in the Roman index. It was suggested that in dangerous times, the heretical books in the lists were better not to be read and should not be given to the common people and young people. One consideration was the risk of these lists inadvertently advertising which books were subversive. A list in the Netherlands omitted books not found in the Netherlands so as not to draw attention to them. In addition, there was also a directory of books that could be used at schools. As for the Bibles, it was noted in the catalog of 1546 that in some, especially in French and German translations, the meaning was corrupted by misinterpretation or by additions or omissions.\n\nSome theological writings from this period were faulted for only pretending to follow the Vulgate while actually adding things in from the Greek. With respect to other writings, it was asserted that although the translation was good, the printers had added bad prefaces, notes, and so on. At times, summaries of the individual chapters and marginal notes were asserted to have errors in them.\n\nThe prohibited books catalog of 1546 contains 25 Latin Bibles and three Latin New Testaments, of German Bibles mostly the Antwerp editions, and two French Bibles as well as four French New Testaments from Antwerp. After a decree of April 29, 1550, lay people were forbidden to argue over the Scriptures. To preach concerning the Holy Scripture was only be granted to those authorized by the University or by the bishops. On September 25, an additional ordinance followed, saying that this prohibition would not apply to those who simply talked about Scripture according to the understanding of the church.\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn Spain, the inquisitors were forbidden in 1549 to grant permission to own or read forbidden books. The inquisitors themselves were not to read the forbidden books in their possession. Pope [[Pope Julius III|Julius III]] issued a bull in 1550 which abolished all previously granted authorizations to read banned books. This bull was also published in Spain. The Spanish catalog of 1551, which was inspired by the Leuven catalog ordered by Charles V, included among other things a general prohibition on all Bibles translated into the Spanish or other vernacular languages.\n\n=== France ===\nIn France, bans on certain books were published by the king or parliaments at the request of bishops or state-appointed inquisitors. Appraisals took over especially the [[Sorbonne]]. On March 18, 1521, at the request of the University of Paris, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] decreed that Parisian booksellers should not print new Latin or French books on the Christian faith before they had been examined by a theological faculty or deputies. On May 2, 1542, Parliament amended this regulation by stating that nothing should be printed without the approval of the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Roman Catholic Church|Rector]] and the [[Dean (education)|Dean]], and that the Rector should appoint two members from each faculty to examine the writings concerned. In 1569, Bibles and religious books were subject to approval by four doctors. Containers of imported books were only to be opened under official supervision. Beginning in 1551 with the [[Edict of Ch\u00e2teaubriant]], the import of religious books from [[Geneva]] or other places notoriously for heresy was forbidden. On August 26, 1525, the Sorbonne, at Parliament's request, declared that a Bible translation used for the [[Book of hours|Horae Beatae Virginis Mariae]] of [[Sotie#cite_note-FLC-3|Mere sotte]] would not receive a printing permit. In accordance with earlier decisions of the faculty, it was decided on February 5, 1526 that it would be dangerous at all to publish translations of the Bible or biblical books and those already published should be better suppressed than tolerated.\n\nA rare exception was the Sorbonne's permission for a Pauline-related gospel work in 1530, which was translated from Latin into French. From 1543 to 1556 there was a catalog of banned books at the Sorbonne. Later on, every bookstore was required to have a copy of this catalog available. There was also a general remark in the catalog: How dangerous it was to allow Bible translations in the vernacular to be read even by uneducated people and those who did not read them with a pious and humble spirit, as there were many now [[Waldensians|Waldenses]], [[Catharism|Albigensians]], etc. Therefore, considering the malice of the people in the present, the translation of the Bible into the vernacular should be regarded as dangerous and perishable.\n\nThe later Roman index was never used in France and an intended French index dating from 1562 was ultimately not published due to the''[[Edict of Beaulieu]]'' of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. In 1577 the provisions were changed in favor of the Protestants: \"No books may be sold without permission of our local officials or, as far as the so-called [[Calvinism|Reformed]] religion books are concerned, without the approval of the Chambers which we hold in the parliaments for the affairs of the form so-called Reformed. Forbidden is the printing and distribution of [[defamatory libel]]s.\"\n\nFrom the 16th through 18th centuries, a Bible smuggler's path led from [[Passau]] to the Slovenian border and [[Arnoldstein]] in Austria. Cattle drivers and dealers, merchants, and carters brought Bibles and hymnals into Austria, where they were used by [[Crypto-Protestantism|Crypto-Protestants]].\n\n=== General Rules in the ''Roman Index'' ===\n[[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (pontificate 1559\u20131565) also added general rules to the ''Index Romanus''. In the first printed and published version of 1559, there are 30 [[Bible translations into Latin|Latin editions of Scripture]], 10 New Testament editions, and two short general rules for Bibles in foreign languages. \n{{Quote|text=Biblia omnia vulgari idiomate, scilicet Germanico, Gallico, Hispanico, Italico, Anglico sive Flandrico, &c. conscripta, nullatenus vel imprimi, vel legi, vel teneri possint absque licentia sacri officii S.

[...] <br /> All New Testaments in the vernacular, in German, French, Italian, English or Flandrian language and more. may not be printed, read or kept without (written) permission of the Holy Office of the Roman and General Inquisition.}}\n\nAt the 18th meeting of the Council of Trent on 26 February 1562, it was decided to work out general indexing rules. On December 3rd or 4th, 1563, the Council decided to submit its proposal, the ''Decretum de indice librorum'', to the Pope for final adaptation. With the bull ''[[List of papal bulls#cite ref-McNamara_1-1|Dominici gregis custodiae]]'' the ''Index tridentinus'' was published on March 24, 1564 by the Pope. In it all the writings of all [[:wikt:heresiarch|heresiarchs]] (all Reformers) were included on the index, regardless of whether they contained theology, religious words, or descriptions of nature. Especially on Bibles, Rules 3 and 4 came into play. \n{{Quote|text='''REGULA III.'''<br />[1] Versiones scriptorum etiam ecclesiasticorum, quae hactenus editae sunt a damnatis auctoribus, modo nihil contra sanam doctrinam contineant, permittuntur.<br />[2] Librorum autem veteris Testamenti versiones, viris tantum doctis et piis, judicio Episcopi concedi poterunt, modo hujusmodi versionibus, tanquam elucidationibus Vulgatae editionis, ad intelligendam sacram Scripturam, non autem tamquam sacro textu, utantur.<br />[3] Versiones vero novi Testamenti ab auctoribus primae classis hujus Indicis factae, nemini concedantur, quia utilitatis parum, periculi vero plurimum lectoribus ex earum lectione manare solet.<br />[4] Si quae vero adnotationes cum hujusmodi, quae permittuntur, versionibus, vel cum Vulgata editione circumferuntur, expunctis locis suspectis a Facultate Theologica alicujus Universitatis catholicae, aut Inquisitione generali, permitti eisdem poterunt, quibus et versiones.<br />[5] Quibus conditionibus totum volumen Bibliorum, quod vulgo Biblia Vatabli dicitur, aut partes ejus, concedi viris piis et doctis poterunt.<br />[6] Ex Bibliis vero Isidori Clarii Brixiani prologus et prolegomena praecidantur; ejus vero textum, nemo textum Vulgatae editionis esse existimet.}}\n\n{{Quote|text='''Rule 3.'''<br />The translations of older ecclesiastical writers (for example, Church Fathers) published by authors of the first class are allowed if they do not oppose the sound doctrine.

On the other hand, translations [in Latin] of the New Testament are not to be permitted by first-class authors, because reading them does not bring much benefit to the readers. Instead, such translations pose much danger. Commentaries by First Class authors, on the condition they are associated with such Old Testament or Vulgate translations, may be allowed for use by pious and learned men after theologically suspect men have been dealt with by theological faculties or the Roman Inquisition. This is especially true of the so-called Bible of the [[Fran\u00e7ois Vatable|Vatablus]].

The counselor or confessor may permit the reading of such translations when they realize that reading such translations can bring no harm, but instead will augment faith and piety.\n\nThis permission should be given in writing. He who reads or has read a Bible in the vernacular without such permission should not be able to receive absolution from his sins until he has delivered the Bible translation to the bishop. Booksellers who sell or otherwise procure Bibles in the vernacular to those who lack permission shall be required to pay for books for the bishop to use for religious purposes. Other punishments may be given according to the nature of the offense, with penalties that expire at a set time. Members of [[Religious order (Catholic)|Religious order]]s may not read and buy such Bibles without the permission of their superiors.<ref name=\"reusch1\" />}}\n\nThe rules were reprinted in each version until the reform in 1758. Believers were forbidden to make, read, own, buy, sell or give away these books on the basis of excommunication.<ref name=\"wolfBuch\">\nHubert Wolf: ''Index: der Vatikan und die verbotenen B\u00fccher'', C.H.Beck, 2007, {{ISBN|3-406-54778-8}}, p. 27\u201334, 218 pages</ref>\n\nAt the Diet of Speyer in 1570, it was decreed that every printer should be sworn in on the Reichstag regulations. A similar provision can be found in the Reich Police Order (Reichspolizei-Ordnung){{efn|For more on the Reichspolizei, see the German language article: [[:de:Polizeibegriff in Deutschland#Der Polizeibegriff im geschichtlichen Wandel|Polizeibegriff in Deutschland \u00a7 Der Polizeibegriff im geschichtlichen Wandel]]}} of 1577, however, \"nothing unruly and obscenely should be printed,\" according to the Christian general doctrine and the religious peace called for at Augsburg. [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] (pontificate 1585\u20131590) replaced the general rules of the ''Index Romanus''. In its seventh rule it stated: {{Quote|text=Bibles or parts of Bibles translated into vernacular, even by Catholics, are nowhere permitted without the special permission of the Apostolic See. Paraphrases in the vernacular are strictly prohibited.}}\n[[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] confirmed in a bull of October 17, 1595, in principle, the old general rules, but made the fourth rule more restrictive by adding to it. This restored the provision of Paul IV that dispensation could only be granted on behalf of the Pope or the Roman Inquisition: {{Quote|text=this rule does not renew authority to bishops, inquisitors, or superiors, permission to buy, read or possess Bibles or parts of the Old or New Testament, or summaries and historical [[Compendium|compendia]] of the Bible or biblical books in the vernacular, having been deprived of this mandate by the mandate and custom of the Roman Inquisition.}}\n\nWith this addition, the rule remained valid until 1758. How it was dealt with in each country was different. In a Catholic country like Bavaria, it was state law. In particular, booksellers had their licenses revoked for violating it. In contrast, in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], a refuge of Protestantism, the index functioned more like a blacklist. But it also found application in elite Catholic schools in secularized France until the 20th century.

This broad interpretation of the fourth index rule was followed in 1757 by Benedict XIV. (This lasted until 1836.)\n\nA later regulation of the Roman book censorship of 1757 permitted only translations with explanatory notes taken from the Fathers of the Church and with papal approval.\n\n=== Punishments against violators ===\nAs part of a program of persecution against the [[Salzburg Protestants]], in 1731, [[Leopold Anton von Firmian]] \u2013 [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] as well as its temporal ruler as Count, ordered the wholesale seizure and burning of all Protestant books and Bibles.<ref>[https://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=561 Catholics Cleanse Salzburg of Protestants]</ref>\n\nOn May 27, 1747 Jakob Schmidlin (\"Sulzijoggi\") was hanged as the leading head of a Bible movement in the canton of [[Lucerne]] in Galgenw\u00e4ldli on the [[Emme (river)|Emme]].

In fact, experience has proved that the sacred writing, when used in the vernacular, has caused more harm than good due to the recklessness of men. (Rule 4) It is therefore necessary to renew the salutary resolution of June, 13th, 1757, which prohibits all translations of the Holy Scriptures into the national languages, except those approved by the Apostolic See and published with notes from the Works of the Holy Fathers.}}\n\nThe ''Epistola encyclica'' of May 3, 1824 by [[Pope Leo XII|Leo XII]] also did not exhibit any liberal attitudes.\n\nIn 1836, [[Pope Gregory XVI|Gregory XVI]] eliminated the relief made back in 1757.

After the revival of the [[Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Papal States]], the government sealed the New Testaments, which were in the possession of the American ambassador. The police checked daily to see if the seals were still intact. After some time, the government purchased the Bibles in order to burn them gradually.\n\nDuring this time, persons entering the Papal States could have their individual personal Bibles seized at the border. Most notably, editions of [[Giovanni Diodati]] were targeted for enforcement. Violators could go to jail for a short time. The papal legate and the Minister of Finance expressed regret over the events. There were also house searches.\n\nIn 1851 at [[Nice]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia#Savoyard struggle for the Italian unification|Kingdom of Sardinia]], several boxes of French Bible boxes were impounded in the Customs House. The Minister of the Interior had no objections to releasing the Bibles, but the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nice#Modern Bishops|Bishop of Nice]] disagreed. \n\nThe situation in Nice was very different from the situation in the Duchy of Tuscany. The duchy had a reputation for being liberal during the rule of [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II]], even prior to 1849. There were three Protestant churches within the duchy: one English, one Scottish and one French. The French Protestant church held fairs in the Italian language. After the brief period during the republic the subsequent counter-revolution, the liberal climate changed to conservative. On May 18, 1849, 3,000 copies of a Catholic [[Bible translations into Italian|Italian translation of the Bible]] were confiscated and burned under the orders of [[Antonio Martini]], the Archbishop of Florence, even though they had been printed with permission. Persecution of Protestants increased. In 1851, services in Italian were outlawed. The possession of a Protestant Italian Bible alone was considered sufficient evidence for conviction. The most prominent prisoner was Count Piero Guicciardini, who was arrested with six others.

Moreover, the books of non-Catholics, [[:wikt:ex professo|ex professo]] treating of Religion, are prohibited, unless they clearly contain nothing contrary to Catholic Faith. 4. The books of the above-mentioned writers, not treating ex professo of Religion, but only touching incidentally upon the Truths of Faith, are not to be considered as prohibited by Ecclesiastical Law unless proscribed by special Decree.\n\nCHAPTER II. Of Editions of the Original Text of Holy Scripture and of Versions not in the Vernacular\n\n5. Editions of the Original Text and of the ancient Catholic versions of Holy Scripture, as well as those of the Eastern Church, if published by non-Catholics, even though apparently edited in a faithful and complete manner, are allowed only to those engaged in Theological and Biblical Studies, provided also that the Dogma of Catholic Faith are not impugned in the [[:wikt:prolegomenon#English|Prolegomena]] or Annotations. 6.

Violators of so-called \"Bible bans\" have been punished by killing, imprisonment, forced labor, and banishment, as well as by burning or confiscating the Bible or Bibles used or distributed. Censorship of the Bible occurred in historical times and is still going on today.\n\nThe ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''{{efn|also called Index Romanus or \"Roman Index\"}} of the Catholic Church included various translations of the Bible. In most cases, the bans on pious lay people possessing or using Bibles were related to vernacular Bible editions. Clerics were never forbidden to possess the [[Vulgate]] Bible translation in the Latin language.\n\nFrom the point of view of Protestantism, the topic mostly refers to historical provisions of the Catholic Church against reading or possessing Bibles not of the Latin Vulgate translation, or in the case of the laity, possessing any Bibles at all, including the Vulgate. From a Catholic point of view, one rarely speaks of Bible bans, because in their view the attempts by the hierarchy to prevent opposing biblical interpretations were justified. From a Catholic point of view, the [[censorship]] of the Bible was justified both by restricting Bibles from those lacking instruction and by censoring translations thought to encourage deviations from official doctrines.<ref name=\"Baumgarten-Crusius1832\">\n[[Ludwig Friedrich Otto Baumgarten-Crusius]]: ''Lehrbuch der christlichen Dogmengeschichte.

The New Testament was written in [[Koine Greek|Koine]], a form of ancient Greek. The books were translated into several other languages, including [[Bible translations into Latin|Latin]]. From about A.D. 300 onward, Latin began to assert itself as the language of worship in [[Western Christianity]]. This was aided by the fact many European languages, called the [[Romance languages]], are all descended from Latin. In contrast the earliest written Western [[Germanic languages]] date only from the 6th century. From A.D. 382-420, a new translation was made into the Latin vernacular, the [[Vulgate]], which became the dominant translation for [[Western Christianity]] in the 7th-9th centuries. From about the 9th century it was regarded as the only valid Bible translation.{{efn|See [[Bible translations in the Middle Ages]]}} In [[Eastern Christianity]], on the other hand, Greek remained dominant.\n\n== Persecution by Antiochus Epiphanes ==\n[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], the Hellenistic king of the Seleucid Empire, made possession of the [[Torah]] a capital offense and burned the copies he could find.<ref>[[:s:Bible (King_James)/1 Maccabees#57|I Macccabees 1:57]]</ref> This and other persecutions sparked resistance led by the Macccabees.\n\n== Diocletianic persecution ==\nDuring the [[Diocletianic Persecution]], Bibles were targeted as part of a larger program intended to wipe out Christianity.

Yet Christians were forbidden to use the Old Church Slavonic translation by [[Pope John X|John X]] in 920 and by the Lateran Synod of 1059, with the synod being confirmed by [[Pope Nicholas II|Nicholas II]] and [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]]. In a letter to [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislav II]] of Bohemia dated 2 January 1080, Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] revoked his predecessors' permission to use the [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic language]].

However, he noted that the desire to read and study the divine scriptures, was not to blame, but rather it was a recommended disposition. Since, however, the individual by himself apart from private meetings could hardly procure Bible texts, this ban was practically equivalent to a Bible ban for lay people.<ref name=\"Balz1977\">\nHorst Robert Balz, Gerhard Krause, Gerhard M\u00fcller, Siegfried M.

Since several cities or parishes had residents with differing languages and customs, it was decided at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] under Innocent III that suitable people were to be sought who performed the priestly ministry according to their respective customs.\n\nAfter the end of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the [[Council of Toulouse]] tightened the provisions against the [[Heretic (disambiguation)|heretics]] in this ecclesiastical province. The [[Inquisition]] was the first to work nationwide, and the University of Toulouse was founded, to which the Catholic Institute of Toulouse is also called.

His teachings were rejected in 1381 by the university and 1382 by the church. For fear of a popular uprising Wycliffe was not charged. The translation of the Bible caused great unrest among the clergy, and for their sake several defensive provincial synods were convened, such as the 3rd Council of [[Oxford]] (ended in 1408). Under the chairmanship of Archbishop [[Thomas Arundel]], official positions against Wycliffe were written in the ''[[Oxford Constitutions|Oxford Constitution]]'' and ''Arundel Constitution''.

Individuals like William Butler wanted to go even further and also limit Bible translations to the Latin language alone. In 1401, Parliament passed the ''[[De heretico comburendo]]'' law in order to suppress Wycliffe's followers and censor their books, including the Bible translation. At the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415, Wycliffe was finally proclaimed a heretic and condemned as \"that pestilent wretch of damnable memory, yea, the forerunner and disciple of anti-christ who, as the complement of his wickedness, invented a new translation of the Scriptures into his mother-tongue.\"<ref>[http://www.bible-researcher.com/wyclif1.html Schaff's account of Wyclif and the Lollards], quote from Arundel</ref> His helpers [[Nicholas Hereford]] and [[John Purvey]] were forced to recant their teachings, and his bones, as determined by the council were finally burned in 1428.

He was strangled in 1536 near Brussels and then burned.\n\n== From the printing press until the Reformation ==\n\nAround 1440-1450 [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented a printing press with movable type, with which he produced the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. His invention quickly spread throughout Europe. In 1466 the [[Johannes Mentelin|Mentelin Bible]] was the first vernacular language Bible to be printed. It was a word-for-word translation from the Latin Vulgate.<ref name=\"kapp\">\nFriedrich Kapp: ''[[s:Geschichte des Deutschen Buchhandels Band 1|Geschichte des Deutschen Buchhandels Volume 1]] (Geschichte des Deutschen Buchhandels bis in das siebzehnte Jahrhundert)'', Published by B\u00f6rsenvereins der Deutschen Buchh\u00e4ndler, Leipzig 1886; [[s:Geschichte des Deutschen Buchhandels Band 1/Neuntes Kapitel|Kapitel 9: Die B\u00fcchercensur und die Pre\u00dfverfolgungen]], p. 527\u2013535\n</ref>\n\n[[Pope Paul II]] (pontificate 1464-1471) confirmed the decree of [[James I of Aragon]] on the prohibition of Bibles in vernacular languages. Under [[Isabella I of Castile]] and her husband [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the printing of vernacular Bibles was prohibited in Spanish state law. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] which they instituted ordered the destruction of [[Hebrew literature#Medieval era|all Hebrew books]] and all vernacular Bibles in 1497. This was five years after the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]]. In 1498, the Inquisition stated that it was impossible to translate the Bible into a modern language without making mistakes that would plunge unskilled and especially [[Converso|new converts]] into doubts about faith.\n\nThe complete translation of the Bible into a Romance language,{{efn|sometimes credited as a \"first,\" though it follows the Waldensian New Testament}} a transfer of the Vulgate into [[Valencian]], was made by the [[Carthusians|Carthusian]] order general [[Bonifaci Ferrer]] (1355-1417) and was printed in 1478.

This authorization was approved by [[Pope Alexander VI]]. In several theological and non-theological books from this period a [[printing patent]] is included in the publications. From this time also printing patents of the [[Patriarch of Venice]] can be found. With the censorship of January 4, 1486 and an executive order of January 10, the Elector-Archbishop [[Berthold von Henneberg|Berthold von Henneberg]] of Mainz can be considered a pioneer in censorship regulation in the German-speaking countries for [[Mainz]], [[Erfurt]], and [[Frankfurt]]. His censorship decisions did not concern secular topics, but instead targeted specific religious texts, especially translations from Latin and Greek into the German. Berthold was of the opinion that the German language was too poor to reproduce the precise and well-formulated Latin and Greek texts. Up to this time no heretical writings had appeared printed in German, but since 1466 about ten relatively identical [[Bible translations into German#Pre-Lutheran German Bibles|German Bible translations]] were completed. He commented:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xctNDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA32&dq=%22Die+g%C3%B6ttliche+Buchdruckerkunst+macht+aller+Welt+den+Gebrauch+von+B%C3%BCchern%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqtq6q5ubhAhUDQq0KHTs9B2AQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Die%20g%C3%B6ttliche%20Buchdruckerkunst%20macht%20aller%20Welt%20den%20Gebrauch%20von%20B%C3%BCchern%22&f=false Fremde R\u00e4ume, Religionen und Rituale in Mandevilles \u203aReisen\u2039: Wahrnehmung] by Christina Henss, page 32</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Divine printing makes the use of books accessible to the world for instruction and edification.

The sacred laws and canons, however, are composed by wise and eloquent men with such great care and skill, and their understanding is so difficult that the duration of human life, even for the most discerning, is scarcely sufficient to cope with them. Nevertheless, some cheeky and ignorant people have dared to translate those writings into such poor ordinary German that even scholars are seduced by their work into great misunderstandings.}}\n\nFor every book translated into German, a license from certain university professors had to be obtained before distribution. Otherwise one would be excommunicated, the books would be confiscated and one would have to pay a fine of 100 gold [[florin]]s to the Elector-Archbishop. Due to a bull of [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]] from the year 1486 there was also a censorship authority set up involving the university in Cologne and operated by an official of the archbishop. [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] declared a preventive censorship with his bull of 1 June 1501. This extended to all the writings of the three religious electors [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Mainz]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Trier]] and the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Archdiocese of Magdeburg]], in which so many heretical books and treatises were printed. Pope [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] determined during the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] on May 3 , 1515, in the bull ''Inter Sollicitudines'', that in all dioceses all books or writings to be printed had to be carefully examined and approved by the [[inquisitor]], bishop, or a bishop commissioned by the bishop. In case of [[contravention]], punishment would be the loss of the books by public burning, a fine of a hundred [[ducat]]s payable to the [[protonotary apostolic]] in Rome, threatened with no hope of estate, deprivation of permission to write for a year, excommunication, and potentially the confiscation of one's estate upon death. [[Recidivism]] (\"if he is persistent\") could be dealt with by the offender's bishop by all legal means as [[Deterrence (penology)|deterrence ]] to others.\n\nIn 1490 a number of Hebrew Bibles and other Jewish books were burned in Andaluc\u00eda at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition.<ref>''The Spanish Inquisition'', Henry Kelsea, London, White Lion, 1965, p.98</ref>\n\n== 16th century ==\nFrom 1516 to 1535, [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam published several editions of his ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]]''. It was a double edition with both a new Latin version as well as the first print of the Greek text, which was reconstructed in a few places by [[Translation#Back-translation|back-translating]] Latin into Greek. In 1517 [[Martin Luther|Luther]] published his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''. In 1521 he was excommunicated with the bull ''[[Decet Romanum Pontificem]]'', declared a heretic, and issued the [[Edict of Worms]]. In 1522, the first translation of [[Luther Bible#Luther's New Testament translation|Luther's New Testament]] was published. It was translated on the basis of the Greek text of Erasmus. In 1534 the entire Holy Scripture was printed, completing the ''[[Luther Bible]]''.\n\nAt the [[Council of Trent]], both Luther's and Erasmus's writings were put on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''. Later printed copies of the index explicitly banned their Bibles as well as any prior editions and in general all similar Bible editions.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DyjGPgWjMmoC&pg=PP69&lpg=PP69&dq=\"Biblia+cum+recognitione+Martini+Luteri\"&s Index auctorum, et librorum, qui ab officio sanctae Rom. et vniuersalis] by the Congregazione dell'Inquisizione, 1559</ref><ref name=\"librorum1559\">\n[http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/ILP-1559.htm#New Testaments Index Librorum Prohibitorum \u2013 NOV.

Later, Erasmus was classified in a milder index class, and as a result later Catholic Bible translations were able to be based on Erasmus's Greek New Testament.\n\nThe [[Edict of Worms]] against Luther was not enforced throughout the empire. In 1523, at the [[Diets of Nuremberg|Reichstag in Nuremberg]] the papal nuncio [[Francesco Chieregati]] asked for the Holy Roman Empire to enforce the clause of the Lateran Council against printing any book without the permission of the local bishop or his representative. He also wanted the Edict of Worms to be enforced. Instead, on March 6, 1523, it was decreed that until the demanded church council could be held, local rulers themselves should ensure that no new writings were printed or sold in their territories unless they had been approved by reasonable men. Other writings, especially those of a insulting nature, were to be banned under severe punishment.\n\nLikewise, the Nuremberg Diet of 1524 determined that the imperial estates should \"obey as much as possible\" the Edict of Worms, and otherwise repeated the order of 1523. Pope Clement VII complained to the emperor and to the kings of England and France concerning the decision of 1523. In a letter dated July 15, 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] insisted that the Edict of Worms was to be enforced. But he dropped this demand at the 1526 [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]]. Instead it was decided on August 27 that, until the planned council, every imperial state in relation to the edict of Worms should \"live, govern and behave for itself, such as it hopes and trusts before God and the Emperor.\" \n\nThe 1529 [[Diet of Speyer (1529)|Diet of Speyer]] limited its decrees essentially to repeating the resolutions of 1523 Diet of Augsburg. On May 13, 1530 the papal nuncio gave the Emperor a memorandum which recommended that the Edict of Worms and the bull of Leo X was to be implemented by imperial decree and on pain of punishment. Following the [[Protestation at Speyer]] at the conclusion of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] on November 19, 1530, it was decided that nothing should be printed without specifying the printer and the printing location. The nuncio's request had failed.\n\nAs part of the 1541 [[Diet of Regensburg (1541)|Diet of Regensburg]] which set the terms of the [[Regensburg Interim]], the rule against publishing insults was repeated.\n\n=== England ===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of England changed his opinion about Bible translations multiple times. In a proclamation of 1530, he said that the [[prelate]]s, etc., believed there was no need to translate the Bible into English and put it into the hands of the ordinary people. The reading of Bible translations must be made dependent on the permission of the superiors. All printed English books concerning the Bible were banned and were to be delivered to the bishop within 14 days. New English books concerning Holy Scripture should not be printed without the permission of the bishop and the author. Yet after the danger of spreading heretical writings passes, the Bible ought to be translated. In the meantime, however, all English, French and Low German (including [[Dutch Low Saxon]]) versions must to be delivered to the bishop, with the exception of any books corrected by the king and the bishops.\n\nThe Tyndale translation, the only one so far printed, continued to be banned on the basis of translation errors, [[annotation]]s, and extensive prologue. In 1534, the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York|Canterbury Convocation]] requested that the king [[Royal commission|commission]] a new translation of the Bible by suitable persons and authorize the reading of the new translation. Although the king did not designate translators, new translations appeared from 1535 and afterwards. In 1536 and 1538 [[Thomas Cromwell]] prescribed that [[Myles Coverdale#Coverdale's Translation of the Bible: 1535|Coverdale]]'s translation of the Bible was to be placed in every church. These Bibles were to be printed in a large size and [[Chained library|chained]] to prevent theft. This translation came to be called the \"[[Great Bible]]\" or \"Chained Bible.\" In contrast, Henry VIII complained in 1539 that people were abusing their permission to read the Bible.\n\nRegulations of 1538 and 1539 provided that no one should sell English books without the King's permission and that no one should print or import English Bibles with comments and prefaces unless they have been verified by authorized agencies. In 1540, Thomas Cromwell was executed for heresy and treason. In 1542 the Convocation negotiated about the shortcomings of existing Bible translations and started a new translation. In 1543, the king again forbade the Tyndale Bible and ordered all annotations removed from all the Bibles and New Testaments. It was also determined that without the King's permission, the [[Social class in the United Kingdom#Early modern|lower classes]] would no longer be allowed to read the even non-forbidden translations. The basis for this was that if allowed to read the Bible, they would end up abusing their privilege. In 1546, the last year of Henry VIII's reign, it was again decreed that no foreign-language English books concerning Christianity should be printed without express permission.\n\n==== During reign of Mary I ====\nIn England, the provisions of the bull ''Inter Solicitudines''{{efn|The Italian Wikipedia has an article on ''[[:it:Inter Solicitudines|Inter Solicitudines]]''}} (1515) under the reign of the Roman Catholic Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in the \"Reformation Decrees\" of the papal legate Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] in 1556 were published. As various books of heresy, rebellion, and treachery were brought in from abroad and secretly printed in the land, in 1558 Mary I determined that owners of such books should be regarded as rebels and punished under the martial law.\n\n=== Council of Trent ===\nAt the [[Council of Trent]], the Vulgate was declared ''authentic'' and ''alone applicable''.<ref>([[:s:Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent/Session IV/Canonical Scriptures|Fourth session on April 8, 1546]])</ref> It was also decided that in the in future, books dealing with religious subjects could not be printed, sold, or even kept without the name of the author and the approval of a bishop. The [[Imprimatur#Catholic Church|imprimatur]] notice must be printed at the beginning of the book. Bishops may not charge fees for providing the services of examining and approving books. During the negotiations in March and April of 1546 it was also discussed whether it was not appropriate to ban Bible translations into the vernacular. [[Pierre Van Der Worst]], bishop of [[Acqui Terme|Acqui]] thought that if the untrained were to read the Bible, it could easily give rise to misunderstandings and errors. He thought it would be enough for the women and ordinary people to become acquainted with the doctrines of Scripture through [[Homily|sermons]] at church. Cardinal [[Pedro Pacheco de Villena]] believed that all Spanish and French and most Italian bishops were against vernacular Bible translations. He referred to Spain's longstanding ban on translations, to the ban in France and to the fact that the University of Paris, which had 150 doctors, had not only spoken out against Bible translations, but also explained that the authors of such translations are like heretics because translations are a source of many heresies. In Germany, a part of the population had been brought to [[Apostasy in Christianity#Penalties|apostasy]] through vernacular translations. On the other hand, Cardinal [[Cristoforo Madruzzo]] of Trent replied that it was not the German translations of the Bible but the professors of the Greek and Hebrew languages who were to blame for the confusion. A ban would make the worst impression in Germany. In the end, no decision was reached on March 17th. Pacheco requested on April 1 to reject all ancient translations except the Vulgate, including the [[Septuagint]] and all Bible translations by heretics. [[Pietro Bertani]], Bishop of Fano replied that the Church has always tolerated various translations and that even the heretical translations are not necessarily to be rejected, just as the early church did not reject the translations of [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]] and [[Theodotion]]. [[Bartolom\u00e9 Carranza]] reported that many bishops and theologians spoke out in favor of allowing Bible translations. His argument in favor of vernacular translations came from the common practice in Spain and other countries to publicly read and preach from Gospels and epistles in the vernacular during [[Fiesta patronal|festivals]]. As this had occurred without danger, why not also translate additional parts of the Bible? Yet still it would be best not to translate the whole Bible. The majority of the members of the Council agreed with him. Similarly, the [[Sorbonne#Paris Faculty of Theology|Paris Faculty of Theology]] expressed a similar opinion in 1526. As a result, Pacheco's claim was judged to be incorrect.\n\n=== ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' ===\nAround this time, the papal ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' began to be developed. At the 1548 [[Diet of Augsburg#Augsburg Interim|Diet of Augsburg]], which pronounced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]], the ordinance against insults was repeated and the previous provisions were extended to include the name of the author or poet. In addition, books were to be checked before printing by the \"ordinary authority of every place.\" There was a sentiment against that which was \"rebellious and [[:wikt:ignominious|ignominious]] or unruly or obnoxious to the Catholic Doctrine of the Holy Christian Church.\" The already printed books of Luther were to be suppressed. The Holy Roman Imperial [[Procurator fiscal|Fiscal]] official was to intervene against the offending authorities. After the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the Augsburg Interim and increased religious freedom by declaring ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'', the papal ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' was only observed as law in Catholic territories.\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\nIn the Netherlands up until 1550, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] issued a series of decrees intent on enforcing the 1521 [[Diet of Worms|Edict of Worms]]. He issued them by virtue of his sovereign power and did not refer to the decrees of the councils and popes. In contrast to his strictly secular method censorship, the [[Inquisition#Early Modern European history|Inquisition]] derived its ability to censor from papal authority. In addition to bans against individual authors and specific works, there was a language-related book ban against the translation of German, [[Flemish]], and French heresies into Dutch issued in 1526. Some general works of heretics were allowed to appear if the name was not mentioned. Additionally, individuals were allowed to possess Luther's writings in order to refute them. \n\nDuring the reign of [[Philip II of Spain]] (son of Charles V), the laws were not significantly expanded, although they were confirmed and honed. During his time the possession or reading of forbidden books was sufficient evidence that one was a heretic. Such heretics were usually allowed to save themselves by [[abjuration]] if it was a first offense. Punishments could include consequences to \"body or goods, according to circumstances\" (1524), [[exile]] (1526), and the death penalty (1529, 1531). The prescribed method of execution differed by sex. Men were have their heads placed on stakes following their beheading, while women were to be buried alive. Burning was only for [[Recidivism|recidivists]]. \n\nThe list of banned books grew over time. Relatively short untitled lists were produced in 1526, 1529 and 1540. There are also historical references to a condemnation catalogs issued by the [[KU Leuven|University of Leuven]] faculty in 1546 and 1550. Parts of these earlier lists of banned books were later incorporated into Spanish banned book catalogs and in the Roman index. It was suggested that in dangerous times, the heretical books in the lists were better not to be read and should not be given to the common people and young people. One consideration was the risk of these lists inadvertently advertising which books were subversive. A list in the Netherlands omitted books not found in the Netherlands so as not to draw attention to them. In addition, there was also a directory of books that could be used at schools. As for the Bibles, it was noted in the catalog of 1546 that in some, especially in French and German translations, the meaning was corrupted by misinterpretation or by additions or omissions.\n\nSome theological writings from this period were faulted for only pretending to follow the Vulgate while actually adding things in from the Greek. With respect to other writings, it was asserted that although the translation was good, the printers had added bad prefaces, notes, and so on. At times, summaries of the individual chapters and marginal notes were asserted to have errors in them.\n\nThe prohibited books catalog of 1546 contains 25 Latin Bibles and three Latin New Testaments, of German Bibles mostly the Antwerp editions, and two French Bibles as well as four French New Testaments from Antwerp. After a decree of April 29, 1550, lay people were forbidden to argue over the Scriptures. To preach concerning the Holy Scripture was only be granted to those authorized by the University or by the bishops. On September 25, an additional ordinance followed, saying that this prohibition would not apply to those who simply talked about Scripture according to the understanding of the church.\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn Spain, the inquisitors were forbidden in 1549 to grant permission to own or read forbidden books. The inquisitors themselves were not to read the forbidden books in their possession. Pope [[Pope Julius III|Julius III]] issued a bull in 1550 which abolished all previously granted authorizations to read banned books. This bull was also published in Spain. The Spanish catalog of 1551, which was inspired by the Leuven catalog ordered by Charles V, included among other things a general prohibition on all Bibles translated into the Spanish or other vernacular languages.\n\n=== France ===\nIn France, bans on certain books were published by the king or parliaments at the request of bishops or state-appointed inquisitors. Appraisals took over especially the [[Sorbonne]] . On March 18, 1521, at the request of the University of Paris, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] decreed that Parisian booksellers should not print new Latin or French books on the Christian faith before they had been examined by a theological faculty or deputies. In May 2, 1542, Parliament amended this regulation by stating that nothing should be printed without the approval of the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Roman Catholic Church|Rector]] and the [[Dean (education)|Dean]], and that the Rector should appoint two members from each faculty to examine the writings concerned. In 1569, Bibles and religious books were subject to approval by four doctors. Containers of imported books were only to be opened under official supervision. Beginning in 1551 with the [[Edict of Ch\u00e2teaubriant]], the import of religious books from [[Geneva]] or other places notoriously for heresy was forbidden. On August 26 , 1525, the Sorbonne, at Parliament's request, declared that a Bible translation used for the [[Book of hours|Horae Beatae Virginis Mariae]] of [[Sotie#cite_note-FLC-3|Mere sotte]] would not receive a printing permit. In accordance with earlier decisions of the faculty, it was decided on February 5, 1526 that it would be dangerous at all to publish translations of the Bible or biblical books and those already published should be better suppressed than tolerated.\n\nA rare exception was the Sorbonne's permission for a Pauline related gospel work in 1530, which was translated from Latin into French. From 1543 to 1556 there was a catalog of banned books at the Sorbonne. Later on, every bookstore was required to have a copy of this catalog available. There was also a general remark in the catalog: How dangerous it was to allow Bible translations in the vernacular to be read even by uneducated people and those who did not read them with a pious and humble spirit, as there were many now [[Waldensians|Waldenses]], [[Catharism|Albigensians]], etc. Therefore, considering the malice of the people in the present, the translation of the Bible into the vernacular should be regarded as dangerous and perishable.\n\nThe later Roman index was never used in France and an intended French index dating from 1562 was ultimately not published due to the''[[Edict of Beaulieu]]'' of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. In 1577 the provisions were changed in favor of the Protestants: \"No books may be sold without permission of our local officials or, as far as the so-called [[Calvinism|Reformed]] religion books are concerned, without the approval of the Chambers which we hold in the parliaments for the affairs of the form so-called Reformed. Forbidden is the printing and distribution of [[defamatory libel]]s.\"\n\nFrom the 16th through 18th centuries, a Bible smuggler's path led from [[Passau]] to the Slovenian border and [[Arnoldstein]] in Austria. Cattle drivers and dealers, merchants, and carters brought Bibles and hymnals into Austria, where they were used by [[Crypto-Protestantism|Crypto-Protestants]].\n\n=== General Rules in the ''Roman Index'' ===\n[[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (pontificate 1559-1565) also added general rules to the ''Index Romanus''. In the first printed and published version of 1559, there are 30 [[Bible translations into Latin|Latin editions of Scripture]], 10 New Testament editions, and two short general rules for Bibles in foreign languages. \n{{Quote|text=Biblia omnia vulgari idiomate, scilicet Germanico, Gallico, Hispanico, Italico, Anglico sive Flandrico, &c. conscripta, nullatenus vel imprimi, vel legi, vel teneri possint absque licentia sacri officii S.

[...] <br /> All New Testaments in the vernacular, in German, French, Italian, English or Flandrian language and more. may not be printed, read or kept without (written) permission of the Holy Office of the Roman and General Inquisition.}}\n\nAt the 18th meeting of the Council of Trent on 26 February 1562 it was decided to work out general indexing rules. On December 3rd or 4th, 1563, the Council decided to submit its proposal, the ''Decretum de indice librorum'', to the Pope for final adaptation. With the bull ''[[List of papal bulls#cite ref-McNamara_1-1|Dominici gregis custodiae]]'' the ''Index tridentinus'' was published on March 24, 1564 by the Pope. In it all the writings of all [[:wikt:heresiarch|heresiarchs]] (all Reformers) were included on the index, regardless of whether they contained theology, religious words, or descriptions of nature. Especially on Bibles, Rules 3 and 4 came into play. \n{{Quote|text='''REGULA III.'''<br />[1] Versiones scriptorum etiam ecclesiasticorum, quae hactenus editae sunt a damnatis auctoribus, modo nihil contra sanam doctrinam contineant, permittuntur.<br />[2] Librorum autem veteris Testamenti versiones, viris tantum doctis et piis, judicio Episcopi concedi poterunt, modo hujusmodi versionibus, tanquam elucidationibus Vulgatae editionis, ad intelligendam sacram Scripturam, non autem tamquam sacro textu, utantur.<br />[3] Versiones vero novi Testamenti ab auctoribus primae classis hujus Indicis factae, nemini concedantur, quia utilitatis parum, periculi vero plurimum lectoribus ex earum lectione manare solet.<br />[4] Si quae vero adnotationes cum hujusmodi, quae permittuntur, versionibus, vel cum Vulgata editione circumferuntur, expunctis locis suspectis a Facultate Theologica alicujus Universitatis catholicae, aut Inquisitione generali, permitti eisdem poterunt, quibus et versiones.<br />[5] Quibus conditionibus totum volumen Bibliorum, quod vulgo Biblia Vatabli dicitur, aut partes ejus, concedi viris piis et doctis poterunt.<br />[6] Ex Bibliis vero Isidori Clarii Brixiani prologus et prolegomena praecidantur; ejus vero textum, nemo textum Vulgatae editionis esse existimet.}}\n\n{{Quote|text='''Rule 3.'''<br />The translations of older ecclesiastical writers (for example, Church Fathers) published by authors of the first class are allowed if they do not oppose the sound doctrine.

On the other hand, translations [in Latin] of the New Testament are not to be permitted by first-class authors, because reading them does not bring much benefit to the readers. Instead, such translations pose much danger. ommentaries by First Class authors, on the condition they are associated with such Old Testament or Vulgate translations, may be allowed for use by pious and learned men after theologically suspect men have been dealt with by theological faculties or the Roman Inquisition. This is especially true of the so-called Bible of the [[Fran\u00e7ois Vatable|Vatablus]].

The counselor or confessor may permit the reading of such translations when they realize that reading such translations can bring no harm, but instead will augment faith and piety.\n\nThis permission should be given in writing. He who reads or has read a Bible in the vernacular without such permission should not be able to receive absolution from his sins until he has delivered the Bible translation to the bishop. Booksellers who sell or otherwise procure Bibles in the vernacular to those who lack permission shall \nbe required to pay for books for the bishop to use for religious purposes. Other punishments may be given according to the nature of the offense, with penalties that expire at a set time. Members of [[Religious order (Catholic)|Religious order]]s may not read and buy such Bibles without the permission of their superiors.<ref name=\"reusch1\" />}}\n\nThe rules were reprinted in each version until the reform in 1758. Believers were forbidden to make, read, own, buy, sell or give away these books on the basis of excommunication.<ref name=\"wolfBuch\">\nHubert Wolf: ''Index: der Vatikan und die verbotenen B\u00fccher'', C.H.Beck, 2007, {{ISBN|3-406-54778-8}}, p. 27\u201334, 218 pages</ref>\n\nAt the Diet of Speyer in 1570 it was decreed that every printer should be sworn in on the Reichstag regulations. A similar provision can be found in the Reich Police Order (Reichspolizei-Ordnung){{efn|For more on the Reichspolizei, see the German language article: [[:de:Polizeibegriff in Deutschland#Der Polizeibegriff im geschichtlichen Wandel|Polizeibegriff in Deutschland \u00a7 Der Polizeibegriff im geschichtlichen Wandel]]}} of 1577, however, \"nothing unruly and obscenely should be printed,\" according to the Christian general doctrine and the religious peace called for at Augsburg. [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] (pontificate 1585-1590) replaced the general rules of the ''Index Romanus''. In its seventh rule it stated: {{Quote|text=Bibles or parts of Bibles translated into vernacular, even by Catholics, are nowhere permitted without the special permission of the Apostolic See. Paraphrases in the vernacular are strictly prohibited.}}\n[[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] confirmed in a bull of October 17, 1595, in principle, the old general rules, but made the fourth rule more restrictive by adding to it. This restored the provision of Paul IV that dispensation could only be granted on behalf of the Pope or the Roman Inquisition: {{Quote|text=this rule does not renew authority to bishops, inquisitors, or superiors, permission to buy, read or possess Bibles or parts of the Old or New Testament, or summaries and historical [[Compendium|compendia]] of the Bible or biblical books in the vernacular, having been deprived of this mandate by the mandate and custom of the Roman Inquisition.}}\n\nWith this addition, the rule remained valid until 1758. How it was dealt with in each country was different. In a Catholic country like Bavaria it was state law. In particular, booksellers had their licenses revoked for violating it. In contrast, in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], a refuge of Protestantism, the index functioned more like a blacklist. But it also found application in elite Catholic schools in secularized France until the 20th century.

[[Pope Alexander VII|Alexander VII]] (pontificate 1655-1667) insisted on the fourth rule in his 1664 index and added all Bible translations - in whatever language - to the index.

In the eighteenth century, attempts were made to move away from individual dispensations; now, any Bible translation approved by a competent ecclesiastical authority should generally be considered as lawful for all laymen. This broad interpretation of the fourth index rule was followed in 1757 by Benedict XIV. (This lasted until 1836.)\n\nA later regulation of the Roman book censorship of 1757 permitted only translations with explanatory notes taken from the Fathers of the Church and with papal approval.\n\n=== Punishments against violators ===\nAs part of a program of persecution against the [[Salzburg Protestants]], in 1731, [[Leopold Anton von Firmian]] \u2013 [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] as well as its temporal ruler as Count, ordered the wholesale seizure and burning of all Protestant books and Bibles.<ref>[https://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=561 Catholics Cleanse Salzburg of Protestants]</ref>\n\nOn May 27, 1747 Jakob Schmidlin (\"Sulzijoggi\") was hanged as the leading head of a Bible movement in the canton of [[Lucerne]] in Galgenw\u00e4ldli on the [[Emme (river)|Emme]].

Of over 100 co-defendants of this movement (from [[Ruswil]], [[Wolhusen]], [[Werthenstein]], [[Menznau]], [[Malters]], [[Kriens]], and [[Udligenswil]]), 82 of them were also punished, mostly with perpetual [[Exile|banishment]]. Since the Bible was at the center of this  movement and violations of censorship rules against the use and possession of Bibles was one of the offenses committed by the convicted, after the trial the authorities issued a decree that included a general prohibition on laymen having Bibles:<ref name=\"stadtmission\">\n{{Cite Web|url=http://www.stadtmission-luzern.ch/ueber-uns/geschichte-der-stadtmission.html |title=Die Geschichte der Stadtmission Luzern \u2013 Die Anf\u00e4nge der Stadtmission verkn\u00fcpft mit dem letzten M\u00e4rtyrer der Schweiz und einem Bibelverbot |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115065327/http://stadtmission-luzern.ch/ueber-uns/geschichte-der-stadtmission.html |archive-date=January 15, 2013}}\n</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=We also want to prohibit all and each of our subjects, who are not taught, not only from selling the uncatholic and forbidden books, but also good Bibles and their distribution in anyway.

It says: \n\n{{Quote|text=We have long abhorred this shameful enterprise that undermines the true foundation of religion. \n\nBy consulting all the cardinals in obedience to the rules of our Church, with the utmost care and attention paid to the rules formulated at [[Meuse]] to discover and exterminate this plague in every way, we have shown that the Bible printed by heretics is among those forbidden under the regulations of the ''Index'', (Section 50, Rule 4). In fact, experience has proved that the sacred writing, when used in the vernacular, has caused more harm than good due to the recklessness of men. (Rule 4) It is therefore necessary to renew the salutary resolution of June, 13th, 1757, which prohibits all translations of the Holy Scriptures into the national languages, except those approved by the Apostolic See and published with notes from the Works of the Holy Fathers.}}\n\nThe ''Epistola encyclica'' of May 3, 1824 by [[Pope Leo XII|Leo XII]] also did not exhibit any liberal attitudes.\n\nIn 1836, [[Pope Gregory XVI|Gregory XVI]] eliminated the relief made back in 1757.

After the revival of the [[Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Papal States]], the government sealed the New Testaments, which were in the possession of the American ambassador. The police checked daily to see if the seals were still intact. After some time, the government purchased the Bibles in order to burn them gradually.\n\nDuring this time, persons entering the Papal States could have their individual personal Bibles seized at the border. Most notably, editions of [[Giovanni Diodati]] were targeted for enforcement. Violators could go to jail for a short time. The papal legate and the Minister of Finance expressed regret over the events. There were also house searches.\n\nIn 1851 at [[Nice]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia#Savoyard struggle for the Italian unification|Kingdom of Sardinia]], several boxes of French Bible boxes were impounded in the Customs House. The Minister of the Interior had no objections to releasing the Bibles, but the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nice#Modern Bishops|Bishop of Nice]] disagreed. \n\nThe situation in Nice was very different from the situation in the Duchy of Tuscany. The duchy had a reputation for being liberal during the rule of [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II]], even prior to 1849. There were three Protestant churches within the duchy: one English, one Scottish and one French. The French Protestant church held fairs in the Italian language. After the brief period during the republic the subsequent counter-revolution, the liberal climate changed to conservative. On May 18, 1849, 3,000 copies of a Catholic [[Bible translations into Italian|Italian translation of the Bible]] were confiscated and burned under the orders of [[Antonio Martini]], the Archbishop of Florence, even though they had been printed with permission. Persecution of Protestants increased. In 1851, services in Italian were outlawed. The possession of a Protestant Italian Bible alone was considered sufficient evidence for conviction. The most prominent prisoner was Count Piero Guicciardini, who was arrested with six others. They had met on May 7, 1851, the day before his voluntary departure for religious exile, and read the Scriptures together. He was therefore sentenced to six months imprisonment for blasphemy, which was then converted into exile.<ref name=\"waldegrave\">\nSamuel Waldegrave: ''Italien (Aus einer Rede des Herrn Sam.

Of the Prohibited Books of Apostates, Heretics, Schismatics, and Other Writers\n\n1. All books condemned before the year 1600 by the Sovereign Pontiffs, or by Ecumenical Councils, and which are not recorded in the new Index, must be considered as condemned in the same manner that have formerly been, with the exception of such as are presently permitted by General Decrees. 2. The books of apostates, heretics, schismatics, and all writers whatsoever, defending heresy or schism, or in any way attacking the foundations of Religion, are altogether prohibited. 3. Moreover, the books of non-Catholics, [[:wikt:ex professo|ex professo]] treating of Religion, are prohibited, unless they clearly contain nothing contrary to Catholic Faith. 4. The books of the above-mentioned writers, not treating ex professo of Religion, but only touching incidentally upon the Truths of Faith, are not to be considered as prohibited by Ecclesiastical Law unless proscribed by special Decree.\n\nCHAPTER II. Of Editions of the Original Text of Holy Scripture and of Versions not in the Vernacular\n\n5. Editions of the Original Text and of the ancient Catholic versions of Holy Scripture, as well as those of the Eastern Church, if published by non-Catholics, even though apparently edited in a faithful and complete manner, are allowed only to those engaged in Theological and Biblical Studies, provided also that the Dogma of Catholic Faith are not impugned in the [[:wikt:prolegomenon#English|Prolegomena]] or Annotations. 6. In the same manner and under the same conditions, other versions of the Holy Bible published by non-Catholics, whether in Latin or in any other [[Extinct language|dead language]], are permitted.}}\n\nThe biblical imprints of Leander van Ess {{efn|that is, for [http://www.sacredbible.org/vulgate1822/index.htm his printing] of the [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate]]}} broke the requirement of Chapter II, even though the text contained an old approbation, due to the fact the translation was printed without notes. The first issue with annotations from 1820 was added to the Index of Prohibited Books.\n\nAnother example of an author who violated ''[[Officiorum ac Munerum]]'' is Franz Stephan Griese, {{efn|See [[:de:Franz Stephan Griese|Franz Stephan Griese]] (article in German)}} who in 1919 printed without permission ''The Letters of St. Paul'' (which contained his translation of the letters) in [[Paderborn]], Germany.

He applied himself seriously to his schoolwork and excelled in mathematics and French. He went to church often, and impressed with his energy and eagerness to learn, some of the priests encouraged Thomas to go on to seminary school once he finished primary school.

Thomas's decision to continue his education at the nearest [[lyc\u00e9e]] Ouezzin Coulibaly (named after a preindependence nationalist) proved to be a turning point. This step got him out of his father's household since the lyc\u00e9e was in Bobo-Dioulasso, the country's commercial centre.

It was also seen by young intellectuals as a national institution that might potentially help to discipline the inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy, counterbalance the inordinate influence of traditional chiefs and generally help modernize the country.

The trainee officers were taught by civilian professors in the social sciences. Adama Tour\u00e9, who taught history and geography and was known for having progressive ideas, even though he did not publicly share them, was the academic director at the time.

All regions of the country were soon connected by a vast road- and rail-building program. Over {{Convert|700|km|abbr=on}} of rail was laid by Burkinab\u00e9 people to facilitate manganese extraction in \"The Battle of the Rails\" without any foreign aid or outside money.<ref name=\"UprightDVD\"/> These programs were an attempt to prove that African countries could be prosperous without foreign help or aid.\nSankara also launched education programs to help combat the country's 90% illiteracy rate.

Sankara recognized the challenges faced by African women when he gave his famous address to mark International Women's Day on 8 March 1987 in Ouagadougou. Sankara spoke to thousands of women in a highly political speech in which he stated that the Burkinab\u00e9 Revolution was \"establishing new social relations\" which would be \"upsetting the relations of authority between men and women and forcing each to rethink the nature of both.

He applied himself seriously to his schoolwork and excelled in mathematics and French. He went to church often, and impressed with his energy and eagerness to learn, some of the priests encouraged Thomas to go on to seminary school once he finished primary school. Despite initially agreeing, he took the exam required for entry to the sixth grade in the secular educational system and passed. Thomas's decision to continue his education at the nearest [[lyc\u00e9e]] Ouezzin Coulibaly (named after a preindependence nationalist) proved to be a turning point. This step got him out of his father's household since the lyc\u00e9e was in Bobo-Dioulasso, the country's commercial centre. At the lyc\u00e9e, Sankara made close friends, including Fid\u00e8le Too, whom he later named a minister in his government; and Soumane Tour\u00e9, who was in a more advanced class.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nHis [[Roman Catholic]] parents wanted him to become a priest, but he chose to enter the [[Military of Burkina Faso|military]]. The military was popular at the time, having just ousted a [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo|despised president]]. It was also seen by young intellectuals as a national institution that might potentially help to discipline the inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy, counterbalance the inordinate influence of traditional chiefs and generally help modernize the country. Besides, acceptance into the military academy would come with a scholarship; Sankara could not easily afford the costs of further education otherwise.

The trainee officers were taught by civilian professors in the social sciences. Adama Tour\u00e9, who taught history and geography and was known for having progressive ideas, even though he did not publicly share them, was the academic director at the time. He invited a few of his brightest and more political students, among them Sankara, to join informal discussions about [[imperialism]], [[neocolonialism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]], the [[Russian Revolution|Soviet]] and [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese revolutions]], the [[liberation movement]]s in Africa and similar topics outside of the classroom.

The coup d'\u00e9tat was supported by [[Libya]], which was at the time on the verge of war with France in [[Chad]] (see [[history of Chad]]).\n\nSankara saw himself as a revolutionary and was inspired by the examples of [[Cuba]]'s [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] and [[Ghana]]'s military leader [[Jerry Rawlings]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} As President, he promoted the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" (''R\u00e9volution d\u00e9mocratique et populaire'', or RDP). The ideology of the Revolution was defined by Sankara as [[anti-imperialist]] in a speech of 2 October 1983, the ''Discours d'orientation politique'' (DOP), written by his close associate [[Val\u00e8re Som\u00e9]]. His policy was oriented toward fighting corruption, promoting reforestation, averting famine and making education and health real priorities.\n\nOn the first anniversary of his accession in 1984, he renamed the country [[Burkina Faso]], meaning \"the land of upright people\" in [[Mossi language|Mor\u00e9]] and [[Dyula language|Dyula]], the two major languages of the country.

In one week, 2.5 million Burkinab\u00e9 were vaccinated.<ref name=\"UprightDVD\"/>{{Better source needed|date=October 2019}} Sankara's administration was also the first African government to publicly recognize the [[AIDS]] epidemic as a major threat to Africa.<ref>''HIV/AIDS, illness, and African well-being'', by Toyin Falola & Matthew M.

Brick factories were created to help build houses in effort to end urban slums.<ref name=\"africanagenda.net\"/> In an attempt to fight deforestation, The People's Harvest of Forest Nurseries was created to supply 7,000 village nurseries, as well as organizing the planting of several million trees. All regions of the country were soon connected by a vast road- and rail-building program. Over {{Convert|700|km|abbr=on}} of rail was laid by Burkinab\u00e9 people to facilitate manganese extraction in \"The Battle of the Rails\" without any foreign aid or outside money.<ref name=\"UprightDVD\"/> These programs were an attempt to prove that African countries could be prosperous without foreign help or aid.\nSankara also launched education programs to help combat the country's 90% illiteracy rate. These programs had some success in the first few years. However, wide-scale teacher strikes, coupled with Sankara's unwillingness to negotiate, led to the creation of \"Revolutionary Teachers\". In an attempt to replace the nearly 2,500 teachers fired over a strike in 1987, anyone with a college degree was invited to teach through the revolutionary teachers program.

The courts were created originally to try former government officials in a straightforward way so the average [[Demographics of Burkina Faso|Burkinab\u00e9]] could participate in or oversee trials of enemies of the revolution.<ref name=\"UprightDVD\"/> They placed defendants on trial for corruption, tax evasion or \"counter-revolutionary\" activity.

The CDRs were created as a counterweight to the power of the army as well as to promote political and social revolution.

Sankara recognized the challenges faced by African women when he gave his famous address to mark International Women's Day on 8 March 1987 in Ouagadougou. Sankara spoke to thousands of women in a highly political speech in which he stated that the Burkinab\u00e9 Revolution was \"establishing new social relations\" which would be \"upsetting the relations of authority between men and women and forcing each to rethink the nature of both. This task is formidable but necessary\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category/features/89359|title=Revisiting Thomas Sankara, 26 years later - Pambazuka News|website=pambazuka.net}}</ref> Furthermore, Sankara was the first African leader to appoint women to major cabinet positions and to recruit them actively for the military.<ref name=\"UprightDVD\"/>\n\n=== Second Agacher strip war ===\nIn 1985, Burkina Faso organised a general population census.

According to Christian Morrisson and Jean-Paul Azam of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the \"climate of urgency and drastic action in which many punishments were carried out immediately against those who had the misfortune to be found guilty of unrevolutionary behaviour, bore some resemblance to what occurred in the worst days of the [[French Revolution]], during the [[Reign of Terror]].
