In 1945, the Kaiser Permanente health plan was opened to the public, providing the opportunity of affordable health care to the residents of Fontana.  Following the end of World War II, as the steel mill and community continued to grow, the demand rapidly outgrew the small facility, and in 1955, the hospital was moved to its current location on Sierra Ave.  It has undergone an almost constant pace of expansion and remodel to reach its current state, with major expansions about once a decade; it now contains over 400 beds, houses over 150 doctors, and employs 6000.\n\n== New construction ==\nIn 2009, construction started on a 'replacement hospital' on the Fontana Campus.

{"title_page": "KSB Hospital", "text_new": "'''Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital'''<ref>[http://www.ksbhospital.com KSB Hospital]</ref> is a [[hospital]] in [[Dixon, Illinois]].  KSB Hospital is an 80-bed [[acute care]] facility providing comprehensive ancillary services, including emergency medicine, obstetrics, inpatient psychiatry, a cardiovascular laboratory, outpatient surgery, inpatient surgery, and intensive care, among others.\n\n==History==\nIn May 1895 Judge [[Solomon Hicks Bethea]] purchased land for $3,500 and gave it to the City of Dixon for the establishment of a hospital in the memory of his wife, [[Katherine Shaw Bethea]], who in her short lifetime had been deeply interested in the establishment of a hospital for Dixon, and during her last illness frequently expressed the wish that such work might be accomplished in the near future.\n\nOn May 27, 1895, Mayor Charles H. Hughes informed the City Council of this gift.  An ordinance was passed to establish and maintain a hospital for the use and benefit of the citizens of Dixon.  This ordinance, dated November 1, 1895, also stated that the Mayor, with the approval of the City Council, appoint a board of nine women directors chosen from the citizens at large, which would be authorized to accept the donations of money and real or personal property in the name of the hospital.\n\nThe hospital began its activities January 5, 1897 with 17 beds.  The funds for the first building, which cost $7,250, were raised by individuals, churches, and city organizations.\n\nIn 1909 Judge Bethea died, leaving his Palmyra farmlands to the hospital as an endowment.\n\nShortly after the hospital was opened, the KSB Hospital School for Nurses began educating young women who studied for a three-year term to become registered nurses.\n\nIn 1913 a third story and an addition was added creating a 40-bed capacity.  This was financed by Miss Elizabeth Shaw, sister of Katherine Shaw Bethea, and one of the first hospital board members.\n\nIn 1925, the Nurses Home, providing housing for 25 nurses, was built at a cost of $38,000.\n\nAnother addition was built in 1926 at a cost of $47,000, enlarging the hospital to a 60-bed capacity and adding two solaria for the comfort and enjoyment of patients.\n\nThe generosity of Dr. Samuel Houston of Polo and the perseverance of the board members, under the able leadership of Mrs. W. H. Coppins, made possible the 1941 addition which cost $130,000. This provided 13 new private rooms, 4 semi\u2011private rooms, two additional five-bed wards, a nursery, an operating room, an x\u2011ray room, and kitchen and dining rooms.  This addition brought KSB Hospital to an 89-bed capacity.\n\nIn November 1957, the board authorized a $1,250,000 hospital expansion program and launched a drive for $750,000 in public subscriptions to finance the major portion of the project.  A half\u2011million dollars in capital funds was already in hand from Miss Bess P. Eells, Miss Helen Brinton, the Ford Foundation and other gifts and bequests which had been accumulated over a period of years.\n\nThis project was completed in 1960 and provided 44 desperately needed beds plus space for central supply, laboratory, x\u2011ray, operating rooms, recovery rooms, kitchen, dining room, and laundry.\n\nIn 1967, it once again became necessary to expand the facilities. The 1970 addition increased hospital capacity by 80 beds and remodeled the 1941 building.  This project was financed by $365,000 of hospital reserve funds in conjunction with a $2.2 million in bonds issued through B.C. Ziegler and Company.\n\nThe 1970s also saw the establishment of many modern service lines. A twenty-four-hour emergency room began operations in July 1971. In March 1972, the first male member of the Board of Directors was sworn in, and the board completed the sale of the 698-acre Bethea farm in Palmyra in October 1972. A seven-bed intensive care unit opened in February 1972, and a $2 million clinic was opened and occupied by early physicians with the Medical Arts Clinic in July 1977. March 1978 saw the opening of the 17-bed inpatient psychiatric unit.\n\nIn 1988, KSB Hospital purchased Commerce Towers and soon after constructed a walkway over Crawford Street to connect the building to the hospital.  Physician offices and Materials Management were the first to occupy the new space.\n\nIn January 1989 a new emergency room was opened at the far west end of the hospital, and included a two-stall ambulance garage.  The ER had four treatment bays, two trauma bays and a new x-ray room.\n\nThe spring of 1990 brought a newly remodeled cafeteria and vending machine area.  In 1991, the psychiatry unit was downsized from 26 beds to 16 beds and moved from 3rd floor west to 2nd floor east.  The new psychiatry unit featured improved safety and security features for patients and employees, and included a new eating area, therapy facilities, video monitoring, outside patio, patient lounge, and an isolation room.\n\nBy 1991, the Medical Arts Clinic, founded by Dr. E. S. Murphy and Dr. J. G. McFetridge had grown into a multi-speciality group of more than twenty physicians and had outgrown the 1977 addition.  MAC moved to a large office building downtown that had been built for the USF&G Insurance Company.  The space vacated by MAC was renamed The Annex and became home to several hospital departments, including Medical Records, Patient Accounts, Accounting, Education, Human Resources, Data Processing, Medical Staff, Administration, and included a physician lounge, library, a renal dialysis unit, and space for the Red Cross and Lee County Volunteer Care Clinic.\n\nIn 1992 the Holly and Avis Campbell Surgical Wing was opened.  After nearly two years of construction, this 7,500-square-foot addition offered three new large operating suites and one single use cystoscopy suite for urological procedures. The Campbell estate of $6 million has remained as the single largest bequest in KSB Hospital history. The surgical wing addition also provided for a dedicated heliport. Prior to the opening of the heliport, traffic was halted and cars were moved for each flight to allow helicopters to land at street level near the front entrance.\n\nIn 1995 the Obstetrics and Nursery units were remodeled and downsized from 11 traditional beds to 7 private birthing suites. The new suites offer a private bath, sleep-in area for family, and a large space for visitors.\n\nIn April 1995 Respiratory Therapy, located on 2nd floor just outside the birthing center, moved into newly renovated space on 3rd floor center.  This new space included larger staff areas and offices plus new areas for EEG\u2019s and pulmonary tests.  A Sleep Lab was added to the Respiratory Therapy area in 1998.\n\nIn 1996 KSB Hospital opened its first outpatient facility in Oregon, in a new 13,000 square foot building on a 2.5 acre lot at the corner of Route 64 and West Washington Street.  Antreas Mesrobian M.D., who had practiced in the Warmolts Clinic since 1978, was joined in the Oregon Clinic by Mark Myers M.D., an Oregon native, in 1997, and by Greg Reckamp M.D. in 1998.\n\nIn October 1996 the north half of 3rd floor of Commerce Towers was renovated for a new venture, the Sports and Occupational Medicine Center. This 13,000-square-foot space was staffed by Drs. Gregg Grubb, Philip Zinni, Jon Ortman and Susan Gould and soon had more than 100 local corporations under contract. This department also provided athletic trainers, physical therapists and physicians free to many local school athletic programs.\n\nIn 1997, KSB Hospital purchased the substance abuse service line from Rockford Memorial Hospital and renamed it the KSB Recovery Center.  This service was expanded in 1998 another recovery center was opened on North Galena in Dixon.  Also in 1997, the KSB Adult Day Care Center was opened in the lower level of Edwards Clinic.\n\nA network of clinics was developed with the construction of the Polo Clinic in 1999, the Amboy Clinic in 2002, the opening of the Ashton Clinic in 2001, and the purchase of Edwards Clinic in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, the laboratory was renovated and a new CT and MRI machines were purchased by the Medical Imaging department.\n\nIn 2003, KSB Hospital was recognized by Arbor Associates for Highest Overall Patient Satisfaction, scoring 96.8% satisfaction, the highest score among all hospitals Arbor surveyed.\n\nIn 2004, KSB Hospital purchased Town Square Centre and its primary tenant the Medical Arts Clinic in a $3.8 million deal that added eleven MAC physicians to the KSB Medical Group and significantly expanded hospital property holdings.  In July 2004, the first two residents from the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford began work at KSB Hospital as a part of the newly formed Dixon Rural Training Track.  Also in 2004, the KSB Foot and Ankle Center opened in Commerce Towers, staffed by Dr. Michael Wessels and Dr. David Yeager.\n\nA new parking lot was added in 2005, on the site formerly occupied by a house for students and interns.\n\nIn June 2006, the KSB Cardiovascular Services Lab opened, offering a facility for minimally invasive vascular and cardiac cath services.\n\nIn 2007, a major excavation and construction project brought a two-level parking deck to the front of KSB Hospital.\n\nA new MRI was purchased in 2008 that offered more space for patients and better quality images for physicians. Because of its size and weight, a hole was cut into the wall of the MRI room and a crane hoisted the machine into place. At the same time, a new elevator was added to the west end of the hospital, serving the basement through 4th floor.\n\nAlso in 2008, KSB Hospital began installation of a computerized nurse documentation system, the first in a series of software products necessary for electronic health records.\n\nIn 2010, the sleep lab was renovated and expanded in Commerce Towers, and, in October, half of a new emergency department was completed and opened.  Crawford Street south of 1st Street was vacated by the City of Dixon and closed to traffic to allow KSB Hospital to level off and build a new parking lot for the emergency department.\n\nThe $16 million expansion of outpatient surgery and the emergency department was completed in the fall of 2011.  The expansion included two new surgical suites, recovery rooms, registration and reception areas, new emergency department rooms and trauma bays, and a new three-stall ambulance garage.\n\nIn 2011, KSB Hospital received the Outstanding Patient Experience Award from HealthGrades, in which KSB scored in the top 5% of more than 3,700 U.S. hospitals surveyed. In August, KSB Hospital conducted an employee and found 86.2% satisfaction on a survey in which 94% of employees participated\u2014both percentages were benchmarks among all hospitals in the survey pool.  KSB Medical Group was also awarded by Arbor Associates for exceeding patient expectations in the medical office setting.\n\n==Today==\nKSB Hospital provides healthcare services in nine locations in the Sauk Valley area.<ref>[http://www.ksbhospital.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=69&Itemid=80 Locations]</ref> \nKSB Hospital, Commerce Towers,  Town Square Centre, Edwards Clinic, KSB Eye & Vision Center, KSB Center for Health Services - Amboy Clinic, KSB - Ashton Clinic,  KSB Center for Health Services - Oregon Clinic, KSB Center for Health Services - Polo Clinic,\n\n==Mission statement==\nThe mission of Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital is \"to restore, maintain, and enhance health by providing superior care now and in the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ksbhospital.com/about_ksb_overview.htm |title=Mission Statement of KSB Hospital |access-date=2007-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024120150/http://www.ksbhospital.com/about_ksb_overview.htm |archive-date=2007-10-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Coord|41|50|40|N|89|28|47|W|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1897]]\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1960]]\n[[Category:Hospitals in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Dixon, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Lee County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:1897 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "'''Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital'''<ref>[http://www.ksbhospital.com KSB Hospital]</ref> is a [[hospital]] in [[Dixon, Illinois]].

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died of a severe illness shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a [[wild goose chase]] and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |work=Pixar Post |access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> The gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]], which had forced most movie theaters to shut down within several weeks after Onward's release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/ |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |first= Scott |last= Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died of a severe illness shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements.

Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a [[wild goose chase]] and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |work=Pixar Post |access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act.
