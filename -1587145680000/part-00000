The heads of all six Linkin Park members are kept in a digital lab equipped with computers and advanced equipment which can be seen extracting something from the heads as [[Chester Bennington]] and [[Mike Shinoda]] sing. According to [[Joe Hahn|Mr. Hahn]], the band members' heads are powering the world. At the very end of the video, the commander of the alien race tries to battle the blue tentacles that were released by the members' heads, but gets his gun ripped out of his hand, and is enveloped by them.\n\nDirector Joe Hahn explained that the events of the video took place after the end of the human race and all that's left are the heads of the six Linkin Park members. The video is also said to have been inspired by the dream sequences in the 2001 film ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''. The music video was aired on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] block as a commercial break (around the year 2002). There is also a video for \"Points of Authority\" from ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'' which contains footage of the band playing live. It is featured on the DVD ''[[Frat Party at the Pankake Festival]]''.\n\nAnother video features the live performance of \"Points of Authority\" from Linkin Park's live album ''[[Live in Texas (Linkin Park album)|Live in Texas]]''. The Live in Texas version is available on [[iTunes]], along with [[Lying from You]]. The \"Points of Authority\" video was not officially uploaded on YouTube by Linkin Park or [[Warner Bros.

On the music video, the long note cuts off.\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n|all_writing = Linkin Park\n|headline = \"Pts.OF.Athrty\"\n|title1  = Pts.OF.Athrty\n|length1 = 3:36\n|title2  = Buy Myself (remix of By Myself by Marilyn Manson)\n|writer2 = Linkin Park\n|length2 = 4:26\n|title3  = H!

The heads of all six Linkin Park members are kept in a digital lab equipped with computers and advanced equipment which can be seen extracting something from the heads as [[Chester Bennington]] and [[Mike Shinoda]] sing. According to [[Joe Hahn|Mr. Hahn]], the band members' heads are powering the world. At the very end of the video, the commander of the alien race tries to battle the blue tentacles that were released by the members' heads, but gets his gun ripped out of his hand, and is enveloped by them.\n\nDirector Joe Hahn explained that the events of the video took place after the end of the human race and all that's left are the heads of the six Linkin Park members. The video is also said to have been inspired by the dream sequences in the 2001 film ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''. The music video was aired on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] block as a commercial break (around the year 2002). There is also a video for \"Points of Authority\" from ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'' which contains footage of the band playing live. It is featured on the DVD ''[[Frat Party at the Pankake Festival]]''.\n\nAnother video features the live performance of \"Points of Authority\" from Linkin Park's live album ''[[Live in Texas (Linkin Park album)|Live in Texas]]''. The Live in Texas version is available on [[iTunes]], along with [[Lying from You]]. The \"Points of Authority\" video was not officially uploaded on YouTube by Linkin Park or [[Warner Bros.

Bharathiraja]]. The film stars primarily newcomers such as [[S. Rajasekar|Rajasekaran]], [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]], [[Nizhalgal Ravi|Ravi]], [[Chandrasekhar (Tamil actor)|Chandrasekhar]] and Suvitha. The film's crew too contained a host of newcomers including the lyricist [[Vairamuthu]] and [[Manivannan]], both would later go on to become an established lyricist and a director respectively.\n\nThe film revolves around a group of youngsters and their struggles to overcome the challenges faced by them in society. Though a commercial failure, the film was screened at the \"Indian Panorama\" section of the [[International Film Festival of India]] in 1981. The same year it won two awards at the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nGopi and Hari, two unemployed graduates, share a room and live together in Madras. While Gopi is looking for a job, Hari aspires to become a music composer in the film industry. They both manage to make ends meet with the help of their friends. Their neighbour is Prabhu, a college-going student who spends all the time in smoking, painting and singing. A new family relocates to their apartment. The couple have a daughter Maha. Prabhu and Maha both study in the same college and become good friends. Prabhu decided to apprentice under a Veena expert. Much to his disappointment, the expert dies before he joins the class.\n\nGopi takes tuition for Maha and they both fall in love. During this time, Gopi, Hari, and Prabhu get arrested for some reason. Maha pledges her chain and takes them out on bail. In an attempt to reform, Prabhu goes to meet his college principal, but gets dismissed from the college. He gets scolded by his father, but Maha becomes very supportive to him. Prabhu assumes that she loves him. During this time Maha's parents force her to discontinue her tuition as a few of their relatives suspect she and Gopi are in love with each other. Hari gets a break in films and gets an advance payment of money from the producers. Using the sum, they return Maha's chain. By this time, Maha's parents start looking for a groom for her.\n\nMaha meets Gopi and advises him to find a job so that they can marry. Things start to take a turn for the worse when Hari is dropped from the film because the financier of the film is not convinced that having a newcomer is a good idea. The house owner expels Gopi and Hari from the house for not paying the rent. A dejected Gopi and Hari seek shelter with Mani, a rickshaw puller. Gopi gets a telegram informing that his father is dead. To bear his travel expenses, Mani's son Singam goes out, but meets with an accident. Hari tries to get some money by playing music in the streets but is hardly able to make it. Gopi approaches a moneylender to borrow money. The moneylender talks ill about Singam which  makes Gopi angry. In a fit of rage, he stabs the moneylender and takes away the money. When he arrives, he is informed that Singam is dead.\n\nMeanwhile, Maha's parents arrange a marriage for her. When she meets Prabhu, he confesses his love for her. A shocked Maha informs him that she never loved him, but only loves Gopi. Prabhu gets disappointed and feels life has ditched him as every single moment. He tries to molest Maha but is stopped when she takes a knife and threatens that she will kill herself. Prabhu feels guilty and takes the knife and stabs himself to death. By this time, Gopi arrives at her house and informs her that he has killed the moneylender for money. They both go a step ahead and marry each other. The next day they are arrested for Prabhu's murder. Hari throws his harmonium in the sea and becomes mad.\n\n== Production ==\nManivannan joined Bharathiraaja's unit as an assistant in the film.

The house owner expels Gopi and Hari from the house for not paying the rent. A dejected Gopi and Hari seek shelter with Mani, a rickshaw puller. Gopi gets a telegram informing that his father is dead. To bear his travel expenses, Mani's son Singam goes out, but meets with an accident. Hari tries to get some money by playing music in the streets but is hardly able to make it. Gopi approaches a moneylender to borrow money. The moneylender talks ill about Singam which  makes Gopi angry. In a fit of rage, he stabs the moneylender and takes away the money. When he arrives, he is informed that Singam is dead.\n\nMeanwhile, Maha's parents arrange a marriage for her. When she meets Prabhu, he confesses his love for her. A shocked Maha informs him that she never loved him, but only loves Gopi. Prabhu gets disappointed and feels life has ditched him as every single moment. He tries to molest Maha but is stopped when she takes a knife and threatens that she will kill herself. Prabhu feels guilty and takes the knife and stabs himself to death. By this time, Gopi arrives at her house and informs her that he has killed the moneylender for money. They both go a step ahead and marry each other. The next day they are arrested for Prabhu's murder. Hari throws his harmonium in the sea and becomes mad.\n\n== Production ==\nManivannan joined Bharathiraaja's unit as an assistant in the film.

In the late 1850s, the builders of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad were pushing their line steadily across Arkansas. By 1874, they had crossed the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and had reached the Texas state line. Between February 16 and March 19, 1874, trains ran between the Texas border and the Red River, whence passengers and freight were ferried to [[Fulton, Arkansas|Fulton]] to continue by rail. The Red River Bridge opened on March 20, 1874, and since then, trains have run directly from Texarkana to [[St. Louis]].\n\nKeen rivalry existed between the 1870s railroad builders. The [[Texas and Pacific Railroad]] reached across Texas to the Arkansas state line. The border was the logical place for the different railways to connect. On December 8, 1873, the Texas and Pacific sold the first town lots for the future city. The first to buy was J. W. Davis, who purchased the land where today's Hotel McCartney now stands, opposite Union Station.\n\nWho gave Texarkana its name is not known. A person who surveyed the Iron Mountain Railroad right-of-way from [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] to the state line allegedly painted \"TEX-ARK-ANA\" on a plank and nailed it to a tree, saying, \"This is the name of a town which is to be built here.\"  \n[[File:Texarkana TX water tower.png|thumb|Water tower in Texarkana]]\n\n==Geography==\nTexarkana is located at the junction of [[Interstate 30]] and US highways [[U.S. Route 59|59]], [[U.S. Route 67|67]], [[U.S. Route 71|71]], and [[U.S. Route 82|82]] in extreme northeast Texas on the Texas-Arkansas border,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.texarkana.tx.us/ourcity.html|title=Our City|publisher=Ci.texarkana.tx.us|accessdate=December 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023153755/http://www.ci.texarkana.tx.us/ourcity.html|archivedate=October 23, 2010}}</ref> at {{Coord|33|26|14|N|94|4|3|W|type:city}} (33.437170, -94.067394).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered by the city of Texarkana, Arkansas, to the east, and by the smaller cities of [[Nash, Texas|Nash]] and [[Wake Village, Texas]], to the west.

In the late 1850s, the builders of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad were pushing their line steadily across Arkansas. By 1874, they had crossed the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and had reached the Texas state line. Between February 16 and March 19, 1874, trains ran between the Texas border and the Red River, whence passengers and freight were ferried to [[Fulton, Arkansas|Fulton]] to continue by rail. The Red River Bridge opened on March 20, 1874, and since then, trains have run directly from Texarkana to [[St. Louis]].\n\nKeen rivalry existed between the 1870s railroad builders. The [[Texas and Pacific Railroad]] reached across Texas to the Arkansas state line. The border was the logical place for the different railways to connect. On December 8, 1873, the Texas and Pacific sold the first town lots for the future city. The first to buy was J. W.
