Once they turn in the Golden Brick for immunity, it is then made available as the reward for a future challenge. The season will culminate in a finale, in which top teams compete for a $100,000, a Lego Masters trophy, and the title of Lego Master.<ref name=\"Variety\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/fox-builds-its-second-show-around-a-popular-brand-with-lego-masters/|title= Fox Builds Its Second Show Around a Popular Brand With Lego Masters|work=Adweek}}</ref>\n\n==Elimination table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Social [[conservatives]] denounced the poem as flouting accepted norms of morality due to its blatant depictions of human [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. In 1882, [[Boston]]'s [[district attorney]] threatened action against ''Leaves of Grass'' for violating the state's obscenity laws and demanded that changes be made to several passages from \"Song of Myself\".<ref name=\"Greenspan\" />\n\n==Literary style==\n[[File:Quadroon type at Ponce, Porto Rico.jpg|alt=A dark-skinned woman in a light dress standing against a wall|thumb|\"Song of Myself\" includes passages about the unsavory realities of the United States before the Civil War, including one about a multi-racial slave]]\nThe poem is written in Whitman's signature [[free verse]] style. Whitman, who praises words \"as simple as grass\" (section 39) forgoes standard verse and [[stanza]] patterns in favor of a simple, legible style that can appeal to a mass audience.<ref>Redding, Patrick. \"Whitman Unbound: Democracy and Poetic Form\". ''New Literary Theory'' 41.3 (2010): 669-90. ''Project Muse''. Web. 19 October 2011.</ref>\n\nCritics have noted a strong [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] influence on the poem. In section 32, for instance, Whitman expresses a desire to \"live amongst the animals\" and to find divinity in the insects.\n\nIn addition to this [[romanticism]], the poem seems to anticipate a kind of [[realism (arts)|realism]] that would only become important in [[United States]] literature after the [[American Civil War]]. In the following 1855 passage, for example, we can see Whitman's inclusion of the gritty details of everyday life:<blockquote>The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,<br>\n(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's bed-room;)<br>\nThe jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,<br>\nHe turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;<br>\nThe malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,<br>\nWhat is removed drops horribly in a pail;<br>\nThe [[quadroon]] girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove, ... (section 15)\n</blockquote>\n\n==\"Self\"==\nIn the poem, Whitman emphasizes an all-powerful \"I\" which serves as narrator, who should not be limited to or confused with the person of the historical [[Walt Whitman]]. The [[persona]] described has transcended the conventional boundaries of self: \"I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-washed babe .... and am not contained between my hat and boots\" (section 7).\n\nThere are several other quotes from the poem that makes it apparent that Whitman does not consider the narrator to represent a single individual. Rather, he seems to be narrating for all:\n\n* \"For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\" (Section 1)\n* \"In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barleycorn less/and the good or bad I say of myself I say of them\" (Section 20)\n* \"It is you talking just as much as myself... I act as the tongue of you\" (Section 47)\n* \"I am large, I contain multitudes.\" (Section 51)\n\nAlice L. Cook and John B. Mason offer representative interpretations of the \"self\" as well as its importance in the poem. Cook writes that the key to understanding the poem lies in the \"concept of self\" (typified by Whitman) as \"both individual and universal,\"<ref>Cook, Alice L. \"A Note on Whitman\u2019s Symbolism in 'Song of Myself'\". ''Modern Language Notes'' 65.4 (1950): 228-32.  ''JSTOR''.

''American Literature'' 45.1 (1973): 34-49. ''JSTOR''.

In 1882, [[Boston]]'s [[district attorney]] threatened action against ''Leaves of Grass'' for violating the state's obscenity laws and demanded that changes be made to several passages from \"Song of Myself\".<ref name=\"Greenspan\" />\n\n==Literary style==\n[[File:Quadroon type at Ponce, Porto Rico.jpg|alt=A dark-skinned woman in a light dress standing against a wall|thumb|\"Song of Myself\" includes passages about the unsavory realities of the United States before the Civil War, including one about a multi-racial slave]]\nThe poem is written in Whitman's signature [[free verse]] style. Whitman, who praises words \"as simple as grass\" (section 39) forgoes standard verse and [[stanza]] patterns in favor of a simple, legible style that can appeal to a mass audience.<ref>Redding, Patrick. \"Whitman Unbound: Democracy and Poetic Form\". ''New Literary Theory'' 41.3 (2010): 669-90. ''Project Muse''. Web. 19 October 2011.</ref>\n\nCritics have noted a strong [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] influence on the poem. In section 32, for instance, Whitman expresses a desire to \"live amongst the animals\" and to find divinity in the insects.\n\nIn addition to this [[romanticism]], the poem seems to anticipate a kind of [[realism (arts)|realism]] that would only become important in [[United States]] literature after the [[American Civil War]]. In the following 1855 passage, for example, we can see Whitman's inclusion of the gritty details of everyday life:<blockquote>The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,<br>\n(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's bed-room;)<br>\nThe jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,<br>\nHe turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;<br>\nThe malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,<br>\nWhat is removed drops horribly in a pail;<br>\nThe [[quadroon]] girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove, ... (section 15)\n</blockquote>\n\n==\"Self\"==\nIn the poem, Whitman emphasizes an all-powerful \"I\" which serves as narrator, who should not be limited to or confused with the person of the historical [[Walt Whitman]]. The [[persona]] described has transcended the conventional boundaries of self: \"I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-washed babe .... and am not contained between my hat and boots\" (section 7).\n\nThere are several other quotes from the poem that makes it apparent that Whitman does not consider the narrator to represent a single individual. Rather, he seems to be narrating for all:\n\n* \"For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\" (Section 1)\n* \"In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barleycorn less/and the good or bad I say of myself I say of them\" (Section 20)\n* \"It is you talking just as much as myself... I act as the tongue of you\" (Section 47)\n* \"I am large, I contain multitudes.\" (Section 51)\n\nAlice L. Cook and John B. Mason offer representative interpretations of the \"self\" as well as its importance in the poem. Cook writes that the key to understanding the poem lies in the \"concept of self\" (typified by Whitman) as \"both individual and universal,\"<ref>Cook, Alice L. \"A Note on Whitman\u2019s Symbolism in 'Song of Myself'\". ''Modern Language Notes'' 65.4 (1950): 228-32.  ''JSTOR''.

''American Literature'' 45.1 (1973): 34-49. ''JSTOR''. Web. 17 October 2011.</ref> The \"self\" serves as a human ideal; in contrast to the archetypal self in [[epic poetry]], this self is one of the common people rather than a hero.<ref>Miller, James E. ''Walt Whitman''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1962. Print.</ref> Nevertheless, Whitman locates heroism in every individual as an expression of the whole (the \"leaf\" among the \"grass\").\n\n==Uses in other media==\nCanadian doctor and long-time Whitman friend [[Richard Maurice Bucke]] analyzed the poem in his influential and widely read 1898 book ''[[Cosmic Consciousness]]'', as part of his investigation of the development of man's mystic relation to the infinite.\n\nThe poem figures in the plot of the 2008 young adult novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' by [[John Green (author)|John Green]].<ref name=\"Poolos2014\">{{cite book|author=Christine Poolos|title=John Green|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpFhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=15 December 2014|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc|isbn=978-1-4777-7904-0|page=41}}</ref>\n\n\"Song of Myself\" and other Whitman poems are frequently referenced in the 2013 young adult fiction novel ''Dr. Bird's Advice for Sad Poets'' by Evan Roskos.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Dr. Bird's Advice for Sad Poets|url = http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15764032-dr-bird-s-advice-for-sad-poets|website = Goodreads|access-date = 2016-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe line \"I am large, I contain multitudes\" is referenced in the music video to Jill Scott's [[Golden (Jill Scott song)|Golden]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QCXr79Rkcw</ref>\n\nA documentary project, Whitman Alabama, featured residents of Alabama reading Whitman verses on camera.<ref>[http://www.whitmanalabama.com/ Whitman Alabama]</ref><ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/reciting-walt-whitman-at-a-drug-court-in-alabama \"Reciting Walt Whitman at a Drug Court in Alabama\" in ''The New Yorker'']</ref>\n\nThe poem is central to the plot of the play \"[[I and You]]\" by Lauren Gunderson.<ref name=\"Gunderson2018\">{{cite book|author=Lauren Gunderson|title=I and You|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpODDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA67|date=20 December 2018|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-10510-2|page=67}}</ref>\n\n\"Song of Myself\" was a major inspiration for the symphonic metal album ''[[Imaginaerum]]'' (2011) by [[Nightwish]], as well as [[Imaginaerum (film)|the fantasy film based on that album]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource|Leaves of Grass/Book III|Song of Myself}}\n* [http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/song-myself The University of Toronto's full text, with line numbers]\n* [http://www.classroomelectric.org/volume1/belasco/whitman-emerson.htm Emerson's letter To Whitman]\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2909452 Alice L.

The golden age of capitalism is a common name for this period in both academic and economics books.\n\nThe term is also used in other contexts. In older sources and occasionally in contemporary ones, the golden age of capitalism can refer to the period of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] from approximately [[International monetary systems#The pre World War II financial order: 1870\u20131914|1870 to 1914]] which also saw rapid economic expansion. Yet another name for the quarter century following the end of World War II is the Age of Marx, although the [[Soviet Union]]'s economic statistics were not reliable during this period.<ref>{{cite book\n| title=Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism,\n| first=Meghnad |last=Desai\n| publisher=Verso\n| year=2002\n| isbn= 1-85984-429-4 \n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX2wAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA216 \n| pages=216\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| title=The Cambridge history of twentieth-century political thought \n| first1=Terence |last1=Ball |first2=Richard Paul |last2=Bellamy\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| year=2002\n| isbn= 1-85984-429-4 \n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1h4_NqTOFoC&pg=PA45\n| pages=45\n}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\nEconomist Roger Middleton states that economic historians generally agree on 1950 as the start date for the golden age,<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Middleton\n | first = Roger\n | title = The British Economy Since 1945\n | year = 2000\n | page = 3\n | ISBN = 0-333-68483-4\n | publisher= Palgrave Macmillan }}</ref> while [[Robert Skidelsky]] states 1951 is the most recognized start date.<ref name = \"return\">\n{{cite book\n|first= Robert\n|last= Skidelsky\n|title= Keynes: The Return of the Master\n|year= 2009\n|pages= [https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/116 116, 126]\n|isbn= 978-1-84614-258-1\n|publisher= Allen Lane\n|url= https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/116\n}}</ref>\nBoth Skidelsky and Middleton have 1973 as the generally recognized end date, though sometimes the golden age is considered to have ended as early as 1970.\n\nThis long term business cycle ended with a number of events in the early 1970s:\n* the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods monetary system]] in 1971\n* the growing [[international trade]] in manufactured goods, such as automobiles and electronics\n* the [[1973 oil crisis]],\n* the [[1973\u201374 stock market crash]],\n* the ensuing [[1973\u201375 recession]], and\n\nWhile this is the global period, specific countries experienced business expansions for different periods; in [[Taiwan]], the [[Taiwan Miracle]] lasted into the late 1990s, for instance, while in France the period is referred to as ''Trente Glorieuses'' (Glorious 30 [years]) and is considered to extend for the 30-year period from 1945 to 1975.\n\n==Global economic climate==\n[[File:Us unemployment rates 1950 2005.png|thumb|upright=1.35|In the United States, unemployment fluctuated during the 1950s, but dropped steadily during the 1960s.]]\n\n[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] members enjoyed real GDP growth averaging over 4% per year in the 1950s, and nearly 5% per year in the 1960s, compared with 3% in the 1970s and 2% in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cqGVVkw4JhgC&pg=PA1\n|title= The Golden Age of Capitalism\n|publisher= Clarendon Press\n|first1= Stephen A. |last1=Marglin |first2=Juliet B. |last2=Schor\n|page=1\n|accessdate=2015-12-20}}\n</ref>\n\nSkidelsky devotes ten pages of his 2009 book ''[[Keynes: The Return of the Master]]'' to a comparison of the golden age to what he calls the [[Washington Consensus]] period, which he dates as spanning 1980\u20132009 (1973\u20131980 being a transitional period):<ref name = \"return\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Metric !!

It was not until later that the world had the exceptional growth of China raising the global average. Skidelsky also reports that inequality was generally decreasing during the golden age, whereas since the Washington Consensus was formed it has been increasing.\n\nGlobally, the golden age was a time of unusual financial stability, with crises far less frequent and intense than before or after. [[Martin Wolf]] reports that between 1945\u201371 (27 years) the world saw only 38 financial crises, whereas from 1973\u201397 (24 years) there were 139.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Wolf\n | first = Martin\n | title = Fixing Global Finance\n | year = 2009\n | chapter= 3\n | pages = 31\n | publisher =Yale University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:GiveUsTheTools.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Allied [[war bond]]s matured during these years, transferring cash from governments to private households.]]\n\n===Depopulation from war===\n[[Depopulation]] will tend to free up resources for [[investment]] and create an environment of lower competition for the survivors.

It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war, hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers.\n\n====Military spending====\nAnother explanation for this period is the theory of the [[permanent war economy]], which suggests that the large spending on the military helped stabilize the global economy; this has also been referred to as \"[[Military Keynesianism]]\".\n\n===Financial repression===\nThis period also saw [[financial repression]]\u2014low nominal interest rates and low or [[negative interest rates|negative real interest rates]] (nominal rates lower than inflation plus taxation), via government policy\u2014resulting respectively in debt servicing costs being low (low nominal rates) and in liquidation of existing debt (via inflation and taxation).<ref>[https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2011/res2/pdf/crbs.pdf The Liquidation of Government Debt], Reinhart, Carmen M. & Sbrancia, M.

In the inter-war period, the [[Great Depression]] also caused investments to lose value.<ref name=wealth_conscription>https://web.stanford.edu/group/scheve-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ScheveStasavage_IO_2010.pdf</ref>\n\nDuring both World Wars, [[progressive taxation]] and [[capital levies]] were introduced, with the generally-stated aim of distributing the sacrifices required by the war more evenly. While tax rates dipped between the wars, they did not return to pre-war levels. Top tax rates increased dramatically, in some cases tenfold. This had a significant effect on both income and wealth distributions. Such policies were commonly referred to as the \"conscription of income\" and \"conscription of wealth\".<ref name=wealth_conscription/>\n\n{{quote|a  fundamental  objection  to the government's policy of conscription is that it conscripts human life only, and that it does not attempt to conscript wealth... |Liberal party election platform, autumn 1917, Canada}}\n\n[[The Economist]], a British publication, opposed capital levies, but supported \"direct  taxation  heavy  enough  to  amount  to  rationing  of  citizens' incomes\"; similarly, the American economist [[Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague]], in the [[Economic Journal]], argued that that \"conscription of men should logically and equitably be accompanied by something in the nature of conscription of current income above that which is absolutely necessary\".<ref name=wealth_conscription/> \n\n[[Rationing#Second World War|Rationing]] of goods was also widely used, with the aim of distributing scarce resources efficiently.<ref name=focus/> Rationing was widely done with [[ration stamp]]s, a second currency that entitled the bearer to buy (with regular money) a certain amount of a certain sort of good (for instance, two ounces of meat,<ref name=focus>http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/War/londonRation.html</ref> or a certain amount of clothing<ref>https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/8-facts-about-clothes-rationing-in-britain-during-the-second-world-war</ref> or fuel). Price controls were also used (for instance, the price of restaurant meals was capped).<ref name=focus/>\n\nIn the post-war period, progressive taxation persisted. [[Inheritance tax]]es also had an effect. [[Rationing in the United Kingdom]] lasted until 1954. Allied [[war bonds]] matured during the post-war years, transferring cash from governments to private households.\n\nIn Japan, progressive tax rates were imposed during [[Occupation_of_Japan|the Allied occupation]], at rates that roughly matched those in the United States at that time. High marginal tax rates for the wealthiest 1% were in place throughout Japan's decades of post-war growth<ref>Moriguchi, Chiaki and Emmanual Saez. 2008. \"THE EVOLUTION OF INCOME CONCENTRATION IN JAPAN, 1886 \u20132005:\nEVIDENCE FROM INCOME TAX STATISTICS,\" The Review of Economics and Statistics, November 2008, 90(4): 713\u2013734, https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/moriguchi-saezREStat08japan.pdf</ref> South Korea, after the [[Korean War]] saw a similar trajectory.

During the [[Vietnam War]] (1950s{{snd}}1970s) the price of oil slowly declined to under $20. During the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo of 1973]]\u2014the first oil shock\u2014the price of oil rapidly rose to double in price.\n\n===International cooperation===\n[[File:Marshall Plan poster.JPG|thumb|left|Poster for the [[Marshall Plan]]]]\n{{See also|Aftermath of World War II}}\n\nAmong the causes can be mentioned the rapid normalization of political relations between former Axis powers and the western Allies.\nAfter the war, the major powers were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the [[Great Depression]], some of which were ascribed to [[Aftermath of World War I|post\u2013World War I]] policy errors. The [[Marshall Plan]] for the rebuilding of Europe is most credited for reconciliation, though the immediate post-war situations was more complicated. In 1948 the [[Marshall Plan]] pumped over $12 billion to rebuild and modernize Western Europe. The [[European Coal and Steel Community]] formed the foundation of what was to become the [[European Union]] in later years.\n\n====Institutional arrangements====\n[[Institutional economists]] point to the international institutions established in the post-war period. Structurally, the victorious Allies established the [[United Nations]] and the [[Bretton Woods monetary system]], international institutions designed to promote stability. This was achieved through a number of policies, including promoting [[free trade]], instituting the [[Marshall Plan]], and the use of [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=====US Council of Economic Advisers=====\nIn the United States, the [[Employment Act of 1946]] set the goals of achieving full employment, full production, and stable prices. It also created the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] to provide objective economic analysis and advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and international economic policy issues. In its first 7 years the CEA made five technical advances in policy making:<ref>Salant, Walter S. \"Some Intellectual Contributions of the Truman Council of Economic Advisers to Policy-Making,\" ''History of Political Economy,'' 1973, Vol. 5 Issue 1, pp 36\u201349</ref>\n#The replacement of a \"cyclical model\" of the economy by a \"growth model,\"\n#The setting of quantitative targets for the economy,\n#Use of the theories of fiscal drag and full-employment budget,\n#Recognition of the need for greater flexibility in taxation, and\n#Replacement of the notion of unemployment as a structural problem by a realization of low aggregate demand.\n\n==Specific countries==\nThe economies of the [[economy of the United States|United States]], [[economy of Japan|Japan]], [[economy of West Germany|West Germany]], [[economy of France|France]], and [[economy of Italy|Italy]] did particularly well. Japan and West Germany caught up to and exceeded the GDP of the [[economy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] during these years, even as the UK itself was experiencing the greatest absolute prosperity in its history. In France, this period is often looked back to with nostalgia as the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'', or \"Glorious Thirty\", while the economies of West Germany and Austria were characterized by ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle), and in Italy it is called [[History of the Italian Republic#The 1950s and 1960s: the Economic Boom|''Miracolo economico'']] (economic miracle). Most [[developing countries]] also did well in this period.\n\n===Belgium===\n{{Main|Belgian economic miracle}}\n[[Belgium]] experienced a brief but very rapid economic recovery in the aftermath of World War II. The comparatively light damage sustained by Belgium's heavy industry during the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation]] and the Europe-wide need for the country's traditional exports (steel and coal, textiles, and railway infrastructure) meant that Belgium became the first European country to regain its pre-war level of output in 1947. Economic growth in the period was accompanied by low inflation and sharp increases in real living standards.\n\nHowever, lack of capital investment meant that Belgium's heavy industry was ill-equipped to compete with other European industries in the 1950s. This contributed to the start of [[deindustrialisation]] in [[Wallonia]] and the emergence of regional economic disparities.\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Trente Glorieuses}}\n\nBetween 1947 and 1973, France went through a boom period (5% growth per year on average) dubbed by [[Jean Fourasti\u00e9]] ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' - the title of a book published in 1979. The economic growth occurred mainly due to productivity gains and to an increase in the number of working hours. Indeed, the working population grew very slowly, the \"[[baby boom]]\" being offset by the extension of the time dedicated to study. Productivity gains came from catching up with the United States. In 1950, the average income in France was 55% of that of an American; it reached 80% in 1973. Among the \"major\" nations, only Japan had faster growth in this era than France.<ref>P. Sicsic, and C. Wyplosz. \"France: 1945-92.\" in ''Economic Growth in Europe since 1945,'' edited by N. Crafts and G. Toniolo. (Cambridge University Press, 1996)</ref>\n\nThe extended period of transformation and modernization also involved an increasing internationalization of the French economy. France by the 1980s had become a leading world economic power and the world's fourth-largest exporter of manufactured products. It became Europe's largest agricultural producer and exporter, accounting for more than 10 percent of world trade in such goods by the 1980s. The service sector grew rapidly and became the largest sector, generating a large foreign-trade surplus, chiefly from the earnings from tourism.<ref>\nAndrea Boltho, \"Economic Policy in France and Italy since the War: Different Stances, Different Outcomes?,\" ''Journal of Economic Issues'' 35#3 (2001) pp 713+ [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=5000888520 online]\n</ref>\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian economic miracle}}\n\nThe Italian economy experienced very variable growth. In the 1950s and early 1960s the [[Italian economic miracle|Italian economy boomed]], with record high growth-rates, including 6.4% in 1959, 5.8% in 1960, 6.8% in 1961, and 6.1% in 1962. This rapid and sustained growth was due to the ambitions of several{{quantify|date=May 2016}} Italian businesspeople, the opening of new industries (helped by the discovery of hydrocarbons, made for iron and steel, in the [[Po valley]]), re-construction and the modernisation of most Italian cities, such as Milan, Rome and Turin, and the aid given to the country after World War II (notably through the [[Marshall Plan]]).<ref>Vera Zamagni, Vera, ''The economic history of Italy 1860-1990'' (Oxford University Press, 1993)</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2016}}<ref>\nGiangiacomo Nardozzi, \"The Italian\" Economic Miracle\".

McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' (2002) pp 562-98</ref> Given a boost by the [[Korean War]], in which it acted as a major supplier to the UN force, Japan's economy embarked on a prolonged period of extremely rapid growth, led by the manufacturing sectors. Japan emerged as a significant power in many economic spheres, including steel working, car manufacturing and the manufacturing of electronics. Japan rapidly caught up with the West in foreign trade, GNP, and general quality of life. The high economic growth and political tranquility of the mid to late 1960s were slowed by the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973. Almost completely dependent on imports for petroleum, Japan experienced its first recession since World War&nbsp;II. Another serious problem was Japan's growing trade surplus, which reached record heights. The United States pressured Japan to remedy the imbalance, demanding that Tokyo raise the value of the yen and open its markets further to facilitate more imports from the United States.<ref>Hans Brinckmann, and Ysbrand Rogge.

In the US, Gross Domestic Product increased from $228 billion in 1945 to just under $1.7 trillion in 1975. By 1975, the US economy represented some 35% of the entire world industrial output, and the US economy was over 3 times larger than that of Japan, the next largest economy.<ref>[http://countryeconomy.com/gdp?year=1975 Countries GDP 1975: GDP annual comparison, CountryEconomy.com]</ref> The expansion was interrupted in the United States by five [[recession]]s ([[Recession of 1949|1948\u201349]], [[Recession of 1953|1953\u201354]], [[Recession of 1958|1957\u201358]], [[Recession of 1960\u201361|1960\u201361]], and [[Recession of 1969\u201370|1969\u201370]]).\n\n$200&nbsp;billion in [[war bonds]] matured, and the [[G.I. Bill]] financed a well-educated work force. The middle class swelled, as did GDP and productivity. The US underwent its own golden age of economic growth. This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] in this period\u2014labor union membership peaked during the 1950s. Much of the growth came from the movement of low-income farm workers into better-paying jobs in the towns and cities\u2014a process largely completed by 1960.<ref>French, Michael.

The recovery was accelerated by the [[Deutsche Mark#Currency reform of June 1948|currency reform of June 1948]], US gifts of $1.4 billion [[Marshall Plan]] aid, the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the opening of the global market.<ref>Detlef Junker, ed., ''The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1968'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004) vol 1:291-309</ref> West Germany gained legitimacy and respect, as it shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis. West Germany played a central role in the creation of European cooperation; it joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1958.\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Old Mods photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The increased free time of adolescents caused the rise of [[youth subculture]]s such as [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]].]]\n\nThe post-war economic boom had many social, cultural, and political effects (not least of which was the demographic bulge termed the [[Post\u2013World War II baby boom|baby boom]]). Movements and phenomena associated with this period include the height of the [[Cold War]], [[postmodernism]], [[decolonisation]], a marked increase in [[consumerism]], the [[welfare state]], the [[space race]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[import substitution]], [[counterculture of the 1960s]], opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the [[sexual revolution]], the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]], and a nuclear [[arms race]]. In the United States, the middle-class began a mass migration away from the cities and towards the suburbs. Thus, it can be summed up as a period of prosperity in which most people could enjoy a job for life, a house and a family.\n\nIn the West, there emerged a near-complete consensus against strong ideology and a belief that technocratic and scientific solutions could be found to most of humanity's problems, a view advanced by US President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962. This optimism was symbolized through such events as the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], and Lyndon B. Johnson's [[Great Society]] programs, which aimed at eliminating poverty in the United States.\n\n==Decline==\nThe sharp rise in oil prices (due to the [[1973 oil crisis]]) hastened the transition to the [[post-industrial economy]], and a multitude of social problems have since emerged. During the 1970s [[steel crisis]], demand for steel declined, and the Western world faced competition from [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]]. This was especially harsh for mining and steel districts such as the North American [[Rust Belt]] and the West German [[Ruhr area]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Post-war consensus]], in Britain\n* [[Four Asian Tigers]]\n* [[Mexican miracle]]\n* [[Spanish miracle]]\n* [[Nixon shock]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Boltho, Andrea, ed.

Contrary to early predictions, this high growth also included many countries that had been devastated by the war, such as [[Japan]] ([[Japanese economic miracle]]), [[West Germany]] and [[Austria]] ([[Wirtschaftswunder]]), [[South Korea]] ([[Miracle on the Han River]]), [[France]] ([[Trente Glorieuses]]), [[Italy]] ([[Italian economic miracle]]) and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] ([[Greek economic miracle]]).\n\n==Terminology==\nIn academic literature, the period is frequently referred to as the post\u2013World War II economic boom, although this term can refer to much shorter booms in particular markets. It is also known as the long boom, but this term is generic and can refer to other periods. The golden age of capitalism is a common name for this period in both academic and economics books.\n\nThe term is also used in other contexts. In older sources and occasionally in contemporary ones, the golden age of capitalism can refer to the period of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] from approximately [[International monetary systems#The pre World War II financial order: 1870\u20131914|1870 to 1914]] which also saw rapid economic expansion. Yet another name for the quarter century following the end of World War II is the Age of Marx, although the [[Soviet Union]]'s economic statistics were not reliable during this period.<ref>{{cite book\n| title=Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism,\n| first=Meghnad |last=Desai\n| publisher=Verso\n| year=2002\n| isbn= 1-85984-429-4 \n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX2wAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA216 \n| pages=216\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| title=The Cambridge history of twentieth-century political thought \n| first1=Terence |last1=Ball |first2=Richard Paul |last2=Bellamy\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| year=2002\n| isbn= 1-85984-429-4 \n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1h4_NqTOFoC&pg=PA45\n| pages=45\n}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\nEconomist Roger Middleton states that economic historians generally agree on 1950 as the start date for the golden age,<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Middleton\n | first = Roger\n | title = The British Economy Since 1945\n | year = 2000\n | page = 3\n | ISBN = 0-333-68483-4\n | publisher= Palgrave Macmillan }}</ref> while [[Robert Skidelsky]] states 1951 is the most recognized start date.<ref name = \"return\">\n{{cite book\n|first= Robert\n|last= Skidelsky\n|title= Keynes: The Return of the Master\n|year= 2009\n|pages= [https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/116 116, 126]\n|isbn= 978-1-84614-258-1\n|publisher= Allen Lane\n|url= https://archive.org/details/keynesreturnofma0000skid/page/116\n}}</ref>\nBoth Skidelsky and Middleton have 1973 as the generally recognized end date, though sometimes the golden age is considered to have ended as early as 1970.\n\nThis long term business cycle ended with a number of events in the early 1970s:\n* the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods monetary system]] in 1971\n* the growing [[international trade]] in manufactured goods, such as automobiles and electronics\n* the [[1973 oil crisis]],\n* the [[1973\u201374 stock market crash]],\n* the ensuing [[1973\u201375 recession]], and\n\nWhile this is the global period, specific countries experienced business expansions for different periods; in [[Taiwan]], the [[Taiwan Miracle]] lasted into the late 1990s, for instance, while in France the period is referred to as ''Trente Glorieuses'' (Glorious 30 [years]) and is considered to extend for the 30-year period from 1945 to 1975.\n\n==Global economic climate==\n[[File:Us unemployment rates 1950 2005.png|thumb|upright=1.35|In the United States, unemployment fluctuated during the 1950s, but dropped steadily during the 1960s.]]\n\n[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] members enjoyed real GDP growth averaging over 4% per year in the 1950s, and nearly 5% per year in the 1960s, compared with 3% in the 1970s and 2% in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cqGVVkw4JhgC&pg=PA1\n|title= The Golden Age of Capitalism\n|publisher= Clarendon Press\n|first1= Stephen A. |last1=Marglin |first2=Juliet B. |last2=Schor\n|page=1\n|accessdate=2015-12-20}}\n</ref>\n\nSkidelsky devotes ten pages of his 2009 book ''[[Keynes: The Return of the Master]]'' to a comparison of the golden age to what he calls the [[Washington Consensus]] period, which he dates as spanning 1980\u20132009 (1973\u20131980 being a transitional period):<ref name = \"return\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Metric !!

It was not until later that the world had the exceptional growth of China raising the global average. Skidelsky also reports that inequality was generally decreasing during the golden age, whereas since the Washington Consensus was formed it has been increasing.\n\nGlobally, the golden age was a time of unusual financial stability, with crises far less frequent and intense than before or after. [[Martin Wolf]] reports that between 1945\u201371 (27 years) the world saw only 38 financial crises, whereas from 1973\u201397 (24 years) there were 139.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Wolf\n | first = Martin\n | title = Fixing Global Finance\n | year = 2009\n | chapter= 3\n | pages = 31\n | publisher =Yale University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:GiveUsTheTools.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Allied [[war bond]]s matured during these years, transferring cash from governments to private households.]]\n\n===Depopulation from war===\n[[Depopulation]] will tend to free up resources for [[investment]] and create an environment of lower competition for the survivors.

While tax rates dipped between the wars, they did not return to pre-war levels. Top tax rates increased dramatically, in some cases tenfold. This had a significant effect on both income and wealth distributions. Such policies were commonly referred to as the \"conscription of income\" and \"conscription of wealth\".<ref name=wealth_conscription/>\n\n{{quote|a  fundamental  objection  to the government's policy of conscription is that it conscripts human life only, and that it does not attempt to conscript wealth... |Liberal party election platform, autumn 1917, Canada}}\n\n[[The Economist]], a British publication, opposed capital levies, but supported \"direct  taxation  heavy  enough  to  amount  to  rationing  of  citizens' incomes\"; similarly, the American economist [[Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague]], in the [[Economic Journal]], argued that that \"conscription of men should logically and equitably be accompanied by something in the nature of conscription of current income above that which is absolutely necessary\".<ref name=wealth_conscription/> \n\n[[Rationing#Second World War|Rationing]] of goods was also widely used, with the aim of distributing scarce resources efficiently.<ref name=focus/> Rationing was widely done with [[ration stamp]]s, a second currency that entitled the bearer to buy (with regular money) a certain amount of a certain sort of good (for instance, two ounces of meat,<ref name=focus>http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/War/londonRation.html</ref> or a certain amount of clothing<ref>https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/8-facts-about-clothes-rationing-in-britain-during-the-second-world-war</ref> or fuel). Price controls were also used (for instance, the price of restaurant meals was capped).<ref name=focus/>\n\nIn the post-war period, progressive taxation persisted. [[Inheritance tax]]es also had an effect. [[Rationing in the United Kingdom]] lasted until 1954. Allied [[war bonds]] matured during the post-war years, transferring cash from governments to private households.\n\nIn Japan, progressive tax rates were imposed during [[Occupation_of_Japan|the Allied occupation]], at rates that roughly matched those in the United States at that time.

During the [[Vietnam War]] (1950s{{snd}}1970s) the price of oil slowly declined to under $20.

The [[Marshall Plan]] for the rebuilding of Europe is most credited for reconciliation, though the immediate post-war situations was more complicated. In 1948 the [[Marshall Plan]] pumped over $12 billion to rebuild and modernize Western Europe. The [[European Coal and Steel Community]] formed the foundation of what was to become the [[European Union]] in later years.\n\n====Institutional arrangements====\n[[Institutional economists]] point to the international institutions established in the post-war period. Structurally, the victorious Allies established the [[United Nations]] and the [[Bretton Woods monetary system]], international institutions designed to promote stability. This was achieved through a number of policies, including promoting [[free trade]], instituting the [[Marshall Plan]], and the use of [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=====US Council of Economic Advisers=====\nIn the United States, the [[Employment Act of 1946]] set the goals of achieving full employment, full production, and stable prices. It also created the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] to provide objective economic analysis and advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and international economic policy issues. In its first 7 years the CEA made five technical advances in policy making:<ref>Salant, Walter S. \"Some Intellectual Contributions of the Truman Council of Economic Advisers to Policy-Making,\" ''History of Political Economy,'' 1973, Vol. 5 Issue 1, pp 36\u201349</ref>\n#The replacement of a \"cyclical model\" of the economy by a \"growth model,\"\n#The setting of quantitative targets for the economy,\n#Use of the theories of fiscal drag and full-employment budget,\n#Recognition of the need for greater flexibility in taxation, and\n#Replacement of the notion of unemployment as a structural problem by a realization of low aggregate demand.\n\n==Specific countries==\nThe economies of the [[economy of the United States|United States]], [[economy of Japan|Japan]], [[economy of West Germany|West Germany]], [[economy of France|France]], and [[economy of Italy|Italy]] did particularly well. Japan and West Germany caught up to and exceeded the GDP of the [[economy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] during these years, even as the UK itself was experiencing the greatest absolute prosperity in its history. In France, this period is often looked back to with nostalgia as the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'', or \"Glorious Thirty\", while the economies of West Germany and Austria were characterized by ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle), and in Italy it is called [[History of the Italian Republic#The 1950s and 1960s: the Economic Boom|''Miracolo economico'']] (economic miracle). Most [[developing countries]] also did well in this period.\n\n===Belgium===\n{{Main|Belgian economic miracle}}\n[[Belgium]] experienced a brief but very rapid economic recovery in the aftermath of World War II. The comparatively light damage sustained by Belgium's heavy industry during the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation]] and the Europe-wide need for the country's traditional exports (steel and coal, textiles, and railway infrastructure) meant that Belgium became the first European country to regain its pre-war level of output in 1947. Economic growth in the period was accompanied by low inflation and sharp increases in real living standards.\n\nHowever, lack of capital investment meant that Belgium's heavy industry was ill-equipped to compete with other European industries in the 1950s. This contributed to the start of [[deindustrialisation]] in [[Wallonia]] and the emergence of regional economic disparities.\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Trente Glorieuses}}\n\nBetween 1947 and 1973, France went through a boom period (5% growth per year on average) dubbed by [[Jean Fourasti\u00e9]] ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' - the title of a book published in 1979. The economic growth occurred mainly due to productivity gains and to an increase in the number of working hours. Indeed, the working population grew very slowly, the \"[[baby boom]]\" being offset by the extension of the time dedicated to study. Productivity gains came from catching up with the United States. In 1950, the average income in France was 55% of that of an American; it reached 80% in 1973. Among the \"major\" nations, only Japan had faster growth in this era than France.<ref>P. Sicsic, and C. Wyplosz. \"France: 1945-92.\" in ''Economic Growth in Europe since 1945,'' edited by N. Crafts and G. Toniolo. (Cambridge University Press, 1996)</ref>\n\nThe extended period of transformation and modernization also involved an increasing internationalization of the French economy. France by the 1980s had become a leading world economic power and the world's fourth-largest exporter of manufactured products. It became Europe's largest agricultural producer and exporter, accounting for more than 10 percent of world trade in such goods by the 1980s. The service sector grew rapidly and became the largest sector, generating a large foreign-trade surplus, chiefly from the earnings from tourism.<ref>\nAndrea Boltho, \"Economic Policy in France and Italy since the War: Different Stances, Different Outcomes?,\" ''Journal of Economic Issues'' 35#3 (2001) pp 713+ [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=5000888520 online]\n</ref>\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian economic miracle}}\n\nThe Italian economy experienced very variable growth. In the 1950s and early 1960s the [[Italian economic miracle|Italian economy boomed]], with record high growth-rates, including 6.4% in 1959, 5.8% in 1960, 6.8% in 1961, and 6.1% in 1962. This rapid and sustained growth was due to the ambitions of several{{quantify|date=May 2016}} Italian businesspeople, the opening of new industries (helped by the discovery of hydrocarbons, made for iron and steel, in the [[Po valley]]), re-construction and the modernisation of most Italian cities, such as Milan, Rome and Turin, and the aid given to the country after World War II (notably through the [[Marshall Plan]]).<ref>Vera Zamagni, Vera, ''The economic history of Italy 1860-1990'' (Oxford University Press, 1993)</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2016}}<ref>\nGiangiacomo Nardozzi, \"The Italian\" Economic Miracle\".

McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' (2002) pp 562-98</ref> Given a boost by the [[Korean War]], in which it acted as a major supplier to the UN force, Japan's economy embarked on a prolonged period of extremely rapid growth, led by the manufacturing sectors. Japan emerged as a significant power in many economic spheres, including steel working, car manufacturing and the manufacturing of electronics. Japan rapidly caught up with the West in foreign trade, GNP, and general quality of life. The high economic growth and political tranquility of the mid to late 1960s were slowed by the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973. Almost completely dependent on imports for petroleum, Japan experienced its first recession since World War&nbsp;II. Another serious problem was Japan's growing trade surplus, which reached record heights. The United States pressured Japan to remedy the imbalance, demanding that Tokyo raise the value of the yen and open its markets further to facilitate more imports from the United States.<ref>Hans Brinckmann, and Ysbrand Rogge.

However, the growth slowed and ended by 1960, as the [[Khrushchev era|Khrushchev regime]] poured resources into large military and space projects, and the civilian sector languished.

In the US, Gross Domestic Product increased from $228 billion in 1945 to just under $1.7 trillion in 1975. By 1975, the US economy represented some 35% of the entire world industrial output, and the US economy was over 3 times larger than that of Japan, the next largest economy.<ref>[http://countryeconomy.com/gdp?year=1975 Countries GDP 1975: GDP annual comparison, CountryEconomy.com]</ref> The expansion was interrupted in the United States by five [[recession]]s ([[Recession of 1949|1948\u201349]], [[Recession of 1953|1953\u201354]], [[Recession of 1958|1957\u201358]], [[Recession of 1960\u201361|1960\u201361]], and [[Recession of 1969\u201370|1969\u201370]]).\n\n$200&nbsp;billion in [[war bonds]] matured, and the [[G.I. Bill]] financed a well-educated work force. The middle class swelled, as did GDP and productivity. The US underwent its own golden age of economic growth. This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] in this period\u2014labor union membership peaked during the 1950s. Much of the growth came from the movement of low-income farm workers into better-paying jobs in the towns and cities\u2014a process largely completed by 1960.<ref>French, Michael.

Labor union's support of the new policies, postponed wage increases, minimized strikes, supported technological modernization, and a policy of co-determination (Mitbestimmung), which involved a satisfactory grievance resolution system and required the representation of workers on the boards of large corporations,<ref>Friedrich F\u00fcrstenberg, \"West German Experience with Industrial Democracy,\" ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' Vol. 431, (May, 1977), pp. 44\u201353 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1042033 in JSTOR]</ref> all contributed to such a prolonged economic growth. The recovery was accelerated by the [[Deutsche Mark#Currency reform of June 1948|currency reform of June 1948]], US gifts of $1.4 billion [[Marshall Plan]] aid, the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the opening of the global market.<ref>Detlef Junker, ed., ''The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1968'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004) vol 1:291-309</ref> West Germany gained legitimacy and respect, as it shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis. West Germany played a central role in the creation of European cooperation; it joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1958.\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Old Mods photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The increased free time of adolescents caused the rise of [[youth subculture]]s such as [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]].]]\n\nThe post-war economic boom had many social, cultural, and political effects (not least of which was the demographic bulge termed the [[Post\u2013World War II baby boom|baby boom]]). Movements and phenomena associated with this period include the height of the [[Cold War]], [[postmodernism]], [[decolonisation]], a marked increase in [[consumerism]], the [[welfare state]], the [[space race]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[import substitution]], [[counterculture of the 1960s]], opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the [[sexual revolution]], the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]], and a nuclear [[arms race]]. In the United States, the middle-class began a mass migration away from the cities and towards the suburbs. Thus, it can be summed up as a period of prosperity in which most people could enjoy a job for life, a house and a family.\n\nIn the West, there emerged a near-complete consensus against strong ideology and a belief that technocratic and scientific solutions could be found to most of humanity's problems, a view advanced by US President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962. This optimism was symbolized through such events as the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], and Lyndon B. Johnson's [[Great Society]] programs, which aimed at eliminating poverty in the United States.\n\n==Decline==\nThe sharp rise in oil prices (due to the [[1973 oil crisis]]) hastened the transition to the [[post-industrial economy]], and a multitude of social problems have since emerged. During the 1970s [[steel crisis]], demand for steel declined, and the Western world faced competition from [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]]. This was especially harsh for mining and steel districts such as the North American [[Rust Belt]] and the West German [[Ruhr area]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Post-war consensus]], in Britain\n* [[Four Asian Tigers]]\n* [[Mexican miracle]]\n* [[Spanish miracle]]\n* [[Nixon shock]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Boltho, Andrea, ed.

He continued to play football at [[Eton College]], winning the House Cup in 1861 with Joynes's House, but was never selected for the school eleven. He first played association football early in 1866.\n\nAs a player, Kinnaird had a remarkable record in the [[FA Cup]]. He played in a record nine FA Cup finals. He was on the winning side three times with [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] and twice with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]], and celebrated his fifth Cup Final victory by standing on his head in front of the pavilion. In the course of his career as a Cup Final player, Kinnaird played in every position, from goalkeeper to forward. It was while playing in goal for Wanderers in the [[1877 FA Cup Final|1877 final]] that he suffered the indignity of scoring the first significant [[own goal]] in football history, accidentally stepping backwards over his own goal line after fielding an innocuous long shot from an [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] forward.  The match finished 1\u20131 and Wanderers won with a second goal in extra time.  Some time after the match, for unknown reasons, the FA struck the Oxford goal from the records, changing the official score to 2\u20130 (although if Oxford had not scored, there would have been no reason for the game to go to extra time, so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers' second goal as well).<ref name=\"W47\">{{cite book |last= Warsop|first= Keith|title= The Early FA Cup Finals and the Southern Amateurs|year= 2004|publisher= SoccerData|isbn= 1-899468-78-1 |page=47}}</ref>  For the next century, all sources reported the score of the match as 2\u20130.<ref name=\"W47\" />  In the 1980s, after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians, the FA reinstated the Oxford goal, and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090616021730/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 June 2009|title=Cup Final Statistics|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he was born in [[Kensington]], London, as a son of an old [[Perthshire]] family, Kinnaird also played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref name = rsssf/> He made his solitary appearance against [[England national football team|England]] in the second ever international match, played on 8 March 1873 at [[The Oval]].<ref name = rsssf>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1880.html |title=Scotland \u2013 International Matches 1872\u20131880 |website= |publisher=RSSSF |date=19 September 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2020 |first1=Alan |last1=Brown |first2=Gabriele |last2=Tossani}}</ref>\n\n====Playing style====\n[[File:Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird.jpg|thumb|130px|Caricature of Kinnaird published in 1912]]\nHe was renowned as perhaps the toughest tackler of his day, giving rise to the (probably apocryphal) story that his wife once expressed the fear that he would \"come home one day with a broken leg.\" A friend is said to have responded: \"You must not worry, madam. If he does, it will not be his own.\" Posterity has awarded Arthur Kinnaird the reputation of being fond of '[[Hacking (rugby)|hacking]]', i.e. deliberately kicking his opponents. This is not entirely fair: reports from his playing days do not criticise him, and he owes his notoriety to an oft-repeated anecdote which first appeared in an October 1892 issue of ''Pastime'' magazine, a weekly sporting journal that was edited by Nicholas Lane 'Pa' Jackson, founder of the [[Corinthian_F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] and a committee member of the Football Association.\n\nJackson wrote: 'The keen rivalry which at one time existed between the Old Etonians and Old Harrovians lent an additional zest to the matches between them, and in one of these Lord Kinnaird's energy was expended as much on the shins of his opponents as on the ball. This at length caused a protest from the captain of the Harrovians, who asked, 'Are we going to play the game, or are we going to have hacking?'  'Oh, let us have hacking!' was the noble reply.' Jackson later reveals that the opposing captain was [[C. W.

Alcock and [[Morton Peto Betts]] were sufficiently disabled to be unable to play for England in the first official international, two weeks later.\n\nSportswriters and fellow internationals queued to pay tribute to Kinnaird's skill as a footballer both during and after his career.

It is well known among modern-day Latinists as the place where documents of the [[Catholic Church]] are written in or translated into [[Latin language|Latin]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters]], or in short ''Secretariate of Briefs'', was one of the so-called offices of the [[Roman Curia]] which were abolished in the 20th century. The secretary for Latin letters was a prelate or private chamberlain whose duties were to write the letters of less solemnity which the sovereign pontiff addresses to different personages.\n\nBy the time of [[Pope Paul VI's reform of the Roman Curia]], the office once known as Secretary for Briefs to Princes had been renamed more prosaically as the Latin Language Department of the First Section of the Secretariat of State.

It is well known among modern-day Latinists as the place where documents of the [[Catholic Church]] are written in or translated into [[Latin language|Latin]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters]], or in short ''Secretariate of Briefs'', was one of the so-called offices of the [[Roman Curia]] which were abolished in the 20th century. The secretary for Latin letters was a prelate or private chamberlain whose duties were to write the letters of less solemnity which the sovereign pontiff addresses to different personages.\n\nBy the time of [[Pope Paul VI's reform of the Roman Curia]], the office once known as Secretary for Briefs to Princes had been renamed more prosaically as the Latin Language Department of the First Section of the Secretariat of State. No longer headed by a Cardinal, it had lost some of its luster, but it remained the real communications hub at the Vatican.\n\n==21st century==\n[[Reginald Foster (Latinist)|Reginald Foster]] is an American Catholic priest and friar of the order of Discalced [[Carmelites]], born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], on 14 November 1939.
