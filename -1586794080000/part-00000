Pope's music has been featured nationwide on [[Sirius XM]] radio. He has toured nationally alongside acts such as [[John Michael Montgomery]], [[Mark Chesnutt]], [[Shooter Jennings]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[John Schneider (screen actor)]], and [[Sunny Sweeney]]. In 2019, his hit song, \"Stoned On The One\" was recorded by [[John Schneider (screen actor)]] and signifies one of Schneider's fastest rising hits to date, peaking at #30 on [https://musicrow.com/wp-content/CBOcharts/CBOChart030520.pdf Music Row\u2019s Country Breakout Chart.]\n\n== Early life ==\nAndrew Pope was born on January 21, 1985 at Dekalb Regional Medical Center in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]]. He is a native of [[Geraldine, Alabama]], [[United States]] and he attended Geraldine High School. At a very early age, Pope was introduced to music. When he was with his mother and step-father, Pope would hear artists like [[Hank Williams Jr]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]. Through attending a small church with his grandmother, he was exposed to southern gospel hymns and when he was with his grandfather he would hear folks like [[Hank Williams]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Fats Domino]].\n\nPope would begin piano lessons at the age of 6. It wasn't long after that until Andrew's family realized he was a natural born musician. Pope, however, would not go on to pursue this until later in life. Pope was a rather shy child and other than playing the occasional \"Sunday special\" at his church, he did not want to perform in public. He would practice the piano day in and day out, by himself, and eventually he would create his own arrangements by listening to the notes.\n\nAt age 14, Andrew's mother borrowed an old guitar from a cousin and placed it in Andrew's bedroom. When Pope got home from school he noticed the guitar and, never having played one before, he picked it up and began to find a few basic chords, by ear. This would lead to Pope's new obsession. He would play this guitar every day until he got his very own for Christmas later that year. The first song Pope learned to play was \"[[Tuesday's Gone]]\" by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]. He had not yet figured out all of the chords for the song, but he learned to mimic the lead guitar parts, originally created/played by Lynyrd Skynyrd's [[Gary Rossington]]. Pope would not give up until he learned what would become the very first song he taught himself to strum, one of his favorites, [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]'s \"[[My Home's in Alabama (song)|My Home's in Alabama]]\".\n\nPope wrote his first song at the age of 20, while going through a divorce. This would open the portal to his highly praised songwriting talents that many boast about today.\n\nPope would then go on to graduate from [[Gadsden State Community College]] with honors, receiving an [[Associate degree]] in [[Business administration]].\n\n== Music career ==\nAndrew Pope started performing at honky tonk bars in January 2008, alongside friend Tyler Cooper. The duo would eventually become known as \"The Midnight Rounders\",  touring the Southeast region with over 100 dates per year, often playing only for tips. In 2010, Pope formed the band, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGdHrVzn56Q Andrew Pope & Bootleg Whiskey]. They toured heavily, mainly around the Southeast region, performing over 120 shows per year. The original lineup for Andrew Pope & Bootleg Whiskey consisted of:\n\nAndrew Pope - Vocals, Guitar, Keys, Harmonica\n\nJosh Pope - Keys, Guitar, Lead Guitar\n\nKeegan Walsh - Bass Guitar\n\nScott Paulson - Drums, BGVs\n\nRay Gressett (Replaced Josh Pope in 2011) - Lead Guitar\n\nIn 2012, Pope was discovered by MillTown Records and later signed an independent deal that would bring forth his debut album, \"Here We Go\" in November 2012. The album featured songs written by Pope as well as guest appearances from [[Confederate Railroad]] and [[Jeff Cook]] from country supergroup [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]. \"Here We Go\" debuted at number 63 on the [[ITunes]] Country Album chart. After touring in support of the album, Pope began to immerse himself in his writing. From 2013 to 2016, Pope would go on to write some 300 songs. Frequent co-writers at the time included world class songwriters such as Mark Narmore, Larry Bastian, and [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]r [[Bobby Bare]].\n\nIn 2017, Pope would produce and release his second album, \"Stoned On The One\", under self owned music label Alacob Music. All songs featured on the album are written or co-written by Pope. It features guest appearances/contributions from folks such as [[The Bellamy Brothers]], [[James Otto]], and [[Larry Gatlin]]. \"Stoned On The One\" debuted at number 49 on iTunes Top Country Albums chart to high praise. Songs from the album are featured heavily in rotation on  [[Shooter Jennings]]\u2019 longtime running program, Shooter Jennings\u2019 Electric Rodeo  on [[Sirius XM]] Outlaw Country. In a 2017 [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] article, Shooter Jennings would proclaim Andrew to \"[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8468362/shooter-jennings-premieres-drunk-talks-hank-williams-jr-influence have a bright future in country music'].\n\nIn 2019, actor/singer/songwriter [[John Schneider (screen actor)]] recorded Pope\u2019s \"Stoned On The One\" for his album \"Redneck Rebel\". \"Stoned On The One\" has proved to be one of Schneider's fastest rising most successful songs to date, currently charting at number 39 on Music Row's Country Breakout Chart. On August 17, 2019, Schneider would invite Andrew as a guest to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the debut of Stoned On The One live. His performance was received to a standing ovation from the sell out crowd. Schneider says, \"This is one of the best country songs I have ever heard and I am so lucky to be able to know and get to hang out with this man, Andrew Pope\".\n\nCurrently, Pope is on tour with [[John Schneider (screen actor)]] and plans to release new music in 2020, with friend/producer [[Shooter Jennings]].\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"|[[iTunes|US Country]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Here We Go \n|  \n* Release date: November 6, 2012\n* Label: MillTown\n| 63\n|-\n!Stoned On The One\n!\n* Release date: May 5, 2017\n* Label: Alacob Music\n| 49\n!\n|}\n\n== References ==\n^ ` [https://www.djournal.com/lifestyle/arts-entertainment/pope-to-play-ponder-at-blue-canoe-on-saturday/article_93e320d9-9a8f-5093-ad89-fe6ac8e7ddba.html Pope to play, ponder at Blue Canoe on Saturday]\n\n^ ` [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8468362/shooter-jennings-premieres-drunk-talks-hank-williams-jr-influence Shooter Jennings premieres DRUNK, Talks Hank Williams Jr Influence]\n\n^ ` [http://garyhayescountry.com/shooter-jennings-jaime-wyatt-and-andrew-pope-at-the-nashville-palace/ Shooter Jennings, Jaime Wyatt, and Andrew Pope at the Nashville Palace]\n\n^ ` [https://countrymusicjunkies.com/2013/08/07/country-music-has-a-church-but-now-it-has-a-pope/#more-1732 Country music has a church, but now it has a Pope]\n\n^ ` [https://countryexclusive.com/tag/andrew-pope/ Stoned On The One Album Review]\n\n^ ` [https://yourlifeinasong.com/modern-day-crooner-andrew-pope-puts-love-rest-stoned-one-may-5th Modern Day Country Crooner Andrew Pope Puts Love To Rest On 'Stoned On The One' May 5th]\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://andrewpopemusic.com/}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pope, Andrew}}\n[[Category:People from DeKalb County, Alabama]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Alabama]]\n[[Category:1985 births]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century male singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=June 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Andrew Pope\n| image               = Andrew_Pope_(updated).jpg\n| image_size          = \n| landscape           = \n| alt                 = \n| caption             = Andrew Pope at Chicago Music Exchange in 2018 filming a performance\n| background          = solo_singer\n| birth_name          = William Andrew Pope\n| birth_date          = January 21, 1985\n| birth_place         = [[Fort Payne, Alabama]]\n| origin              = [[Geraldine, Alabama]]\n| genre               = [[Country music|Country]]\n| occupation          = Guitarist/Singer/Songwriter\n| instrument          = [[Singing|Vocals]], [[Guitar]], [[Piano]], [[Bass Guitar]]\n| years_active        = 2008-present\n| label               = Alacob Music\n| associated_acts     = \n| website             = {{url|http://andrewpopemusic.com/}}\n}}\n''' William Andrew Pope''' (born January 21, 1985) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter.

(2011) ''Chemistry for Engineering Students'', Brooks/Cole. </ref> <ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20B\" />\n\nThe definition was adopted in November 2018 as one of the seven [[SI base unit]]s,<ref name=\"IUPACrev\"/> revising the previous definition that specified it as the number of atoms in 12 [[gram]]s of [[carbon-12]] (<sup>12</sup>C), an [[isotope]] of [[carbon]].\n\nThe number {{val|6.02214076|e=23}} (the [[Avogadro number]]) was chosen so that the mass of one mole of a chemical compound, in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the average mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|daltons]]. Thus, for example, one mole of water contains {{val|6.02214076|e=23}} molecules, whose total mass is about 18.015 grams \u2013 and the mean mass of one molecule of water is about 18.015&nbsp;daltons.\n \nThe mole is widely used in chemistry as a convenient way to express amounts of reactants and products of chemical reactions. For example, the chemical equation {{nowrap|2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2H<sub>2</sub>O}} can be interpreted to mean that 2&nbsp;mol [[dihydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) and 1&nbsp;mol [[dioxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) react to form 2&nbsp;mol water (H<sub>2</sub>O).

For example, a solution may contain a certain number of dissolved molecules that are more or less independent of each other. However, in a solid the constituent particles are fixed and bound in a lattice arrangement, yet they may be separable without losing their chemical identity. Thus the solid is composed of a certain number of moles of such particles. In yet other cases, such as [[diamond]], where the entire crystal is essentially a single molecule, the mole is still used to express the number of atoms bound together, rather than a count of multiple molecules. Thus, common chemical conventions apply to the definition of the constituent particles of a substance, in other cases exact definitions may be specified.\n\n===Molar mass===\nThe [[molar mass]] of a substance is the [[mass]] of a sample, in multiples of the [[gram]], divided by the [[amount of substance]] in that sample. The amount of substance is the number of moles in the sample. It is a characteristic property of the substance.\nFor most practical purposes, its magnitude is numerically the same as that of the mean mass of one molecule, expressed in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s.  For example, the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.<ref name=BIPMrealise>[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]. \"[http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf Realising the mole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829154405/http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}.\" Retrieved 25 September 2008.</ref>  Other methods include the use of the [[molar volume]] or the measurement of [[electric charge]].<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe number of moles of a substance in a sample is obtained by dividing the mass of the sample by the molar mass of the compound.  For example, 100 g of water is about 5.551&nbsp;mol of water.<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe molar mass of a substance depends not only on its [[molecular formula]], but also on the distribution of [[isotopes]] of each chemical element present in it. For example, the mass of one mole of [[calcium-40]] is {{val|fmt=commas|39.96259098|0.00000022|u=grams}}, whereas the mass of one mole of [[calcium-42]] is {{val|fmt=commas|41.95861801|0.00000027|u=grams}}, and of one mole of [[calcium]] with the normal isotopic mix is {{val|40.078|0.004|u=grams}}.\n\n===Molar concentration===\nThe [[molar concentration]], also called ''molarity'', of a solution of some substance is the number of moles per unit of volume of the final solution. In the SI its standard unit is mol/[[Metre|m]]<sup>3</sup>, although more practical units, such as mol/litre are used.\n\n===Molar fraction===\nThe [[molar fraction]] or [[mole fraction]] of a substance in a mixture (such as a solution) is the number of moles of the compound in one sample of the mixture, divided by the total number of moles of all components.  For example, if 20 g of {{chem|NaCl}} is dissolved in 100 g of water, the amounts of the two substances in the solution will be (20 g)/(58.443 g/mol) = 0.34221&nbsp;mol and (100 g)/(18.015 g/mol) = 5.5509&nbsp;mol, respectively; and the molar fraction of {{chem|NaCl}} will be 0.34221/(0.34221 + 5.5509) = 0.05807.\n\nIn a mixture of gases, the [[partial pressure]] of each component is proportional to its molar ratio.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the mole is intertwined with that of [[molecular mass]], [[atomic mass unit]]s, the [[Avogadro number]].\n\nThe first table of [[standard atomic weight]] (atomic mass) was published by [[John Dalton]] (1766\u20131844) in 1805, based on a system in which the relative atomic mass of [[hydrogen]] was defined as 1. These relative atomic masses were based on the [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] proportions of chemical reaction and compounds, a fact that greatly aided their acceptance: It was not necessary for a chemist to subscribe to [[atomic theory]] (an unproven hypothesis at the time) to make practical use of the tables. This would lead to some confusion between atomic masses (promoted by proponents of atomic theory) and [[equivalent weight]]s (promoted by its opponents and which sometimes differed from relative atomic masses by an integer factor), which would last throughout much of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848) was instrumental in the determination of relative atomic masses to ever-increasing accuracy. He was also the first chemist to use [[oxygen]] as the standard to which other masses were referred. Oxygen is a useful standard, as, unlike hydrogen, it forms compounds with most other elements, especially [[metals]]. However, he chose to fix the atomic mass of oxygen as 100, which did not catch on.\n\n[[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt]] (1816\u201356), [[Henri Victor Regnault]] (1810\u201378) and [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]] (1826\u20131910) expanded on Berzelius' works, resolving many of the problems of unknown stoichiometry of compounds, and the use of atomic masses attracted a large consensus by the time of the [[Karlsruhe Congress]] (1860). The convention had reverted to defining the atomic mass of hydrogen as 1, although at the level of precision of measurements at that time \u2013 relative uncertainties of around 1% \u2013 this was numerically equivalent to the later standard of oxygen = 16. However the chemical convenience of having oxygen as the primary atomic mass standard became ever more evident with advances in analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass determinations.\n\nThe name ''mole'' is an 1897 translation of the German unit ''Mol'', coined by the [[chemist]] [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in 1894 from the German word ''Molek\u00fcl'' ([[molecule]]).<ref>{{Cite journal\n|first=Georg\n|last=Helm\n|year=1897\n|title=The Principles of Mathematical Chemistry: The Energetics of Chemical Phenomena\n|series=transl. by Livingston, J.; Morgan, R.\n|place=New York\n|publisher=Wiley\n|page=6\n}}</ref><ref>Some sources place the date of first usage in English as 1902.

Amount of substance can be described as mass divided by Proust's \"definite proportions\", and contains information that is missing from the measurement of mass alone. As demonstrated by [[John Dalton|Dalton's]] [[law of partial pressures]] (1803), a measurement of mass is not even necessary to measure the amount of substance (although in practice it is usual). There are many physical relationships between amount of substance and other physical quantities, the most notable one being the [[ideal gas law]] (where the relationship was first demonstrated in 1857). The term \"mole\" was first used in a textbook describing these [[colligative properties]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Similar units==\nLike chemists, chemical engineers use the unit mole extensively, but different unit multiples may be more suitable for industrial use. For example, the SI unit for volume is the cubic metre, a much larger unit than the commonly used litre in the chemical laboratory. When amount of substance is also expressed in kmol (1000 mol) in industrial-scaled processes, the numerical value of molarity remains the same.\n\nFor convenience in avoiding conversions in the [[Imperial units|imperial]] (or [[United States customary units|American customary units]]), some engineers adopted the ''pound-mole'' (notation ''lb-mol'' or ''lbmol''), which is defined as the number of entities in 12 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] of <sup>12</sup>C.  One lb-mol is equal to {{val|fmt=commas|453.59237|u=mol}},<ref name=Himmelblau>{{cite book|first=David|last = Himmelblau|year=1996|title=Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering|edition=6|isbn=978-0-13-305798-0|pages=17\u201320}}</ref> which value is the same as the number of grams in an [[international avoirdupois pound]].\n\nIn the metric system, chemical engineers once used the ''kilogram-mole'' (notation ''kg-mol''), which is defined as the number of entities in 12&nbsp;kg of <sup>12</sup>C, and often referred to the mole as the ''gram-mole'' (notation ''g-mol''), when dealing with laboratory data.<ref name=Himmelblau/>\n\nLate 20th-century chemical engineering practice came to use the ''kilomole'' (kmol), which is numerically identical to the kilogram-mole, but whose name and symbol adopt the SI convention for standard multiples of metric units \u2013 thus, kmol means 1000&nbsp;mol.  This is analogous to the use of kg instead of g. The use of kmol is not only for \"magnitude convenience\" but also makes the equations used for modelling chemical engineering systems [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]]. For example, the conversion of a flowrate of kg/s to kmol/s only requires the molecular mass without the factor 1000 unless the basic SI unit of mol/s were to be used.\n\nGreenhouse and growth chamber lighting for plants is sometimes expressed in micromoles per square metre per second, where 1&nbsp;mol photons = {{val|6.02|e=23}} photons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lighting Radiation Conversion|url=http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|accessdate=March 10, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131342/http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|archivedate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mole Day==\nOctober 23, denoted 10/23 in the US, is recognized by some as [[Mole Day]].<ref>[http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html History of National Mole Day Foundation, Inc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023075040/http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html |date=2010-10-23 }}</ref> It is an informal holiday in honor of the unit among chemists.

For example, a solution may contain a certain number of dissolved molecules that are more or less independent of each other. However, in a solid the constituent particles are fixed and bound in a lattice arrangement, yet they may be separable without losing their chemical identity. Thus the solid is composed of a certain number of moles of such particles. In yet other cases, such as [[diamond]], where the entire crystal is essentially a single molecule, the mole is still used to express the number of atoms bound together, rather than a count of multiple molecules. Thus, common chemical conventions apply to the definition of the constituent particles of a substance, in other cases exact definitions may be specified.\n\n===Molar mass===\nThe [[molar mass]] of a substance is the [[mass]] of a sample, in multiples of the [[gram]], divided by the [[amount of substance]] in that sample. The amount of substance is the number of moles in the sample. It is a characteristic property of the substance.\nFor most practical purposes, its magnitude is numerically the same as that of the mean mass of one molecule, expressed in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s.  For example, the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.<ref name=BIPMrealise>[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]. \"[http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf Realising the mole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829154405/http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_mol_en.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}.\" Retrieved 25 September 2008.</ref>  Other methods include the use of the [[molar volume]] or the measurement of [[electric charge]].<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe number of moles of a substance in a sample is obtained by dividing the mass of the sample by the molar mass of the compound.  For example, 100 g of water is about 5.551&nbsp;mol of water.<ref name=BIPMrealise/>\n\nThe molar mass of a substance depends not only on its [[molecular formula]], but also on the distribution of [[isotopes]] of each chemical element present in it. For example, the mass of one mole of [[calcium-40]] is {{val|fmt=commas|39.96259098|0.00000022|u=grams}}, whereas the mass of one mole of [[calcium-42]] is {{val|fmt=commas|41.95861801|0.00000027|u=grams}}, and of one mole of [[calcium]] with the normal isotopic mix is {{val|40.078|0.004|u=grams}}.\n\n===Molar concentration===\nThe [[molar concentration]], also called ''molarity'', of a solution of some substance is the number of moles per unit of volume of the final solution. In the SI its standard unit is mol/[[Metre|m]]<sup>3</sup>, although more practical units, such as mol/litre are used.\n\n===Molar fraction===\nThe [[molar fraction]] or [[mole fraction]] of a substance in a mixture (such as a solution) is the number of moles of the compound in one sample of the mixture, divided by the total number of moles of all components.  For example, if 20 g of {{chem|NaCl}} is dissolved in 100 g of water, the amounts of the two substances in the solution will be (20 g)/(58.443 g/mol) = 0.34221&nbsp;mol and (100 g)/(18.015 g/mol) = 5.5509&nbsp;mol, respectively; and the molar fraction of {{chem|NaCl}} will be 0.34221/(0.34221 + 5.5509) = 0.05807.\n\nIn a mixture of gases, the [[partial pressure]] of each component is proportional to its molar ratio.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the mole is intertwined with that of [[molecular mass]], [[atomic mass unit]]s, the [[Avogadro number]].\n\nThe first table of [[standard atomic weight]] (atomic mass) was published by [[John Dalton]] (1766\u20131844) in 1805, based on a system in which the relative atomic mass of [[hydrogen]] was defined as 1. These relative atomic masses were based on the [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] proportions of chemical reaction and compounds, a fact that greatly aided their acceptance: It was not necessary for a chemist to subscribe to [[atomic theory]] (an unproven hypothesis at the time) to make practical use of the tables. This would lead to some confusion between atomic masses (promoted by proponents of atomic theory) and [[equivalent weight]]s (promoted by its opponents and which sometimes differed from relative atomic masses by an integer factor), which would last throughout much of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848) was instrumental in the determination of relative atomic masses to ever-increasing accuracy. He was also the first chemist to use [[oxygen]] as the standard to which other masses were referred. Oxygen is a useful standard, as, unlike hydrogen, it forms compounds with most other elements, especially [[metals]]. However, he chose to fix the atomic mass of oxygen as 100, which did not catch on.\n\n[[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt]] (1816\u201356), [[Henri Victor Regnault]] (1810\u201378) and [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]] (1826\u20131910) expanded on Berzelius' works, resolving many of the problems of unknown stoichiometry of compounds, and the use of atomic masses attracted a large consensus by the time of the [[Karlsruhe Congress]] (1860). The convention had reverted to defining the atomic mass of hydrogen as 1, although at the level of precision of measurements at that time \u2013 relative uncertainties of around 1% \u2013 this was numerically equivalent to the later standard of oxygen = 16. However the chemical convenience of having oxygen as the primary atomic mass standard became ever more evident with advances in analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass determinations.\n\nThe name ''mole'' is an 1897 translation of the German unit ''Mol'', coined by the [[chemist]] [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in 1894 from the German word ''Molek\u00fcl'' ([[molecule]]).<ref>{{Cite journal\n|first=Georg\n|last=Helm\n|year=1897\n|title=The Principles of Mathematical Chemistry: The Energetics of Chemical Phenomena\n|series=transl. by Livingston, J.; Morgan, R.\n|place=New York\n|publisher=Wiley\n|page=6\n}}</ref><ref>Some sources place the date of first usage in English as 1902.

Amount of substance can be described as mass divided by Proust's \"definite proportions\", and contains information that is missing from the measurement of mass alone. As demonstrated by [[John Dalton|Dalton's]] [[law of partial pressures]] (1803), a measurement of mass is not even necessary to measure the amount of substance (although in practice it is usual). There are many physical relationships between amount of substance and other physical quantities, the most notable one being the [[ideal gas law]] (where the relationship was first demonstrated in 1857). The term \"mole\" was first used in a textbook describing these [[colligative properties]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Similar units==\nLike chemists, chemical engineers use the unit mole extensively, but different unit multiples may be more suitable for industrial use. For example, the SI unit for volume is the cubic metre, a much larger unit than the commonly used litre in the chemical laboratory. When amount of substance is also expressed in kmol (1000 mol) in industrial-scaled processes, the numerical value of molarity remains the same.\n\nFor convenience in avoiding conversions in the [[Imperial units|imperial]] (or [[United States customary units|American customary units]]), some engineers adopted the ''pound-mole'' (notation ''lb-mol'' or ''lbmol''), which is defined as the number of entities in 12 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] of <sup>12</sup>C.  One lb-mol is equal to {{val|fmt=commas|453.59237|u=mol}},<ref name=Himmelblau>{{cite book|first=David|last = Himmelblau|year=1996|title=Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering|edition=6|isbn=978-0-13-305798-0|pages=17\u201320}}</ref> which value is the same as the number of grams in an [[international avoirdupois pound]].\n\nIn the metric system, chemical engineers once used the ''kilogram-mole'' (notation ''kg-mol''), which is defined as the number of entities in 12&nbsp;kg of <sup>12</sup>C, and often referred to the mole as the ''gram-mole'' (notation ''g-mol''), when dealing with laboratory data.<ref name=Himmelblau/>\n\nLate 20th-century chemical engineering practice came to use the ''kilomole'' (kmol), which is numerically identical to the kilogram-mole, but whose name and symbol adopt the SI convention for standard multiples of metric units \u2013 thus, kmol means 1000&nbsp;mol.  This is analogous to the use of kg instead of g. The use of kmol is not only for \"magnitude convenience\" but also makes the equations used for modelling chemical engineering systems [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]]. For example, the conversion of a flowrate of kg/s to kmol/s only requires the molecular mass without the factor 1000 unless the basic SI unit of mol/s were to be used.\n\nGreenhouse and growth chamber lighting for plants is sometimes expressed in micromoles per square metre per second, where 1&nbsp;mol photons = {{val|6.02|e=23}} photons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lighting Radiation Conversion|url=http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|accessdate=March 10, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131342/http://www.egc.com/useful_info_lighting.php|archivedate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Mole Day==\nOctober 23, denoted 10/23 in the US, is recognized by some as [[Mole Day]].<ref>[http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html History of National Mole Day Foundation, Inc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023075040/http://www.moleday.org/htdocs/history.html |date=2010-10-23 }}</ref> It is an informal holiday in honor of the unit among chemists.

These were old-stock \"[[Yankee]]\" immigrants, descended from the [[English people|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England in the 1600s. The completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1821 caused a surge in immigration from New England to what was then the [[Northwest Territory]]. The end of the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832 increased the immigration surge of immigration, again coming from New England as a result of overpopulation combined with land shortages in that region. Some of these later settlers were from [[upstate New York]], whose relatives had moved to that region from New England shortly after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York were the vast majority of Elkhart County's inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. These settlers were primarily members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] though due to the [[Second Great Awakening]] many of them had converted to [[Methodism]] and some had become [[Baptists]] before moving west. The [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions, including those in Elkhart County are now known as the [[Church of Christ]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]. As a result of this heritage, most of Elkhart County supported the abolitionist movement before the [[American Civil War]]. Elkhart County provided substantial numbers of recruits for the [[Union Army]]. During the end of the nineteenth century, [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|German]] migrants came to Elkhart County, although most did not come directly from Europe, but had stopped in other areas in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], such as [[Ohio]].<ref>A Standard History of Elkhart County, Indiana: An Authentic Narrative of the Past, with Particular Attention to the Modern Era in the Commercial, Industrial, Educational, Civic and Social Development (Volumes 1 and 2).

These were old-stock \"[[Yankee]]\" immigrants, descended from the [[English people|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England in the 1600s. The completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1821 caused a surge in immigration from New England to what was then the [[Northwest Territory]]. The end of the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832 increased the immigration surge of immigration, again coming from New England as a result of overpopulation combined with land shortages in that region. Some of these later settlers were from [[upstate New York]], whose relatives had moved to that region from New England shortly after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York were the vast majority of Elkhart County's inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. These settlers were primarily members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] though due to the [[Second Great Awakening]] many of them had converted to [[Methodism]] and some had become [[Baptists]] before moving west. The [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions, including those in Elkhart County are now known as the [[Church of Christ]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]. As a result of this heritage, most of Elkhart County supported the abolitionist movement before the [[American Civil War]]. Elkhart County provided substantial numbers of recruits for the [[Union Army]]. During the end of the nineteenth century, [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|German]] migrants came to Elkhart County, although most did not come directly from Europe, but had stopped in other areas in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], such as [[Ohio]].<ref>A Standard History of Elkhart County, Indiana: An Authentic Narrative of the Past, with Particular Attention to the Modern Era in the Commercial, Industrial, Educational, Civic and Social Development (Volumes 1 and 2).

During his reign, the Spanish kingdoms reached the height of their influence and power. This is sometimes called the ''[[Spanish Golden Age]]''.\n\nPhilip led a highly [[national debt|debt-leveraged regime]], seeing [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1569, 1575, and 1596. This policy was partly the cause of the [[Act of Abjuration|declaration of independence]] that created the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1581. On 31 December 1584 Philip signed the [[Treaty of Joinville]], with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]] signing on behalf of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]; consequently Philip supplied a considerable annual grant to the League over the following decade to maintain the civil war in France, with the hope of destroying the French Calvinists. A devout Catholic, Philip saw himself as the defender of Catholic Europe against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He sent an [[Spanish Armada|armada]] to invade Protestant England in 1588, with the strategic aim of overthrowing [[Elizabeth I of England]] and re-establishing Catholicism there; but it was defeated in a skirmish at [[Gravelines]] (northern France) and then destroyed by storms as it circled the British Isles to return to Spain. The following year [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s naval power was able to recover after the failed invasion of the [[English Armada]] into Spain.<ref>[[Rowse, A. L.]] (1969). ''Tudor Cornwall: portrait of a society''. C. Scribner, p.400</ref><ref>\"One decisive action might have forced Philip II to the negotiating table and avoided fourteen years of continuing warfare.

Society for Nautical Research, 1990</ref>\n\nUnder Philip, about 9,000 men a year on average were recruited from Spain; in crisis years the total could rise to 20,000. Between 1567 and 1574, nearly 43,000 men left Spain to fight in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] (modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kamen|first1=Henry|title=Spain, 1469-1714: A Society of Conflict|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=150}}</ref>\n\nPhilip was described by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as \"slight of stature and round-faced, with pale blue eyes, [[Habsburg lip|somewhat prominent lip]], and pink skin, but his overall appearance is very attractive\". The Ambassador went on to say \"He dresses very tastefully, and everything that he does is courteous and gracious.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=James C.|title=Pursuit of Power: Venetian Ambassadors' Reports on Spain, Turkey, and France in the Age of Philip II 1560\u20131600|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|year=1970|pages=81\u201382}}</ref> Besides Mary I, Philip was married three other times and widowed four times.\n\n==Early life: 1527\u201344==\n[[File:Bautizo Felipe II grande.jpg|thumb|left|'The Baptism of Phillip II' in [[Valladolid]], Castile. Historical ceiling preserved in Palacio de Pimentel (Valladolid).]]\nThe son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I and V, King of the Spanish kingdoms and Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife, [[Isabella of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Isabella of Portugal]], Philip was born in the Castilian capital of [[Valladolid]] on 21 May 1527 at Palacio de Pimentel, which was owned by Don Bernardino Pimentel (the first Marqu\u00e9s de T\u00e1vara). The culture and courtly life of Castile were an important influence in his early life. He was tutored by [[Juan Mart\u00ednez Sil\u00edceo|Juan Mart\u00ednez Siliceo]], the future [[Archbishop of Toledo]]. Philip displayed reasonable aptitude in arts and letters alike. Later he would study with more illustrious tutors, including the humanist Juan Crist\u00f3bal Calvete de Estrella. Though Philip had good command over [[Latin]], Spanish, and Portuguese, he never managed to equal his father, Charles V, as a [[polyglot]]. While Philip was also a German [[archduke]] of the [[House of Habsburg]], he was seen as a foreigner in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The feeling was mutual. Philip felt himself to be culturally Spanish; he had been born in Castile and raised in the Castilian court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in the Spanish kingdoms. This would ultimately impede his succession to the imperial throne.<ref name=\"JBE\">James Boyden; Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopaedia of the Early Modern World.</ref>\n\nIn April 1528, when Philip was eleven months old, he received the oath of allegiance as heir to the crown from the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. From that time until the death of his mother Isabella in 1539, he was raised in the royal court of Castile under the care of his mother and one of her [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ladies, Dona Leonor de Mascarenhas, to whom he was devotedly attached. Philip was also close to his two sisters, [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Mar\u00eda]] and [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Juana]], and to his two pages, the Portuguese nobleman [[Ruy G\u00f3mez de Silva|Rui Gomes da Silva]] and [[Luis de Requesens]], the son of his governor Juan de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. These men would serve Philip throughout their lives, as would Antonio P\u00e9rez, his secretary from 1541.\n[[File:Philip II portrait by Titian.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Titian]], {{circa|1550}}.]]\nPhilip's martial training was undertaken by his governor, Juan de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, a Castilian nobleman who served as the [[commendador]] mayor of Castile. The practical lessons in warfare were overseen by the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] during the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|Italian Wars]]. Philip was present at the [[Siege of Perpignan (1542)|Siege of Perpignan]] in 1542 but did not see action as the Spanish army under Alba decisively defeated the besieging French forces under the [[Henry II of France|Dauphin of France]]. On his way back to Castile, Philip received the oath of allegiance of the [[Aragon]]ese Cortes at [[Monz\u00f3n]]. His political training had begun a year previously under his father, who had found his son studious, grave, and prudent beyond his years, and having decided to train and initiate him in the government of the Spanish kingdoms. The king-emperor's interactions with his son during his stay in Castile convinced him of Philip's precocity in statesmanship, so he determined to leave in his hands the [[List of Spanish regents|regency of the Spanish kingdoms]] in 1543. Philip, who had previously been made the [[Duke of Milan]] in 1540, began governing the most extensive empire in the world at the young age of sixteen.\n\nCharles left Philip with experienced advisors\u2014notably the secretary [[Francisco de los Cobos]] and the general Duke of Alba. Philip was also left with extensive written instructions that emphasised \"piety, patience, modesty, and distrust.\" These principles of Charles were gradually assimilated by his son, who would grow up to become grave, self-possessed and cautious. Personally, Philip spoke softly and had an icy self-mastery; in the words of one of his ministers, \"he had a smile that was cut by a sword.\"<ref>Encyclopedia of World Biography 2004.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy==\n{{refimprove|section|date=January 2020}}\nAfter living in the [[Netherlands]] in the early years of his reign,<ref>Parker, Geoffrey. ''The Dutch Revolt.''. London: Penguin. p.41.</ref> Philip II decided to return to Castile. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority, influenced by the growing strength of the bureaucracy. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] Empire was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the [[House of Habsburg]]. In practice, Philip often found his authority overruled by local assemblies, and his word less effective than that of local lords.<ref>Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt''. p.42.</ref>\n\nPhilip carried [[List of titles and honours of the Heir Apparent to the Spanish Throne#Titles held by the heir apparent to the Spanish Throne|several titles]] as [[List of heirs to the Spanish throne|heir to the Spanish kingdoms and empire]], including [[Prince of Asturias]]. The newest constituent kingdom in the empire was [[Kingdom of Navarre#Spanish conquest of Navarre|Navarre]], a realm invaded by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] mainly with Castilian troops (1512), and annexed to Castile with an ambiguous status (1513). [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|War across Navarre]] continued until 1528 ([[Treaty of Madrid (1526)#Madrid|Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai]]). Charles V proposed to end hostilities with King [[Henry II of Navarre]]\u2014the legitimate monarch of Navarre\u2014by marrying his son Philip to the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne III of Navarre]]. The marriage would provide a dynastic solution to instability in Navarre, making him king of all Navarre and prince of independent [[B\u00e9arn]], as well as lord of a large part of southern France. However, the French nobility under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] opposed the arrangement and successfully ended the prospects of marriage between the heirs of Habsburg and Albret in 1541.\n\n[[File:Philip II of Spain by Antonio Moro.jpg|thumb|left|Philip, in the prime of his life, by Giacomo Antonio Moro]]\n\nIn his will Charles stated his doubts over Navarre and recommended that his son give the kingdom back. Both King Charles and his son Philip II failed to abide by the elective (contractual) nature of the Crown of Navarre, and took the kingdom for granted. This sparked mounting tension not only with King Henry II and Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, but also with the Parliament of the Spanish Navarre (''Cortes'', ''The Three States'') and the ''Diputaci\u00f3n'' for breach of the [[Fueros of Navarre|realm specific laws (fueros)]]\u2014violation of the ''pactum subjectionis'' as ratified by Ferdinand. Tensions in Navarre came to a head in 1592 after several years of disagreements over the agenda of the intended parliamentary session.\n\nIn November 1592, the Parliament (''Cortes'') of Arag\u00f3n revolted against another breach of the realm-specific laws, so the Attorney General (''Justicia'') of the kingdom, Juan de Lanuza, was executed on Philip II's orders, with his secretary [[Antonio P\u00e9rez (statesman)|Antonio Perez]] taking exile in France. In Navarre the major strongholds of the kingdom were garrisoned by troops alien to the kingdom (Castilians) in conspicuous violation of the laws of Navarre, and the Parliament had long been refusing to pledge loyalty to Philip II's son and heir apparent without a proper ceremony. On 20 November 1592 a ghostly Parliament session was called, pushed by Philip II, who had arrived in [[Pamplona#Three boroughs and one city|Pamplona]] at the head of an unspecified military force, and with one only point on his agenda\u2014attendance to the session was kept blank on the minutes: unlawful appointments of trusted Castilian officials and an imposition of his son as future king of Navarre at the Santa Maria Cathedral. A ceremony was held before the bishop of Pamplona (22 November), but its customary procedure and terms were altered. Protests erupted in Pamplona, but they were quelled.\n[[File:Jooris van der Straeten - Portrait of Philip II of Spain.jpg|thumb|Philip II wearing the order of the garter by [[Jooris van der Straeten]], c. 1554]]\n\nPhilip II also grappled with the problem of the large [[Morisco]] population in the Spanish kingdoms, who were sometimes forcibly converted to Christianity by his predecessors. In 1569, the [[Morisco Revolt]] broke out in the southern province of [[Granada (province)|Granada]] in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs. Philip ordered the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces.\n\nDespite its immense dominions, the Spanish kingdoms had a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown (in contrast to France, for example, which was much more heavily populated). Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, and collection was largely farmed out to local lords. He was able to finance his military campaigns only by taxing and exploiting the local resources of his empire. The flow of income from the [[New World]] proved vital to his militant foreign policy, but nonetheless his exchequer several times faced bankruptcy.\n\nSpanish culture flourished during Philip's reign, beginning the \"[[Spanish Golden Age]]\", creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts. One of the notable artists from Phillip II's court was [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], who gained fame for her talent and unusual role as a woman artist. She was invited to the court of Madrid in 1559 and was chosen to become an attendant to [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] (1566\u20131633). Anguissola also became a lady-in-waiting and court painter for the queen, [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elizabeth de Valois]]. During her time as a court painter, Anguissola painted many official portraits of the royal family, a sharp departure from her previous personal portraits.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Koning Spanje Filips II 1-5 Philipsdaalder 1566.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Portrait of Philip II on 1/5 Philipsdaalder, struck 1566, Guelders, Low Countries]]\n\nCharles V had left his son Philip with a debt of about 36 million [[ducat]]s and an annual deficit of 1 million ducats. This debt caused Phillip II to default on loans in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1596 (including debt to Poland, known as [[Neapolitan sums]]). Lenders had no power over the King and could not force him to repay his loans. These defaults were just the beginning of Spain's economic troubles as its kings would default six more times in the next 65 years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Azar|title=War in Human Civilization|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-923663-3|page=488|edition=4.}}</ref> Aside from reducing state revenues for overseas expeditions, the domestic policies of Philip II further burdened the Spanish kingdoms and would, in the following century, contribute to its decline, as maintained by some historians.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elliott |first = J.

This made the Spanish kingdoms and its possessions difficult to rule, unlike France, which while divided into regional states, had a single [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General]]. The lack of a viable supreme assembly led to power defaulting into Philip II's hands, especially as manager and final arbiter of the constant conflict between different authorities. To deal with the difficulties arising from this situation, authority was administered by local agents appointed by the crown and viceroys carrying out crown instructions. Philip II felt it necessary to be involved in the detail, and he presided over specialised councils for state affairs, finance, war, and the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].\n\nPhilip II played groups against each other, leading to a system of checks and balances that managed affairs inefficiently, even to the extent of damaging state business, as in the [[Antonio P\u00e9rez (statesman)|Perez affair]]. Following a fire in Valladolid in 1561, he resisted calls to move his Court to [[Lisbon]], an act that could have curbed centralisation and bureaucracy domestically as well as relaxed rule in the Empire as a whole. Instead, with the traditional Royal and [[Primate of Spain|Primacy]] seat of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] now essentially obsolete, he moved his Court to the Castilian stronghold of [[Madrid]]. Except for a brief period under [[Philip III of Spain]], Madrid has remained the capital of Spain. It was around this time that Philip II converted the [[Royal Alc\u00e1zar of Madrid]] into a royal palace. The works, which lasted from 1561 until 1598, were done by tradesmen that came from the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], and [[France]].\n\nKing Philip II ruled at a critical turning point in European history toward [[modernity]] whereas his father Charles V had been forced to an itinerant rule as a medieval king. He mainly directed state affairs, even when not at Court. Indeed, when his health began failing, he worked from his quarters at the Palace-Monastery-Pantheon of [[El Escorial]] that he had built in 1584, a palace built as a monument to Spain's role as a center of the Christian world. But Philip did not enjoy the supremacy that [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] would in the next century, nor was such a rule necessarily possible at his time. The inefficiencies of the Spanish state and the restrictively regulated industry under his rule were common to many contemporary countries. Further, the dispersal of the [[Morisco]]s from Granada \u2013 motivated by the fear they might support a Muslim invasion \u2013 had serious negative effects on the economy{{fact|date=July 2019}}, particularly in that region.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8667 Philipppus II.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philip II]]\n\nPhilip's foreign policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic objectives. He considered himself the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman Turks]] and against the forces of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He never relented from his fight against [[heresy]], defending the Catholic faith and limiting freedom of worship within his territories.<ref>As Philip wrote in 1566 to [[Luis de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Requesens|Luis de Requesens]]: \"You can assure his Holiness that rather than suffer the least injury to religion and the service of God, I would lose all my states and a hundred lives if I had them, for I do not intend to rule over heretics.\" {{Harvnb|Pettegree|2002|p=214}}.</ref> These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where Protestantism had taken deep root. Following the [[Revolt of the Netherlands]] in 1568, Philip waged a campaign against Dutch heresy and secession. It also dragged in the English and the French at times and expanded into the German Rhineland with the [[Cologne War]]. This series of conflicts lasted for the rest of his life. Philip's constant involvement in European wars took a significant toll on the treasury and caused economic difficulties for the Crown and even bankruptcies.\n\nIn 1588, the English defeated Philip's [[Spanish Armada]], thwarting his planned invasion of the country to reinstate Catholicism. But [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war with England]] continued for the next sixteen years, in a complex series of struggles that included France, Ireland and the main battle zone, the [[Low Countries]]. It would not end until all the leading protagonists, including himself, had died. Earlier, however, after several setbacks in his reign and especially that of his father, Philip did achieve a decisive victory against the Turks at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Lepanto]] in 1571, with the allied fleet of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], which he had put under the command of his illegitimate brother, [[John of Austria]]. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of [[Iberian Union|Portugal]].\n\nWith regard to Philip's overseas possessions, in response to the reforms imposed by the Ordenanzas, extensive questionnaires were distributed to every major town and region in New Spain called [[relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]]. These surveys helped the Spanish monarchy to govern these overseas conquests more effectively.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian Wars}}\n\nCharles V abdicated the throne of Naples to Philip on 25 July 1554, and the young king was invested with the kingdom (officially called \"Naples and Sicily\") on 2 October by [[Pope Julius III]]. The date of Charles' abdication of the throne of Sicily is uncertain, but Philip was invested with this kingdom (officially \"Sicily and Jerusalem\") on 18 November 1554 by Julius.<ref>[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', vol. 2 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 935\u201336 and notes.</ref> In 1556, Philip decided to invade the [[Papal States]] and temporarily held territory there, perhaps in response to [[Pope Paul IV]]'s anti-Spanish outlook. According to Philip II, he was doing it for the benefit of the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nIn a letter from [[Francisco de Vargas y Mexia|Francisco de Vargas]] to the Princess Dowager of Portugal, Regent of the Spanish kingdoms, dated 22 September 1556, it is written:\n{{quote|I have reported to your Highness what has been happening here, and how far the Pope is going in his fury and vain imaginings. His Majesty could not do otherwise than have a care for his reputation and dominions. I am sure your Highness will have had more recent news from the Duke of Alva, who has taken the field with an excellent army and has penetrated so far into the Pope's territory that his cavalry is raiding up to ten miles from Rome, where there is such panic that the population would have run away had not the gates been closed. The Pope has fallen ill with rage, and was struggling with a fever on the 16th of this month. The two Carafa brothers, the Cardinal and Count Montorio, do not agree, and they and Piero Strozzi are not on as good terms as they were in the past. They would like to discuss peace. The best thing would be for the Pope to die, for he is the poison at the root of all this trouble and more which may occur. His Majesty's intention is only to wrest the knife from this madman's hand and make him return to a sense of his dignity, acting like the protector of the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]], in whose name, and that of the [[College of Cardinals]], his Majesty has publicly proclaimed that he has seized all he is occupying. The Pope is now sending again to the potentates of Italy for help. I hope he will gain as little thereby as he has done in the past, and that the French will calm down. May God give us peace in the end, as their Majesties desire and deserve!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol13/pp275-280|title=Spain: September 1556|editor=Royall Tyler |publisher=Institute of Historical Research|year=1954|work=Calendar of State Papers, Spain, Vol. 13: 1554\u20131558|access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn response to the invasion, [[Pope Paul IV]] called for a French military intervention. After minor fights in Lazio and near Rome, [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Fernando Alvarez de Toledo]] (Duke of Alba and Viceroy of Naples) met [[Carlo Carafa|Cardinal Carlo Carafa]] and signed the ''treaty of [[Cave, Lazio|Cave]]'' as a compromise: French and Spanish forces left the Papal states and the Pope declared a neutral position between France and the Spanish kingdoms.<ref name=\"fiuRebiba\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1555-ii.htm|access-date=21 April 2010|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church |author=Salvador Miranda|year=2010|publisher=[[Florida International University]]}}</ref>\n\nPhilip led the Spanish kingdoms into the final phase of the [[Italian Wars]]. A Spanish advance into France from the Low Countries led to their important victory at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)| Battle of St. Quentin]] in 1557. The French were defeated again at the [[Battle of Gravelines (1558)| Battle of Gravelines]] in 1558. The resulting [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] in 1559 secured [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] to the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and [[Corsica]] to the [[Republic of Genoa]]. Both Genoa and Savoy were allies of Spain and, although Savoy subsequently declared its neutrality between France and Spain, Genoa remained a crucial financial ally for Philip during his entire reign. The treaty also confirmed Philip's direct control over [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], Sicily, and [[Sardinia]]. Therefore, all of southern Italy was under direct Spanish rule. Sicily and Naples were viceroyalties of the [[Crown of Castile]], while Sardinia was part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In the north, Milan was a Duchy of the Holy Roman Empire held by Philip. Attached to the Kingdom of Naples, the [[State of Presidi]] in Tuscany gave Philip the possibility to monitor maritime traffic to southern Italy. The [[Council of Italy]] was set up by Philip in order to co-ordinate his rule over the states of Milan, Naples and Sicily. Ultimately, the treaty ended the 60-year Franco-Habsburg wars for supremacy in Italy. It marked also the beginning of a period of peace between the Pope and Philip, as their European interests converged, although political differences remained and diplomatic contrasts eventually re-emerged.\n\nBy the end of the wars in 1559, [[Habsburg Spain]] had been established as the premier power of Europe, to the detriment of France. In France, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] was fatally wounded in a joust held during the celebrations of the peace. His death led to the accession of his 15-year-old son [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], who in turn soon died. The French monarchy was thrown into turmoil, which increased further with the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]] that would last for several decades. The states of Italy were reduced to second-rate powers, and Milan and Naples were annexed directly to Aragon. Mary Tudor's death in 1558 enabled Philip to seal the treaty by marrying Henry II's daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois]], later giving him a claim to the throne of France on behalf of his daughter by Elisabeth, [[Isabel Clara Eugenia]].\n\n===France===\n{{main|French Wars of Religion}}\nThe French Wars of Religion (1562\u201398) were primarily fought between French Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). The conflict involved the factional disputes between the aristocratic houses of France, such as the House of Bourbon and House of Guise (Lorraine), and both sides received assistance from foreign sources.\n\nPhilip signed the [[Treaty of Vaucelles]] with Henry II of France in 1556. Based on the terms of the treaty, the territory of [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] in [[Burgundy]] was to be relinquished to Philip. However, the treaty was broken shortly afterwards. France and the Spanish kingdoms waged war in northern France and Italy over the following years. Spanish victories at St. Quentin and Gravelines led to the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, in which France recognised Spanish sovereignty over Franche-Comt\u00e9.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Portuguese Succession]], the pretender [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Ant\u00f3nio]] fled to France following his defeats and, as Philip's armies had not yet occupied the [[Azores]], he sailed there with a large Anglo-French fleet under [[Filippo di Piero Strozzi|Filippo Strozzi]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] exile in the service of France. The naval [[Battle of Terceira]] took place on 26 July 1582, in the sea near the [[Azores Islands|Azores]], off [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island]], as part of the War of the Portuguese Succession and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)]]. The Spanish navy defeated the combined Anglo-French fleet that had sailed to preserve control of the Azores under Ant\u00f3nio. The French naval contingent was the largest French force sent overseas before the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref>Jan Glete p.156</ref>\n\n[[File:PhilipIIbust.JPG|thumb|A [[marble]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Philip II of Spain by [[Leone Leoni|Pompeo Leoni, son of Leone Leoni]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe Spanish victory at Terceira was followed by the [[Conquest of the Azores|Battle of the Azores]] between the Portuguese loyal to the claimant Ant\u00f3nio, supported by French and English troops, and the Spanish-Portuguese forces loyal to Philip commanded by the admiral Don [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n]]. Victory in Azores completed the incorporation of [[Spanish Empire|Portugal into the Spanish Empire]].<ref>Nascimiento Rodrigues/Tessaleno Devezas p.122</ref>\n\nPhilip financed the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] during the French Wars of Religion. He directly intervened in the final phases of the wars (1589\u20131598), ordering the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] into France in an effort to unseat [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and perhaps dreaming of placing his favourite daughter, Isabel Clara Eugenia, on the French throne. Elizabeth of Valois, Philip's third wife and Isabella's mother, had already ceded any claim to the French Crown with her marriage to Philip. However the [[Parliament of Paris]], in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella Clara Eugenia was \"the legitimate sovereign\" of France. Philip's interventions in the fighting \u2013 sending the Duke of Parma to end Henry IV's [[Siege of Paris, 1590|siege of Paris]] in 1590 and the [[Siege of Rouen (1591)|siege of Rouen]] in 1592 \u2013 contributed in saving the French Catholic Leagues's cause against a Protestant monarchy.\n\nIn 1593, Henry agreed to convert to Catholicism; weary of war, most French Catholics switched to his side against the hardline core of the Catholic League, who were portrayed by Henry's propagandists as puppets of a foreign monarch, Philip. By the end of 1594 certain League members were still working against Henry across the country, but all relied on the support of the Spanish Crown. In January 1595, therefore, Henry officially declared war on the Spanish Crown, to show Catholics that Philip was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French state, and Protestants that he had not become a puppet of the Spanish Crown through his conversion, while hoping to reconquer large parts of northern France from the Franco-Spanish Catholic forces.<ref>Knecht French Civil Wars p272</ref>\n\nFrench victory at the [[Battle of Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise]] in Burgundy, 5 June 1595, marked an end to the Catholic League in France. The French also made some progress during an invasion of the Spanish Netherlands. They captured [[Ham, Belgium|Ham]] and massacred the small Spanish garrison, provoking anger among the Spanish ranks.{{cn|date=January 2020}} The Spanish launched a concerted offensive that year, taking [[Siege of Doullens|Doullens]], [[Cambrai]], and [[Siege of Le Catelet (1595)|Le Catelet]]; at Doullens, they massacred 4,000 of its citizens.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goubert |first1= Pierre |title=The Course of French History |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |page=103}}</ref> On 24 April 1596, the Spanish also [[Siege of Calais (1596)|conquered Calais]]. Following the Spanish capture of [[Amiens]] in March 1597, the French Crown laid siege to it until it managed to [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|reconquer Amiens]] from the overstretched Spanish forces in September 1597. Henry then negotiated a peace with the Spanish Crown. The war was only drawn to an official close, however, after the [[Edict of Nantes]], with the [[Peace of Vervins]] in May 1598.\n\nThe 1598 Treaty of Vervins was largely a restatement of the 1559 Peace of C\u00e2teau-Cambr\u00e9sis and Spanish forces and subsidies were withdrawn; meanwhile, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, which offered a high degree of religious toleration for French Protestants. The military interventions in France thus failed to oust Henry from the throne or suppress Protestantism in France, and yet they had played a decisive part in helping the French Catholic cause gain the conversion of Henry, ensuring that Catholicism would remain France's official and majority faith \u2013 matters of paramount importance for the devoutly Catholic Spanish king.\n\n===Mediterranean===\n{{further|Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars}}\n[[File:Felipe IV offers Ferdinand to Glory.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]; after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, Philip offers his short-lived heir [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias|Fernando]] to Glory in this [[allegory]]]]\n[[File:Tercio - Morados Viejos.svg|thumb|[[Standard (flag)|Standard]] of the {{lang|es|[[tercio]]s morados}} of the Spanish army under Philip II]]\n\nIn the early part of his reign Philip was concerned with the rising power of the Ottoman Empire under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. Fear of Islamic domination in the Mediterranean caused him to pursue an aggressive foreign policy.\n\nIn 1558, Turkish admiral [[Piyale Pasha]] captured the [[Balearic Islands]], especially inflicting great damage on [[Menorca]] and enslaving many, while raiding the coasts of the Spanish mainland. Philip appealed to the Pope and other powers in Europe to bring an end to the rising [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] threat. Since his father's losses against the Ottomans and against [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] in 1541, the major European sea powers in the Mediterranean, namely the Spanish Crown and [[Venice]], became hesitant in confronting the Ottomans. The myth of \"Turkish invincibility\" was becoming a popular story, causing fear and panic among the people.\n\nIn 1560, Philip II organised a ''Holy League'' between the Spanish kingdoms and the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Papal States]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. The joint fleet was assembled at [[Messina]] and consisted of 200 ships (60 galleys and 140 other vessels) carrying a total of 30,000 soldiers under the command of [[Giovanni Andrea Doria]], nephew of the famous Genoese admiral [[Andrea Doria]].\n\nOn 12 March 1560, the Holy League captured the island of [[Djerba]], which had a strategic location and could control the sea routes between [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]]. As a response, Suleiman sent an Ottoman fleet of 120 ships under the command of Piyale Pasha, which arrived at Djerba on 9 May 1560. The battle lasted until 14 May 1560, and the forces of Piyale Pasha and [[Turgut Reis]] (who joined Piyale Pasha on the third day of the battle) won an overwhelming victory at the [[Battle of Djerba]]. The Holy League lost 60 ships (30 galleys) and 20,000 men, and Giovanni Andrea Doria was barely able to escape with a small vessel. The Ottomans retook the Fortress of Djerba, whose Spanish commander, D. [[\u00c1lvaro de Sande]], attempted to escape with a ship but was followed and eventually captured by Turgut Reis. In 1565 the Ottomans sent [[Siege of Malta (1565)|a large expedition to Malta]], which laid siege to several forts on the island, taking some of them. The Spanish sent a relief force, which finally drove the Ottoman army out of the island.\n\nThe grave threat posed by the increasing Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean was reversed in one of history's most decisive battles, with the destruction of nearly the entire Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, by the Holy League under the command of Philip's half brother, [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]]. A fleet sent by Philip, again commanded by Don John, reconquered Tunis from the Ottomans in 1573. The Turks soon rebuilt their fleet, and in 1574 [[Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis]] managed to recapture [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Tunis]] with a force of 250 galleys and a siege that lasted 40 days. Thousands of Spanish and Italian soldiers became prisoners. Nevertheless, Lepanto marked a permanent reversal in the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean and the end of the threat of Ottoman control. In 1585 a peace treaty was signed with the Ottomans.\n\n==Colonial policy==\n===Strait of Magellan===\nDuring Philip's reign Spain considered the [[Pacific Ocean]] a ''[[Mare clausum]]'' \u2013 a sea closed to other naval powers.

He appointed [[Margaret of Parma]] as Governor of the Netherlands, when he left the low countries for the Spanish kingdoms in 1559, but forced her to adjust policy to the advice of [[Cardinal Granvelle]], who was greatly disliked in the Netherlands, after he insisted on direct control over events in the Netherlands despite being over two weeks' ride away in Madrid. There was discontent in the Netherlands about Philip's taxation demands and the incessant [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|persecution]] of Protestants. In 1566, Protestant preachers sparked anti-clerical riots known as the [[Dutch Revolt#1566 \u2014 Iconoclasm and repression|Iconoclast Fury]]; in response to growing Protestant influence, the army of the Iron Duke ([[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]]) went on the offensive. In 1568, Alba had two Flemish nobles executed in [[Brussels]]' [[Grand Place|central square]], further alienating the local aristocracy.

The Portuguese suffered 4,000 killed, wounded, or captured, while the Spanish sustained only 500 casualties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Spencer C. |title=500 Great Military Leaders [2 volumes] |date=2014 |page=19}}</ref> The troops commanded by [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo]] the 3rd [[Duke of Alba]]<ref>Geoffrey Parker ''The army of Flanders and the Spanish road'', London, 1972 {{ISBN|0-521-08462-8}}, p. 35</ref> imposed subjection to Philip before entering Lisbon, where he seized an immense treasure.<ref>[[Henry Kamen]], ''The duke of Alba'' (New Haven\u2013London: Yale University Press, 2004), Pp. x + 204.</ref> Philip II of Spain was crowned ''Philip I'' of Portugal in 1581 (recognized as king by the [[Portuguese Cortes]] of [[Tomar]]) and a near sixty-year [[personal union]] under the rule of the [[Philippine Dynasty]] began. This gave Philip control of the extensive [[Portuguese empire]]. When Philip left for Madrid in 1583, he made his nephew [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert of Austria]] his viceroy in Lisbon. In Madrid he established a [[Council of Portugal]] to advise him on Portuguese affairs, giving prominent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish courts, and allowing Portugal to maintain autonomous law, currency, and government. This is on the well-established pattern of [[Polysynodial System|rule by councils]].\n\n[[File:ImperioDeFelipeII.svg|thumb|Spanish Empire of Philip II, III and IV including all charted and claimed territories, maritime claims (mare clausum) and other features.]]\n\n==Relations with England and Ireland==\n\n===King of England and Ireland===\n[[File:Philip II.jpg|thumb|Titian portrait of Philip as prince (1554), aged about twenty-four dressed in a lavishly decorated set of armour.]]\n\nPhilip's father arranged his marriage to 37-year-old Queen [[Mary I of England]], Charles' maternal first cousin. His father ceded the crown of Naples, as well as his claim to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], to him. Their marriage at [[Winchester Cathedral]] on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip's view of the affair was entirely political. Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] petitioned Mary to consider marrying an Englishman, preferring [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon|Edward Courtenay]].\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain]], Philip was to enjoy Mary I's titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. Coins were also to show the heads of both Mary and Philip. The marriage treaty also provided that England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father in any war. The Privy Council instructed that Philip and Mary should be joint signatories of royal documents, and this was enacted by an Act of Parliament, which gave him the title of king and stated that he \"shall aid her Highness ... in the happy administration of her Grace's realms and dominions.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=George Burton |editor-last2=Stephens |editor-first2=H.

The couple's joint royal style after Philip ascended the Spanish throne in 1556 was: ''Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, Spain, France, Jerusalem, both the Sicilies and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tirol''.\n\nHowever, the couple had no children. Mary died in 1558 before the union could revitalise the Roman Catholic Church in England. With her death, Philip lost his rights to the English throne (including the ancient [[English claims to the French throne]]) and ceased to be King of England, Ireland and (as claimed by them) France.\n\nPhilip's distaff great-grandson, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], married [[Princess Henrietta of England]] in 1661; in 1807, the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] claim to the British throne passed to the descendants of their child [[Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans]].\n\n===After Mary I's death===\n{{further|Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)}}\n[[File:Dominios de Felipe II.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Philip's European and North African dominions in 1581]]\n\nUpon Mary's death, the throne went to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] I. Philip had no wish to sever his tie with England, and had sent a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. However, she delayed in answering, and in that time learned Philip was also considering a [[House of Valois|Valois]] alliance. Elizabeth I was the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII and [[Anne Boleyn]]. This union was deemed illegitimate by English Catholics, who disputed the validity of both the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and of his subsequent marriage to Boleyn, and hence claimed that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], the Catholic great granddaughter of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], was the legitimate heir to the throne.\n\nFor many years Philip maintained peace with England, and even defended Elizabeth from the Pope's threat of excommunication. This was a measure taken to preserve a European balance of power. Ultimately, Elizabeth allied England with the Protestant rebels in the Netherlands. Further, English ships began a policy of piracy against Spanish trade and threatened to plunder the great Spanish treasure ships coming from the new world. English ships went so far as to attack a Spanish port. The last straw for Philip was the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] signed by Elizabeth in 1585 \u2013 promising troops and supplies to the rebels. Although it can be argued this English action was the result of Philip's [[Treaty of Joinville]] with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]], Philip considered it an act of war by England.\n\nThe execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 ended Philip's hopes of placing a Catholic on the English throne. He turned instead to more direct plans to invade England and return the country to Catholicism. In 1588, he sent a fleet, the [[Spanish Armada]], to rendezvous with the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]'s army and convey it across the English Channel. However, the operation had little chance of success from the beginning, because of lengthy delays, lack of communication between Philip II and his two commanders and the lack of a deep bay for the fleet. At the point of attack, a storm struck the [[English Channel]], already known for its harsh currents and choppy waters, which devastated large numbers of the Spanish fleet. There was a tightly fought battle against the English [[Royal Navy]]; it was by no means a slaughter (only 1 Spanish ship was sunk),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=R. G. |title=1001 Battles That Changed the Course of History |date=2017 |page=296}}</ref> but the Spanish were forced into a retreat, and the overwhelming majority of the Armada was destroyed by the harsh weather. Whilst the English Royal Navy may not have destroyed the Armada at the Battle of Gravelines, they had prevented it from linking up with the army it was supposed to convey across the channel. Thus whilst the English Royal Navy may have only won a slight tactical victory over the Spanish, it had delivered a major strategic one\u2014preventing the invasion of England. Through a week of fighting the Spanish had expended 100,000 cannonballs, but no English ship was seriously damaged.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Spencer |title=Battles that Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict |date=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=183}}</ref> However, over 7,000 English sailors died from disease during the time the Armada was in English water.\n\nThe defeat of the Spanish Armada gave great heart to the Protestant cause across Europe. The storm that smashed the Armada was seen by many of Philip's enemies as a sign of the will of God. Many Spaniards blamed the admiral of the Armada for its failure, but Philip, despite his complaint that he had sent his ships to fight the English, not the elements, was not among them. A year later, Philip remarked:\n\n{{Cquote|It is impiety, and almost blasphemy to presume to know the will of God. It comes from the sin of pride. Even kings, Brother Nicholas, must submit to being used by God's will without knowing what it is. They must never seek to use it.|4=Philip II}}\n\nA measure of the character of Philip can be gathered by the fact that he personally saw to it that the wounded men of the Armada were treated and received pensions, and that the families of those who died were compensated for their loss, which was highly unusual for the time.\n\nWhile the invasion had been averted, England was unable to take advantage of this success. An attempt to use her newfound advantage at sea with a [[English Armada|counter-armada]] the following year failed disastrously with 40 ships sunk and 15,000 men lost.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez Duro, Ces\u00e1reo (1972).

Madrid. p.51</ref> Likewise, English buccaneering and attempts to seize territories in the Caribbean were defeated by Spain's rebuilt navy and their improved intelligence networks (although [[Capture of C\u00e1diz|C\u00e1diz was destroyed]] by an Anglo-Dutch force after a failed attempt to seize the treasure fleet). The Habsburgs also struck back with the [[Dunkirkers]], who took an increasing toll of Dutch and English shipping.\n\nEventually, the Spanish attempted two further Armadas, in October 1596 and October 1597.  The [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596 Armada]] was destroyed in a storm off northern Spain; it had lost as many as 72 of its 126 ships and suffered 3,000 deaths. The [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597 Armada]] was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast undetected. This [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)]] would be fought to a grinding end, but not until both Philip II (d. 1598) and Elizabeth I (d. 1603) were dead. Some of the fighting was done on land in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands, with the English sending expeditionary forces to France and the Netherlands to fight Spain, and Spain attempting to assist Irish rebellions in Ireland.\n\n==Death==\nPhilip II died in [[El Escorial]], near Madrid, on 13 September 1598, of [[cancer]].<ref>{{citation|last=Koenigsberger|first=Helmut Georg|title=Philip II|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|year=2012|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/456081/Philip-II|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref> He was succeeded by his 20-year-old son, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]].\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of Philip II of Spain}}\n[[File:Philip II's realms in 1598.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Philip's dominions in 1598]]\n\nUnder Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power. However, in spite of the great and increasing quantities of gold and silver flowing into his coffers from the American mines, the riches of the Portuguese spice trade, and the enthusiastic support of the Habsburg dominions for the [[Counter-Reformation]], he would never succeed in suppressing Protestantism or defeating the Dutch rebellion. Early in his reign, the Dutch might have laid down their weapons if he had desisted in trying to suppress Protestantism,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} but his devotion to Catholicism would not permit him to do so. He was a devout Catholic and exhibited the typical 16th century disdain for religious heterodoxy; he said, \"Before suffering the slightest damage to religion in the service of God, I would lose all of my estates and a hundred lives, if I had them, because I do not wish nor do I desire to be the ruler of heretics.\"<ref>{{YouTube|id=qhlAqklH0do#t=21m27s|title=The Myth of the Spanish Inquisition}} (at 21:27 \u2013 21:40). BBC.</ref>\n\nAs he strove to enforce Catholic orthodoxy through an intensification of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], students were barred from studying elsewhere, and books printed by Spaniards outside the kingdom were banned. Even a highly respected churchman like [[Bartolome Carranza|Archbishop Carranza]] of Toledo was jailed by the Inquisition for 17 years, for publishing ideas that seemed sympathetic in some degree with Protestantism. Such strict enforcement of orthodox belief was successful, and Spain avoided the religiously inspired strife tearing apart other European dominions.\n\nThe [[School of Salamanca]] flourished under his reign. [[Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta]], highly honoured at Rome by several popes and looked on as an oracle of learning, published his ''Manuale sive Enchiridion Confessariorum et Poenitentium'' (Rome, 1568), long a classical text in the schools and in ecclesiastical practice.\n\n[[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]], generally regarded as the greatest scholastic after [[Thomas Aquinas]] and regarded during his lifetime as being the greatest living philosopher and theologian, was writing and lecturing, not only in Spain but also in Rome (1580\u20131585), where [[Pope Gregory XIII]] attended the first lecture that he gave. [[Luis de Molina]] published his ''De liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia'' (1588), wherein he put forth the doctrine attempting to reconcile the [[omniscience]] of God with human [[free will]] that came to be known as [[Molinism]], thereby contributing to what was one of the most important intellectual debates of the time; Molinism became the ''de facto'' [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] doctrine on these matters, and is still advocated today by [[William Lane Craig]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]], among others.\n\n[[File:Felipe II de Espa\u00f1a 01.jpg|upright|thumb|Statue of Philip II at the [[Sabatini Gardens]] in Madrid ([[Felipe de Castro|F.

''Felipe II y su tiempo''. Espasa Calpe, Madrid, 6th Ed. {{ISBN|84-239-9736-7}}.

In a more recent example of popular culture, Philip II's portrayal in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937) is not entirely unsympathetic; he is shown as a very hardworking, intelligent, religious, somewhat paranoid ruler whose prime concern is his country, but who had no understanding of the English, despite his former co-monarchy there.\n\nEven in countries that remained Catholic, primarily France and the Italian states, fear and envy of Spanish success and domination created a wide receptiveness for the worst possible descriptions of Philip II. Although some efforts have been made to separate legend from reality,<ref>Hume, Martin. ''Philip II of Spain'', London, 1897. Martin tried to retrieve the prejudiced views on the king at his time, something Carl Bratli also tried to do in his ''Filip of Spanien'' (Koebenhaven, 1909). Their works oppose to those of Ludwig Pfandl, ''Felipe II. Bosquejo de una vida y un tiempo'', Munich, 1938, who assessed very negatively Felipe's personality</ref> that task has proved extremely difficult, since many prejudices are rooted in the cultural heritage of European countries. Spanish-speaking historians tend to assess his political and military achievements, sometimes deliberately avoiding issues such as the king's lukewarmness (or even support) toward Catholic fanaticism.<ref>In his work, ''Felipe II'' (Madrid, 1943) W.T. Walsh depicts Felipe's reign as a prosperous and successful one, tending to make an apology of it. Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez, in ''Espa\u00f1a y los espa\u00f1oles en la Edad Moderna'' (Salamanca, 1979), points out how White Legend supporters flourished during the 1940s and 1950s, and how they omitted the darkest issues of Felipe's reign</ref> English-speaking historians tend to show Philip II as a fanatical, despotical, criminal, imperialist monster,<ref>Those kinds of adjectives can be read in M. Van Durme's 1953 ''El Cardenal Granvela''</ref> minimising his military victories ([[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]], [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of Saint Quentin]], etc.) to mere anecdotes, and magnifying his defeats (namely the [[Invincible Armada]]<ref>Cabrera de C\u00f3rdoba, ''Felipe II rey de Espa\u00f1a'', ed. RAH, 1877, criticizes how Felipe's victories are being minimised by English historians, and points out the small consequences of defeats such as the Invincible Armada</ref>) even though at the time those defeats did not result in great political or military changes in the balance of power in Europe. Moreover, it has been noted that objectively assessing Philip's reign would necessitate a re-analysis of the reign of his greatest opponents, namely England's Queen [[Elizabeth I]] and the Dutch [[William the Silent]], who are popularly regarded as great heroes in their home nations; if Philip II is to be shown to the English or Dutch public in a more favourable light, Elizabeth and William would lose their cold-blooded, fanatical enemy, thus decreasing their own patriotic accomplishments.{{NoteTag|This appreciation is noted by Martin Hume in his aforementioned work (\"Philip II of Spain\", London 1897), pointing out how difficult is to show Philip II in a more favorable light to his fellow Englishmen because of that.}}\n\nPhilip II's reign can hardly be characterised by its failures. He ended French Valois ambitions in Italy and brought about the Habsburg ascendency in Europe. He commenced settlements in the [[Philippines]], which were named after him,{{NoteTag|The Philippine archipelago was first sighted by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] on his expedition to the Spice Islands, but it was during Philip's reign that Spanish explorer [[Ruy Lopez de Villalobos]] renamed them from the archipelago of St. Lazarus to ''Las Islas Filipinas'' in Philip's honour.}} and established the first trans-Pacific trade route between America and Asia. He secured the Portuguese kingdom and empire. He succeeded in increasing the importation of silver in the face of English, Dutch, and French privateers, overcoming multiple financial crises and consolidating Spain's overseas empire. Although clashes would be ongoing, he ended the major threat posed to Europe by the Ottoman navy.\n\n== Titles, honours and styles ==\n[[File:Cannon with arms of Philip II as King of England and Ireland.jpg|thumb|Cannon with arms of Philip II as King of Spain and ''jure uxoris'' King of England and France.]]\n\n* Heir titles\n** [[Prince of Gerona]]: 21 May 1527 \u2013 16 January 1556\n** [[Prince of Asturias]] 1528\u20131556\n* [[List of Castilian monarchs|King of Castile]] as '''Philip II''': 16 January 1556 \u2013 13 September 1598\n** King of Castile, of Le\u00f3n, of Granada, of Toledo, of Galicia, of Seville, of Cordoba, of Murcia, of Jaen, of the Algarves, of Algeciras, of Gibraltar, of the Canary Islands, of the Indias, the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea.{{NoteTag|With la incorporation of Portugal to the Monarchy the title changed to East and West Indies, the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean sea.}} Lord of Molina.\n** [[Lord of Biscay]].\n* [[List of Aragonese monarchs|King of Aragon]] as '''Philip I''': 16 January 1556 \u2013 13 September 1598\n** King of Arag\u00f3n.\n** King of the Two Sicilies.\n*** [[List of kings of Naples|King of Naples]], of Jerusalem: Since 25 July 1554.\n*** [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]].

She was a daughter of Philip's maternal uncle, [[John III of Portugal]], and paternal aunt, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]]. They were married at [[Salamanca]] on 12 November 1543. The marriage produced one son in 1545, after which Maria died 4 days later due to haemorrhage:\n* [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]] (8 July 1545 \u2013 24 July 1568), died unmarried and without issue.\n\nPhilip's second wife was his first cousin once removed, Queen [[Mary I of England]]. The marriage, which took place on 25 July 1554 at [[Winchester Cathedral]], was political. By this marriage, Philip became ''[[jure uxoris]]'' [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] and [[King of Ireland|Ireland]], although the couple was apart more than together as they ruled their respective countries. The marriage produced no children, although there was a [[false pregnancy]], and Mary died in 1558, ending Philip's reign in England and Ireland.\n\nPhilip's third wife was [[Elisabeth of Valois]], the eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]]. The original ceremony was conducted by proxy (the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] standing in for Philip) at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] prior to Elisabeth's departure from France. The actual ceremony was conducted in [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]] upon her arrival in Spain. During their marriage (1559\u20131568) they conceived five daughters and a son, though only two of the girls survived. Elisabeth died a few hours after the loss of her last child. Their children were:\n* Stillborn son (1560)\n* Miscarried twin daughters (August 1564).\n* [[Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella Clara Eugenia]] (12 August 1566 \u2013 1 December 1633), married [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]],\n* [[Catherine Michelle of Spain|Catherine Michelle]] (10 October 1567 \u2013 6 November 1597), married [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], and had issue.\n* Miscarried daughter (3 October 1568).\n\nPhilip's fourth and final wife was his niece, [[Anna of Austria (1549\u20131580)|Anna of Austria]]. By contemporary accounts, this was a convivial and satisfactory marriage (1570\u20131580) for both Philip and Anna. This marriage produced four sons and one daughter. Anna died of heart failure 8 months after giving birth to Maria in 1580. Their children were:\n* [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias]] (4 December 1571 \u2013 18 October 1578), died young.\n* Charles Laurence (12 August 1573 \u2013 30 June 1575), died young.\n* [[Diego, Prince of Asturias]] (15 August 1575 \u2013 21 November 1582), died young.\n* [[Philip III of Spain]] (14 April 1578 \u2013 31 March 1621).\n* Maria (14 February 1580 \u2013 5 August 1583), died young.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Maria Manuela, Princess of Portugal and Asturias - El Prado.jpg|Princess Maria of Portugal\nFile:Maria Tudor1.jpg|Queen Mary Tudor of England\nFile:Isabel de Valois2..jpg|Queen Elisabeth of Valois\nFile:La reina Ana de Austria, por Sofonisba Anguissola.jpg|Queen Anna of Austria by Sofonisba Anguissola\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Descendants of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon]]\n* [[List of Portuguese monarchs]]\n* [[List of Spanish monarchs]]\n* [[The empire on which the sun never sets]]\n* [[Royal Armoury of Madrid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]].

During his reign, the Spanish kingdoms reached the height of their influence and power. This is sometimes called the ''[[Spanish Golden Age]]''.\n\nPhilip led a highly [[national debt|debt-leveraged regime]], seeing [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1569, 1575, and 1596. This policy was partly the cause of the [[Act of Abjuration|declaration of independence]] that created the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1581. On 31 December 1584 Philip signed the [[Treaty of Joinville]], with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]] signing on behalf of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]; consequently Philip supplied a considerable annual grant to the League over the following decade to maintain the civil war in France, with the hope of destroying the French Calvinists. A devout Catholic, Philip saw himself as the defender of Catholic Europe against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He sent an [[Spanish Armada|armada]] to invade Protestant England in 1588, with the strategic aim of overthrowing [[Elizabeth I of England]] and re-establishing Catholicism there; but it was defeated in a skirmish at [[Gravelines]] (northern France) and then destroyed by storms as it circled the British Isles to return to Spain. The following year [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s naval power was able to recover after the failed invasion of the [[English Armada]] into Spain.<ref>[[Rowse, A. L.]] (1969). ''Tudor Cornwall: portrait of a society''. C. Scribner, p.400</ref><ref>\"One decisive action might have forced Philip II to the negotiating table and avoided fourteen years of continuing warfare.

Society for Nautical Research, 1990</ref>\n\nUnder Philip, about 9,000 men a year on average were recruited from Spain; in crisis years the total could rise to 20,000. Between 1567 and 1574, nearly 43,000 men left Spain to fight in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] (modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kamen|first1=Henry|title=Spain, 1469-1714: A Society of Conflict|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=150}}</ref>\n\nPhilip was described by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as \"slight of stature and round-faced, with pale blue eyes, [[Habsburg lip|somewhat prominent lip]], and pink skin, but his overall appearance is very attractive\". The Ambassador went on to say \"He dresses very tastefully, and everything that he does is courteous and gracious.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=James C.|title=Pursuit of Power: Venetian Ambassadors' Reports on Spain, Turkey, and France in the Age of Philip II 1560\u20131600|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|year=1970|pages=81\u201382}}</ref> Besides Mary I, Philip was married three other times and widowed four times.\n\n==Early life: 1527\u201344==\n[[File:Bautizo Felipe II grande.jpg|thumb|left|'The Baptism of Phillip II' in [[Valladolid]], Castile. Historical ceiling preserved in Palacio de Pimentel (Valladolid).]]\nThe son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I and V, King of the Spanish kingdoms and Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife, [[Isabella of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Isabella of Portugal]], Philip was born in the Castilian capital of [[Valladolid]] on 21 May 1527 at Palacio de Pimentel, which was owned by Don Bernardino Pimentel (the first Marqu\u00e9s de T\u00e1vara). The culture and courtly life of Castile were an important influence in his early life. He was tutored by [[Juan Mart\u00ednez Sil\u00edceo|Juan Mart\u00ednez Siliceo]], the future [[Archbishop of Toledo]]. Philip displayed reasonable aptitude in arts and letters alike. Later he would study with more illustrious tutors, including the humanist Juan Crist\u00f3bal Calvete de Estrella. Though Philip had good command over [[Latin]], Spanish, and Portuguese, he never managed to equal his father, Charles V, as a [[polyglot]]. While Philip was also a German [[archduke]] of the [[House of Habsburg]], he was seen as a foreigner in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The feeling was mutual. Philip felt himself to be culturally Spanish; he had been born in Castile and raised in the Castilian court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in the Spanish kingdoms. This would ultimately impede his succession to the imperial throne.<ref name=\"JBE\">James Boyden; Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopaedia of the Early Modern World.</ref>\n\nIn April 1528, when Philip was eleven months old, he received the oath of allegiance as heir to the crown from the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. From that time until the death of his mother Isabella in 1539, he was raised in the royal court of Castile under the care of his mother and one of her [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ladies, Dona Leonor de Mascarenhas, to whom he was devotedly attached. Philip was also close to his two sisters, [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Mar\u00eda]] and [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Juana]], and to his two pages, the Portuguese nobleman [[Ruy G\u00f3mez de Silva|Rui Gomes da Silva]] and [[Luis de Requesens]], the son of his governor Juan de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. These men would serve Philip throughout their lives, as would Antonio P\u00e9rez, his secretary from 1541.\n[[File:Philip II portrait by Titian.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Titian]], {{circa|1550}}.]]\nPhilip's martial training was undertaken by his governor, Juan de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, a Castilian nobleman who served as the [[commendador]] mayor of Castile. The practical lessons in warfare were overseen by the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] during the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|Italian Wars]]. Philip was present at the [[Siege of Perpignan (1542)|Siege of Perpignan]] in 1542 but did not see action as the Spanish army under Alba decisively defeated the besieging French forces under the [[Henry II of France|Dauphin of France]]. On his way back to Castile, Philip received the oath of allegiance of the [[Aragon]]ese Cortes at [[Monz\u00f3n]]. His political training had begun a year previously under his father, who had found his son studious, grave, and prudent beyond his years, and having decided to train and initiate him in the government of the Spanish kingdoms. The king-emperor's interactions with his son during his stay in Castile convinced him of Philip's precocity in statesmanship, so he determined to leave in his hands the [[List of Spanish regents|regency of the Spanish kingdoms]] in 1543. Philip, who had previously been made the [[Duke of Milan]] in 1540, began governing the most extensive empire in the world at the young age of sixteen.\n\nCharles left Philip with experienced advisors\u2014notably the secretary [[Francisco de los Cobos]] and the general Duke of Alba. Philip was also left with extensive written instructions that emphasised \"piety, patience, modesty, and distrust.\" These principles of Charles were gradually assimilated by his son, who would grow up to become grave, self-possessed and cautious. Personally, Philip spoke softly and had an icy self-mastery; in the words of one of his ministers, \"he had a smile that was cut by a sword.\"<ref>Encyclopedia of World Biography 2004.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy==\n{{refimprove|section|date=January 2020}}\nAfter living in the [[Netherlands]] in the early years of his reign,<ref>Parker, Geoffrey. ''The Dutch Revolt.''. London: Penguin. p.41.</ref> Philip II decided to return to Castile. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority, influenced by the growing strength of the bureaucracy. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] Empire was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the [[House of Habsburg]]. In practice, Philip often found his authority overruled by local assemblies, and his word less effective than that of local lords.<ref>Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt''. p.42.</ref>\n\nPhilip carried [[List of titles and honours of the Heir Apparent to the Spanish Throne#Titles held by the heir apparent to the Spanish Throne|several titles]] as [[List of heirs to the Spanish throne|heir to the Spanish kingdoms and empire]], including [[Prince of Asturias]]. The newest constituent kingdom in the empire was [[Kingdom of Navarre#Spanish conquest of Navarre|Navarre]], a realm invaded by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] mainly with Castilian troops (1512), and annexed to Castile with an ambiguous status (1513). [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|War across Navarre]] continued until 1528 ([[Treaty of Madrid (1526)#Madrid|Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai]]). Charles V proposed to end hostilities with King [[Henry II of Navarre]]\u2014the legitimate monarch of Navarre\u2014by marrying his son Philip to the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne III of Navarre]]. The marriage would provide a dynastic solution to instability in Navarre, making him king of all Navarre and prince of independent [[B\u00e9arn]], as well as lord of a large part of southern France. However, the French nobility under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] opposed the arrangement and successfully ended the prospects of marriage between the heirs of Habsburg and Albret in 1541.\n\n[[File:Philip II of Spain by Antonio Moro.jpg|thumb|left|Philip, in the prime of his life, by Giacomo Antonio Moro]]\n\nIn his will Charles stated his doubts over Navarre and recommended that his son give the kingdom back. Both King Charles and his son Philip II failed to abide by the elective (contractual) nature of the Crown of Navarre, and took the kingdom for granted. This sparked mounting tension not only with King Henry II and Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, but also with the Parliament of the Spanish Navarre (''Cortes'', ''The Three States'') and the ''Diputaci\u00f3n'' for breach of the [[Fueros of Navarre|realm specific laws (fueros)]]\u2014violation of the ''pactum subjectionis'' as ratified by Ferdinand. Tensions in Navarre came to a head in 1592 after several years of disagreements over the agenda of the intended parliamentary session.\n\nIn November 1592, the Parliament (''Cortes'') of Arag\u00f3n revolted against another breach of the realm-specific laws, so the Attorney General (''Justicia'') of the kingdom, Juan de Lanuza, was executed on Philip II's orders, with his secretary [[Antonio P\u00e9rez (statesman)|Antonio Perez]] taking exile in France. In Navarre the major strongholds of the kingdom were garrisoned by troops alien to the kingdom (Castilians) in conspicuous violation of the laws of Navarre, and the Parliament had long been refusing to pledge loyalty to Philip II's son and heir apparent without a proper ceremony. On 20 November 1592 a ghostly Parliament session was called, pushed by Philip II, who had arrived in [[Pamplona#Three boroughs and one city|Pamplona]] at the head of an unspecified military force, and with one only point on his agenda\u2014attendance to the session was kept blank on the minutes: unlawful appointments of trusted Castilian officials and an imposition of his son as future king of Navarre at the Santa Maria Cathedral. A ceremony was held before the bishop of Pamplona (22 November), but its customary procedure and terms were altered. Protests erupted in Pamplona, but they were quelled.\n[[File:Jooris van der Straeten - Portrait of Philip II of Spain.jpg|thumb|Philip II wearing the order of the garter by [[Jooris van der Straeten]], c. 1554]]\n\nPhilip II also grappled with the problem of the large [[Morisco]] population in the Spanish kingdoms, who were sometimes forcibly converted to Christianity by his predecessors. In 1569, the [[Morisco Revolt]] broke out in the southern province of [[Granada (province)|Granada]] in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs. Philip ordered the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces.\n\nDespite its immense dominions, the Spanish kingdoms had a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown (in contrast to France, for example, which was much more heavily populated). Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, and collection was largely farmed out to local lords. He was able to finance his military campaigns only by taxing and exploiting the local resources of his empire. The flow of income from the [[New World]] proved vital to his militant foreign policy, but nonetheless his exchequer several times faced bankruptcy.\n\nSpanish culture flourished during Philip's reign, beginning the \"[[Spanish Golden Age]]\", creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts. One of the notable artists from Phillip II's court was [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], who gained fame for her talent and unusual role as a woman artist. She was invited to the court of Madrid in 1559 and was chosen to become an attendant to [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] (1566\u20131633). Anguissola also became a lady-in-waiting and court painter for the queen, [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elizabeth de Valois]]. During her time as a court painter, Anguissola painted many official portraits of the royal family, a sharp departure from her previous personal portraits.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Koning Spanje Filips II 1-5 Philipsdaalder 1566.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Portrait of Philip II on 1/5 Philipsdaalder, struck 1566, Guelders, Low Countries]]\n\nCharles V had left his son Philip with a debt of about 36 million [[ducat]]s and an annual deficit of 1 million ducats. This debt caused Phillip II to default on loans in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1596 (including debt to Poland, known as [[Neapolitan sums]]). Lenders had no power over the King and could not force him to repay his loans. These defaults were just the beginning of Spain's economic troubles as its kings would default six more times in the next 65 years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Azar|title=War in Human Civilization|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-923663-3|page=488|edition=4.}}</ref> Aside from reducing state revenues for overseas expeditions, the domestic policies of Philip II further burdened the Spanish kingdoms and would, in the following century, contribute to its decline, as maintained by some historians.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elliott |first = J.

This made the Spanish kingdoms and its possessions difficult to rule, unlike France, which while divided into regional states, had a single [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General]]. The lack of a viable supreme assembly led to power defaulting into Philip II's hands, especially as manager and final arbiter of the constant conflict between different authorities. To deal with the difficulties arising from this situation, authority was administered by local agents appointed by the crown and viceroys carrying out crown instructions. Philip II felt it necessary to be involved in the detail, and he presided over specialised councils for state affairs, finance, war, and the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].\n\nPhilip II played groups against each other, leading to a system of checks and balances that managed affairs inefficiently, even to the extent of damaging state business, as in the [[Antonio P\u00e9rez (statesman)|Perez affair]]. Following a fire in Valladolid in 1561, he resisted calls to move his Court to [[Lisbon]], an act that could have curbed centralisation and bureaucracy domestically as well as relaxed rule in the Empire as a whole. Instead, with the traditional Royal and [[Primate of Spain|Primacy]] seat of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] now essentially obsolete, he moved his Court to the Castilian stronghold of [[Madrid]]. Except for a brief period under [[Philip III of Spain]], Madrid has remained the capital of Spain. It was around this time that Philip II converted the [[Royal Alc\u00e1zar of Madrid]] into a royal palace. The works, which lasted from 1561 until 1598, were done by tradesmen that came from the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], and [[France]].\n\nKing Philip II ruled at a critical turning point in European history toward [[modernity]] whereas his father Charles V had been forced to an itinerant rule as a medieval king. He mainly directed state affairs, even when not at Court. Indeed, when his health began failing, he worked from his quarters at the Palace-Monastery-Pantheon of [[El Escorial]] that he had built in 1584, a palace built as a monument to Spain's role as a center of the Christian world. But Philip did not enjoy the supremacy that [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] would in the next century, nor was such a rule necessarily possible at his time. The inefficiencies of the Spanish state and the restrictively regulated industry under his rule were common to many contemporary countries. Further, the dispersal of the [[Morisco]]s from Granada \u2013 motivated by the fear they might support a Muslim invasion \u2013 had serious negative effects on the economy{{fact|date=July 2019}}, particularly in that region.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8667 Philipppus II.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philip II]]\n\nPhilip's foreign policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic objectives. He considered himself the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman Turks]] and against the forces of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He never relented from his fight against [[heresy]], defending the Catholic faith and limiting freedom of worship within his territories.<ref>As Philip wrote in 1566 to [[Luis de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Requesens|Luis de Requesens]]: \"You can assure his Holiness that rather than suffer the least injury to religion and the service of God, I would lose all my states and a hundred lives if I had them, for I do not intend to rule over heretics.\" {{Harvnb|Pettegree|2002|p=214}}.</ref> These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where Protestantism had taken deep root. Following the [[Revolt of the Netherlands]] in 1568, Philip waged a campaign against Dutch heresy and secession. It also dragged in the English and the French at times and expanded into the German Rhineland with the [[Cologne War]]. This series of conflicts lasted for the rest of his life. Philip's constant involvement in European wars took a significant toll on the treasury and caused economic difficulties for the Crown and even bankruptcies.\n\nIn 1588, the English defeated Philip's [[Spanish Armada]], thwarting his planned invasion of the country to reinstate Catholicism. But [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war with England]] continued for the next sixteen years, in a complex series of struggles that included France, Ireland and the main battle zone, the [[Low Countries]]. It would not end until all the leading protagonists, including himself, had died. Earlier, however, after several setbacks in his reign and especially that of his father, Philip did achieve a decisive victory against the Turks at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Lepanto]] in 1571, with the allied fleet of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], which he had put under the command of his illegitimate brother, [[John of Austria]]. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of [[Iberian Union|Portugal]].\n\nWith regard to Philip's overseas possessions, in response to the reforms imposed by the Ordenanzas, extensive questionnaires were distributed to every major town and region in New Spain called [[relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]]. These surveys helped the Spanish monarchy to govern these overseas conquests more effectively.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian Wars}}\n\nCharles V abdicated the throne of Naples to Philip on 25 July 1554, and the young king was invested with the kingdom (officially called \"Naples and Sicily\") on 2 October by [[Pope Julius III]]. The date of Charles' abdication of the throne of Sicily is uncertain, but Philip was invested with this kingdom (officially \"Sicily and Jerusalem\") on 18 November 1554 by Julius.<ref>[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', vol. 2 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 935\u201336 and notes.</ref> In 1556, Philip decided to invade the [[Papal States]] and temporarily held territory there, perhaps in response to [[Pope Paul IV]]'s anti-Spanish outlook. According to Philip II, he was doing it for the benefit of the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nIn a letter from [[Francisco de Vargas y Mexia|Francisco de Vargas]] to the Princess Dowager of Portugal, Regent of the Spanish kingdoms, dated 22 September 1556, it is written:\n{{quote|I have reported to your Highness what has been happening here, and how far the Pope is going in his fury and vain imaginings. His Majesty could not do otherwise than have a care for his reputation and dominions. I am sure your Highness will have had more recent news from the Duke of Alva, who has taken the field with an excellent army and has penetrated so far into the Pope's territory that his cavalry is raiding up to ten miles from Rome, where there is such panic that the population would have run away had not the gates been closed. The Pope has fallen ill with rage, and was struggling with a fever on the 16th of this month. The two Carafa brothers, the Cardinal and Count Montorio, do not agree, and they and Piero Strozzi are not on as good terms as they were in the past. They would like to discuss peace. The best thing would be for the Pope to die, for he is the poison at the root of all this trouble and more which may occur. His Majesty's intention is only to wrest the knife from this madman's hand and make him return to a sense of his dignity, acting like the protector of the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]], in whose name, and that of the [[College of Cardinals]], his Majesty has publicly proclaimed that he has seized all he is occupying. The Pope is now sending again to the potentates of Italy for help. I hope he will gain as little thereby as he has done in the past, and that the French will calm down.

After minor fights in Lazio and near Rome, [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Fernando Alvarez de Toledo]] (Duke of Alba and Viceroy of Naples) met [[Carlo Carafa|Cardinal Carlo Carafa]] and signed the ''treaty of [[Cave, Lazio|Cave]]'' as a compromise: French and Spanish forces left the Papal states and the Pope declared a neutral position between France and the Spanish kingdoms.<ref name=\"fiuRebiba\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1555-ii.htm|access-date=21 April 2010|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church |author=Salvador Miranda|year=2010|publisher=[[Florida International University]]}}</ref>\n\nPhilip led the Spanish kingdoms into the final phase of the [[Italian Wars]]. A Spanish advance into France from the Low Countries led to their important victory at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)| Battle of St. Quentin]] in 1557. The French were defeated again at the [[Battle of Gravelines (1558)| Battle of Gravelines]] in 1558. The resulting [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] in 1559 secured [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] to the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and [[Corsica]] to the [[Republic of Genoa]]. Both Genoa and Savoy were allies of Spain and, although Savoy subsequently declared its neutrality between France and Spain, Genoa remained a crucial financial ally for Philip during his entire reign. The treaty also confirmed Philip's direct control over [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], Sicily, and [[Sardinia]]. Therefore, all of southern Italy was under direct Spanish rule. Sicily and Naples were viceroyalties of the [[Crown of Castile]], while Sardinia was part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In the north, Milan was a Duchy of the Holy Roman Empire held by Philip. Attached to the Kingdom of Naples, the [[State of Presidi]] in Tuscany gave Philip the possibility to monitor maritime traffic to southern Italy. The [[Council of Italy]] was set up by Philip in order to co-ordinate his rule over the states of Milan, Naples and Sicily. Ultimately, the treaty ended the 60-year Franco-Habsburg wars for supremacy in Italy. It marked also the beginning of a period of peace between the Pope and Philip, as their European interests converged, although political differences remained and diplomatic contrasts eventually re-emerged.\n\nBy the end of the wars in 1559, [[Habsburg Spain]] had been established as the premier power of Europe, to the detriment of France. In France, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] was fatally wounded in a joust held during the celebrations of the peace. His death led to the accession of his 15-year-old son [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], who in turn soon died. The French monarchy was thrown into turmoil, which increased further with the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]] that would last for several decades. The states of Italy were reduced to second-rate powers, and Milan and Naples were annexed directly to Aragon. Mary Tudor's death in 1558 enabled Philip to seal the treaty by marrying Henry II's daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois]], later giving him a claim to the throne of France on behalf of his daughter by Elisabeth, [[Isabel Clara Eugenia]].\n\n===France===\n{{main|French Wars of Religion}}\nThe French Wars of Religion (1562\u201398) were primarily fought between French Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). The conflict involved the factional disputes between the aristocratic houses of France, such as the House of Bourbon and House of Guise (Lorraine), and both sides received assistance from foreign sources.\n\nPhilip signed the [[Treaty of Vaucelles]] with Henry II of France in 1556. Based on the terms of the treaty, the territory of [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] in [[Burgundy]] was to be relinquished to Philip. However, the treaty was broken shortly afterwards. France and the Spanish kingdoms waged war in northern France and Italy over the following years. Spanish victories at St. Quentin and Gravelines led to the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, in which France recognised Spanish sovereignty over Franche-Comt\u00e9.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Portuguese Succession]], the pretender [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Ant\u00f3nio]] fled to France following his defeats and, as Philip's armies had not yet occupied the [[Azores]], he sailed there with a large Anglo-French fleet under [[Filippo di Piero Strozzi|Filippo Strozzi]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] exile in the service of France. The naval [[Battle of Terceira]] took place on 26 July 1582, in the sea near the [[Azores Islands|Azores]], off [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island]], as part of the War of the Portuguese Succession and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)]]. The Spanish navy defeated the combined Anglo-French fleet that had sailed to preserve control of the Azores under Ant\u00f3nio. The French naval contingent was the largest French force sent overseas before the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref>Jan Glete p.156</ref>\n\n[[File:PhilipIIbust.JPG|thumb|A [[marble]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Philip II of Spain by [[Leone Leoni|Pompeo Leoni, son of Leone Leoni]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe Spanish victory at Terceira was followed by the [[Conquest of the Azores|Battle of the Azores]] between the Portuguese loyal to the claimant Ant\u00f3nio, supported by French and English troops, and the Spanish-Portuguese forces loyal to Philip commanded by the admiral Don [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n]]. Victory in Azores completed the incorporation of [[Spanish Empire|Portugal into the Spanish Empire]].<ref>Nascimiento Rodrigues/Tessaleno Devezas p.122</ref>\n\nPhilip financed the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] during the French Wars of Religion. He directly intervened in the final phases of the wars (1589\u20131598), ordering the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] into France in an effort to unseat [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and perhaps dreaming of placing his favourite daughter, Isabel Clara Eugenia, on the French throne. Elizabeth of Valois, Philip's third wife and Isabella's mother, had already ceded any claim to the French Crown with her marriage to Philip. However the [[Parliament of Paris]], in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella Clara Eugenia was \"the legitimate sovereign\" of France. Philip's interventions in the fighting \u2013 sending the Duke of Parma to end Henry IV's [[Siege of Paris, 1590|siege of Paris]] in 1590 and the [[Siege of Rouen (1591)|siege of Rouen]] in 1592 \u2013 contributed in saving the French Catholic Leagues's cause against a Protestant monarchy.\n\nIn 1593, Henry agreed to convert to Catholicism; weary of war, most French Catholics switched to his side against the hardline core of the Catholic League, who were portrayed by Henry's propagandists as puppets of a foreign monarch, Philip. By the end of 1594 certain League members were still working against Henry across the country, but all relied on the support of the Spanish Crown. In January 1595, therefore, Henry officially declared war on the Spanish Crown, to show Catholics that Philip was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French state, and Protestants that he had not become a puppet of the Spanish Crown through his conversion, while hoping to reconquer large parts of northern France from the Franco-Spanish Catholic forces.<ref>Knecht French Civil Wars p272</ref>\n\nFrench victory at the [[Battle of Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise]] in Burgundy, 5 June 1595, marked an end to the Catholic League in France. The French also made some progress during an invasion of the Spanish Netherlands. They captured [[Ham, Belgium|Ham]] and massacred the small Spanish garrison, provoking anger among the Spanish ranks.{{cn|date=January 2020}} The Spanish launched a concerted offensive that year, taking [[Siege of Doullens|Doullens]], [[Cambrai]], and [[Siege of Le Catelet (1595)|Le Catelet]]; at Doullens, they massacred 4,000 of its citizens.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goubert |first1= Pierre |title=The Course of French History |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |page=103}}</ref> On 24 April 1596, the Spanish also [[Siege of Calais (1596)|conquered Calais]]. Following the Spanish capture of [[Amiens]] in March 1597, the French Crown laid siege to it until it managed to [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|reconquer Amiens]] from the overstretched Spanish forces in September 1597. Henry then negotiated a peace with the Spanish Crown. The war was only drawn to an official close, however, after the [[Edict of Nantes]], with the [[Peace of Vervins]] in May 1598.\n\nThe 1598 Treaty of Vervins was largely a restatement of the 1559 Peace of C\u00e2teau-Cambr\u00e9sis and Spanish forces and subsidies were withdrawn; meanwhile, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, which offered a high degree of religious toleration for French Protestants. The military interventions in France thus failed to oust Henry from the throne or suppress Protestantism in France, and yet they had played a decisive part in helping the French Catholic cause gain the conversion of Henry, ensuring that Catholicism would remain France's official and majority faith \u2013 matters of paramount importance for the devoutly Catholic Spanish king.\n\n===Mediterranean===\n{{further|Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars}}\n[[File:Felipe IV offers Ferdinand to Glory.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]; after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, Philip offers his short-lived heir [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias|Fernando]] to Glory in this [[allegory]]]]\n[[File:Tercio - Morados Viejos.svg|thumb|[[Standard (flag)|Standard]] of the {{lang|es|[[tercio]]s morados}} of the Spanish army under Philip II]]\n\nIn the early part of his reign Philip was concerned with the rising power of the Ottoman Empire under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. Fear of Islamic domination in the Mediterranean caused him to pursue an aggressive foreign policy.\n\nIn 1558, Turkish admiral [[Piyale Pasha]] captured the [[Balearic Islands]], especially inflicting great damage on [[Menorca]] and enslaving many, while raiding the coasts of the Spanish mainland. Philip appealed to the Pope and other powers in Europe to bring an end to the rising [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] threat. Since his father's losses against the Ottomans and against [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] in 1541, the major European sea powers in the Mediterranean, namely the Spanish Crown and [[Venice]], became hesitant in confronting the Ottomans. The myth of \"Turkish invincibility\" was becoming a popular story, causing fear and panic among the people.\n\nIn 1560, Philip II organised a ''Holy League'' between the Spanish kingdoms and the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Papal States]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. The joint fleet was assembled at [[Messina]] and consisted of 200 ships (60 galleys and 140 other vessels) carrying a total of 30,000 soldiers under the command of [[Giovanni Andrea Doria]], nephew of the famous Genoese admiral [[Andrea Doria]].\n\nOn 12 March 1560, the Holy League captured the island of [[Djerba]], which had a strategic location and could control the sea routes between [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]]. As a response, Suleiman sent an Ottoman fleet of 120 ships under the command of Piyale Pasha, which arrived at Djerba on 9 May 1560. The battle lasted until 14 May 1560, and the forces of Piyale Pasha and [[Turgut Reis]] (who joined Piyale Pasha on the third day of the battle) won an overwhelming victory at the [[Battle of Djerba]]. The Holy League lost 60 ships (30 galleys) and 20,000 men, and Giovanni Andrea Doria was barely able to escape with a small vessel. The Ottomans retook the Fortress of Djerba, whose Spanish commander, D. [[\u00c1lvaro de Sande]], attempted to escape with a ship but was followed and eventually captured by Turgut Reis. In 1565 the Ottomans sent [[Siege of Malta (1565)|a large expedition to Malta]], which laid siege to several forts on the island, taking some of them. The Spanish sent a relief force, which finally drove the Ottoman army out of the island.\n\nThe grave threat posed by the increasing Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean was reversed in one of history's most decisive battles, with the destruction of nearly the entire Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, by the Holy League under the command of Philip's half brother, [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]]. A fleet sent by Philip, again commanded by Don John, reconquered Tunis from the Ottomans in 1573. The Turks soon rebuilt their fleet, and in 1574 [[Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis]] managed to recapture [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Tunis]] with a force of 250 galleys and a siege that lasted 40 days. Thousands of Spanish and Italian soldiers became prisoners. Nevertheless, Lepanto marked a permanent reversal in the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean and the end of the threat of Ottoman control. In 1585 a peace treaty was signed with the Ottomans.\n\n==Colonial policy==\n===Strait of Magellan===\nDuring Philip's reign Spain considered the [[Pacific Ocean]] a ''[[Mare clausum]]'' \u2013 a sea closed to other naval powers.

He appointed [[Margaret of Parma]] as Governor of the Netherlands, when he left the low countries for the Spanish kingdoms in 1559, but forced her to adjust policy to the advice of [[Cardinal Granvelle]], who was greatly disliked in the Netherlands, after he insisted on direct control over events in the Netherlands despite being over two weeks' ride away in Madrid. There was discontent in the Netherlands about Philip's taxation demands and the incessant [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|persecution]] of Protestants. In 1566, Protestant preachers sparked anti-clerical riots known as the [[Dutch Revolt#1566 \u2014 Iconoclasm and repression|Iconoclast Fury]]; in response to growing Protestant influence, the army of the Iron Duke ([[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]]) went on the offensive. In 1568, Alba had two Flemish nobles executed in [[Brussels]]' [[Grand Place|central square]], further alienating the local aristocracy.

The war came to an end in 1648, when the Dutch Republic was recognised by the Spanish Crown as independent; the eight decades of war came at a massive human cost, with an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 victims, of which 350,000 to 400,000 were civilians killed by disease and what would later be considered [[war crime]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victimario Hist\u00f3rico Militar|url=http://remilitari.com/guias/victimario9.htm}}</ref>\n\n==King of Portugal==\n{{Main|Iberian Union}}\n[[File:Anthony I of Portugal.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Anthony I of Portugal]]]]\nIn 1578 young king [[Sebastian of Portugal]] died at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] without descendants, triggering a [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis|succession crisis]].

In Madrid he established a [[Council of Portugal]] to advise him on Portuguese affairs, giving prominent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish courts, and allowing Portugal to maintain autonomous law, currency, and government. This is on the well-established pattern of [[Polysynodial System|rule by councils]].\n\n[[File:ImperioDeFelipeII.svg|thumb|Spanish Empire of Philip II, III and IV including all charted and claimed territories, maritime claims (mare clausum) and other features.]]\n\n==Relations with England and Ireland==\n\n===King of England and Ireland===\n[[File:Philip II.jpg|thumb|Titian portrait of Philip as prince (1554), aged about twenty-four dressed in a lavishly decorated set of armour.]]\n\nPhilip's father arranged his marriage to 37-year-old Queen [[Mary I of England]], Charles' maternal first cousin. His father ceded the crown of Naples, as well as his claim to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], to him. Their marriage at [[Winchester Cathedral]] on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip's view of the affair was entirely political. Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] petitioned Mary to consider marrying an Englishman, preferring [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon|Edward Courtenay]].\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain]], Philip was to enjoy Mary I's titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. Coins were also to show the heads of both Mary and Philip. The marriage treaty also provided that England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father in any war. The Privy Council instructed that Philip and Mary should be joint signatories of royal documents, and this was enacted by an Act of Parliament, which gave him the title of king and stated that he \"shall aid her Highness ... in the happy administration of her Grace's realms and dominions.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=George Burton |editor-last2=Stephens |editor-first2=H.

The couple's joint royal style after Philip ascended the Spanish throne in 1556 was: ''Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, Spain, France, Jerusalem, both the Sicilies and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tirol''.\n\nHowever, the couple had no children. Mary died in 1558 before the union could revitalise the Roman Catholic Church in England. With her death, Philip lost his rights to the English throne (including the ancient [[English claims to the French throne]]) and ceased to be King of England, Ireland and (as claimed by them) France.\n\nPhilip's distaff great-grandson, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], married [[Princess Henrietta of England]] in 1661; in 1807, the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] claim to the British throne passed to the descendants of their child [[Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans]].\n\n===After Mary I's death===\n{{further|Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)}}\n[[File:Dominios de Felipe II.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Philip's European and North African dominions in 1581]]\n\nUpon Mary's death, the throne went to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] I. Philip had no wish to sever his tie with England, and had sent a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. However, she delayed in answering, and in that time learned Philip was also considering a [[House of Valois|Valois]] alliance. Elizabeth I was the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII and [[Anne Boleyn]]. This union was deemed illegitimate by English Catholics, who disputed the validity of both the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and of his subsequent marriage to Boleyn, and hence claimed that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], the Catholic great granddaughter of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], was the legitimate heir to the throne.\n\nFor many years Philip maintained peace with England, and even defended Elizabeth from the Pope's threat of excommunication. This was a measure taken to preserve a European balance of power. Ultimately, Elizabeth allied England with the Protestant rebels in the Netherlands. Further, English ships began a policy of piracy against Spanish trade and threatened to plunder the great Spanish treasure ships coming from the new world. English ships went so far as to attack a Spanish port. The last straw for Philip was the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] signed by Elizabeth in 1585 \u2013 promising troops and supplies to the rebels. Although it can be argued this English action was the result of Philip's [[Treaty of Joinville]] with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]], Philip considered it an act of war by England.\n\nThe execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 ended Philip's hopes of placing a Catholic on the English throne. He turned instead to more direct plans to invade England and return the country to Catholicism. In 1588, he sent a fleet, the [[Spanish Armada]], to rendezvous with the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]'s army and convey it across the English Channel. However, the operation had little chance of success from the beginning, because of lengthy delays, lack of communication between Philip II and his two commanders and the lack of a deep bay for the fleet. At the point of attack, a storm struck the [[English Channel]], already known for its harsh currents and choppy waters, which devastated large numbers of the Spanish fleet. There was a tightly fought battle against the English [[Royal Navy]]; it was by no means a slaughter (only 1 Spanish ship was sunk),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=R. G. |title=1001 Battles That Changed the Course of History |date=2017 |page=296}}</ref> but the Spanish were forced into a retreat, and the overwhelming majority of the Armada was destroyed by the harsh weather. Whilst the English Royal Navy may not have destroyed the Armada at the Battle of Gravelines, they had prevented it from linking up with the army it was supposed to convey across the channel. Thus whilst the English Royal Navy may have only won a slight tactical victory over the Spanish, it had delivered a major strategic one\u2014preventing the invasion of England. Through a week of fighting the Spanish had expended 100,000 cannonballs, but no English ship was seriously damaged.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Spencer |title=Battles that Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict |date=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=183}}</ref> However, over 7,000 English sailors died from disease during the time the Armada was in English water.\n\nThe defeat of the Spanish Armada gave great heart to the Protestant cause across Europe. The storm that smashed the Armada was seen by many of Philip's enemies as a sign of the will of God. Many Spaniards blamed the admiral of the Armada for its failure, but Philip, despite his complaint that he had sent his ships to fight the English, not the elements, was not among them. A year later, Philip remarked:\n\n{{Cquote|It is impiety, and almost blasphemy to presume to know the will of God. It comes from the sin of pride. Even kings, Brother Nicholas, must submit to being used by God's will without knowing what it is. They must never seek to use it.|4=Philip II}}\n\nA measure of the character of Philip can be gathered by the fact that he personally saw to it that the wounded men of the Armada were treated and received pensions, and that the families of those who died were compensated for their loss, which was highly unusual for the time.\n\nWhile the invasion had been averted, England was unable to take advantage of this success. An attempt to use her newfound advantage at sea with a [[English Armada|counter-armada]] the following year failed disastrously with 40 ships sunk and 15,000 men lost.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez Duro, Ces\u00e1reo (1972).

Madrid. p.51</ref> Likewise, English buccaneering and attempts to seize territories in the Caribbean were defeated by Spain's rebuilt navy and their improved intelligence networks (although [[Capture of C\u00e1diz|C\u00e1diz was destroyed]] by an Anglo-Dutch force after a failed attempt to seize the treasure fleet). The Habsburgs also struck back with the [[Dunkirkers]], who took an increasing toll of Dutch and English shipping.\n\nEventually, the Spanish attempted two further Armadas, in October 1596 and October 1597.  The [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596 Armada]] was destroyed in a storm off northern Spain; it had lost as many as 72 of its 126 ships and suffered 3,000 deaths. The [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597 Armada]] was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast undetected. This [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)]] would be fought to a grinding end, but not until both Philip II (d. 1598) and Elizabeth I (d. 1603) were dead. Some of the fighting was done on land in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands, with the English sending expeditionary forces to France and the Netherlands to fight Spain, and Spain attempting to assist Irish rebellions in Ireland.\n\n==Death==\nPhilip II died in [[El Escorial]], near Madrid, on 13 September 1598, of [[cancer]].<ref>{{citation|last=Koenigsberger|first=Helmut Georg|title=Philip II|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|year=2012|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/456081/Philip-II|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref> He was succeeded by his 20-year-old son, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]].\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of Philip II of Spain}}\n[[File:Philip II's realms in 1598.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Philip's dominions in 1598]]\n\nUnder Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power. However, in spite of the great and increasing quantities of gold and silver flowing into his coffers from the American mines, the riches of the Portuguese spice trade, and the enthusiastic support of the Habsburg dominions for the [[Counter-Reformation]], he would never succeed in suppressing Protestantism or defeating the Dutch rebellion. Early in his reign, the Dutch might have laid down their weapons if he had desisted in trying to suppress Protestantism,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} but his devotion to Catholicism would not permit him to do so. He was a devout Catholic and exhibited the typical 16th century disdain for religious heterodoxy; he said, \"Before suffering the slightest damage to religion in the service of God, I would lose all of my estates and a hundred lives, if I had them, because I do not wish nor do I desire to be the ruler of heretics.\"<ref>{{YouTube|id=qhlAqklH0do#t=21m27s|title=The Myth of the Spanish Inquisition}} (at 21:27 \u2013 21:40). BBC.</ref>\n\nAs he strove to enforce Catholic orthodoxy through an intensification of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], students were barred from studying elsewhere, and books printed by Spaniards outside the kingdom were banned. Even a highly respected churchman like [[Bartolome Carranza|Archbishop Carranza]] of Toledo was jailed by the Inquisition for 17 years, for publishing ideas that seemed sympathetic in some degree with Protestantism. Such strict enforcement of orthodox belief was successful, and Spain avoided the religiously inspired strife tearing apart other European dominions.\n\nThe [[School of Salamanca]] flourished under his reign. [[Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta]], highly honoured at Rome by several popes and looked on as an oracle of learning, published his ''Manuale sive Enchiridion Confessariorum et Poenitentium'' (Rome, 1568), long a classical text in the schools and in ecclesiastical practice.\n\n[[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]], generally regarded as the greatest scholastic after [[Thomas Aquinas]] and regarded during his lifetime as being the greatest living philosopher and theologian, was writing and lecturing, not only in Spain but also in Rome (1580\u20131585), where [[Pope Gregory XIII]] attended the first lecture that he gave. [[Luis de Molina]] published his ''De liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia'' (1588), wherein he put forth the doctrine attempting to reconcile the [[omniscience]] of God with human [[free will]] that came to be known as [[Molinism]], thereby contributing to what was one of the most important intellectual debates of the time; Molinism became the ''de facto'' [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] doctrine on these matters, and is still advocated today by [[William Lane Craig]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]], among others.\n\n[[File:Felipe II de Espa\u00f1a 01.jpg|upright|thumb|Statue of Philip II at the [[Sabatini Gardens]] in Madrid ([[Felipe de Castro|F.

In a more recent example of popular culture, Philip II's portrayal in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937) is not entirely unsympathetic; he is shown as a very hardworking, intelligent, religious, somewhat paranoid ruler whose prime concern is his country, but who had no understanding of the English, despite his former co-monarchy there.\n\nEven in countries that remained Catholic, primarily France and the Italian states, fear and envy of Spanish success and domination created a wide receptiveness for the worst possible descriptions of Philip II. Although some efforts have been made to separate legend from reality,<ref>Hume, Martin. ''Philip II of Spain'', London, 1897. Martin tried to retrieve the prejudiced views on the king at his time, something Carl Bratli also tried to do in his ''Filip of Spanien'' (Koebenhaven, 1909). Their works oppose to those of Ludwig Pfandl, ''Felipe II. Bosquejo de una vida y un tiempo'', Munich, 1938, who assessed very negatively Felipe's personality</ref> that task has proved extremely difficult, since many prejudices are rooted in the cultural heritage of European countries. Spanish-speaking historians tend to assess his political and military achievements, sometimes deliberately avoiding issues such as the king's lukewarmness (or even support) toward Catholic fanaticism.<ref>In his work, ''Felipe II'' (Madrid, 1943) W.T. Walsh depicts Felipe's reign as a prosperous and successful one, tending to make an apology of it. Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez, in ''Espa\u00f1a y los espa\u00f1oles en la Edad Moderna'' (Salamanca, 1979), points out how White Legend supporters flourished during the 1940s and 1950s, and how they omitted the darkest issues of Felipe's reign</ref> English-speaking historians tend to show Philip II as a fanatical, despotical, criminal, imperialist monster,<ref>Those kinds of adjectives can be read in M. Van Durme's 1953 ''El Cardenal Granvela''</ref> minimising his military victories ([[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]], [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of Saint Quentin]], etc.) to mere anecdotes, and magnifying his defeats (namely the [[Invincible Armada]]<ref>Cabrera de C\u00f3rdoba, ''Felipe II rey de Espa\u00f1a'', ed. RAH, 1877, criticizes how Felipe's victories are being minimised by English historians, and points out the small consequences of defeats such as the Invincible Armada</ref>) even though at the time those defeats did not result in great political or military changes in the balance of power in Europe. Moreover, it has been noted that objectively assessing Philip's reign would necessitate a re-analysis of the reign of his greatest opponents, namely England's Queen [[Elizabeth I]] and the Dutch [[William the Silent]], who are popularly regarded as great heroes in their home nations; if Philip II is to be shown to the English or Dutch public in a more favourable light, Elizabeth and William would lose their cold-blooded, fanatical enemy, thus decreasing their own patriotic accomplishments.{{NoteTag|This appreciation is noted by Martin Hume in his aforementioned work (\"Philip II of Spain\", London 1897), pointing out how difficult is to show Philip II in a more favorable light to his fellow Englishmen because of that.}}\n\nPhilip II's reign can hardly be characterised by its failures. He ended French Valois ambitions in Italy and brought about the Habsburg ascendency in Europe. He commenced settlements in the [[Philippines]], which were named after him,{{NoteTag|The Philippine archipelago was first sighted by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] on his expedition to the Spice Islands, but it was during Philip's reign that Spanish explorer [[Ruy Lopez de Villalobos]] renamed them from the archipelago of St. Lazarus to ''Las Islas Filipinas'' in Philip's honour.}} and established the first trans-Pacific trade route between America and Asia. He secured the Portuguese kingdom and empire. He succeeded in increasing the importation of silver in the face of English, Dutch, and French privateers, overcoming multiple financial crises and consolidating Spain's overseas empire. Although clashes would be ongoing, he ended the major threat posed to Europe by the Ottoman navy.\n\n== Titles, honours and styles ==\n[[File:Cannon with arms of Philip II as King of England and Ireland.jpg|thumb|Cannon with arms of Philip II as King of Spain and ''jure uxoris'' King of England and France.]]\n\n* Heir titles\n** [[Prince of Gerona]]: 21 May 1527 \u2013 16 January 1556\n** [[Prince of Asturias]] 1528\u20131556\n* [[List of Castilian monarchs|King of Castile]] as '''Philip II''': 16 January 1556 \u2013 13 September 1598\n** King of Castile, of Le\u00f3n, of Granada, of Toledo, of Galicia, of Seville, of Cordoba, of Murcia, of Jaen, of the Algarves, of Algeciras, of Gibraltar, of the Canary Islands, of the Indias, the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea.{{NoteTag|With la incorporation of Portugal to the Monarchy the title changed to East and West Indies, the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean sea.}} Lord of Molina.\n** [[Lord of Biscay]].\n* [[List of Aragonese monarchs|King of Aragon]] as '''Philip I''': 16 January 1556 \u2013 13 September 1598\n** King of Arag\u00f3n.\n** King of the Two Sicilies.\n*** [[List of kings of Naples|King of Naples]], of Jerusalem: Since 25 July 1554.\n*** [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]].

She was a daughter of Philip's maternal uncle, [[John III of Portugal]], and paternal aunt, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]]. They were married at [[Salamanca]] on 12 November 1543. The marriage produced one son in 1545, after which Maria died 4 days later due to haemorrhage:\n* [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]] (8 July 1545 \u2013 24 July 1568), died unmarried and without issue.\n\nPhilip's second wife was his first cousin once removed, Queen [[Mary I of England]]. The marriage, which took place on 25 July 1554 at [[Winchester Cathedral]], was political. By this marriage, Philip became ''[[jure uxoris]]'' [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] and [[King of Ireland|Ireland]], although the couple was apart more than together as they ruled their respective countries. The marriage produced no children, although there was a [[false pregnancy]], and Mary died in 1558, ending Philip's reign in England and Ireland.\n\nPhilip's third wife was [[Elisabeth of Valois]], the eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]]. The original ceremony was conducted by proxy (the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] standing in for Philip) at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] prior to Elisabeth's departure from France. The actual ceremony was conducted in [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]] upon her arrival in Spain. During their marriage (1559\u20131568) they conceived five daughters and a son, though only two of the girls survived. Elisabeth died a few hours after the loss of her last child. Their children were:\n* Stillborn son (1560)\n* Miscarried twin daughters (August 1564).\n* [[Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella Clara Eugenia]] (12 August 1566 \u2013 1 December 1633), married [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]],\n* [[Catherine Michelle of Spain|Catherine Michelle]] (10 October 1567 \u2013 6 November 1597), married [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], and had issue.\n* Miscarried daughter (3 October 1568).\n\nPhilip's fourth and final wife was his niece, [[Anna of Austria (1549\u20131580)|Anna of Austria]]. By contemporary accounts, this was a convivial and satisfactory marriage (1570\u20131580) for both Philip and Anna. This marriage produced four sons and one daughter. Anna died of heart failure 8 months after giving birth to Maria in 1580. Their children were:\n* [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias]] (4 December 1571 \u2013 18 October 1578), died young.\n* Charles Laurence (12 August 1573 \u2013 30 June 1575), died young.\n* [[Diego, Prince of Asturias]] (15 August 1575 \u2013 21 November 1582), died young.\n* [[Philip III of Spain]] (14 April 1578 \u2013 31 March 1621).\n* Maria (14 February 1580 \u2013 5 August 1583), died young.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Maria Manuela, Princess of Portugal and Asturias - El Prado.jpg|Princess Maria of Portugal\nFile:Maria Tudor1.jpg|Queen Mary Tudor of England\nFile:Isabel de Valois2..jpg|Queen Elisabeth of Valois\nFile:La reina Ana de Austria, por Sofonisba Anguissola.jpg|Queen Anna of Austria by Sofonisba Anguissola\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Descendants of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon]]\n* [[List of Portuguese monarchs]]\n* [[List of Spanish monarchs]]\n* [[The empire on which the sun never sets]]\n* [[Royal Armoury of Madrid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]].

Based on these findings the [[International Olympic Committee]] called for an emergency meeting to consider banning Russia from the Summer Olympics.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/sports/report-confirms-state-sponsored-doping-by-russia-at-olympics.html|title=Russia May Face Olympics Ban as Doping Scheme Is Confirmed|last=Ruiz|first=Rebecca|date=18 July 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July, the IOC rejected WADA's recommendation to ban Russia from the Summer Olympics and announced that a decision would be made by each sport federation.

The following day, two further track cyclists, [[Kirill Sveshnikov]] and [[Dmitri Sokolov (cyclist)|Dmitri Sokolov]] were named as implicated in the methodology, and withdrawn, placing the Russian entry in the men's team pursuit in doubt.<ref name=cycling-doping/><ref>{{cite news|title=UCI confirms three Russian cyclists withdrawn from Olympic Games|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-confirms-three-russian-cyclists-withdrawn-from-olympic-games/|publisher=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|date=28 July 2016|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n;Sprint\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!colspan=2|Qualification\n!Round 1\n!Repechage 1\n!Round 2\n!Repechage 2\n!Quarterfinals\n!Semifinals\n!colspan=2|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|'''[[Denis Dmitriev]]'''\n|align=left rowspan=2|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's sprint|Men's sprint]]\n|9.774<br />73.664\n|4 '''Q'''\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Rafa\u0142 Sarnecki|Sarnecki]]|POL|2016 Summer}}<br/>'''W''' 10.141<br />70.998\n|{{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Sam Webster (cyclist)|Webster]]|NZL|2016 Summer}}<br/>'''W''' 10.102<br />71.273\n|{{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9|Baug\u00e9]]|FRA|2016 Summer}}<br/>'''W''' 10.202, '''W''' 10.166\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Jason Kenny|Kenny]]|GBR|2016 Summer}}<br/>'''W''' 10.139, '''L''', '''L'''\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Matthew Glaetzer|Glaetzer]]|AUS|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W'''  10.105, '''W'''  10.190\n|{{bronze03}}\n|-align=center\n|align=left|[[Nikita Shurshin]]\n|10.418<br />69.111\n|26\n|colspan=8|Did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|[[Daria Shmeleva]]\n|align=left rowspan=2|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's sprint|Women's sprint]]\n|11.230<br/>64.113\n|22\n|colspan=9|Did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|[[Anastasia Voynova]]\n|10.985<br/>65.543\n|11 '''Q'''\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Stephanie Morton|Morton]]|AUS|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 11.503<br/>62.592\n| {{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Zhong Tianshi|Zhong Ts]]|CHN|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 11.271<br/>63.880\n|{{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Elis Ligtlee|Ligtlee]]|NED|2016 Summer}}<br />'''L''',  '''L'''\n|Did not advance\n|''5th place final''<br />{{flagIOCathlete|[[Zhong Tianshi|Zhong]]|CHN|2016 Summer}}<br />{{flagIOCathlete|[[Lee Wai Sze|Lee W S]]|HKG|2016 Summer}}<br />{{flagIOCathlete|[[Simona Krupeckait\u0117|Krupeckait\u0117]]|LTU|2016 Summer}}<br />'''L'''\n|8\n|}\n\n;Team sprint\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=2|Qualification\n!colspan=2|Semifinals\n!colspan=2|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|'''[[Daria Shmeleva]]<br />[[Anastasia Voynova]]'''\n|align=left|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's team sprint|Women's team sprint]]\n|32.655<br />55.121\n|2 '''Q'''\n|{{flagIOCteam|CAN|2016 Summer}}<br/>'''W''' 32.324<br />55.686\n|2 '''Q'''\n|{{flagIOCteam|CHN|2016 Summer}}<br/>'''L''' 32.401<br />55.553\n|{{silver02}}\n|}\n\n;Keirin\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!1st Round\n!Repechage\n!2nd Round\n!Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Rank\n!Rank\n!Rank\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|[[Denis Dmitriev]]\n|align=left|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's Keirin|Men's keirin]]\n|4 '''R'''\n|2\n|colspan=2| Did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|[[Daria Shmeleva]]\n|align=left rowspan=2|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's Keirin|Women's keirin]]\n|3 '''R'''\n|2 \n|colspan=2| Did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|[[Anastasia Voynova]]\n|4 '''R'''\n|1 '''Q'''\n|3 '''Q'''\n|4\n|}\n\n===Mountain biking===\nRussia has qualified one mountain biker for the women's Olympic cross-country race, as a result of her nation's ninth-place finish in the UCI Olympic Ranking List of 25 May 2016.

Two more rowers, namely Anastasiia Karabelshchikova and Ivan Podshivalov, were ruled ineligible by reason of previous bans.

Based on these findings the [[International Olympic Committee]] called for an emergency meeting to consider banning Russia from the Summer Olympics.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/sports/report-confirms-state-sponsored-doping-by-russia-at-olympics.html|title=Russia May Face Olympics Ban as Doping Scheme Is Confirmed|last=Ruiz|first=Rebecca|date=18 July 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July, the IOC rejected WADA's recommendation to ban Russia from the Summer Olympics and announced that a decision would be made by each sport federation.

Two more rowers, namely Anastasiia Karabelshchikova and Ivan Podshivalov, were ruled ineligible by reason of previous bans.
