It is an area of approximately {{convert|11.38|km2|mi2}}, that reaches an altitude of {{convert|1021|m|ft}} above sea level. It is bordered on the east by the civil parish of [[S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Regatos]] and west by the parish of [[Santa B\u00e1rbara (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo)|Santa B\u00e1rbara das Nove Ribeiras]], as well as, along a short frontier to the north, with the parish of [[Altares]].\n\nThe parish's southern coast is formed from a {{convert|20|-|30|m|ft}} high arriba, marked by its only major geological structure, the Ponta das Cinco, a rocky spur formed by a basaltic dike that penetrated one of the radial faults, along the Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara. Yet, running through the region are several smaller volcanic cones composed of black or red basaltic rock. The lower part of the parish developed along a planar zone that corresponds with the terminal area of basaltic fissural flows from the region of Pico da Bagacina, resulting in a gently sloping area towards the northwest. This area is occupied by relatively recent lava flows, with little evidence of pyroclastic eruptive material, translating into shallow soils and rocky covering.\n\nTowards the west and interior, the slope gradually increases, passing into a transition zone towards the cone of the Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara. The highest part of the parish, the apex of the administrative frontier corresponds to the watercourses that divide the ravines of [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]] and Cinco Ribeiras, an area of accentuated slopes, reaching the summit of the caldera of Santa B\u00e1rbara (the highest point on the island of Terceira). Apart from this volcano, the parish is little accented, with only the Pico da Praia, at {{convert|323|m|ft}} above sea level, representing the highest altitude in the parish.\n\nCinco Ribeiras is crossed by three primary ravines: the Ribeira do Mouro, the Ribeira das Cinco and the Ribeira da Praia, that are part of the radial drainage system, of the Santa B\u00e1rbara Massif.\n\n===Climate===\nSituated along the southwest of the Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara, the parish occupies a transition zone between oceanic and Mediterranean climate (on the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification between Csb, on the lower areas, and Cfb, on higher altitudes), exposed to strong southwest winds, resulting in elevated humidity during periods of atmospheric instability, intense orthographic precipitation in the higher altitudes. Precipitation along the massif results in flooding along the shallow ravines, which are unable to transport the water that flows from the higher altitudes.\n\n===Human geography===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:left;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of<br>Cinco Ribeiras<br><small>(1890 - 2011)</small>\n| 1890 | 1019\n| 1900 | 1180\n| 1911 | 1149\n| 1920 | 1017\n| 1930 | 1020\n| 1940 | 1072\n| 1950 | 1024\n| 1960 | 1018\n| 1970 | 880\n| 1981 | 657\n| 1991 | 650\n| 2001 | 684\n| 2011 | 704\n}}\n}}\n|}\nUrban development, much like the other settlements of Terceira, is constituted by a linear structure, that follows the main roadway that circles the island, with little expansion into the fields. The lateral roads normally accompany the ravines, except for the area between Ribeira do Mouro and Ribeira das Cinco, where smaller urban agglomerations developed along the municipal road of Canadinhas, the circuits {{convert|200|m|ft}} above the Regional Roadway to connect Cinco Ribeiras and Terra Ch\u00e3 (through S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Regatos).\n\nAnother nucleus in development, constituted by primarily summer homes, developed around the porto of Cinco Ribeiras, circling the small hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Lurdes, in addition to a few homes in the ''Canada do Porto'' alongside.\n\nFollowing the 1991 census the parish included 650 inhabitants (138 males and 114 female residents), included in the localities referred to as Ribeira das Cinco (51 inhabitants), Ribeira do Mouro (84 inhabitants) and Cinco Ribeiras (418 inhabitants). The population decreased during the 20th century, from its apex of 1180 residentes around 1900.\n\nThe evolution of the parish has been marked by emigration, primarily to Brasil, then the United States and finally to Canada. During the 20th century, the population maintained stable until the middle of the 1960s; then, following facilitated emigration laws and the consequence of the Kennedy-Pastore Act, the population began a rapid decline until it stabilized following the [[Carnation Revolution]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe traditional architecture of Cinco Ribeiras resembles much of the rural homes of the western Terceira region, and is generally constructed around a single floor. The settlement is also distinguished for its many white-washed homes, bordered by multi-coloured trim around the corners, doors and windows (unique for the island of Terceira).\n* '''Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Paroquial de Cinco Ribeiras/Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar}})<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=29064 |title=Igreja Paroquial de Altares/Igreja de S\u00e3o Roque (PT071901010058) |publisher=SIPA \u2013 Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o para o Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico|editor=SIPA|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese |first=Paula |last=No\u00e9 |year=2012 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n* '''Imp\u00e9rio of Holy Spirit of Cinco Ribeiras''' {{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo de Cinco Ribeiras}}<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=33792 |title=Igreja Paroquial de Altares/Igreja de S\u00e3o Roque (PT071901010058) |publisher=SIPA \u2013 Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o para o Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico|editor=SIPA|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese |first=Paula |last=No\u00e9 |year=2012 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Angra do Hero\u00edsmo}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Parishes of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type                    = parish\n| name                    = Cinco Ribeiras\n| image_skyline           = Costa das Cinco Ribeiras, local da Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras.jpg\n| image_caption           = The coastline along the southern frontier of Cinco Ribeiras near the cave of the same name\n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = \n| region                  = Azores\n| island                  = [[Terceira Island|Terceira]]\n| municipality            = [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]]\n| image_map               = Locator map AZO TER Cinco Ribeiras.svg\n| map_caption             = Location of the civil parish in Terceira\n| coordinates             = {{coord|38|41|0|N|27|19|1|W|display=inline,title}}\n| established_date        = Settlement: fl. 1800<br>Parish: c. 1867<br>Civil parish: c. 1879\n| area_total_km2          = 10.80\n| elevation_m             = 121\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_total        = 704\n| postal_code             = 9700-321\n| area_code               = 292 XXX XXX\n| patron                  = [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Nossa Senhora do Pilar]]\n| website                 = {{url|http://www.jf5ribeiras.com/}}\n<!-- | footnotes               = Geographic detail from CAOP (2010)<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/Areas_Freg_Mun_Dist_CAOP2010.zip |title=Carta Administrativa Oficial de Portugal |publisher=Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |accessdate=1 July 2011 |year=2010 |editor=IGP |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521174146/http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/Areas_Freg_Mun_Dist_CAOP2010.zip |archivedate=21 May 2011 }}</ref> produced by Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas (IGP) -->\n}}\n'''Cinco Ribeiras''' is a [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] in the [[concelho|municipality]] of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]] on the island of [[Terceira Island|Terceira]] in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] archipelago of the [[Azores]].

This area is occupied by relatively recent lava flows, with little evidence of pyroclastic eruptive material, translating into shallow soils and rocky covering.\n\nTowards the west and interior, the slope gradually increases, passing into a transition zone towards the cone of the Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara. The highest part of the parish, the apex of the administrative frontier corresponds to the watercourses that divide the ravines of [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]] and Cinco Ribeiras, an area of accentuated slopes, reaching the summit of the caldera of Santa B\u00e1rbara (the highest point on the island of Terceira). Apart from this volcano, the parish is little accented, with only the Pico da Praia, at {{convert|323|m|ft}} above sea level, representing the highest altitude in the parish.\n\nCinco Ribeiras is crossed by three primary ravines: the Ribeira do Mouro, the Ribeira das Cinco and the Ribeira da Praia, that are part of the radial drainage system, of the Santa B\u00e1rbara Massif.\n\n===Climate===\nSituated along the southwest of the Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara, the parish occupies a transition zone between oceanic and Mediterranean climate (on the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification between Csb, on the lower areas, and Cfb, on higher altitudes), exposed to strong southwest winds, resulting in elevated humidity during periods of atmospheric instability, intense orthographic precipitation in the higher altitudes. Precipitation along the massif results in flooding along the shallow ravines, which are unable to transport the water that flows from the higher altitudes.\n\n===Human geography===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:left;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of<br>Cinco Ribeiras<br><small>(1890 - 2011)</small>\n| 1890 | 1019\n| 1900 | 1180\n| 1911 | 1149\n| 1920 | 1017\n| 1930 | 1020\n| 1940 | 1072\n| 1950 | 1024\n| 1960 | 1018\n| 1970 | 880\n| 1981 | 657\n| 1991 | 650\n| 2001 | 684\n| 2011 | 704\n}}\n}}\n|}\nUrban development, much like the other settlements of Terceira, is constituted by a linear structure, that follows the main roadway that circles the island, with little expansion into the fields. The lateral roads normally accompany the ravines, except for the area between Ribeira do Mouro and Ribeira das Cinco, where smaller urban agglomerations developed along the municipal road of Canadinhas, the circuits {{convert|200|m|ft}} above the Regional Roadway to connect Cinco Ribeiras and Terra Ch\u00e3 (through S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Regatos).\n\nAnother nucleus in development, constituted by primarily summer homes, developed around the porto of Cinco Ribeiras, circling the small hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Lurdes, in addition to a few homes in the ''Canada do Porto'' alongside.\n\nFollowing the 1991 census the parish included 650 inhabitants (138 males and 114 female residents), included in the localities referred to as Ribeira das Cinco (51 inhabitants), Ribeira do Mouro (84 inhabitants) and Cinco Ribeiras (418 inhabitants). The population decreased during the 20th century, from its apex of 1180 residentes around 1900.\n\nThe evolution of the parish has been marked by emigration, primarily to Brasil, then the United States and finally to Canada. During the 20th century, the population maintained stable until the middle of the 1960s; then, following facilitated emigration laws and the consequence of the Kennedy-Pastore Act, the population began a rapid decline until it stabilized following the [[Carnation Revolution]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe traditional architecture of Cinco Ribeiras resembles much of the rural homes of the western Terceira region, and is generally constructed around a single floor. The settlement is also distinguished for its many white-washed homes, bordered by multi-coloured trim around the corners, doors and windows (unique for the island of Terceira).\n* '''Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Paroquial de Cinco Ribeiras/Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar}})<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=29064 |title=Igreja Paroquial de Altares/Igreja de S\u00e3o Roque (PT071901010058) |publisher=SIPA \u2013 Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o para o Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico|editor=SIPA|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese |first=Paula |last=No\u00e9 |year=2012 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n* '''Imp\u00e9rio of Holy Spirit of Cinco Ribeiras''' {{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo de Cinco Ribeiras}}<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=33792 |title=Igreja Paroquial de Altares/Igreja de S\u00e3o Roque (PT071901010058) |publisher=SIPA \u2013 Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o para o Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico|editor=SIPA|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese |first=Paula |last=No\u00e9 |year=2012 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Angra do Hero\u00edsmo}}\n\n[[Category:Parishes of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_Ribeiras"}

The Padres are the only MLB team that does not share its city with another franchise in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major American professional sports leagues]].  The Padres are the only [[List of American and Canadian cities by number of major professional sports franchises#List of teams by urban area|major professional sports franchise]] to be located in San Diego, following the [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation]] of the [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]] to [[Los Angeles]] in 2017. They are also the only franchise in the MLB not to have a [[no-hitter]], having gone 8,020 games without throwing one, a major league record to begin a franchise.<ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/padres-set-mlb-record-as-nohitter-drought-reaches-8020-games-025609221.html</ref>\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the San Diego Padres}}\n\n=== Minor league team ===\n{{See also|San Diego Padres (PCL)}}\nThe Padres adopted their name from the [[Pacific Coast League]] team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by 18-year-old [[Ted Williams]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall-of-Famer]] who was a native of San Diego.  The team's name, Spanish for \"fathers\", refers to the Spanish [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who founded [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|San Diego]] in 1769.\n\n===Major league team===\nIn [[1969 San Diego Padres season|1969]], the Padres joined the ranks of [[Major League Baseball]] as one of four new expansion teams, along with the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]]), the [[Kansas City Royals]], and the [[Seattle Pilots]] (now the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]). Their original owner was [[C. Arnholt Smith]], a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|PCL Padres]] whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and [[Buzzie Bavasi]] as well as a new [[Qualcomm Stadium|playing field]], the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the [[National League West|NL West]], losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger [[Nate Colbert]], an expansion draftee from the [[Houston Astros]] and still the Padres' career leader in home runs.\n\nThe team's fortunes gradually improved as they won five [[National League West]] titles and reached the [[World Series]] twice, in [[1984 World Series|1984]] and in [[1998 World Series|1998]], but lost both times. The Padres' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was [[Tony Gwynn]], who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, [[Petco Park]], in [[2004 San Diego Padres season|2004]].\n\nAs of 2019, the Padres are the only team in MLB yet to throw a no-hitter.  On July 18, 1972, [[Steve Arlin]] took a no-hitter to 2 outs in the 9th inning, which is as close as the team has come to achieving this feat.\n\n==Spring training==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 130\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = San Diego Padres logo 1985.png\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Padres logo, 1985\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = San Diego Padres logo 1986 to 1989.png\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = Padres logo, 1986\u201389\n\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = San Diego Padres logo 1990.png\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = Padres logo, 1990\n\n| image4    = San Diego Padres logo 1992 to 1998.png\n| caption4  = Padres logo, 1991\u20132003\n\n| image5    = San Diego Padres alternate logo 2000 to 2003.png\n| caption5  = Padres alternate logo, 2000\u201303\n\n| image6    = San Diego Padres logo.svg\n| caption6  = Padres primary logo, 2012\u201314\n\n| image7    = SDPadres logo.svg\n| caption7  = Padres primary logo, 2015\u201319\n}}\nThe team has played its spring training games at the [[Peoria Sports Complex]] in [[Peoria, Arizona]] since 1994. They share the stadium with the [[Seattle Mariners]].\n\nFrom 1969 to 1993, the Padres held spring training in [[Yuma, Arizona]] at [[Desert Sun Stadium]]. Due to the short driving distance and direct highway route (170 miles, all on [[Interstate 8]]), Yuma was very popular with Padres fans, and many fans would travel by car from San Diego for spring training games. The move from Yuma to Peoria was very controversial, but was defended by the team as a reflection on the low quality of facilities in Yuma and the long travel necessary to play against other Arizona-based spring training teams (whose sites were all in the Phoenix and Tucson areas, both rather far from Yuma).\n\n==Logos and colors==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}\nThroughout the team's history, the San Diego Padres have used multiple logos, uniform, and  color combinations. Their first logo depicted a [[friar]] swinging a bat with Padres written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres on the exterior of it. The \"Swinging Friar\" has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the \"Swinging Friar\" is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the [[mascot]] of the team and is now utilized as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.\n\nIn 1985, the Padres switched to using a script-like logo in which ''Padres'' was written sloped up. That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team's colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the 1990 season.\n\nIn 1989, the Padres took the scripted Padres logo that was used from 1985 to 1988 and put it in a gray ring that read \"San Diego Baseball Club\" with a striped center. In 1991, the color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows. In 1991, the team's colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.\n\nFor the 2002 season, the Padres removed the stripes off the home jersey and went with a white home jersey with a cleaner look. The pinstripe jerseys were worn as alternate jerseys on certain occasions throughout the 2002 season. The Padres kept this design for two seasons until their 2004 season, in which they moved into their new ballpark.\n\nThe logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the 2003 and 2004 seasons, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with ''San Diego'' written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team's colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. For the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a gray jersey, with the team typically playing in either blue or sand jerseys on the road and white or blue jerseys at home. In 2009, the ''San Diego'' was removed from the top right corner of the logo and two years later, the away uniform changed from sand to gray.\n\nFor the 2012 season, the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" adorning the outer circle. The \"swinging friar\" logo was recolored to the current colors of navy blue and white. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year's primary logo below the depiction of [[Petco Park]] in sand and above the year of the team's first season (EST. 1969).

The Padres are the only MLB team that does not share its city with another franchise in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major American professional sports leagues]].  The Padres are the only [[List of American and Canadian cities by number of major professional sports franchises#List of teams by urban area|major professional sports franchise]] to be located in San Diego, following the [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation]] of the [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]] to [[Los Angeles]] in 2017. They are also the only franchise in the MLB not to have a [[no-hitter]], having gone 8,020 games without throwing one, a major league record to begin a franchise.<ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/padres-set-mlb-record-as-nohitter-drought-reaches-8020-games-025609221.html</ref>\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the San Diego Padres}}\n\n=== Minor league team ===\n{{See also|San Diego Padres (PCL)}}\nThe Padres adopted their name from the [[Pacific Coast League]] team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by 18-year-old [[Ted Williams]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall-of-Famer]] who was a native of San Diego.  The team's name, Spanish for \"fathers\", refers to the Spanish [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who founded [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|San Diego]] in 1769.\n\n===Major league team===\nIn [[1969 San Diego Padres season|1969]], the Padres joined the ranks of [[Major League Baseball]] as one of four new expansion teams, along with the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]]), the [[Kansas City Royals]], and the [[Seattle Pilots]] (now the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]). Their original owner was [[C. Arnholt Smith]], a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|PCL Padres]] whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and [[Buzzie Bavasi]] as well as a new [[Qualcomm Stadium|playing field]], the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the [[National League West|NL West]], losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger [[Nate Colbert]], an expansion draftee from the [[Houston Astros]] and still the Padres' career leader in home runs.\n\nThe team's fortunes gradually improved as they won five [[National League West]] titles and reached the [[World Series]] twice, in [[1984 World Series|1984]] and in [[1998 World Series|1998]], but lost both times. The Padres' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was [[Tony Gwynn]], who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, [[Petco Park]], in [[2004 San Diego Padres season|2004]].\n\nAs of 2019, the Padres are the only team in MLB yet to throw a no-hitter.  On September 5, 1997, [[Andy Ashby]] took a no-hitter into the 9th inning, which is as close as the team has come to achieving this feat.\n\n==Spring training==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 130\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = San Diego Padres logo 1985.png\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Padres logo, 1985\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = San Diego Padres logo 1986 to 1989.png\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = Padres logo, 1986\u201389\n\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = San Diego Padres logo 1990.png\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = Padres logo, 1990\n\n| image4    = San Diego Padres logo 1992 to 1998.png\n| caption4  = Padres logo, 1991\u20132003\n\n| image5    = San Diego Padres alternate logo 2000 to 2003.png\n| caption5  = Padres alternate logo, 2000\u201303\n\n| image6    = San Diego Padres logo.svg\n| caption6  = Padres primary logo, 2012\u201314\n\n| image7    = SDPadres logo.svg\n| caption7  = Padres primary logo, 2015\u201319\n}}\nThe team has played its spring training games at the [[Peoria Sports Complex]] in [[Peoria, Arizona]] since 1994. They share the stadium with the [[Seattle Mariners]].\n\nFrom 1969 to 1993, the Padres held spring training in [[Yuma, Arizona]] at [[Desert Sun Stadium]]. Due to the short driving distance and direct highway route (170 miles, all on [[Interstate 8]]), Yuma was very popular with Padres fans, and many fans would travel by car from San Diego for spring training games. The move from Yuma to Peoria was very controversial, but was defended by the team as a reflection on the low quality of facilities in Yuma and the long travel necessary to play against other Arizona-based spring training teams (whose sites were all in the Phoenix and Tucson areas, both rather far from Yuma).\n\n==Logos and colors==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}\nThroughout the team's history, the San Diego Padres have used multiple logos, uniform, and  color combinations. Their first logo depicted a [[friar]] swinging a bat with Padres written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres on the exterior of it. The \"Swinging Friar\" has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the \"Swinging Friar\" is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the [[mascot]] of the team and is now utilized as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.\n\nIn 1985, the Padres switched to using a script-like logo in which ''Padres'' was written sloped up. That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team's colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the 1990 season.\n\nIn 1989, the Padres took the scripted Padres logo that was used from 1985 to 1988 and put it in a gray ring that read \"San Diego Baseball Club\" with a striped center. In 1991, the color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows. In 1991, the team's colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.\n\nFor the 2002 season, the Padres removed the stripes off the home jersey and went with a white home jersey with a cleaner look. The pinstripe jerseys were worn as alternate jerseys on certain occasions throughout the 2002 season. The Padres kept this design for two seasons until their 2004 season, in which they moved into their new ballpark.\n\nThe logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the 2003 and 2004 seasons, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with ''San Diego'' written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team's colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. For the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a gray jersey, with the team typically playing in either blue or sand jerseys on the road and white or blue jerseys at home. In 2009, the ''San Diego'' was removed from the top right corner of the logo and two years later, the away uniform changed from sand to gray.\n\nFor the 2012 season, the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" adorning the outer circle. The \"swinging friar\" logo was recolored to the current colors of navy blue and white. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year's primary logo below the depiction of [[Petco Park]] in sand and above the year of the team's first season (EST. 1969). Until 2015, the blue and sand version was used on the home uniform, while the blue and white version was used on the away and alternate uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brock|first=Corey|title=Padres' new uniforms a nod to tradition|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/25946088/|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=November 9, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2016 season, the Padres wore a navy blue and yellow color scheme, similar to the one used on the [[2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] logo.<ref>{{cite web|last=Center|first=Bill|title=Padres' uniforms salute past, future, Navy|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/158864630|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref> To coincide with the change, the Padres added a new brown and yellow alternate uniform to be worn mostly during Friday home games.\n\nFor the 2017 season, the Padres revealed a new color scheme and new jerseys for the second straight year.

In 2026, a civil war erupts on Altis following a [[coup d'etat]] by the Altis Armed Forces (AAF). In 2030, a ceasefire is declared. A loyalist rebel group, the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA), rejects the new military government and wages a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the AAF. NATO [[peacekeeping]] forces are deployed to Altis, establishing a US-led joint NATO-AAF peacekeeping force, Task Force Aegis (TF Aegis). Five years later, NATO investment in the Aegean dwindles, and CSAT begins to subsidize the AAF and mobilizes its own forces in the Pacific. With the peacekeeping mandate nearing its end, NATO begins to withdraw from Altis, and tensions rise between AAF and NATO.<ref>https://arma3.com/features/campaign</ref><ref>https://arma3.com/features/factions</ref>\n\nThe DLC campaign, ''Apex Protocol'', added in the ''ARMA 3: Apex'' expansion, is set on the Northern Division of a South Pacific island group nation known as the Horizon Islands Federation. The division is commonly known as Tanoa, the largest island in the division. The campaign takes place after the events of the base game campaign, following the regroup with NATO ending.\n\n''Remnants of War'' is a story-driven DLC campaign added in the ''Laws of War'' DLC. The story focuses on Nathan MacDade, an [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] technician working for the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP for short), a humanitarian [[NGO]]. Other scenarios are explored as Nathan reminisces about past events. Some actions the player can take have moral consequences, which are reflected in the ending.\n\nThe main player character of the singleplayer campaign features [[Corporal]] Ben Kerry, a [[United States Army|US Army]] soldier assigned to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] deployed on Stratis. Players also play as [[Sergeant]] Conway during the prologue. Other major NATO characters include [[Staff Sergeant]] Adams, General Armstrong, as well as Combat Technology Research Group (a NATO spec ops group, CTRG for short) personnel Captain Scott Miller, and Miller's second in command Lieutenant James. Major FIA characters include Kostas Stavrou, leader of northern FIA forces, and Nikos Panagopoulos, an FIA head. Players play as CTRG Group 15 operators in ''Apex Protocol''.\n\n===''The East Wind''===\nIn 2034, a firing incident between the AAF and FIA leads to the breakdown of their ceasefire, and eventually escalates into open warfare. NATO-AAF relations deteriorate, and NATO peacekeepers are reduced to the smaller island of Stratis. By 2035, NATO prepares to fully withdraw from Stratis. On July 7, 2035, the AAF suddenly attacks the remaining NATO forces on Stratis, destroying their bases and killing their commander.{{#tag:ref|The exact cause of AAF attacking NATO is unclear, though it is implied to be a reaction to a NATO black operation.|group=N}} Corporal Ben Kerry and Staff Sergeant Adams attempt to regroup with NATO survivors, but Adams is killed by a [[landmine]]. Kerry and other NATO survivors eventually regroup under a group of [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British special forces]] led by Captain Scott Miller.\n\nMiller organizes a number of ineffective [[guerrilla]] missions against the AAF, while his own squad conducts clandestine operations independently. Over the course of a few days, under group Alpha, Kerry helps destroy a helicopter to hide the position of the NATO survivors, breaks an AAF siege around a small village, assassinates a high ranking AAF commander, and helps attack Mike Air Station-26 to try and contact NATO MEDCOM (which fails). After making contact with an FIA operative by the name of Nikos Panagopolous, Kerry's group follows them to a cache, only to have it destroyed by AAF forces, with Nikos seemingly escaping. With the cache lost, Miller orders an attack on AAF positions in the south, but after overunning a village, mortar fire hits Camp Maxwell where the NATO survivors are hiding. Despite Miller's orders, Kerry's team returns to camp to find it in ruins, with NATO survivors tending to the wounded. The next day, Miller manages to contact NATO command and arranges for a re-invasion of Stratis. To assist with the invasion, Miller leads the survivors to take control of a town on Stratis, called Agia Marina. However, CSAT reinforcements foil the operation, and Miller orders the survivors to head to Altis on two boats he prepared in a small cove. Miller states that the survivors will link up with the FIA upon arriving at Altis, but AAF [[Attack aircraft|attack jets]] attack and destroy the boats before they arrive at Altis.\n\nKerry wakes up on Altis and manages to reunite with Lieutenant James, Miller's second in command, who laid in on a mountain after an FIA attack on Kavala (the former capital of Altis) failed miserably. Kerry is taken to the FIA and given charge of an FIA squad to ambush a convoy. During this part, Kerry can accidentally destroy the ammo truck, though it does not effect the outcome of the mission as CSAT carries out a massive counterattack and nearly exterminates the FIA, forcing them to move to a different camp near Gori. More missions pass as Kerry helps take down an outpost and capture a fuel truck (he can either use the fuel truck to blow up a ranking commander from CSAT and lower CSAT's reserves in later missions, or bring the fuel back and get a head start on other missions). In the next mission, Kerry helps an officer named Orestes defect, and uses him to either take down a helicopter or raid a CSAT fuel dump. Eventually, the FIA learns that their main smuggler and figurehead, Nikos Panagopolous, has been spotted on the island of Stratis, and CTRG arranges a rescue operation to retrieve him. The operation is successful, and the FIA begins to become more emboldened in their strategy. Later on, the FIA learns that NATO main forces will be invading Altis, and plans their own operation to assist. During the operation, Kerry witnesses NATO [[gunship]]s firing on FIA forces. Kerry manages to call off the attack through a downed NATO pilot. The next day, NATO commander Colonel Armstrong meets with Kerry and tells him that they were unaware of the FIA's activities around the AAC airfield. When Kerry asks about Miller, Armstrong responds that he has no knowledge of Scott Miller, and that British forces left Stratis many months ago. Mentioning Miller drives Armstrong to believe Kerry may be hostile, on top of the fact that he is the only survivor from Task Force Aegis on Stratis.\n\nArmstrong, under the callsign \"Crossroads\", orders Kerry to lead an FIA squad and assist in NATO operations. NATO manages to repel AAF and CSAT forces and secure most of Altis. Crossroads confirms that Miller is not hostile, but he warns Kerry to avoid him and his team. During this time, tectonic activity on Altis increases sharply.\n\nWith the AAF on the verge of defeat, Crossroads orders all NATO forces to regroup for one final offensive, Kerry is suddenly contacted by a dying Lt. James who provides his location to find him. Kerry can either regroup with NATO or disobey orders and find James.\n\nIf Kerry regroups with NATO, Kerry is ordered to lead a reconnaissance squad to mark out enemy positions and spearhead the offensive. The AAF surrenders shortly after the offensive begins. An epilogue set six weeks later shows peace returning to Altis, while Kerry, now Sergeant, works with the continued NATO presence to maintain peace.\n\nIf Kerry looks for James, Kerry finds him at the site of a failed assault on a secret CSAT facility. James orders Kerry to find a truck loaded with a special device and take it to Miller, before dying. Kerry finds the truck in the facility and brings it to Miller. Kerry confronts Miller about his manipulations and the nature of the device, but Miller only hints that the device is responsible for the recent tremors. As they talk, CSAT suddenly launches a massive invasion against both NATO and the AAF, forcing NATO into withdrawal. Miller initially promises to return for Kerry after he takes the device off the island, but breaks the promise after he leaves, leaving Kerry alone to find a way off the island.\n\n===''Apex Protocol''===\n\nFollowing a major tsunami known as the Pacific disaster, the paramilitary crime syndicate, the Syndikat, rose to power in several regions on Tanoa. Finding the Syndikat's rapid expansion suspicious, NATO sends in CTRG Group 15 to investigate.\n\nCTRG Group 15, under callsign \"Raider\", deploys on Tanoa and conducts several operations against the Syndikat, destroying a Syndikat ammo depot and ambushing a Syndikat convoy. They discover evidence of CSAT support of the Syndikat. During an operation to capture the Syndikat's leader, Solomon Maru, Raider instead finds that they've been led into an ambush by the Chinese CSAT special forces Viper Team. Raider manages to escape from the ambush.\n\nFollowing the ambush, Raider conducts an operation to rescue CTRG asset \"Keystone\". Keystone turns out to be Captain Scott Miller, leader of CTRG Group 14, who had been tracking the special CSAT device since it left Altis, which is a [[tectonic weapon]] codenamed \"Eastwind\". Miller believes that Viper deployed Eastwind on Tanoa, causing the Pacific disaster, and supported the Syndikat, all to destabilize Tanoa.\n\nAfter rescuing Miller, CTRG raids a Viper black site on Tanoa to retrieve Eastwind. They find the black site already attacked and abandoned; Syndikat double-crossed CSAT before CTRG arrived, holding Eastwind ransom to blackmail against CSAT. CTRG did however recover files about CSAT's \"Apex Protocol,\" which involves using operatives to destabilize strategically important nations so CSAT can provide assistance and foster CSAT support.\n\nCTRG tracks Eastwind to a large port, where CSAT attempts to deal with Syndikat to recover Eastwind, while Maru arms Eastwind. CTRG quickly attacks, fighting against both Syndikat and Viper, and manages to kill Maru, disarm Eastwind, and secure the device. Following the operation, CSAT's Apex Protocol is exposed to the whole world, leading to international condemnation, while Eastwind is now in NATO's possession.\n\n===''Remnants of War''===\n\nDays after the end of the NATO invasion of Altis, a civilian mechanic from the Altis town of Oreokastro returns to the town, after hearing news that his missing brother had appeared at the town's church in a recent firefight. As he searches the church, he is killed by a landmine.\n\nSeveral days later, journalist Katherine Bishop conducts an online interview with Nathan MacDade as he works on the disposal of [[explosive remnants of war]] at Oreokastro. Oreokastro, formerly a major FIA garrison and the site of an IDAP camp, was completely destroyed during the war and is now a [[ghost town]]. Nathan reminisces about Oreokastro's past as he conducts his work, and tells five stories surrounding Oreokastro during the war.\n\n* In the first story, after the breakdown of the FIA-AAF ceasefire, NATO peacekeeper Staff Sergeant Adams led a TF Aegis squad to secure a NATO [[airdrop]] intended for the Oreokastro IDAP camp, and repelled an attack from FIA bandits.\n* In the second story, a FIA fighter from Oreokastro, Alexis Kouris, sets up defenses around Oreokastro after the AAF announced their plans to assault the town.\n* In the third story, Nathan recounts a rumor that a squad of supposed CSAT special forces parachuted in near Oreokastro and [[Laser designator|designated]] FIA positions in the town for an AAF [[cluster bomb]] air strike, destroying much of the town. Nathan notes that NATO casings were discovered on site, and it is implied that the special forces may have been Miller's CTRG team instead.\n* In the fourth story, Markos Kouris, Alexis' brother and a [[non-combatant]] at Oreokastro, was heavily injured by the AAF air strike. As the AAF assaults the town, Markos limps his way to the IDAP camp at the town church, and was eventually evacuated. The town is abandoned after the assault.\n* In the final story, set during the NATO invasion of Altis, AAF officers Lieutenant Antoniou Dimitriou and Major Gavras were overwhelmed by NATO-FIA forces and were pushed back to Oreokastro. The two defend themselves at the town's church, and deploy landmines for self defense. They withstand the attack and extract. Alexis is one of the casualties in the assault, leading Markos to search the church after the war, resulting in him being killed by leftover landmines.\n\nBack at present, Katherine asks Nathan about who he thinks is most responsible for the destruction of Oreokastro: NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA, or nobody. After Nathan responds, Katherine shows Nathan a draft of her report on the impacts the war had left on the life on Altis, the contents reflecting on the player's actions throughout the campaign. As Nathan completes the EOD operation, he bides Katherine farewell as he and his team pack up and leave Oreokastro, proceeding to their next cleanup site.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:James Crowe Bohemia Interactive.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jay Crowe was the game's creative director and provided some voice acting for the game.]]\nBohemia Interactive officially announced the development of ''ARMA 3'' on May 19, 2011.<ref name=\"arma3anounced\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/bohemia-interactive-oznamuje-arma-3-55791|title=ARMA 3 announced|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In June 2012 an [[Alpha release|alpha version]] of the game was demonstrated at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]].<ref name=\"alpha-e3\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tv/arma-3-e3-2012-rozhovor-6419|title=Arma 3 shown during E3 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Bohemia Interactive announced that they will release three [[downloadable content]] episodes for free after the game's initial launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arma3.com/news/arma-3-campaign-deployed-across-3-free-dlc-episodes|title=Free DLC|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> An alpha version of the game was released on March 5, 2013, allowing players to experience the game during development, as well as assist in development by reporting bugs and giving feedback on their experience.

In 2026, a civil war erupts on Altis following a [[coup d'etat]] by the Altis Armed Forces (AAF). In 2030, a ceasefire is declared. A loyalist rebel group, the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA), rejects the new military government and wages a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the AAF. NATO [[peacekeeping]] forces are deployed to Altis, establishing a US-led joint NATO-AAF peacekeeping force, Task Force Aegis (TF Aegis). Five years later, NATO investment in the Aegean dwindles, and CSAT begins to subsidize the AAF and mobilizes its own forces in the Pacific. With the peacekeeping mandate nearing its end, NATO begins to withdraw from Altis, and tensions rise between AAF and NATO.<ref>https://arma3.com/features/campaign</ref><ref>https://arma3.com/features/factions</ref>\n\nThe DLC campaign, ''Apex Protocol'', added in the ''ARMA 3: Apex'' expansion, is set on the Northern Division of a South Pacific island group nation known as the Horizon Islands Federation. The division is commonly known as Tanoa, the largest island in the division. The campaign takes place after the events of the base game campaign, following the regroup with NATO ending.\n\n''Remnants of War'' is a story-driven DLC campaign added in the ''Laws of War'' DLC. The story focuses on Nathan MacDade, an [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] technician working for the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP for short), a humanitarian [[NGO]]. Other scenarios are explored as Nathan reminisces about past events. Some actions the player can take have moral consequences, which are reflected in the ending.\n\nThe main player character of the singleplayer campaign features [[Corporal]] Ben Kerry, a [[United States Army|US Army]] soldier assigned to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] deployed on Stratis. Players also play as [[Sergeant]] Conway during the prologue. Other major NATO characters include [[Staff Sergeant]] Adams, General Armstrong, as well as Combat Technology Research Group (a NATO spec ops group, CTRG for short) personnel Captain Scott Miller, and Miller's second in command Lieutenant James. Major FIA characters include Kostas Stavrou, leader of northern FIA forces, and Nikos Panagopoulos, an FIA head. Players play as CTRG Group 15 operators in ''Apex Protocol''.\n\n===''The East Wind''===\nIn 2034, a firing incident between the AAF and FIA leads to the breakdown of their ceasefire, and eventually escalates into open warfare. NATO-AAF relations deteriorate, and NATO peacekeepers are reduced to the smaller island of Stratis. By 2035, NATO prepares to fully withdraw from Stratis. On July 7, 2035, the AAF suddenly attacks the remaining NATO forces on Stratis, destroying their bases and killing their commander.{{#tag:ref|The exact cause of AAF attacking NATO is unclear, though it is implied to be a reaction to a NATO black operation.|group=N}} Corporal Ben Kerry and Staff Sergeant Adams attempt to regroup with NATO survivors, but Adams is killed by a [[landmine]]. Kerry and other NATO survivors eventually regroup under a group of [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British special forces]] led by Captain Scott Miller.\n\nMiller organizes a number of ineffective [[guerrilla]] missions against the AAF, while his own squad conducts clandestine operations independently. Over the course of a few days, under group Alpha, Kerry helps destroy a helicopter to hide the position of the NATO survivors, breaks an AAF siege around a small village, assassinates a high ranking AAF commander, and helps attack Mike Air Station-26 to try and contact NATO MEDCOM (which fails). After making contact with an FIA operative by the name of Nikos Panagopolous, Kerry's group follows them to a cache, only to have it destroyed by AAF forces, with Nikos seemingly escaping. With the cache lost, Miller orders an attack on AAF positions in the south, but after overunning a village, mortar fire hits Camp Maxwell where the NATO survivors are hiding. Despite Miller's orders, Kerry's team returns to camp to find it in ruins, with NATO survivors tending to the wounded. The next day, Miller manages to contact NATO command and arranges for a re-invasion of Stratis. To assist with the invasion, Miller leads the survivors to take control of a town on Stratis, called Agia Marina. However, CSAT reinforcements foil the operation, and Miller orders the survivors to head to Altis on two boats he prepared in a small cove. Miller states that the survivors will link up with the FIA upon arriving at Altis, but AAF [[Attack aircraft|attack jets]] attack and destroy the boats before they arrive at Altis.\n\nKerry wakes up on Altis and manages to reunite with Lieutenant James, Miller's second in command, who laid in on a mountain after an FIA attack on Kavala (the former capital of Altis) failed miserably. Kerry is taken to the FIA and given charge of an FIA squad to ambush a convoy. During this part, Kerry can accidentally destroy the ammo truck, though it does not effect the outcome of the mission as CSAT carries out a massive counterattack and nearly exterminates the FIA, forcing them to move to a different camp near Gori. More missions pass as Kerry helps take down an outpost and capture a fuel truck (he can either use the fuel truck to blow up a ranking commander from CSAT and lower CSAT's reserves in later missions, or bring the fuel back and get a head start on other missions). In the next mission, Kerry helps an officer named Orestes defect, and uses him to either take down a helicopter or raid a CSAT fuel dump. Eventually, the FIA learns that their main smuggler and figurehead, Nikos Panagopolous, has been spotted on the island of Stratis, and CTRG arranges a rescue operation to retrieve him. The operation is successful, and the FIA begins to become more emboldened in their strategy. Later on, the FIA learns that NATO main forces will be invading Altis, and plans their own operation to assist. During the operation, Kerry witnesses NATO [[gunship]]s firing on FIA forces. Kerry manages to call off the attack through a downed NATO pilot. The next day, NATO commander Colonel Armstrong meets with Kerry and tells him that they were unaware of the FIA's activities around the AAC airfield. When Kerry asks about Miller, Armstrong responds that he has no knowledge of Scott Miller, and that British forces left Stratis many months ago. Mentioning Miller drives Armstrong to believe Kerry may be hostile, on top of the fact that he is the only survivor from Task Force Aegis on Stratis.\n\nArmstrong, under the callsign \"Crossroads\", orders Kerry to lead an FIA squad and assist in NATO operations. NATO manages to repel AAF and CSAT forces and secure most of Altis. Crossroads confirms that Miller is not hostile, but he warns Kerry to avoid him and his team. During this time, tectonic activity on Altis increases sharply.\n\nWith the AAF on the verge of defeat, Crossroads orders all NATO forces to regroup for one final offensive, Kerry is suddenly contacted by a dying Lt. James who provides his location to find him. Kerry can either regroup with NATO or disobey orders and find James.\n\nIf Kerry regroups with NATO, Kerry is ordered to lead a reconnaissance squad to mark out enemy positions and spearhead the offensive. The AAF surrenders shortly after the offensive begins. An epilogue set six weeks later shows peace returning to Altis, while Kerry, now Sergeant, works with the continued NATO presence to maintain peace.\n\nIf Kerry looks for James, Kerry finds him at the site of a failed assault on a secret CSAT facility. James orders Kerry to find a truck loaded with a special device and take it to Miller, before dying. Kerry finds the truck in the facility and brings it to Miller. Kerry confronts Miller about his manipulations and the nature of the device, but Miller only hints that the device is responsible for the recent tremors. As they talk, CSAT suddenly launches a massive invasion against both NATO and the AAF, forcing NATO into withdrawal. Miller initially promises to return for Kerry after he takes the device off the island, but breaks the promise after he leaves, leaving Kerry alone to find a way off the island.\n\n===''Apex Protocol''===\n\nFollowing a major tsunami known as the Pacific disaster, the paramilitary crime syndicate, the Syndikat, rose to power in several regions on Tanoa. Finding the Syndikat's rapid expansion suspicious, NATO sends in CTRG Group 15 to investigate.\n\nCTRG Group 15, under callsign \"Raider\", deploys on Tanoa and conducts several operations against the Syndikat, destroying a Syndikat ammo depot and ambushing a Syndikat convoy. They discover evidence of CSAT support of the Syndikat. During an operation to capture the Syndikat's leader, Solomon Maru, Raider instead finds that they've been led into an ambush by the Chinese CSAT special forces Viper Team. Raider manages to escape from the ambush.\n\nFollowing the ambush, Raider conducts an operation to rescue CTRG asset \"Keystone\". Keystone turns out to be Captain Scott Miller, leader of CTRG Group 14, who had been tracking the special CSAT device since it left Altis, which is a [[tectonic weapon]] codenamed \"Eastwind\". Miller believes that Viper deployed Eastwind on Tanoa, causing the Pacific disaster, and supported the Syndikat, all to destabilize Tanoa.\n\nAfter rescuing Miller, CTRG raids a Viper black site on Tanoa to retrieve Eastwind. They find the black site already attacked and abandoned; Syndikat double-crossed CSAT before CTRG arrived, holding Eastwind ransom to blackmail against CSAT. CTRG did however recover files about CSAT's \"Apex Protocol,\" which involves using operatives to destabilize strategically important nations so CSAT can provide assistance and foster CSAT support.\n\nCTRG tracks Eastwind to a large port, where CSAT attempts to deal with Syndikat to recover Eastwind, while Maru arms Eastwind. CTRG quickly attacks, fighting against both Syndikat and Viper, and manages to kill Maru, disarm Eastwind, and secure the device. Following the operation, CSAT's Apex Protocol is exposed to the whole world, leading to international condemnation, while Eastwind is now in NATO's possession.\n\n===''Remnants of War''===\n\nDays after the end of the NATO invasion of Altis, a civilian mechanic from the Altis town of Oreokastro returns to the town, after hearing news that his missing brother had appeared at the town's church in a recent firefight. As he searches the church, he is killed by a landmine.\n\nSeveral days later, journalist Katherine Bishop conducts an online interview with Nathan MacDade as he works on the disposal of [[explosive remnants of war]] at Oreokastro. Oreokastro, formerly a major FIA garrison and the site of an IDAP camp, was completely destroyed during the war and is now a [[ghost town]]. Nathan reminisces about Oreokastro's past as he conducts his work, and tells five stories surrounding Oreokastro during the war.\n\n* In the first story, after the breakdown of the FIA-AAF ceasefire, NATO peacekeeper Staff Sergeant Adams led a TF Aegis squad to secure a NATO [[airdrop]] intended for the Oreokastro IDAP camp, and repelled an attack from FIA bandits.\n* In the second story, a FIA fighter from Oreokastro, Alexis Kouris, sets up defenses around Oreokastro after the AAF announced their plans to assault the town.\n* In the third story, Nathan recounts a rumor that a squad of supposed CSAT special forces parachuted in near Oreokastro and [[Laser designator|designated]] FIA positions in the town for an AAF [[cluster bomb]] air strike, destroying much of the town. Nathan notes that NATO casings were discovered on site, and it is implied that the special forces may have been Miller's CTRG team instead.\n* In the fourth story, Markos Kouris, Alexis' brother and a [[non-combatant]] at Oreokastro, was heavily injured by the AAF air strike. As the AAF assaults the town, Markos limps his way to the IDAP camp at the town church, and was eventually evacuated. The town is abandoned after the assault.\n* In the final story, set during the NATO invasion of Altis, AAF officers Lieutenant Antoniou Dimitriou and Major Gavras were overwhelmed by NATO-FIA forces and were pushed back to Oreokastro. The two defend themselves at the town's church, and deploy landmines for self defense. They withstand the attack and extract. Alexis is one of the casualties in the assault, leading Markos to search the church after the war, resulting in him being killed by leftover landmines.\n\nBack at present, Katherine asks Nathan about who he thinks is most responsible for the destruction of Oreokastro: NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA, or nobody. After Nathan responds, Katherine shows Nathan a draft of her report on the impacts the war had left on the life on Altis, the contents reflecting on the player's actions throughout the campaign. As Nathan completes the EOD operation, he bides Katherine farewell as he and his team pack up and leave Oreokastro, proceeding to their next cleanup site.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:James Crowe Bohemia Interactive.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jay Crowe was the game's creative director and provided some voice acting for the game.]]\nBohemia Interactive officially announced the development of ''ARMA 3'' on May 19, 2011.<ref name=\"arma3anounced\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/bohemia-interactive-oznamuje-arma-3-55791|title=ARMA 3 announced|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In June 2012 an [[Alpha release|alpha version]] of the game was demonstrated at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]].<ref name=\"alpha-e3\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tv/arma-3-e3-2012-rozhovor-6419|title=Arma 3 shown during E3 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Bohemia Interactive announced that they will release three [[downloadable content]] episodes for free after the game's initial launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arma3.com/news/arma-3-campaign-deployed-across-3-free-dlc-episodes|title=Free DLC|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> An alpha version of the game was released on March 5, 2013, allowing players to experience the game during development, as well as assist in development by reporting bugs and giving feedback on their experience.
