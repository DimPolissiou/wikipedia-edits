Each user had sole control of the machine for a scheduled period of time. They would arrive at the computer with program and data, often on punched paper cards and magnetic or paper tape, and would load their program, run and debug it, and carry off their output when done.\n\nAs computers became faster the setup and takedown time became a larger percentage of available computer time. Programs called ''monitors'', the forerunners of [[operating system]]s, were developed which could process a series, or \"batch\", of programs, often from [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] prepared offline. The monitor would be loaded into the computer and run the first job of the batch. At the end of the job it would regain control and load and run the next until the batch was complete. Often the output of the batch would be written to magnetic tape and printed or punched offline. Examples of monitors were IBM's ''Fortran Monitor System'', SOS (Share Operating System),\nand finally [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS|IBSYS]] for IBM's [[IBM 700/7000 series|709x]] systems in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Direct Couple for the IBM 7090\n|website=SoftwarePreservationGroup.org |url=http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/os/dc.html\n|quote=IBSYS was an operating system for the 7090 that evolved from SOS (SHARE Operating System)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=History of Operating Systems |url=https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/16wi/readings/lecture_readings/LCM_OperatingSystemsTimeline_Color_acd_newsize.pdf |website=University of Washington |accessdate=Oct 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Third-generation systems===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[Third-generation computer]]s capable of [[multiprogramming]] began to appear in the 1960s. Instead of running one batch job at a time, these systems can have multiple batch programs running at the same time in order to keep the system as busy as possible. One or more programs might be awaiting input, one actively running on the CPU, and others generating output. Instead of offline input and output, programs called [[spooler]]s read jobs from cards, disk, or remote terminals and place them in a [[batch queue|job queue]] to be run. In order to prevent [[deadlock]]s the [[job scheduler]] needs to know each job's resource requirements\u2014memory, magnetic tapes, mountable [[disk storage|disks]], etc., so various scripting languages were developed to supply this information in a structured way. Probably the most well-known is IBM's ''[[Job Control Language]]'' (JCL). Job schedulers select jobs to run according to a variety of criteria, including priority, memory size, etc.  [[Remote job entry|Remote batch]] is a procedure for submitting batch jobs from remote terminals, often equipped with a [[punch card reader]] and a [[line printer]]. Sometimes [[asymmetric multiprocessing]] is used to spool batch input and output for one or more large computers using an attached smaller and less-expensive system, as in the IBM System/360 [[Attached Support Processor]].\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:CDC NOS batch file.jpg|right|thumb|[[Control Data Corporation|CDC]] [[NOS (software)|NOS]] batch file to get the file STARTRK and output it to the card punch]]\nFrom the late 1960s onwards, [[interactive computing]] such as via text-based [[computer terminal]] interfaces (as in [[Unix shell]]s or [[read-eval-print loop]]s), and later [[graphical user interface]]s became common. Non-interactive computation, both one-off jobs such as compilation, and processing of multiple items in batches, became retrospectively referred to as ''batch processing'', and the term ''batch job'' (in early use often \"batch ''of'' jobs\") became common. Early use is \nparticularly found at the [[University of Michigan]], around the [[Michigan Terminal System]] (MTS).\n<ref>{{cite journal\n|journal=Research News\n|publisher=University of Michigan\n|title=The Computing Center: Coming to Terms with the IBM System/360 Model 67\n|volume=20\n|year=1969\n|issue=Nov/Dec\n|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qs9VAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA122&dq=%22batch+job%22 10]\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough timesharing did exist, its use was not robust enough for corporate data processing; none of this was related to the earlier [[unit record equipment]], which was human-operated.\n\n===Ongoing===\nNon-interactive computation remains pervasive in computing, both for general data processing and for system \"housekeeping\" tasks (using [[system software]]). A high-level program (executing multiple programs, with some additional \"glue\" logic) is today most often called a ''script'', and written in [[scripting language]]s, particularly [[shell script]]s for system tasks; in [[IBM PC DOS]] and [[MS-DOS]] this is instead known as a [[batch file]]. That includes [[UNIX]]-based computers, [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] (whose foundation is the [[BSD]] Unix kernel), and even [[smartphones]]. A running script, particularly one executed from an interactive [[login session]], is often known as a [[job (Unix)|job]], but that term is used very ambiguously.\n\n\"There is no direct counterpart to z/OS\u00ae batch processing in PC or UNIX\u00ae systems. Batch jobs are typically executed at a scheduled time or on an as-needed basis. Perhaps the closest comparison is with processes run by an AT\u00ae or CRON command in UNIX, although the differences are significant.\"<ref name=whatis />\n\n== Modern systems ==\nBatch applications are still critical in most organizations in large part because many common business processes are amenable to batch processing. While online systems can also function when manual intervention is not desired, they are not typically optimized to perform high-volume, repetitive tasks. Therefore, even new systems usually contain one or more batch applications for updating information at the end of the day, generating reports, printing documents, and other non-interactive tasks that must complete reliably within certain business deadlines.\n\nSome applications are amenable to flow processing, namely those that only need data from a single input at once (not totals, for instance): start the next step for each input as it completes the previous step. In this case flow processing lowers [[latency (engineering)|latency]] for individual inputs, allowing them to be completed without waiting for the entire batch to finish. However, many applications require data from all records, notably computations such as totals. In this case the entire batch must be completed before one has a usable result: partial results are not usable.\n\nModern batch applications make use of modern batch frameworks such as [[Jem The Bee]], [[Spring Batch]] or implementations of [[Java Specification Request|JSR]] 352<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=352|title=Batch Applications for the Java Platform|publisher=Java Community Process|accessdate=2015-08-03}}</ref> written for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and other frameworks for other programming languages, to provide the [[fault tolerance]] and [[scalability]] required for high-volume processing.  In order to ensure high-speed processing, batch applications are often integrated with [[grid computing]] solutions to [[partition of a set|partition]] a batch job over a large number of processors, although there are significant programming challenges in doing so. High volume batch processing places particularly heavy demands on system and application architectures as well. Architectures that feature strong [[input/output]] performance and vertical [[scalability]], including modern [[mainframe computers]], tend to provide better batch performance than alternatives.\n\n[[Scripting languages]] became popular as they evolved along with batch processing.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=IBM.com  |title=JSR352 null\n|url=https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=tss1wp102544&aid=5\n|quote=JSR 352, the open standard specification for Java batch processing. ...

In this case the entire batch must be completed before one has a usable result: partial results are not usable.\n\nModern batch applications make use of modern batch frameworks such as [[Jem The Bee]], [[Spring Batch]] or implementations of [[Java Specification Request|JSR]] 352<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=352|title=Batch Applications for the Java Platform|publisher=Java Community Process|accessdate=2015-08-03}}</ref> written for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and other frameworks for other programming languages, to provide the [[fault tolerance]] and [[scalability]] required for high-volume processing.  In order to ensure high-speed processing, batch applications are often integrated with [[grid computing]] solutions to [[partition of a set|partition]] a batch job over a large number of processors, although there are significant programming challenges in doing so. High volume batch processing places particularly heavy demands on system and application architectures as well.

He founded the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in 1700 about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|\"A\" mountain]]. [[Hugo Ocon\u00f3r|Hugo O'Conor]], the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, ''[[Presidio San Augustin del Tucson|Presidio San Agust\u00edn del Tucs\u00f3n]],'' on August 20, 1775 (the present downtown [[Pima County Courthouse]] was built near this site). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually the town came to be called ''Tucs\u00f3n,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area. It was included in the state of [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] after [[Mexico]] gained independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846\u20131848, Tucs\u00f3n was [[capture of Tucson (1846)|captured]] by [[Philip St. George Cooke]] with the [[Mormon Battalion]], but it soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke proceeded to the west, establishing [[Cooke's Wagon Road]] to California. Tucs\u00f3n was not included in the [[Mexican Cession]] to the United States following the war. Cooke's road through Tucs\u00f3n became one of the important routes into California during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe US acquired Arizona, south of the [[Gila River]], via treaty from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on June 8, 1854. Under this treaty and purchase, Tucs\u00f3n became a part of the United States of America. The American military did not formally take over control until March 1856. In time, the name of the town became standardized in English in its current form, where the stress is on the first syllable, the \"u\" is long, and the \"c\" is silent. \n\nIn 1857, Tucson was established as a stage station on the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]]. In 1858 it became 3rd division headquarters of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] and operated until the line was shut down in March 1861. The [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line|Overland Mail Corporation]] attempted to continue running; however, following the [[Bascom Affair]], devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches ended operations in August 1861.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nFrom August 1861 to mid-1862, Tucson served as the western capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Arizona Territory]], the eastern capital being [[Mesilla, New Mexico]]. In 1862, the [[California Column]] drove the Confederate forces out of Arizona. Tucson and all of what is now Arizona were included within the US [[New Mexico Territory]] until 1863, when they became part of the new [[Arizona Territory]].

The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).\n\nTucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64\u00a2 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.\n\nMayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E.

During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually the town came to be called ''Tucs\u00f3n,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area.

Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).\n\nTucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64\u00a2 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.\n\nMayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E.

Eventually, the INS concluded that the taxi driver was her only possible source of contagion, therefore attributing his death to the new virus in spite of the laboratory evidence stating otherwise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/salud/se-reporta-el-primer-muerto-por-coronavirus-en-colombia-473874|title=Se confirma la primera muerte en Colombia por coronavirus|publisher=El Tiempo|date=21 March 2020|language=es}}</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 21 March, about 23 prisoners were killed and 83 injured during a riot at [[La Modelo]] prison in Bogot\u00e1 which erupted amid fears over spreading of the coronavirus through prison walls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/colombia-coronavirus-23-killed-prison-riot-200323104057561.html|title=Colombia coronavirus: 23 killed in prison riot|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/americas/colombia-prison-riots/index.html|title=23 dead in prison riot in Colombia prompted by coronavirus fears, Ministry of Justice says|first=Amir |last=Vera|website=CNN|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> Prisoners across the country were protesting against overcrowding in prisons as well as poor health services ever since the outbreak of COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-51999594|title=At least 23 killed in Colombia prison unrest|date=23 March 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=23 March 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 March, the Ministry of Health confirmed the second death linked to the virus, a 70-year-old woman from [[Yumbo]] whose daughter had returned from Cuba on 2 March and reported to have had contact with two people from the United States, one of which had tested positive for coronavirus.

After the [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]] and the [[Norman conquest of England]], a [[priory]] was reestablished. A small castle was built on the island in 1550.\n\n==Name and etymology==\nThe island of Lindisfarne appears under the [[Old Welsh]] name ''Medcaut'' in the 9th century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''.{{sfn|Nennius|1848|loc=section 65}} Following up on a suggestion by Richard Coates, [[Andrew Breeze]] proposes that the name ultimately derives from Latin ''Medicata [Insula]'' ({{lang-en|Healing [Island]}}), owing perhaps to the island's reputation for medicinal herbs.{{sfn|Breeze|2008|pp=187\u20138}}\n\nBoth the'' [[Parker Chronicle]] ''and'' [[Peterborough Chronicle]]'' annals of AD 793 record the [[Old English]] name, ''Lindisfarena''.{{sfn|Freeborn|p=39}} The soubriquet ''Holy Island'' was in use by the 11th century when it appears in Latin as ''Insula Sacra''. The reference was to Saints [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] and [[Cuthbert]].{{sfn|Simpson|2009}}\n\nThe name Lindisfarne has an uncertain origin. The ''-farne'' part may be Old English ''\u2013fearena'' meaning \"traveller\".{{sfn|James|2019}} The first part, ''Lindis-'', may refer to people from the [[Kingdom of Lindsey]] in modern [[Lincolnshire]], referring to either regular visitors or settlers.{{sfn|Mills|1997|p=221}}{{sfn|Myers|1985|p=175}}{{sfn|Ekwall|1960|pp=298\u20139}} Another possibility is that ''Lindisfarne'' is [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] in origin, containing the element ''Lind-'' meaning \"stream or pool\" ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''llyn''),{{sfn|James|2019}} with the nominal morpheme ''-as(t)'' and an unknown element identical to that in the [[Farne Islands]].{{sfn|James|2019}} Further suggested is that the name may be a wholly [[Old Irish|Irish]] formation, from corresponding ''*lind-is-'', plus ''\u2013fearann'' meaning \"land, domain, territory\".{{sfn|James|2019}} Such an Irish formation, however, could have been based on a pre-existing Brittonic name.{{sfn|James|2019}}\n\nThere is also a supposition that the nearby Farne Islands are fern-like in shape and the name may have come from there.{{sfn|Simpson|2009}}\n\n==Geography and population==\n[[File:Holy Island (Overview).jpg|thumb|Holy Island (1866).]]\nThe island measures {{convert|3|miles|km}} from east to west and {{convert|1+1/2|miles|km}} from north to south, and comprises approximately {{convert|1000|acres|abbr=off}} at high tide. The nearest point of the island is about {{convert|1|mile|km|abbr=off}} from the mainland of England. The island of Lindisfarne is located along the northeast coast of England, close to the border with [[Scotland]]. It is accessible, most times, at low tide by crossing sand and mudflats which are covered with water at high tides. These sand and mud flats carry an ancient pilgrims' path, and in more recent times, a modern causeway. Lindisfarne is surrounded by the {{convert|8750|acre|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve]], which protects the island's sand dunes and the adjacent intertidal habitats. {{As of|2011|03|27|df=y}}, the island had a population of 180.{{sfn|Office for National Statistics|2013}}\n\n====Community====\nA February 2020 report provided an update on the island. At the time, three pubs and a hotel were operating; the store had closed but the post office remained in operation. No professional or medical services were available and residents were driving to [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] for groceries and other supplies. Points of interest for visitors included Lindisfarne Castle operated by the National Trust<ref>[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lindisfarne-castle  \nLindisfarne Castle Things to see and do]</ref>, the priory, the historic church, the nature reserve and the beaches.

For drivers, tide tables are prominently displayed at both ends of the causeway and also where the Holy Island road leaves the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] at [[Beal, Northumberland|Beal]]. The causeway is generally open from about three hours after high tide until two hours before the next high tide, but the period of closure may be extended during stormy weather. Tide tables giving the safe crossing periods are published by Northumberland County Council.{{sfn|Holy Island webmaster|2019}}\n\nDespite these warnings, about one vehicle each month is stranded on the causeway, requiring rescue by [[HM Coastguard]] and/or [[Seahouses]] [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]] lifeboat. A sea rescue costs approximately \u00a31,900 (quoted in 2009, {{Inflation|UK|1900|2009|r=-1|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{inflation-fn|UK|group=lower-alpha}}), while an air rescue costs more than \u00a34,000 (also quoted in 2009, {{Inflation|UK|4000|2009|r=-1|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{inflation-fn|UK|group=lower-alpha}}).{{sfn|Costello|2009}}  Local people have opposed a causeway barrier primarily on convenience grounds.{{sfn|BBC|2011}}{{sfn|Costello|2009}}\n\n==Lighthouses==\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| item = Q18431329\n| name = Guile Point Lighthouse<br>Guile Point East and West\n| image_name = Lindisfarne Lighthouses 2016-05-29.jpg\n| image_width = \n| caption = Guile Point Lighthouse\n| location = Lindisfarne<br>[[Northumberland]]<br>[[England]]\n| pushpin_map = Northumberland\n| pushpin_map_caption = Northumberland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|55.658189|-1.793194}}\n| coordinates_footnotes =\n| yearbuilt = 1859\n| yearlit  = \n| automated = yes\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = stone obelisk (east and west)\n| shape = slim square pyramid tower (east and west)\n| marking = unpainted tower\n| height = {{convert|21|m|ft}} (east)<br>{{convert|25|m|ft}} (west)\n| focalheight = {{convert|9|m|ft}} (east)\n| lens = \n| currentlens =\n| lightsource = solar power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|9|nmi}}\n| characteristic = Oc WRG 6s.

Until 1 November 1995 both were operated by [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House]] (a separate corporation, which formerly had responsibility for navigation marks along the coast from [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] to [[Whitby]]). On that day, responsibility for marking the approach to the harbour was assumed by the London-based Corporation.{{sfn|Corporation of Trinity House|2016|loc=[https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/heugh-hill-lighthouse Heugh Hill]}} \n\nHeugh Hill Light is a metal framework tower with a black triangular day mark, situated on Heugh Hill (a ridge on the south edge of Lindisfarne). Prior to its installation, a wooden beacon with a triangle topmark had stood on the centre of Heugh Hill for many decades.{{sfn|James Imray and Son|2010}}  Nearby is a former [[HM Coastguard|coastguard]] station, recently refurbished and opened to the public as a viewing platform. An adjacent ruin is known as the Lantern Chapel; its origin is unknown, but the name may indicate an earlier navigation light on this site.\n\nGuile Point East and Guile Point West are a pair of stone obelisks standing on a small tidal island on the other side of the channel. The obelisks are [[leading lights|leading marks]] which, when aligned, indicate the safe channel over the [[Shoal#Nautical navigation|bar]]. When Heugh Hill bears 310\u00b0 (in line with the church belfry) the bar is cleared and there is a clear run into the harbour.{{sfn|Fowler|1990|p=22:137}} The beacons were established in 1826 by Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House (in whose ownership they remain). Since the early 1990s, a [[sector light]] has been fixed about one-third of the way up Guile Point East.{{sfn|Corporation of Trinity House|2016|loc=[https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/guile-point-east-lighthouse Guile Point East]}}  \n\nNot a lighthouse but simply a [[daymark]] for maritime navigation, a white brick pyramid, 35 feet high and built in 1810, stands at Emmanuel Head, the north-eastern point of Lindisfarne. It is said to be Britain's earliest purpose-built daymark.{{sfn|Jones|2014}}\n\n<gallery heights=165 widths=200>\nFile:Emmanuel Head Beacon - Holy Island - geograph.org.uk - 63388.jpg|Emmanuel Head Beacon\nFile:Former coastguard station and remains of Lantern Chapel, The Heugh, Holy Island - geograph.org.uk - 409679.jpg|Former coastguard station and remains of 'Lantern Chapel'\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early===\nThe northeast coast of England was largely unsettled by Roman civilians apart from the [[River Tyne|Tyne valley]] and [[Hadrian's Wall]]. The area had been little affected during the centuries of nominal Roman occupation. The countryside had been subject to raids from both [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[Picts]] and was \"not one to attract early Germanic settlement\".{{sfn|Myers|1985|p=198}} [[Ida of Bernicia|King Ida]] (reigned from 547) started the sea-borne settlement of the coast, establishing an ''urbs regia''{{efn|''urbs regia'': \"city of the king\", a royal settlement}} at [[Bamburgh Castle|Bamburgh]] across the bay from Lindisfarne. The conquest was not straightforward, however. The ''Historia Brittonum'' recounts how, in the 6th century, [[Urien]], prince of [[Rheged]], with a coalition of North British kingdoms, besieged [[Angles]] led by [[Theodric of Bernicia]] at the island for three days and nights, until internal power struggles led to the Britons' defeat.{{sfn|Breeze|2008|p=187-8}}{{sfn|Myers|1985|p=199}}\n\n===Lindisfarne Priory===\n\nThe [[abbey|monastery]] of Lindisfarne was founded circa 634 by Irish monk [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Saint Aidan]], who had been sent from [[Iona]] off the west coast of Scotland to [[Northumbria]] at the request of [[Oswald of Northumbria|King Oswald]]. The priory was founded before the end of 634 and Aidan remained there until his death in 651.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=118}}  The priory remained the only seat of a bishopric in Northumbria for nearly thirty years.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=118}} [[Finan of Lindisfarne|Finian]] (bishop 651\u2013661) built a timber church \"suitable for a bishop's seat\".{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=119}}  St [[Bede]], however, was critical of the fact that the church was not built of stone but only of hewn oak thatched with reeds. A later bishop, Eadbert, removed the thatch and covered both walls and roof in lead.<ref>{{harvnb|Loyn|1962|p=275}} quoting {{harvnb|Bede|1896|loc=II, 16; III, 25}}</ref>  An abbot, who could be the bishop, was elected by the brethren and led the community. Bede comments on this:\n{{quote|And let no one be surprised that, though we have said above that in this island of Lindisfarne, small as it is, there is found the seat of a bishop, now we say also that it is the home of an abbot and monks; for it actually is so. For one and the same dwelling-place of the servants of God holds both; and indeed all are monks. Aidan, who was the first bishop of this place, was a monk and always lived according to monastic rule together with all his followers. Hence all the bishops of that place up to the present time exercise their episcopal functions in such a way that the abbot, who they themselves have chosen by the advice of the brethren, rules the monastery; and all the priests, deacons, singers and readers and other ecclesiastical grades, together with the bishop himself, keep the monastic rule in all things.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|c. 730}} in {{harvnb|Colgrave|1940|pp=207\u20139}} cited by {{harvnb|Blair|1977|pp=133\u20134}}</ref>}}\n\nLindisfarne became the base for Christian evangelism in the [[Northern England|North of England]] and also sent a successful mission to [[Mercia]]. Monks from the Irish community of [[Iona Abbey|Iona]] settled on the island. Northumbria's patron saint, [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]], was a monk and later [[abbot]] of the [[monastery]], and his miracles and life are recorded by the Venerable Bede. Cuthbert later became [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]]. An anonymous life of Cuthbert written at Lindisfarne is the oldest extant piece of English historical writing. From its reference to \"Aldfrith, who now reigns peacefully\" it must date to between 685 and 704.<ref>{{harvnb|Colgrave|1940|p=104}} cited by {{harvnb|Stenton|1987|p=88}}</ref>  Cuthbert was buried here, his remains later translated{{efn|That is disinterred, moved and reburied}} to [[Durham Cathedral]] (along with the relics of Saint [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne]]). [[Eadberht of Lindisfarne]], the next bishop (and saint) was buried in the place from which Cuthbert's body was [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] earlier the same year when the priory was abandoned in the late 9th century.\n[[File:Lindisfarne Priory ruins and St. Aidan statue.jpg|thumb|Modern statue of St Aidan beside the ruins of the mediaeval priory]]\nCuthbert's body was carried with the monks, eventually settling in [[Chester-le-Street]] before a final move to [[Durham, England|Durham]]. The saint's shrine was the major pilgrimage centre for much of the region until its despoliation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s commissioners in 1539 or 1540. The grave was preserved, however, and when opened in 1827 yielded a number of remarkable artefacts dating back to Lindisfarne. The inner (of three) coffins was of incised wood, the only decorated wood to survive from the period. It shows Jesus surrounded by the [[Four Evangelists]]. Within the coffin was a [[pectoral cross]] {{convert|6.4|cm}} across made of gold and mounted with garnets and intricate tracery. There was a comb made of elephant ivory, a rare and expensive item in Northern England. Also inside was an embossed silver covered travelling altar. All were contemporary with the original burial on the island. When the body was placed in the shrine in 1104 other items were removed: a paten, scissors and a chalice of gold and onyx. Most remarkable of all was a gospel (known as the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] or Stonyhurst Gospel from its association with the [[Stonyhurst College|college]]). The manuscript is in an early, probably original, binding beautifully decorated with deeply embossed leather.{{sfn|Campbell|1982|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nFollowing Finian's death, Colman became Bishop of Lindisfarne. Up to this point the Northumbrian (and latterly Mercian) churches had looked to Lindisfarne as the mother church. There were significant liturgical and theological differences with the fledgling Roman party based at [[Canterbury]]. According to Stenton: \"There is no trace of any intercourse between these bishops [the Mercians] and the see of Canterbury\".{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=120}} The [[Synod of Whitby]] in 663 changed this. Allegiance switched southwards to Canterbury and thence to [[Rome]]. Colman departed his see for Iona and Lindisfarne ceased to be of such major importance.\n\nIn 735 the northern ecclesiastical province of England was established with the archbishopric at [[York]]. There were only three bishops under York: [[Hexham]], Lindisfarne and [[Whithorn]] whereas Canterbury had the twelve envisaged by [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]].{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=109}}  The [[Diocese of York]] encompassed roughly the counties of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. Hexham covered [[County Durham]] and the southern part of [[Northumberland]] up to the [[River Coquet]] and eastwards into the [[Pennines]]. Whithorn covered most of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] region west of [[Dumfries]] itself. The remainder, [[Cumbria]], northern Northumbria, [[Lothian]] and much of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] formed the diocese of Lindisfarne.{{sfn|Blair|1977|p=145 (map)}}\n\nIn 737 Saint [[Ceolwulf of Northumbria]] abdicated as [[King of Northumbria]] and entered the Prior at Lindisfarne.  He died in 764 and was buried alongside Cuthbert.  In 830 his body was moved to Norham-upon-Tweed and later his head was translated to Durham Cathedral.{{sfn|Britannia_Staff_Article|1999}}\n\n===Lindisfarne Gospels===\n{{main|Lindisfarne Gospels}}\nAt some point in the early 8th century, the famous illuminated manuscript known as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], an illustrated [[Latin]] copy of the [[Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, was made probably at Lindisfarne and the artist was possibly [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne|Eadfrith]], who later became Bishop of Lindisfarne. It is also speculated that a team of illuminators and calligraphers (monks of [[Lindisfarne Priory]]) worked on the text however, their identities are unknown. Sometime in the second half of the 10th century a monk named Aldred added an [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]) gloss to the Latin text, producing the earliest surviving [[Old English language|Old English]] copies of the [[Gospels]]. Aldred attributed the original to Eadfrith (bishop 698\u2013721). The Gospels were written with a good hand, but it is the illustrations done in an [[insular script|insular]] style containing a fusion of Celtic, Germanic and Roman elements that are truly outstanding. According to Aldred, Eadfrith's successor \u00c6thelwald was responsible for pressing and binding it and then it was covered with a fine metal case made by a [[hermit]] called Billfrith.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=120}} The Lindisfarne Gospels now reside in the [[British Library]] in [[London]], somewhat to the annoyance of some Northumbrians.{{sfn|BBC|2008}}  In 1971 professor Suzanne Kaufman of Rockford, Illinois presented a facsimile copy of the Gospels to the clergy of the island.\n\n===Vikings===\n[[File:T.homas Girtin Lindisfarne 1798.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Ruins of Lindisfarne Priory'', by [[Thomas Girtin]], 1798.

Its shelving beaches provided a supposedly perfect landing for the shallow-draft ships of the Viking raiders who fell upon its unsuspecting and virtually unprotected monks in the summer of 793. This bloody assault on a \"place more venerable than all in Britain\" was one of the first positively recorded Viking raids on the west. Lindisfarne was supposedly a good place to attack because people in the dark ages would send their valuables to Lindisfarne, similar to a bank, for safekeeping.{{sfn|Graham-Campbell|Wilson|2001|p=21}}  Viking [[longship]]s, with their shallow drafts and good manoeuvrability under both sail and oar, allowed their crews to strike deep inland up Europe's major rivers.{{sfn|Graham-Campbell|Wilson|2001|p=22}}  The world of the Vikings consisted of a loose grouping of the [[Scandinavia]]n homelands and new overseas colonies, linked by sea routes that reached across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]], spanning even the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].{{sfn|Graham-Campbell|Wilson|2001|p=10}}}}  caused much consternation throughout the Christian west and is now often taken as the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].

These signs were followed by great famine, and a little after those, that same year on 6th ides of January, the ravaging of wretched heathen men destroyed God's church at Lindisfarne.</blockquote>\n\nThe generally accepted date for the Viking raid on Lindisfarne is in fact 8 June; [[Michael Swanton]] writes: \"''vi id Ianr'', presumably [is] an error for ''vi id Iun'' (8 June) which is the date given by the ''Annals of Lindisfarne'' (p. 505), when better sailing weather would favour coastal raids.\"{{sfn|Swanton|2000|p=57}}{{efn|This may be confusing to modern readers. The 6 refers to the number of days BEFORE the Ides, not after. The day itself was included, and so vi id was 6 days before the ides, counting the ides as 1.

See [[Roman calendar]] for full details.}}\n\n[[Alcuin]], a Northumbrian scholar in [[Charlemagne]]'s court at the time, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Never before has such terror appeared in Britain as we have now suffered from a pagan race&nbsp;... The heathens poured out the blood of saints around the altar, and trampled on the bodies of saints in the temple of God, like dung in the streets.{{sfn|Killeen|2012|p=30}}</blockquote>\n\nThe English seemed to have turned their back on the sea as they became more settled. Many monasteries were established on islands, peninsulas, river mouths and cliffs. Isolated communities were less susceptible to interference and the politics of the heartland. The amazement of the English at the raids from the sea must have been matched by the amazement of the raiders at such (to them) vulnerable, wealthy and unarmed settlements.{{sfn|Blair|1977|p=63}}\n\nThese preliminary raids, unsettling as they were, were not followed up. The main body of the raiders passed north around [[Scotland]].{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=239}}  The 9th-century invasions came not from [[Norway]], but from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] from around the entrance to the Baltic.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=239}}  The first Danish raids into England were in the [[Isle of Sheppey]], [[Kent]] during 835 and from there their influence spread north.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=243}}  During this period religious art continued to flourish on Lindisfarne, and the ''Liber Vitae'' of Durham began in the priory.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=95}}\n\nBy 866 the Danes were in [[York]] and in 873 the army was moving into Northumberland.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|pp=247\u2013251}} With the collapse of the Northumbrian kingdom the monks of Lindisfarne fled the island in 875 taking with them St Cuthbert's bones (which are now buried at the [[Durham Cathedral|cathedral]] in [[Durham, England|Durham]]).{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=332}}\n\nPrior to the 9th century Lindisfarne Priory had, in common with other such establishments, held large tracts of land which were managed directly or leased to farmers with a [[life interest]] only. Following the Danish occupation land was increasingly owned by individuals and could be bought, sold and inherited. Following the [[Battle of Corbridge]] in 914 [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair|Ragnald]] seized the land giving some to his followers [[Scula]] and [[Onlafbal]].{{sfn|Richards|1991|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nThe [[priory]] was re-established in [[Normans|Norman]] times in 1093 as a [[Benedictine]] house and continued until its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|suppression]] in 1536 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The standing remains date from this later priory, while the site of the original priory is now occupied by the parish church. The site is a grade I listed building number 1042304.{{sfnp|Historic England|1042304}} The earliest parts of the area are a scheduled ancient monument number 1011650.{{sfnp|Historic England|1011650}}\n\nIn 1462, during the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Margaret of Anjou]] made an abortive attempt to seize the Northumbrian castles. Following a storm at sea 400 troops had to seek shelter on Holy Island, where they surrendered to the [[House of York|Yorkist]]s.{{sfn|Jacob|1988|p=533}}\n\nAn early scholarly description of the [[priory]] was compiled by Dr Henry George Charles Clarke (presumed son of Admiral Sir [[Erasmus Gower]]) {{sfnp|Bates|2017|pp=314-316}} in 1838 during his term as president of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club.{{sfnp|Clarke|1834|pp=111-114}} Dr Clarke surmised that this Norman priory was unique in that the centre aisle had a vault of stone. Of the six arches, Dr Clarke stated \"as if the architect had not previously calculated the space to be occupied by his arcade. The effect here has been to produce a horse-shoe instead of a semicircular arch, from its being of the same height, but lesser span, than the others. This arch is very rare, even in Norman buildings\".\n\n===Lindisfarne Castle===\n{{main|Lindisfarne Castle}}\nLindisfarne Castle was built in 1550, around the time that Lindisfarne Priory went out of use, and stones from the priory were used as building material. It is very small by the usual standards, and was more of a fort. The castle sits on the highest point of the island, a [[whinstone]] hill called Beblowe.\n\nAfter Henry VIII suppressed the priory, his troops used the remains as a naval store. In 1542 Henry VIII ordered the Earl of Rutland to fortify the site against possible Scottish invasion. By December 1547, Ralph Cleisbye, Captain of the fort, had guns including a wheel-mounted demi-culverin, two brass sakers, a falcon, and another fixed demi-culverin.{{sfn|Starkey|1998|p=134}}  However, Beblowe Crag itself was not fortified until 1549 and Sir Richard Lee saw only a decayed platform and turf rampart there in 1565. Elizabeth I then had work carried out on the fort, strengthening it and providing gun platforms for the new developments in artillery technology. When James VI and I came to power in England, he combined the Scottish and English thrones, and the need for the castle declined. At that time the castle was still garrisoned from Berwick and protected the small Lindisfarne Harbour.\n\nDuring the [[Jacobite Rising of 1715]], [[Lancelot Errington]], one of a number of locals who supported the Jacobite cause, visited the castle. Some sources say that he asked the [[Master Gunner]], who also served as the unit's [[barber]], for a shave.{{sfn|Hutson|2006}}  Once Errington was inside, it became clear that most of the garrison were away; later that day he returned with his nephew Mark Errington, claiming that he had lost the key to his watch.{{sfn|Hutson|2006}}  They were allowed in, overpowered the three soldiers present, and claimed the castle as a landing site for the Jacobite group led by [[Thomas Forster]], Member of Parliament for the county of [[Northumberland]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|Barton|2009}}  Reinforcements did not arrive to support the Erringtons, so when a detachment of 100 men arrived from Berwick to retake the castle they were only able to hold out for one day. Fleeing, they were captured at the tollbooth at Berwick and imprisoned, but were later able to tunnel out of their gaol and escape.{{sfn|Hutson|2006}}\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Lime kilns - geograph.org.uk - 410592.jpg|thumbnail|The lime kilns by the castle]]\n\nA [[Dundee]] firm built [[lime kiln]]s on Lindisfarne in the 1860s, and [[Lime (material)|lime]] was burnt on the island until at least the end of the 19th century. The kilns are among the most complex in Northumberland. Horses carried [[limestone]], along the [[Holy Island Waggonway]], from a quarry on the north side of the island to the lime kilns, where it was burned with coal transported from Dundee on the east coast of Scotland. There are still some traces of the jetties by which the coal was imported and the lime exported close by at the foot of the crags. The remains of the [[waggonway]] between the quarries and the kilns makes for a pleasant and easy walk. At its peak over 100 men were employed. [[Crinoid]] columnals extracted from the quarried stone and threaded into necklaces or rosaries became known as [[St Cuthbert's beads]]. The large-scale quarrying in the 19th century had a devastating effect on the interesting limestone caves, but eight sea caves remain at Coves Haven.{{sfn|Scaife|2019}}\n\nWorkings on the lime kilns stopped by the start of the 20th century.{{sfn|The National Trust}}  The lime kilns on Lindisfarne are among the few being actively preserved in Northumberland.{{sfn|The National Trust}}\n\nHoly Island Golf Club was founded in 1907 but later closed in the 1960s.{{sfn|Llewellyn|Llewellyn|2012|loc=[https://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=320 Holy Island Golf Club]}}\n\n==Present day==\n\n[[File:Lindisfarne Abbey and St Marys.JPG|thumb|Lindisfarne Abbey and St Marys]]\n[[File:Lindisfarne Lobster Pots.JPG|thumb|Lindisfarne lobster pots]]\n[[File:Lindisfarne Castle from Harbour.JPG|thumb|Lindisfarne Castle from the harbour]]\n[[File:Holy Island Plays Its Part- Everyday Life on Lindisfarne, 1942 D6771.jpg|thumbnail|A Lindisfarne fisherman in 1942]]\nThe island is within an ''[[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]'' on the [[Northumberland Coast]].

The neighbouring parish church (see below) is still in use.\n\nLindisfarne also has the small [[Lindisfarne Castle]], based on a [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] fort, which was refurbished in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] style by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] for the editor of [[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]], [[Edward Hudson (magazine owner)|Edward Hudson]]. Lutyens also designed the island's [[Holy Island War Memorial|Celtic-cross war-memorial]] on the Heugh. Lutyens' upturned herring busses{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} near the foreshore provided the inspiration for Spanish architect [[Enric Miralles]]' [[Scottish Parliament Building]] in [[Edinburgh]].{{sfn|BBC|2000}}\n\nOne of the most celebrated gardeners of modern times, [[Gertrude Jekyll]] (1843\u20131932), laid out a tiny garden just north of the castle in 1911.{{sfn|The National Trust|2014}}  The [[castle]], garden and nearby [[lime kiln]]s are in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and open to visitors.{{sfn|The National Trust|2014}}\n\n[[J.

This came under the jurisdiction of the [[County Durham|County Palatine of Durham]] until the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]].\n\nLindisfarne was mainly a fishing community for many years, with farming and the production of lime also of some importance.\n\nThe Holy Island of Lindisfarne is well known for [[mead]]. In the mediaeval days when [[monk]]s inhabited the island, it was thought that if the soul was in God's keeping, the body must be fortified with Lindisfarne mead.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The monks have long vanished, and the mead's recipe remains a secret of the family which still produces it; [[Lindisfarne Mead]] is produced at St Aidan's Winery, and sold throughout the UK and elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe isle of Lindisfarne was featured on the television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of the North. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] have also featured on television among the top few Treasures of Britain. It also features in an [[ITV Tyne Tees]] programme ''Diary of an Island'' which started on 19 April 2007 and on a DVD of the same name.\n\n===St.&nbsp;Mary the Virgin===\nWhen the abbey was rebuilt by the Normans, the site was moved. The site of the original priory church was redeveloped in stone as the parish church. As such it is now the oldest building on the island still with a roof on. Remains of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] church exist as the chancel wall and arch. A Norman apse (subsequently replaced in the 13th&nbsp;century) led eastwards from the chancel. The nave was extended in the 12th&nbsp;century with a northern arcade, and in the following century with a southern arcade.\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] the church slipped into disrepair until the restoration of 1860. The church is built of coloured sandstone which has had the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] plaster removed from it. The north aisle is known as the \"fishermen's aisle\" and houses the altar of St.&nbsp;Peter. The south aisle used to hold the altar of St.&nbsp;Margaret of Scotland, but now houses the organ.{{sfn|Brother Damian SSF|2009}}\n\nThe church is a Grade&nbsp;I listed building number 1042304, listed as part of the whole priory.{{sfnp|Historic England|1042304}} The church forms most of the earliest part of the site and is a scheduled ancient monument number 1011650.{{sfnp|Historic England|1011650}}\n\nFor several years in the late 20th&nbsp;century ({{circa}}&nbsp;1980~1990), religious author and cleric [[David Adam (priest)|David Adam]] ministered to thousands of pilgrims and other visitors as rector of Holy Island.\n\n==Community Trust Fund/Holy Island Partnership==\nIn response to the perceived lack of affordable housing on the isle of Lindisfarne, in 1996 a group of islanders established a charitable foundation known as the Holy Island of Lindisfarne Community Development Trust. They built a [[visitor centre]] on the island using the profits from sales. In addition, eleven community houses were built and are rented out to community members who want to continue to live on the island. The trust is also responsible for management of the inner harbour. The Holy Island Partnership was formed in 2009 by members of the community as well as organisations and groups operating on the island.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Pilgrim's Way, Lindisfarne.JPG|thumb|Tourists crossing Pilgrim's Way]]\n\nTourism grew steadily throughout the 20th century, and the isle of Lindisfarne is now a popular destination for visitors. Those tourists staying on the island while it is cut off by the tide experience the island in a much quieter state, as most day trippers leave before the tide rises. At low tide it is possible to walk across the sands following an ancient route known as the Pilgrims' Way (see the [[Lindisfarne#Causeway safety|note about safety]], above). This route is marked with posts and has refuge boxes for stranded walkers, just as the road has a refuge box for those who have left their crossing too late. The isle of Lindisfarne is surrounded by the {{convert|8750|acre|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve]] which attracts bird-watchers to the [[tidal island]]. The island's prominent position and varied habitat make it particularly attractive to tired avian migrants, and {{as of|2016|lc=y}} 330 bird species had been recorded on the

Island'''{{sfn|Ordnance Survey|2019}} or '''Lindisfarne'''{{sfn|Britannia Staff Article}} is a [[tidal island]] off the northeast coast of England, which constitutes the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of Holy Island in [[Northumberland]].{{sfn|Northumberland County Council|2013}} Holy Island has a recorded history from the 6th century AD; it was an important centre of [[Celtic Christianity]] under [[Saint]]s [[Aidan of Lindisfarne]], [[Cuthbert]], [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne]] and [[Eadberht of Lindisfarne]]. After the [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]] and the [[Norman conquest of England]], a [[priory]] was reestablished. A small castle was built on the island in 1550.\n\n==Name and etymology==\nThe island of Lindisfarne appears under the [[Old Welsh]] name ''Medcaut'' in the 9th century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''.{{sfn|Nennius|1848|loc=section 65}} Following up on a suggestion by Richard Coates, [[Andrew Breeze]] proposes that the name ultimately derives from Latin ''Medicata [Insula]'' ({{lang-en|Healing [Island]}}), owing perhaps to the island's reputation for medicinal herbs.{{sfn|Breeze|2008|pp=187\u20138}}\n\nBoth the'' [[Parker Chronicle]] ''and'' [[Peterborough Chronicle]]'' annals of AD 793 record the [[Old English]] name, ''Lindisfarena''.{{sfn|Freeborn|p=39}} The soubriquet ''Holy Island'' was in use by the 11th century when it appears in Latin as ''Insula Sacra''. The reference was to Saints [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] and [[Cuthbert]].{{sfn|Simpson|2009}}\n\nThe name Lindisfarne has an uncertain origin. The ''-farne'' part may be Old English ''\u2013fearena'' meaning \"traveller\".{{sfn|James|2019}} The first part, ''Lindis-'', may refer to people from the [[Kingdom of Lindsey]] in modern [[Lincolnshire]], referring to either regular visitors or settlers.{{sfn|Mills|1997|p=221}}{{sfn|Myers|1985|p=175}}{{sfn|Ekwall|1960|pp=298\u20139}} Another possibility is that ''Lindisfarne'' is [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] in origin, containing the element ''Lind-'' meaning \"stream or pool\" ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''llyn''),{{sfn|James|2019}} with the nominal morpheme ''-as(t)'' and an unknown element identical to that in the [[Farne Islands]].{{sfn|James|2019}} Further suggested is that the name may be a wholly [[Old Irish|Irish]] formation, from corresponding ''*lind-is-'', plus ''\u2013fearann'' meaning \"land, domain, territory\".{{sfn|James|2019}} Such an Irish formation, however, could have been based on a pre-existing Brittonic name.{{sfn|James|2019}}\n\nThere is also a supposition that the nearby Farne Islands are fern-like in shape and the name may have come from there.{{sfn|Simpson|2009}}\n\n==Geography and population==\n[[File:Holy Island (Overview).jpg|thumb|Holy Island (1866).]]\nThe island measures {{convert|3|miles|km}} from east to west and {{convert|1+1/2|miles|km}} from north to south, and comprises approximately {{convert|1000|acres|abbr=off}} at high tide. The nearest point of the island is about {{convert|1|mile|km|abbr=off}} from the mainland of England. The island of Lindisfarne is located along the northeast coast of England, close to the border with [[Scotland]]. It is accessible, most times, at low tide by crossing sand and mudflats which are covered with water at high tides. These sand and mud flats carry an ancient pilgrims' path, and in more recent times, a modern causeway. Lindisfarne is surrounded by the {{convert|8750|acre|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve]], which protects the island's sand dunes and the adjacent intertidal habitats. {{As of|2011|03|27|df=y}}, the island had a population of 180.{{sfn|Office for National Statistics|2013}}\n\n====Community====\nA February 2020 report provided an update on the island. At the time, three pubs and a hotel were operating; the store had closed but the post office remained in operation. No professional or medical services were available and residents were driving to [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] for groceries and other supplies. Points of interest for visitors included Lindisfarne Castle operated by the National Trust<ref>[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lindisfarne-castle  \nLindisfarne Castle Things to see and do]</ref>, the priory, the historic church, the nature reserve and the beaches. At certain times of year, numerous migratory birds can be seen.<ref>[https://www.countrylife.co.uk/property/how-to-buy-a-home-on-one-of-britains-picturesque-tidal-islands-from-jersey-to-northumberland-211669 How to buy a home on one of Britain\u2019s picturesque tidal islands, from Jersey to Northumberland</ref><ref>[https://www.britainexpress.com/counties/northumbria/castles/lindisfarne-castle.htm Lindisfarne Castle History, tourist information, and nearby accommodation]</ref>\n\n===Causeway safety===\n[[File:Come Back Later^ - geograph.org.uk - 16072.jpg|thumb|The causeway flooding with a refuge box in the distance]]\n\nWarning signs urge visitors walking to the island to keep to the marked path, to check tide times and weather carefully, and to seek local advice if in doubt. For drivers, tide tables are prominently displayed at both ends of the causeway and also where the Holy Island road leaves the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] at [[Beal, Northumberland|Beal]]. The causeway is generally open from about three hours after high tide until two hours before the next high tide, but the period of closure may be extended during stormy weather.

The area had been little affected during the centuries of nominal Roman occupation. The countryside had been subject to raids from both [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[Picts]] and was \"not one to attract early Germanic settlement\".{{sfn|Myers|1985|p=198}} [[Ida of Bernicia|King Ida]] (reigned from 547) started the sea-borne settlement of the coast, establishing an ''urbs regia''{{efn|''urbs regia'': \"city of the king\", a royal settlement}} at [[Bamburgh Castle|Bamburgh]] across the bay from Lindisfarne. The conquest was not straightforward, however. The ''Historia Brittonum'' recounts how, in the 6th century, [[Urien]], prince of [[Rheged]], with a coalition of North British kingdoms, besieged [[Angles]] led by [[Theodric of Bernicia]] at the island for three days and nights, until internal power struggles led to the Britons' defeat.{{sfn|Breeze|2008|p=187-8}}{{sfn|Myers|1985|p=199}}\n\n===Lindisfarne Priory===\n\nThe [[abbey|monastery]] of Lindisfarne was founded circa 634 by Irish monk [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Saint Aidan]], who had been sent from [[Iona]] off the west coast of Scotland to [[Northumbria]] at the request of [[Oswald of Northumbria|King Oswald]]. The priory was founded before the end of 634 and Aidan remained there until his death in 651.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=118}}  The priory remained the only seat of a bishopric in Northumbria for nearly thirty years.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=118}} [[Finan of Lindisfarne|Finian]] (bishop 651\u2013661) built a timber church \"suitable for a bishop's seat\".{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=119}}  St [[Bede]], however, was critical of the fact that the church was not built of stone but only of hewn oak thatched with reeds. A later bishop, Eadbert, removed the thatch and covered both walls and roof in lead.<ref>{{harvnb|Loyn|1962|p=275}} quoting {{harvnb|Bede|1896|loc=II, 16; III, 25}}</ref>  An abbot, who could be the bishop, was elected by the brethren and led the community. Bede comments on this:\n{{quote|And let no one be surprised that, though we have said above that in this island of Lindisfarne, small as it is, there is found the seat of a bishop, now we say also that it is the home of an abbot and monks; for it actually is so. For one and the same dwelling-place of the servants of God holds both; and indeed all are monks. Aidan, who was the first bishop of this place, was a monk and always lived according to monastic rule together with all his followers. Hence all the bishops of that place up to the present time exercise their episcopal functions in such a way that the abbot, who they themselves have chosen by the advice of the brethren, rules the monastery; and all the priests, deacons, singers and readers and other ecclesiastical grades, together with the bishop himself, keep the monastic rule in all things.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|c. 730}} in {{harvnb|Colgrave|1940|pp=207\u20139}} cited by {{harvnb|Blair|1977|pp=133\u20134}}</ref>}}\n\nLindisfarne became the base for Christian evangelism in the [[Northern England|North of England]] and also sent a successful mission to [[Mercia]]. Monks from the Irish community of [[Iona Abbey|Iona]] settled on the island. Northumbria's patron saint, [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]], was a monk and later [[abbot]] of the [[monastery]], and his miracles and life are recorded by the Venerable Bede. Cuthbert later became [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]]. An anonymous life of Cuthbert written at Lindisfarne is the oldest extant piece of English historical writing. From its reference to \"Aldfrith, who now reigns peacefully\" it must date to between 685 and 704.<ref>{{harvnb|Colgrave|1940|p=104}} cited by {{harvnb|Stenton|1987|p=88}}</ref>  Cuthbert was buried here, his remains later translated{{efn|That is disinterred, moved and reburied}} to [[Durham Cathedral]] (along with the relics of Saint [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne]]).

The saint's shrine was the major pilgrimage centre for much of the region until its despoliation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s commissioners in 1539 or 1540. The grave was preserved, however, and when opened in 1827 yielded a number of remarkable artefacts dating back to Lindisfarne. The inner (of three) coffins was of incised wood, the only decorated wood to survive from the period. It shows Jesus surrounded by the [[Four Evangelists]]. Within the coffin was a [[pectoral cross]] {{convert|6.4|cm}} across made of gold and mounted with garnets and intricate tracery. There was a comb made of elephant ivory, a rare and expensive item in Northern England. Also inside was an embossed silver covered travelling altar. All were contemporary with the original burial on the island. When the body was placed in the shrine in 1104 other items were removed: a paten, scissors and a chalice of gold and onyx. Most remarkable of all was a gospel (known as the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] or Stonyhurst Gospel from its association with the [[Stonyhurst College|college]]). The manuscript is in an early, probably original, binding beautifully decorated with deeply embossed leather.{{sfn|Campbell|1982|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nFollowing Finian's death, Colman became Bishop of Lindisfarne. Up to this point the Northumbrian (and latterly Mercian) churches had looked to Lindisfarne as the mother church. There were significant liturgical and theological differences with the fledgling Roman party based at [[Canterbury]]. According to Stenton: \"There is no trace of any intercourse between these bishops [the Mercians] and the see of Canterbury\".{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=120}} The [[Synod of Whitby]] in 663 changed this. Allegiance switched southwards to Canterbury and thence to [[Rome]]. Colman departed his see for Iona and Lindisfarne ceased to be of such major importance.\n\nIn 735 the northern ecclesiastical province of England was established with the archbishopric at [[York]]. There were only three bishops under York: [[Hexham]], Lindisfarne and [[Whithorn]] whereas Canterbury had the twelve envisaged by [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]].{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=109}}  The [[Diocese of York]] encompassed roughly the counties of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. Hexham covered [[County Durham]] and the southern part of [[Northumberland]] up to the [[River Coquet]] and eastwards into the [[Pennines]]. Whithorn covered most of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] region west of [[Dumfries]] itself. The remainder, [[Cumbria]], northern Northumbria, [[Lothian]] and much of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] formed the diocese of Lindisfarne.{{sfn|Blair|1977|p=145 (map)}}\n\nIn 737 Saint [[Ceolwulf of Northumbria]] abdicated as [[King of Northumbria]] and entered the Prior at Lindisfarne.  He died in 764 and was buried alongside Cuthbert.  In 830 his body was moved to Norham-upon-Tweed and later his head was translated to Durham Cathedral.{{sfn|Britannia_Staff_Article|1999}}\n\n===Lindisfarne Gospels===\n{{main|Lindisfarne Gospels}}\nAt some point in the early 8th century, the famous illuminated manuscript known as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], an illustrated [[Latin]] copy of the [[Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, was made probably at Lindisfarne and the artist was possibly [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne|Eadfrith]], who later became Bishop of Lindisfarne. It is also speculated that a team of illuminators and calligraphers (monks of [[Lindisfarne Priory]]) worked on the text however, their identities are unknown. Sometime in the second half of the 10th century a monk named Aldred added an [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]) gloss to the Latin text, producing the earliest surviving [[Old English language|Old English]] copies of the [[Gospels]]. Aldred attributed the original to Eadfrith (bishop 698\u2013721). The Gospels were written with a good hand, but it is the illustrations done in an [[insular script|insular]] style containing a fusion of Celtic, Germanic and Roman elements that are truly outstanding. According to Aldred, Eadfrith's successor \u00c6thelwald was responsible for pressing and binding it and then it was covered with a fine metal case made by a [[hermit]] called Billfrith.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=120}} The Lindisfarne Gospels now reside in the [[British Library]] in [[London]], somewhat to the annoyance of some Northumbrians.{{sfn|BBC|2008}}  In 1971 professor Suzanne Kaufman of Rockford, Illinois presented a facsimile copy of the Gospels to the clergy of the island.\n\n===Vikings===\n[[File:T.homas Girtin Lindisfarne 1798.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Ruins of Lindisfarne Priory'', by [[Thomas Girtin]], 1798.

This bloody assault on a \"place more venerable than all in Britain\" was one of the first positively recorded Viking raids on the west. Lindisfarne was supposedly a good place to attack because people in the dark ages would send their valuables to Lindisfarne, similar to a bank, for safekeeping.{{sfn|Graham-Campbell|Wilson|2001|p=21}}  Viking [[longship]]s, with their shallow drafts and good manoeuvrability under both sail and oar, allowed their crews to strike deep inland up Europe's major rivers.{{sfn|Graham-Campbell|Wilson|2001|p=22}}  The world of the Vikings consisted of a loose grouping of the [[Scandinavia]]n homelands and new overseas colonies, linked by sea routes that reached across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]], spanning even the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].{{sfn|Graham-Campbell|Wilson|2001|p=10}}}}  caused much consternation throughout the Christian west and is now often taken as the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].

Many monasteries were established on islands, peninsulas, river mouths and cliffs. Isolated communities were less susceptible to interference and the politics of the heartland. The amazement of the English at the raids from the sea must have been matched by the amazement of the raiders at such (to them) vulnerable, wealthy and unarmed settlements.{{sfn|Blair|1977|p=63}}\n\nThese preliminary raids, unsettling as they were, were not followed up. The main body of the raiders passed north around [[Scotland]].{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=239}}  The 9th-century invasions came not from [[Norway]], but from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] from around the entrance to the Baltic.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=239}}  The first Danish raids into England were in the [[Isle of Sheppey]], [[Kent]] during 835 and from there their influence spread north.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=243}}  During this period religious art continued to flourish on Lindisfarne, and the ''Liber Vitae'' of Durham began in the priory.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=95}}\n\nBy 866 the Danes were in [[York]] and in 873 the army was moving into Northumberland.{{sfn|Stenton|1987|pp=247\u2013251}} With the collapse of the Northumbrian kingdom the monks of Lindisfarne fled the island in 875 taking with them St Cuthbert's bones (which are now buried at the [[Durham Cathedral|cathedral]] in [[Durham, England|Durham]]).{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=332}}\n\nPrior to the 9th century Lindisfarne Priory had, in common with other such establishments, held large tracts of land which were managed directly or leased to farmers with a [[life interest]] only. Following the Danish occupation land was increasingly owned by individuals and could be bought, sold and inherited. Following the [[Battle of Corbridge]] in 914 [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair|Ragnald]] seized the land giving some to his followers [[Scula]] and [[Onlafbal]].{{sfn|Richards|1991|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nThe [[priory]] was re-established in [[Normans|Norman]] times in 1093 as a [[Benedictine]] house and continued until its [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|suppression]] in 1536 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

Of the six arches, Dr Clarke stated \"as if the architect had not previously calculated the space to be occupied by his arcade. The effect here has been to produce a horse-shoe instead of a semicircular arch, from its being of the same height, but lesser span, than the others. This arch is very rare, even in Norman buildings\".\n\n===Lindisfarne Castle===\n{{main|Lindisfarne Castle}}\nLindisfarne Castle was built in 1550, around the time that Lindisfarne Priory went out of use, and stones from the priory were used as building material. It is very small by the usual standards, and was more of a fort. The castle sits on the highest point of the island, a [[whinstone]] hill called Beblowe.\n\nAfter Henry VIII suppressed the priory, his troops used the remains as a naval store. In 1542 Henry VIII ordered the Earl of Rutland to fortify the site against possible Scottish invasion. By December 1547, Ralph Cleisbye, Captain of the fort, had guns including a wheel-mounted demi-culverin, two brass sakers, a falcon, and another fixed demi-culverin.{{sfn|Starkey|1998|p=134}}  However, Beblowe Crag itself was not fortified until 1549 and Sir Richard Lee saw only a decayed platform and turf rampart there in 1565. Elizabeth I then had work carried out on the fort, strengthening it and providing gun platforms for the new developments in artillery technology. When James VI and I came to power in England, he combined the Scottish and English thrones, and the need for the castle declined. At that time the castle was still garrisoned from Berwick and protected the small Lindisfarne Harbour.\n\nDuring the [[Jacobite Rising of 1715]], [[Lancelot Errington]], one of a number of locals who supported the Jacobite cause, visited the castle. Some sources say that he asked the [[Master Gunner]], who also served as the unit's [[barber]], for a shave.{{sfn|Hutson|2006}}  Once Errington was inside, it became clear that most of the garrison were away; later that day he returned with his nephew Mark Errington, claiming that he had lost the key to his watch.{{sfn|Hutson|2006}}  They were allowed in, overpowered the three soldiers present, and claimed the castle as a landing site for the Jacobite group led by [[Thomas Forster]], Member of Parliament for the county of [[Northumberland]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|Barton|2009}}  Reinforcements did not arrive to support the Erringtons, so when a detachment of 100 men arrived from Berwick to retake the castle they were only able to hold out for one day. Fleeing, they were captured at the tollbooth at Berwick and imprisoned, but were later able to tunnel out of their gaol and escape.{{sfn|Hutson|2006}}\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Lime kilns - geograph.org.uk - 410592.jpg|thumbnail|The lime kilns by the castle]]\n\nA [[Dundee]] firm built [[lime kiln]]s on Lindisfarne in the 1860s, and [[Lime (material)|lime]] was burnt on the island until at least the end of the 19th century. The kilns are among the most complex in Northumberland. Horses carried [[limestone]], along the [[Holy Island Waggonway]], from a quarry on the north side of the island to the lime kilns, where it was burned with coal transported from Dundee on the east coast of Scotland. There are still some traces of the jetties by which the coal was imported and the lime exported close by at the foot of the crags. The remains of the [[waggonway]] between the quarries and the kilns makes for a pleasant and easy walk. At its peak over 100 men were employed. [[Crinoid]] columnals extracted from the quarried stone and threaded into necklaces or rosaries became known as [[St Cuthbert's beads]].

Turner|Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin]] and [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] all painted on Holy Island.\n\nHoly Island was considered part of the [[Islandshire]] unit along with several mainland parishes. This came under the jurisdiction of the [[County Durham|County Palatine of Durham]] until the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]].\n\nLindisfarne was mainly a fishing community for many years, with farming and the production of lime also of some importance.\n\nThe Holy Island of Lindisfarne is well known for [[mead]]. In the mediaeval days when [[monk]]s inhabited the island, it was thought that if the soul was in God's keeping, the body must be fortified with Lindisfarne mead.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The monks have long vanished, and the mead's recipe remains a secret of the family which still produces it; [[Lindisfarne Mead]] is produced at St Aidan's Winery, and sold throughout the UK and elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe isle of Lindisfarne was featured on the television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of the North. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] have also featured on television among the top few Treasures of Britain. It also features in an [[ITV Tyne Tees]] programme ''Diary of an Island'' which started on 19 April 2007 and on a DVD of the same name.\n\n===St.&nbsp;Mary the Virgin===\nWhen the abbey was rebuilt by the Normans, the site was moved. The site of the original priory church was redeveloped in stone as the parish church. As such it is now the oldest building on the island still with a roof on. Remains of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] church exist as the chancel wall and arch. A Norman apse (subsequently replaced in the 13th&nbsp;century) led eastwards from the chancel. The nave was extended in the 12th&nbsp;century with a northern arcade, and in the following century with a southern arcade.\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] the church slipped into disrepair until the restoration of 1860. The church is built of coloured sandstone which has had the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] plaster removed from it. The north aisle is known as the \"fishermen's aisle\" and houses the altar of St.&nbsp;Peter. The south aisle used to hold the altar of St.&nbsp;Margaret of Scotland, but now houses the organ.{{sfn|Brother Damian SSF|2009}}\n\nThe church is a Grade&nbsp;I listed building number 1042304, listed as part of the whole priory.{{sfnp|Historic England|1042304}} The church forms most of the earliest part of the site and is a scheduled ancient monument number 1011650.{{sfnp|Historic England|1011650}}\n\nFor several years in the late 20th&nbsp;century ({{circa}}&nbsp;1980~1990), religious author and cleric [[David Adam (priest)|David Adam]] ministered to thousands of pilgrims and other visitors as rector of Holy Island.\n\n==Community Trust Fund/Holy Island Partnership==\nIn response to the perceived lack of affordable housing on the isle of Lindisfarne, in 1996 a group of islanders established a charitable foundation known as the Holy Island of Lindisfarne Community Development Trust. They built a [[visitor centre]] on the island using the profits from sales. In addition, eleven community houses were built and are rented out to community members who want to continue to live on the island. The trust is also responsible for management of the inner harbour. The Holy Island Partnership was formed in 2009 by members of the community as well as organisations and groups operating on the island.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Pilgrim's Way, Lindisfarne.JPG|thumb|Tourists crossing Pilgrim's Way]]\n\nTourism grew steadily throughout the 20th century, and the isle of Lindisfarne is now a popular destination for visitors. Those tourists staying on the island while it is cut off by the tide experience the island in a much quieter state, as most day trippers leave before the tide rises. At low tide it is possible to walk across the sands following an ancient route known as the Pilgrims' Way (see the [[Lindisfarne#Causeway safety|note about safety]], above). This route is marked with posts and has refuge boxes for stranded walkers, just as the road has a refuge box for those who have left their crossing too late. The isle of Lindisfarne is surrounded by the {{convert|8750|acre|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve]] which attracts bird-watchers to the [[tidal island]]. The island's prominent position and varied habitat make it particularly attractive to tired avian migrants, and {{as of|2016|lc=y}} 330 bird species had been recorded on the island.{{sfn|Kerr|2016}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n  | last = Aslet\n  | first =
