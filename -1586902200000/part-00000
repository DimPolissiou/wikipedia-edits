The Children's Commissioner was established under the [[Children Act 2004]] to \"represent the views and interests of children\", and the office was further strengthened by the [[Children and Families Act 2014]] providing a legal mandate to promote and protect the rights of children. The Children's Commissioner also has a duty to speak on behalf of all children in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[Reserved and excepted matters|non-devolved issues]], which include [[immigration]], and [[Youth justice in England and Wales|youth justice]] in Wales.\n\nAs of 05 May 2018, the Children's Commissioner was [[Anne Longfield]].\n\n== History ==\nThe post of Children's Commissioner for England was established by the [[Children Act 2004]] with the intended purpose of becoming the independent voice of children and young people, thereby championing their interests and bringing their concerns to the national arena.

Other tributaries include Little Petherick Creek which joins the main estuary through the Iron Bridge on the Camel Trail, the River Amble which joins the Camel though a tidal barrage near Burniere Point, and the Polmorla Brook (historically Treguddick Brook) which joins the Camel immediately above the bridge at Wadebridge.\n\nIn terms of its name there is evidence that what is now known as the River Camel has had several names in the past. The name Camel is derived from Middle Cornish \"Cam-El\", \"Crooked one\", and seems originally to have referred only to the upper parts.<ref name=\"cpnl\">{{cite book  | last = Weatherhill  | first = Craig  | title = Cornish Place Names and Language  | publisher = Sigma Leisure  | year = 1995  | location =  | pages =  | id =  | isbn = 1-85058-462-1}}</ref>\nThe lower part of the river was referred to as the River Allen, a common Celtic river name of unknown derivation, however in the 19th Century the name Allen was transferred to the River Layne which flows into the Camel just above Egloshayle. The Camel estuary appears to have been called the River Hayle from Middle Cornish \"Hayle\", ''estuary''<ref name=\"cpnl\" /> and while this may have been as much a description as a proper name, the continued use of the name Hayle Bay for the bay containing [[Polzeath]] beach supports this. In turn it has been suggested that the River Layne may have previously been called the River Dewi given the number of places along its course which contain the element.<ref name=\"cpnl\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{Commons category|River Camel}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060317155811/http://www.btinternet.com/~lawson/camelbirds/camelbirdlife.html Birdlife on the River Camel]\n* [http://www.cbwps.org.uk/index.html Cornwall Birdwatching & Preservation Society]\n* [http://www.swuklink.com/BAAAGBHC.php River Camel page at swuklink.com]\n* [http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5787 Saints' Way page on Cornwall County Council website]\n* [http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/ South West Coast Path website]\n* [https://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/camel-trail The Camel Trail on Sustrans website]\n* [https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/cameltrail The Camel Trail on Cornwall County Council website]\n\n{{Cornwall}}\n{{SSSIs Cornwall biological}}\n{{SSSIs Cornwall geological}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Camel, River}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Special Areas of Conservation in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Cornish Killas]]\n[[Category:Camel catchment| ]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Camel"}
