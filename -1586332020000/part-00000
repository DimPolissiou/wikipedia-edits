In early colonial [[New Zealand]], as in European societies, women were excluded from any involvement in politics. Public opinion began to change in the latter half of the nineteenth century, however, and after years of effort by [[women's suffrage]] campaigners, led by [[Kate Sheppard]], New Zealand became the first nation in the world in which all women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections.<ref name=NZH1/>\n\nThe Electoral Bill granting women the franchise was given Royal Assent by Governor [[David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow|Lord Glasgow]] on 19 September 1893. Women voted for the first time in the [[1893 New Zealand general election|election held on 28 November 1893]] (elections for the [[M\u0101ori electorates]] were held on 20 December). Also in 1893, [[Elizabeth Yates (mayor)|Elizabeth Yates]] became Mayor of [[Onehunga]], the first time such a post had been held by a woman anywhere in the [[British Empire]].<ref name=\"DNZB Yates\"/>\n\nIn the 21st century there are more eligible female voters than male, and women also vote at a higher rate than men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.stats.govt.nz/tools_and_services/media-centre/media-releases-2016/suffrage-day-2016.aspx|title=Voting-age women outnumber men|website=archive.stats.govt.nz|language=en-nz|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> However, a higher percentage of female than male non-voters perceive a barrier that prevents them from voting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/voting-and-political-participation|title=Voting and political participation {{!}} Stats NZ|website=www.stats.govt.nz|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>\n\n== Early campaign ==\nIn [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] society and European aristocracy women could achieve significant formal political rank through ancestry.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = The Journal of Pacific History|volume = 22|issue = 3|pages = 139\u2013172|language=en|jstor = 25168930|last1 = Gunson|first1 = Niel|title = Sacred women chiefs and female 'headmen' in Polynesian history|year = 1987|doi = 10.1080/00223348708572563}}</ref> However, Polynesian and by extension [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] society differed in letting charismatic women have significant direct influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/maori-social-structure/page-2|title=TRADITIONAL SOCIAL STRUCTURE|last=McLintock|first=Alexander Hare|last2=R.F|website=An encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A.

Therefore the suffrage campaigns were intertwined with the [[Prohibition|prohibition of alcohol]] movement. This was the focus of some resistance, with the movement being often portrayed as puritanical and draconian in the local press. This also led to politicians who supported the alcohol industry opposing women's suffrage, like the MP for South Dunedin [[Henry Fish]].<ref>''Women\u2019s Suffrage'', [[Archives New Zealand]] Info Sheet 4, March 2011</ref>\n\nIn 1869 under a pseudonym, [[Mary Ann M\u00fcller]] wrote ''An appeal to the men of New Zealand'', the first pamphlet on the issue of women's suffrage to be published in New Zealand.<ref name=\"dnzb2\">[https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1m59/muller-mary-anne \"M\u00fcller, Mary Ann\"], ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]''</ref> In the 1870's [[Mary Ann Colclough]] (Polly Plum) was an active advocate for women's rights in general and women's suffrage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/mary-ann-colclough-polly-plum|title=Mary Ann Colclough \u2013 Polly Plum {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> [[John Richardson (New Zealand politician)|John Larkins Cheese Richardson]] was a keen proponent of women's equality, he was responsible for allowing women to enroll at the [[University of Otago]] in 1871, and helped to remove other barriers to their entry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1r8/richardson-john-larkins-cheese|title=Richardson, John Larkins Cheese|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> Some politicians, including [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]], [[Robert Stout]], [[Julius Vogel]], [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]] and [[John Ballance]], also supported women\u2019s suffrage and in 1878, 1879 and 1887 bills extending the vote to women were narrowly defeated in Parliament.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Successful campaign ==\n[[Women's suffrage]] was granted after about two decades of campaigning throughout New Zealand, by women including [[Kate Sheppard]] and [[Mary Ann M\u00fcller]]. The New Zealand branch of the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) led by [[Anne Ward (suffragist)|Anne Ward]] was particularly instrumental in the campaign. Influenced by the American branch of the Women's Christian Temperance Movement and the philosophy of thinkers like [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], the movement argued that women could bring morality into democratic politics.<ref name=\"briefhistory\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/brief-history| title=Brief History of Women's Suffrage| publisher=NZ History}}</ref> Opponents argued instead that politics was outside women's 'natural sphere' of the home and family. Suffrage advocates countered that allowing women to vote would encourage policies which protected and nurtured families.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWCTU campaigners and suffragettes organised and delivered a series of petitions to Parliament: over 9,000 signatures were delivered in 1891, followed by a petition of almost 20,000 signatures in 1892, and finally in 1893 nearly 32,000 signatures were presented \u2013 almost a quarter of the adult European female population of New Zealand.<ref name=\"briefhistory\" />\n\nFrom 1887, various attempts were made to pass bills enabling female suffrage, the first of which was authored by [[Julius Vogel]], the 8th Premier of New Zealand. Each bill came close to passing. Several electoral bills that would have given adult women the right to vote were passed in the House of Representatives but defeated in the upper Legislative Council.{{citation needed|date = September 2016}}\n\nIn 1891 [[Walter Carncross]] moved an amendment that was intended to make a new bill fail in the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. His amendment was for women to become eligible to be voted into the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and in this way Carncross ensured that the conservative Upper House would reject the bill.

The [[1893 Women's Suffrage Petition]] was presented to Parliament and a new Electoral Bill passed through the [[Lower House]] with a large majority. During debate, there was majority support for the enfranchisement of M\u0101ori as well as P\u0101keh\u0101 women; the inclusion of M\u0101ori women was championed by [[John Shera]], who was married to a woman of M\u0101ori and European descent.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Binney |editor1-first=Judith |editor1-link=Judith Binney |title=The Shaping of History: Essays from the New Zealand Journal of History |date=1968 |publisher=Bridget Williams Books |page=xiii }}</ref> Lobbyists for the liquor industry, concerned that women would force the prohibition of alcohol, petitioned the Upper House to reject the bill. Suffragists responded with mass rallies and telegrams to Members of Parliament. They gave their supporters in Parliament white camellias to wear in their buttonholes. The Upper House was divided on the issue, and [[Premier of New Zealand|Premier]] [[Richard Seddon]] hoped to stop the bill.<ref name=Grimshaw70_92>Grimshaw, pp 70\u201371, 92.</ref>\n\nSeddon needed one more vote to defeat the measure in the Upper House. A new [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] councillor, [[Thomas Kelly (New Zealand politician)|Thomas Kelly]], had decided to vote in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon's manipulation incensed two other councillors [[William Hunter Reynolds]] and [[Edward Cephas John Stevens]], so they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 on 8 September 1893. The two opposition councillors had been opposed to women's suffrage without the 'electoral rights' safeguard of postal voting, seen as necessary to allow all women in isolated rural areas to vote, although seen by the Liberals as rendering the vote open to manipulation by husbands or employers.<ref name=Grimshaw70_92/>\n\n[[File:Codlin's the friend.jpg|thumb|225px|An 1893 cartoon depicting [[William Rolleston]] urging women to vote for the Conservative Party to whom they \"owe the franchise\".]]\n\nEighteen legislative councillors petitioned the new governor, Lord Glasgow, to withhold his consent in enacting the law, but on 19 September 1893 the governor consented and the Electoral Act 1893 gave all women in New Zealand the right to vote.<ref name=NZH1>{{cite web| series = Women's Suffrage |title=Women and the vote: Introduction | url = https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage |date=nd|access-date=13 February 2018 | publisher = New Zealand [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] | work = New Zealand History |location= Wellington, New Zealand}}</ref>\n\nBoth the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] and the opposition subsequently claimed credit for the enfranchisement of women and sought women's newly acquired votes on these grounds.<ref>Atkinson, Neill (2003).

By 1957, Tailfeathers\u2019 work with elders and more experienced artists led him to ensure that his artwork was historically accurate. He wanted to make sure that his depictions of the events and traditions of the Blood People of Alberta weren\u2019t misleading or inaccurate. It was also in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s that his work started to attract attention from a greater audience as the \u201cCowboy and Indian\u201d theme grew popular amongst the media, books, and movies. One of Tailfeathers\u2019 biggest accomplishments was having his art displayed on the cover of [[Western Horseman|Western Horsemen]] in December 1958. This was the first time a Canadian artist\u2019s work had ever touched the cover of this magazine.\n\nEarly in his career, Tailfeathers was directed to anglicize his name so he signed his work \u201cGerald T. Fethers\u201d until 1963, when he started signing his own name again.\n\nTailfeathers went international as he commissioned to paint for the Canada Pavilion at Expo \u201867 in Montreal. This was the first time that the Indigenous people took control of their own representations at a major international venue. He would later find himself displaying his art all over the world including San Francisco, Charlottetown, Ann Arbor, and Calgary.\n\nAlong with a career full of drawings, paintings, watercolours, and sculptures, Tailfeathers illustrated a children\u2019s book called \u201cThe White Calf\u201d (by Cliff Faulknor) in 1965.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Faulknor|first=Cliff|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/white-calf/oclc/441378780&referer=brief_results|title=White calf|last2=Tailfeathers|first2=Gerald|date=1993|publisher=Scholastic-Tab Publications|isbn=978-1-55056-244-6|location=Richmond Hill (Ont.)|language=English|oclc=441378780}}</ref>\n\nTailfeathers was elected Councillor for the Kainai First Nation but chose to serve only one term.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Voyageur|first=Dr Cora J.|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oV10DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=art+expo+67+gerald+tailfeathers&source=bl&ots=0iCeB0D89-&sig=ACfU3U1lWUT_iK9VKCigv2UicBCeQu8MuA&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=art%20expo%2067%20gerald%20tailfeathers&f=false|title=My Heroes Have Always Been Indians: A Century of Great Indigenous Albertans|date=2018-11-14|publisher=Brush Education|isbn=978-1-55059-754-7|language=en}}</ref> He made this decision because the responsibilities took away from his art production, so he opted out of the second term.

Later that year, he married Irene Goodstriker.

Although he has a wide arsenal of skills, most of his artwork are drawings and paintings on paper. He often depicted nineteenth-century Kainai and Plains Indians life in his paintings.\n\n=== Artwork ===\nIn ''The Scalp'', Tailfeathers drew a Native American scalping another, after an apparent battle. The victorious \u201cIndian\u201d is seen standing over his fallen opponent, holding a bow in his left hand, and a piece of his opponent\u2019s scalp. This act was a tradition as it represented a war prize. Tailfeathers used darker and less vivid colors to paint the picture of a death and to weaken the mood.\n\n''Big Bull'' - During his time at St. Mary\u2019s Lake Summer art School, Tailfeathers drew Big Bull with charcoal. Big Bull was the leader of Hunkpapa Lakota who led the resistance against the American government\u2019s policies. The drawing is the side profile of Big Bull with his headdress. Long feathers emerge from the back and fur surrounds the front and sides of his headdress. Along with shading and contrast, the distinct trait of Tailfeather\u2019s portrait was the texture brought from the coal.\n\nIn ''Hunting Buffalo'', Tailfeathers depicts an  Indigenous Canadian hunting a wild buffalo. On a horseback, the hunter is using a bow and arrow to attack multiple buffalo as another is seen in the distance. He paints in a style called \"Studio Style\", or \"Flat Style\", which is a traditional method of painting. In accordance to the style, the painting has a blank background with only the grass below showing. The painting can be referred to as nostalgic, rustic, and traditional.\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n* Ford McLeoc - Canadian Handcrafts Guild\n\n=== Posthumous Exhibitions ===\n\n*1992 Time for Dialogue, Calgary, Alberta\n* 1983 Contemporary Indian Art at Rideau Hall, Ottawa, Ontario\n* 1981 Tradition and Change in Contemporary Indian Art, Edmonton\n\n== Collections ==\n\n*[[Canadian Museum of History|Canadian Museum of Civilization]], Hull Quebec\n* Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Ottawa, Ontario\n*[[Galt Museum & Archives|Galt Museum]], Lethbridge, Alberta\n*[[Glenbow Museum]], Calgary, Alberta\n\n== Honors and Awards ==\nThe University of Lethbridge awarded Tailfeathers an honorary doctorate in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uleth.ca/sites/default/files/2019/10/uofl_honorary_degree_recipients_oct_2019.pdf|title=THE UNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGE Honorary Degree Recipients|last=|first=|date=|website=www.uleth.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nTailfeathers illustrated a children\u2019s book called \u201cThe White Calf\u201d (by Cliff Faulkner) in 1965.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Kainai Nation]]\n*[[Winold Reiss industrial murals]]\n*[[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]]\n*[[Hudson's Bay Company]]\n*[[Expo 67]]\n*[[Indian Association of Alberta]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/Untitled---Indian-Hunting-Buffalo/7E624EA5FE444D61 \"Hunting Buffalo\" Painting]\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/gerald-t-tailfeathers/ \"The Scalp\" Drawing]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=l1rWnplHriQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA121&dq=gerald+tailfeathers&ots=Vjd5baGj3s&sig=N4hx7k9aRr8yfSlvIHkNBzFyF-E#v=onepage&q=gerald%20tailfeathers&f=false \"Big Bull\" Drawing]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=oV10DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=art+expo+67+gerald+tailfeathers&source=bl&ots=0iCeB0D89-&sig=ACfU3U1lWUT_iK9VKCigv2UicBCeQu8MuA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiflYqAnNfnAhUXsJ4KHTyZBaQQ6AEwD3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=art%20expo%2067%20gerald%20tailfeathers&f=false Portrait of Gerald Tailfeathers]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tailfeathers, Gerald}}\n[[Category:1925 births]]\n[[Category:1975 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian painters]]\n[[Category:Canadian male painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century First Nations painters]]\n", "text_old": "'''Gerald Tailfeathers''' (February 14, 1925\u2014April 3, 1975), was one of the first Indigenous Canadians to become a professional painter.

This recognition led to his attendance at Saint Mary\u2019s Lake Summer Art School in Glacier National Park, Montana, with New York portrait painters Winold Reiss and Carl Linck. Unlike many of the students at St. Mary\u2019s Art School who were from The United States, Tailfeathers was from the Blood Reserve in Southern Alberta.

In a modern full-featured windowing system they can be resized, moved, hidden, restored or closed.\n\nWindows usually include other graphical objects, possibly including a menu-bar, toolbars, controls, icons and often a working area. In the working area, the document, image, folder contents or other main object is displayed. Around the working area, within the bounding window, there may be other smaller window areas, sometimes called panes or panels, showing relevant information or options. The working area of a [[single document interface]] holds only one main object. \"Child windows\" in [[multiple document interface]]s, and [[Tab (interface)|tabs]] for example in many web browsers, can make several similar documents or main objects available within a single main application window. Some windows in [[Mac OS X]] have a feature called a drawer, which is a pane that slides out the side of the window and to show extra options.\n\nApplications that can run either under a [[graphical user interface]] or in a [[text user interface]] may use different terminology. [[GNU Emacs]] uses the term 'window' to refer to an area within its display while a traditional window, such as controlled by an [[X11]] window manager, is called a 'frame'.\n\nAny window can be split into the window decoration and the window's content, although some systems purposely eschew window decoration as a form of [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalism]].\n\n==Window decoration==\n[[File:Window (windowing system).svg|thumb|Typical elements of a window. The window decoration is drawn by an OS-level process such as a window manager.

Some window managers may also display a border around [[background window]]s. Typically window borders can be used to provide [[window motion]] enabling the window to be moved or resized by using a [[dragging|drag]] action. Some window managers provide useless borders which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no window motion facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be resized by using a drag action on the border.\n\n=== Title bar ===\n[[File:Titlebar.png|thumb|A title bar of [[GNOME Calculator]]]]\n\n'''Title bar''' is a [[graphical control element]] and part of the window decoration. provided by some window managers. As a convention it is located at the top of the [[window (computing)|window]] as a horizontal bar. The title bar is typically used to display the name of the application, or the name of the open document, and may provide title bar buttons for minimizing, maximizing, closing or rolling up of application windows. Typically titlebars can be used to provide window motion enabling the window to be moved around the screen by using a drag action. Some window managers{{which|date=January 2016}} provide titlebars which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no window motion facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the titlebar.\n\nDefault title-bar text often incorporates the name of the application and/or of its developer. The name of the [[Hostname|host]] running the application also appears frequently. Various methods ([[Menu (computing)|menu]]-selections, [[escape sequences]], setup parameters, [[Command-line interface|command-line]] options \u2013 depending on the computing environment) may exist to give the [[end-user]] some control of title-bar text. Document-oriented applications like a [[text editor]] may display the [[filename]] or [[path (computing)|path]] of the document being edited. Most [[web browser]]s will [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the contents of the [[HTML element]] <code>title</code> in their title bar, sometimes pre- or postfixed by the application name. [[Google Chrome]] and some versions of [[Mozilla Firefox]] place their [[tabbed browsing|tabs]] in the title bar. This makes it unnecessary to use the main window for the tabs, but usually results in the title becoming truncated.\n\nThe title bar often contains [[Graphical widget|widget]]s for system commands relating to the window, such as a ''maximize'', ''minimize'', ''rollup'' and ''close'' buttons; and may include other content such as an application icon, a [[clock]], etc.\n\nIn many [[graphical user interface]]s, including the [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] interfaces, the user may move a window by [[Point-and-click|grabbing]] the title bar and [[Pointing device gesture|dragging]].\n\n==== Titlebar buttons ====\nSome window managers provide titlebar buttons which provide the facility to minimize, maximize, roll-up or close application windows. Some window managers may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or taskpanel, rather than in the titlebars.\n\nThe following buttons may appear in the titlebar:\n* Close\n* Maximize\n* Minimize\n* Resize\n* Roll-up (or [[WindowShade]])\n\nNote that a [[context menu]] may be available from some titlebar buttons or by right-clicking.\n\n==== Titlebar icon ====\nSome window managers display a small icon in the titlebar that may vary according to the application on which it appears. The titlebar icon may behave like a menu button, or may provide a context menu facility. OS X applications commonly have a proxy [[Icon (computing)|icon]] next to the window title that functions the same as the document's icon in the file manager.\n\n==== Document status icon ====\nSome window managers display an icon or symbol to indicate that the contents of the window have not been saved or confirmed in some way: [[Mac OS X]] displays a dot in the center of its close button; [[RISC OS]] appends an [[asterisk]] to the title.\n\n==== Tiling window managers ====\nSome [[tiling window manager]]s provide title bars which are purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a [[Drag-and-drop|drag]] action on the titlebar and may also serve the purpose of a [[status line]] from stacking window managers.\n\n==== In popular operating systems ====\n\n{| style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!

These window managers do not allow windows to be resized by using a drag action on the border.\n\n=== Title bar ===\n[[File:Titlebar.png|thumb|A title bar of [[GNOME Calculator]]]]\n\n'''Title bar''' is a [[graphical control element]] and part of the window decoration. provided by some window managers. As a convention it is located at the top of the [[window (computing)|window]] as a horizontal bar. The title bar is typically used to display the name of the application, or the name of the open document, and may provide title bar buttons for minimizing, maximizing, closing or rolling up of application windows. Typically titlebars can be used to provide window motion enabling the window to be moved around the screen by using a drag action. Some window managers{{which|date=January 2016}} provide titlebars which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no window motion facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the titlebar.\n\nDefault title-bar text often incorporates the name of the application and/or of its developer. The name of the [[Hostname|host]] running the application also appears frequently. Various methods ([[Menu (computing)|menu]]-selections, [[escape sequences]], setup parameters, [[Command-line interface|command-line]] options \u2013 depending on the computing environment) may exist to give the [[end-user]] some control of title-bar text. Document-oriented applications like a [[text editor]] may display the [[filename]] or [[path (computing)|path]] of the document being edited. Most [[web browser]]s will [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the contents of the [[HTML element]] <code>title</code> in their title bar, sometimes pre- or postfixed by the application name. [[Google Chrome]] and some versions of [[Mozilla Firefox]] place their [[tabbed browsing|tabs]] in the title bar. This makes it unnecessary to use the main window for the tabs, but usually results in the title becoming truncated.\n\nThe title bar often contains [[Graphical widget|widget]]s for system commands relating to the window, such as a ''maximize'', ''minimize'', ''rollup'' and ''close'' buttons; and may include other content such as an application icon, a [[clock]], etc.\n\nIn many [[graphical user interface]]s, including the [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] interfaces, the user may move a window by [[Point-and-click|grabbing]] the title bar and [[Pointing device gesture|dragging]].\n\n==== Titlebar buttons ====\nSome window managers provide titlebar buttons which provide the facility to minimize, maximize, roll-up or close application windows. Some window managers may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or taskpanel, rather than in the titlebars.\n\nThe following buttons may appear in the titlebar:\n* Close\n* Maximize\n* Minimize\n* Resize\n* Roll-up (or [[WindowShade]])\n\nNote that a [[context menu]] may be available from some titlebar buttons or by right-clicking.\n\n==== Titlebar icon ====\nSome window managers display a small icon in the titlebar that may vary according to the application on which it appears. The titlebar icon may behave like a menu button, or may provide a context menu facility. OS X applications commonly have a proxy [[Icon (computing)|icon]] next to the window title that functions the same as the document's icon in the file manager.\n\n==== Document status icon ====\nSome window managers display an icon or symbol to indicate that the contents of the window have not been saved or confirmed in some way: [[Mac OS X]] displays a dot in the center of its close button; [[RISC OS]] appends an [[asterisk]] to the title.\n\n==== Tiling window managers ====\nSome [[tiling window manager]]s provide title bars which are purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a [[Drag-and-drop|drag]] action on the titlebar and may also serve the purpose of a [[status line]] from stacking window managers.\n\n==== In popular operating systems ====\n\n{| style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The report notes that \"Chronic use of NSAIDs is also associated with significant morbidity and mortality. NSAID gastrointestinal risk is substantial, with deaths and hospitalization estimated in one publication as 3200 and 32,000 per year respectively. Possible cardiovascular toxicity with chronic NSAID use has been a major discussion recently\", finally noting that \"The goal of the educational efforts is not to decrease appropriate acetaminophen use or encourage substitution of NSAID use, but rather to educate consumers so that they can avoid unnecessary health risks.\"<ref name=\"www.fda.gov\">{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/DrugSafetyandRiskManagementAdvisoryCommittee/UCM164898.pdf |title=Recommendations for FDA Interventions to Decrease the Occurrence of Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity |access-date= |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924160711/https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/DrugSafetyandRiskManagementAdvisoryCommittee/UCM164898.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 }}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n==Veterinary use==\n\n===Cats===\nParacetamol is extremely toxic to cats, which lack the necessary [[UGT1A6]] enzyme to break it down safely.

He is the lead singer and lyricist of the band [[Travis (band)|Travis]], having written nearly all of the songs on their first six studio albums, with the 7th and 8th being more of a co-written work. He is based in [[Berlin]]. Healy released his debut solo album titled ''[[Wreckorder]]'' in October 2010, which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass.\n\n==Early life==\nAlthough born in [[Stafford]], [[England]], Healy grew up in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] \u2013 his parents' hometown. His mother had moved back to Scotland after divorcing her husband. Healy has said that both his mother and his grandmother were major influences on him as a child. Healy attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]] in Glasgow.\n\nAs a young child at primary school, he was awarded a book of [[Robert Burns]] poems and a certificate \"For Outstanding Singing Abilities\" after singing the old Scottish song \"Westering Home\" while dressed in a kilt. However, Healy showed no further interest in singing until his teens. His obsession with songwriting began to take shape when he got his first guitar in 1986 at the age of 13, having seen [[Roy Orbison]] perform his hit [[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]] on ''[[The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross]]''. First songs played on the guitar were old rock'n'roll numbers like \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" and \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]]. His first complete song was written about the headmaster of his school, Peter Mullen, entitled \"Mr. Mullen Blues\", with a sample lyric: ''\"...and there was Pete Mullen, with his pie and beans. It was then I smelled it, it filled the room. Then some wee bugger lit a match and the whole place went Ka-BOOM...Where's your tie boy? Pick up that can. Get in line girl, do you understand...Cause his name is big Pete Mullen...And he's a man\"''. He performed it at the school talent show but failed to move the judges. He then played in several school bands.\n\n==Travis==\n{{Main|Travis (band)}}\n[[File:Travis 2007 II.jpg|thumb|right|Healy Performing With Travis.]]\nIn 1991,  [[Neil Primrose (musician)|Neil Primrose]], the drummer of Glasgow band Glass Onion, asked Healy if he would like to audition for the band; their previous singer, Catherine Maxwell, had just left the band. Healy joined the band on the same day he enrolled at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. This band soon changed their name to [[Travis (band)|Travis]], named after the main character in the [[Wim Wenders]] movie ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''.\n\nTravis' first single, \"[[All I Want to Do Is Rock]]\", was written by Healy while on a visit to [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] on Great [[Cumbrae]], a small island in the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Going there with the sole intention of composing the best song he had ever written, Healy surprised even himself when the track was born. In spite of Healy's success as a songwriter since, he is without formal musical training. As the band has risen to prominence, Healy has continued to be [[Travis (band)|Travis]]' main songwriter, as well as the band's main spokesman and most recognisable member.\n\nTravis has twice been awarded British album of the year at the annual [[BRIT Awards]], and is credited as having paved the way for British bands such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Keane (band)|Keane]]. Travis have released eight studio albums, beginning with ''[[Good Feeling (Travis album)|Good Feeling]]'' in 1997.\n\n==Other musical activities==\nAlthough Healy predominantly plays guitar, he has also been known to write and perform with piano.\n\nIn 2010 Healy released the solo album ''[[Wreckorder]]'', which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass and [[Neko Case]].\n\nHe appeared on the BBC's last night of the proms celebrations in Scotland on 10 September 2011 in the Caird Hall in Dundee.\n\nHe co-wrote the song \"Here With Me\" from [[The Killers]]' 2012 album ''[[Battle Born (album)|Battle Born]]''.\n\n==Influences==\nIn interviews, Healy has talked of being influenced by songwriters such as [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Graham Nash]] (of [[The Hollies]] and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] fame). Healy has since played with both McCartney and Nash.\n\n==Praise==\nHealy's songwriting has been praised by [[Paul McCartney]], [[Elton John]] and [[Noel Gallagher]]. In 2005, [[Coldplay]] frontman [[Chris Martin]] called himself \"a poor man's Fran Healy\".\n\n==Activism==\nHealy is a part of the movement [[Make Poverty History]] and has, alongside his band, played at the [[Live 8]] concerts in both London and [[Edinburgh]]. He has also participated in [[Band Aid 20]]'s re-recording of [[Do They Know It's Christmas?]] \u2013 Healy and friend [[Nigel Godrich]] also playing roles in its organization.\n\nHe has so far made two trips to [[Sudan]] with the [[Save the Children]] Organization, for which he has just launched the biggest ever global campaign<ref>[http://www.cafonline.org/default.aspx?page=15189&WT.mc_id=399 \"Fran Healy launches Save the Children\u2019s biggest ever global campaign\"], ''[[Charities Aid Foundation]]'', 2008-02-20.

There are also 18 cases of homicide-suicide involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non-aviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%).<ref name=kenedi>{{cite journal |last1=Kenedi |first1=Christopher |last2=Friedman |first2=Susan Hatters |last3=Watson |first3=Dougal |last4=Preitner |first4=Claude |title=Suicide and Murder-Suicide Involving Aircraft |journal=Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance |volume=87 |number=4 |date=April 2016 |pages= 388\u2013396 |publisher=Aerospace Medical Association |doi=10.3357/AMHP.4474.2016}}</ref>\n\nKenedi et al. note that homicide-suicide events occur only extremely rarely, but that their impact, in terms of the proportion of deaths, is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. They state: \"There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides.\"<ref name=kenedi/>\n\n==Prevention==\nU.S. regulations require at least two flight crew members to be in

There are also 18 cases of homicide-suicide involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non-aviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%).<ref name=kenedi>{{cite journal |last1=Kenedi |first1=Christopher |last2=Friedman |first2=Susan Hatters |last3=Watson |first3=Dougal |last4=Preitner |first4=Claude |title=Suicide and Murder-Suicide Involving Aircraft |journal=Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance |volume=87 |number=4 |date=April 2016 |pages= 388\u2013396 |publisher=Aerospace Medical Association |doi=10.3357/AMHP.4474.2016}}</ref>\n\nKenedi et al. note that homicide-suicide events occur only extremely rarely, but that their impact, in terms of the proportion of deaths, is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. They state: \"There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides.\"<ref name=kenedi/>\n\n==Prevention==\nU.S. regulations require at least two flight crew members to be in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons, to be able to help in any  medical or other emergency, including intervening if a crew member would try to crash the plane.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/opinion/reducing-risks-after-the-germanwings-crash.html Reducing Risks After the Germanwings Crash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821050520/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/opinion/reducing-risks-after-the-germanwings-crash.html |date=August 21, 2017 }} (''New York Times'', March 26, 2015)</ref><ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/germanwings-crash-murder-suicide-pilot/388778/ Could the Germanwings Crash Have Been Avoided?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203233212/http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/germanwings-crash-murder-suicide-pilot/388778/ |date=December 3, 2016 }} (''The Atlantic'', March 26, 2015)</ref> Following the deliberate crash of [[Germanwings Flight 9525]] on March 24, 2015, some European and Canadian airlines adopted a two-in-cockpit policy<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/germanwings-crash-prompts-airlines-to-introduce-cockpit-rule-of-two Germanwings crash prompts airlines to introduce cockpit \u2018rule of two\u2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094636/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/germanwings-crash-prompts-airlines-to-introduce-cockpit-rule-of-two |date=February 20, 2017 }} (''The Guardian'', March 26, 2015)</ref><ref>[https://www.vox.com/2015/3/26/8294971/pilot-suicide-crash The disturbing history of pilots who deliberately crash their own planes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821045533/https://www.vox.com/2015/3/26/8294971/pilot-suicide-crash |date=August 21, 2017 }} (''Vox'', March 26, 2015)</ref> as did all Australian airlines for aircraft with fifty or more passenger seats.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-30/federal-government-announces-new-cockpit-safety-standards/6358474 Germanwings: Australia tightens cockpit safety laws in wake of French Alps plane crash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330233012/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-30/federal-government-announces-new-cockpit-safety-standards/6358474 |date=March 30, 2015 }} (''Australian Broadcasting Corporation News'', March 30, 2015)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aviation accidents and incidents]]\n*[[Aviation safety]]\n*[[List of aircraft hijackings]], for instances where a hijacker crashed the aircraft\n*[[Kamikaze]]\n*[[Vehicle ramming attack]]\n*[[Mental health in aviation]]\n*[[Suicide by cop]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/26/travel/germanwings-crash-death-by-pilot-cases/ Deliberate acts: 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing] at cnn.com\n* [http://news.aviation-safety.net/2015/03/26/list-of-aircraft-accidents-and-incidents-deliberately-caused-by-pilots/ List of aircraft accidents and incidents intentionally caused by pilots] at aviation-safety.net\n* [http://www.canberratimes.com.au/comment/pilot-suicide-cases-few-and-far-between-20140408-zqs8w.html Pilot suicide cases few and far between] at canberratimes.com\n{{Lists of aviation accidents and incidents}}\n{{Suicide navbox|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Suicide by pilot}}\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving deliberate crashes| ]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by hijacking| ]]\n[[Category:Suicide methods|Aircraft pilot]]\n[[Category:Murder\u2013suicides|Aircraft pilot]]\n[[Category:Lists of aviation accidents and incidents]]\n[[Category:Aviators who committed suicide|Pilot]]\n[[Category:Aviation and health]]\n[[Category:Kamikaze| ]]\n[[Category:Aviation risks]]\n", "name_user": "K Magz", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_by_pilot"}
