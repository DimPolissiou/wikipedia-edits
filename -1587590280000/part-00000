[[Archeologists]] have identified artifacts of the [[Adena culture]], dating from 1000 BC to 200 BC. They were among the several early Native American cultures who built major [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]] for ceremonial and burial use. Remnants of their culture have been found throughout West Virginia. They were followed by other indigenous peoples.\n\nWith the growth of fur trading to the north after European encounter in the coastal areas, the nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' (or Iroquois Confederacy), based in present-day New York, moved into the Ohio Valley in search of new hunting grounds. By the 17th century they had conquered other tribes, pushed them out to the west, and preserved the area for hunting.\n\n===1863 to present===\nIt was not until after West Virginia became a state in 1863 that present-day Mineral County was organized. It was created in 1866 by an Act of the West Virginia Legislature from the existing Hampshire County. The name was selected due to its reserves of minerals, especially [[coal]] - although coal, a type of sedimentary rock, is not a mineral because it does not have a crystalline structure.\n\nThe seminal point in the creation of the county was the arrival of the main line of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1842. The county seat of Keyser was named for an executive of the railroad.<ref name=\"WVEncyclopediaMineral\">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Mineral County | encyclopedia=The West Virginia Encyclopedia | publisher=West Virginia Humanities Council | accessdate=August 30, 2016 | author=Canfield, Jack | URL=http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1801}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  After its formation in 1866, Mineral County was divided into seven townships: Cabin Run, Elk,{{efn-lr|Also called \"Elk Garden\" in early records.}} Frankfort, Mill Creek, New Creek, Piedmont, and Welton.  Mill Creek Township was returned to Hampshire County in 1871, and in 1872 the six remaining townships became magisterial districts.  Except for minor adjustments, they remained relatively unchanged until the 1980s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|329|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|328|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.4|sqmi}} (0.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_54.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 30, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Mountains===\nThe northern terminus of the [[Allegheny Front]] in West Virginia lies in Mineral County, and includes the highest point in the county. Known as \"the Pinnacle\", it is {{convert|3104|ft|m}} above sea level. From the abandoned fire tower four states are visible, [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Virginia]]. The Allegheny Front is the largest mountain in the county; on the north end it is also known as Green Mountain. On top of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] is located the town of [[Elk Garden, West Virginia]] in the southwestern portion of the county. The Potomac River Valley lies to west and north of the mountain, and the [[New Creek]] Valley lies to the east.\n\n[[Knobly Mountain]] lies between the New Creek and Patterson Creek valleys. It is the longest mountain in Mineral County stretching from the Grant County line in the south to the Potomac River in the north at [[Ridgeley, West Virginia]].\n\nTo the east of the Patterson Creek Valley lie a series of low hills which form the eastern border of the county with [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]].\n\n===Rivers===\n*[[North Branch Potomac River]] is the largest river, though not actually in the county. It forms the northern border of the county and the state border with actual border being the low water mark on the south side.  [[Jennings Randolph Lake]] is located on this stream.\n*[[New Creek]] enters the North Branch Potomac River at [[Keyser, West Virginia|Keyser]] with the headwaters starting at Dam Site 14 in [[Grant County, West Virginia]].

[[Archeologists]] have identified artifacts of the [[Adena culture]], dating from 1000 BC to 200 BC. They were among the several early Native American cultures who built major [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]] for ceremonial and burial use. Remnants of their culture have been found throughout West Virginia. They were followed by other indigenous peoples.\n\nWith the growth of fur trading to the north after European encounter in the coastal areas, the nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' (or Iroquois Confederacy), based in present-day New York, moved into the Ohio Valley in search of new hunting grounds. By the 17th century they had conquered other tribes, pushed them out to the west, and preserved the area for hunting.\n\n===1863 to present===\nIt was not until after West Virginia became a state in 1863 that present-day Mineral County was organized. It was created in 1866 by an Act of the West Virginia Legislature from the existing Hampshire County. The name was selected due to its reserves of minerals, especially [[coal]] - although coal, a type of sedimentary rock, is not a mineral because it does not have a crystalline structure.\n\nThe seminal point in the creation of the county was the arrival of the main line of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1842. The county seat of Keyser was named for an executive of the railroad.<ref name=\"WVEncyclopediaMineral\">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Mineral County | encyclopedia=The West Virginia Encyclopedia | publisher=West Virginia Humanities Council | accessdate=August 30, 2016 | author=Canfield, Jack | URL=http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1801}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  After its formation in 1866, Mineral County was divided into seven townships: Cabin Run, Elk,{{efn-lr|Also called \"Elk Garden\" in early records.}} Frankfort, Mill Creek, New Creek, Piedmont, and Welton.  Mill Creek Township was returned to Hampshire County in 1871, and in 1872 the six remaining townships became magisterial districts.  Except for minor adjustments, they remained relatively unchanged until the 1980s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|329|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|328|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.4|sqmi}} (0.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_54.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 30, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Mountains===\nThe northern terminus of the [[Allegheny Front]] in West Virginia lies in Mineral County, and includes the highest point in the county. Known as \"the Pinnacle\", it is {{convert|3104|ft|m}} above sea level. From the abandoned fire tower four states are visible, [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Virginia]]. The Allegheny Front is the largest mountain in the county; on the north end it is also known as Green Mountain. On top of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] is located the town of [[Elk Garden, West Virginia]] in the southwestern portion of the county. The Potomac River Valley lies to west and north of the mountain, and the [[New Creek]] Valley lies to the east.\n\n[[Knobly Mountain]] lies between the New Creek and Patterson Creek valleys. It is the longest mountain in Mineral County stretching from the Grant County line in the south to the Potomac River in the north at [[Ridgeley, West Virginia]].\n\nTo the east of the Patterson Creek Valley lie a series of low hills which form the eastern border of the county with [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]].\n\n===Rivers===\n*[[North Branch Potomac River]] is the largest river, though not actually in the county. It forms the northern border of the county and the state border with actual border being the low water mark on the south side.  [[Jennings Randolph Lake]] is located on this stream.\n*[[New Creek]] enters the North Branch Potomac River at [[Keyser, West Virginia|Keyser]] with the headwaters starting at Dam Site 14 in [[Grant County, West Virginia]].
