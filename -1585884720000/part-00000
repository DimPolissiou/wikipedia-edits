Industrialized countries, except Japan, [[1970s recession|experienced an economic recession]] due to [[1973 oil crisis|an oil crisis]] caused by oil embargoes by the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]]. The crisis saw the first instance of [[stagflation]] which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of [[Keynesian]] economic theory with [[neoliberal]] economic theory, with the first [[neoliberal]] governments being created in [[Chile]], where a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] led by [[Augusto Pinochet]] took place in 1973.\n\nNovelist [[Tom Wolfe]] coined the term \"'Me' decade\" in his essay \"[[The 'Me' Decade and the Third Great Awakening]]\", published by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' in August 1976 referring to the 1970s.

The continent was, however, plagued by endemic military coups, with the long-reigning [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] [[Haile Selassie]] being removed, civil wars and famine.\n\nThe economies of much of the [[developing world]] continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s because of the [[Green Revolution]]. They might have thrived and become stable in the way that Europe recovered after [[World War&nbsp;II]] through the [[Marshall Plan]]; however, their economic growth was slowed by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] but boomed immediately after.\n\n==Politics and wars==\n\n===Wars===\n[[File:DakToVietnam1966.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Vietnam War]] (1955\u20131975)]]\n{{Main|List of wars 1945\u20131989#1970\u20131979}}\nThe most notable wars and/or other conflicts of the decade include:\n*The [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131990)\n** The [[Vietnam War]] came to a close in 1975 with the fall of Saigon and the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. The following year, Vietnam was officially declared reunited.\n** [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] (1979\u20131989) \u2013 Although taking place almost entirely throughout the 1980s, the war officially started on December 27, 1979.\n** [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975\u20132002) \u2013 resulting in intervention by multiple countries on the Marxist and anti-Marxist sides, with [[Cuba]] and [[Mozambique]] supporting the [[Marxist]] faction while [[South Africa]] and [[Zaire]] support the anti-Marxists.\n** [[Ethiopian Civil War]] (1976\u20131991)\n* The [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974)\n* The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971 in [[South Asia]], engaging [[East Pakistan]], [[West Pakistan]], and [[India]]\n**[[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]\n**[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]\n* [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] (Early 20th century\u2013present)\n** [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973) \u2013 the war was launched by [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] against [[Israel]] in October 1973 to recover territories lost by the Arabs in the [[Six-Day War|1967 conflict]]. The Israelis were taken by surprise and suffered heavy losses before they rallied. In the end, they managed to repel the Egyptians (and a simultaneous attack by Syria in the Golan Heights) and crossed the Suez Canal into Egypt proper. In 1978, Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel at [[Camp David]] in the United States, ending outstanding disputes between the two countries. Sadat's actions would lead to his [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|assassination in 1981]].\n* [[The Emergency (India)|Indian emergency]] (1975\u20131977)\n* [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975\u20131990) \u2013 A civil war in the Middle East which at times also involved the PLO and Israel during the early 1980s.\n* [[Western Sahara War]] (1975\u20131991) \u2013 A regional war pinning the rebel [[Polisario Front]] against [[Morocco]] and [[Mauritania]].\n* [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War]] (1978\u20131979) \u2013 the war which was fought between [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]] was based on an [[Expansionism|expansionist]] agenda to annex territory from [[Tanzania]]. The war resulted in the overthrow of [[Idi Amin]]'s regime.\n* The [[Ogaden War]] (1977\u20131978) was another African conflict between [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] over control of the [[Ogaden]] region.\n* The [[Rhodesian Bush War]] (1964-1979)\n\n===International conflicts===\n[[File:1979 Iranian Revolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[1979 Iranian Revolution]]]]\nThe most notable International conflicts of the decade include:\n* Major conflict between capitalist and communist forces in multiple countries, while attempts are made by the Soviet Union and the United States to lessen the chance for conflict, such as both countries endorsing nuclear nonproliferation.\n* In 1976, peaceful student protests in the [[Soweto]] township of [[South Africa]] led to the [[Soweto Uprising]] when more than 700 black school children were killed by South Africa's [[Security Police]].\n* Rise of separatism in the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada. In 1970, radical [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] militants of the ''[[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]]'' (FLQ) kidnapped the Quebec labour minister [[Pierre Laporte]] and British Trade Commissioner [[James Cross]] during the [[October Crisis]], resulting in Laporte being killed, and the enactment of [[martial law]] in Canada under the [[War Measures Act]], resulting in a campaign by the Canadian government which arrests suspected FLQ supporters. The election of the ''[[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' led by [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] in the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada, brings the first political party committed to Quebec independence into power in Quebec. L\u00e9vesque's government pursues an agenda to secede Quebec from Canada by democratic means and strengthen Francophone Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois culture in the late 1970s, such as the controversial [[Charter of the French Language]] more commonly known in Quebec and Canada as \"Bill 101\".\n* [[Martial law]] was declared in the [[Philippines]] on September 21, 1972, by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n* In [[Cambodia]], the communist leader [[Pol Pot]] led a revolution against the American-backed government of [[Lon Nol]]. On April 17, 1975, Pot's forces captured [[Phnom Penh]], the capital, two years after America had halted the bombings of their positions. His communist government, the [[Khmer Rouge]], forced people out of the cities to clear jungles and establish a radical, Marxist agrarian society. Buddhist priests and monks, along with anyone who spoke foreign languages, had any sort of education, or even wore glasses were tortured or killed. As many as 3 million people may have died. Vietnam [[Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia|invaded the country]] at the start of 1979, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge and installing a [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|satellite government]]. This provoked a brief, but furious [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border war with China]] in February of that year.\n* The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 transformed Iran from an autocratic pro-Western monarchy under Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] to a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Islamist]] government under the leadership of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Distrust between the revolutionaries and Western powers led to the [[Iran hostage crisis]] on November 4, 1979, where 66 diplomats, mainly from the United States, were held captive for 444 days.\n* Growing internal tensions take place in [[Yugoslavia]] beginning with the [[Croatian Spring]] movement in 1971 which demands greater decentralization of power to the constituent republics of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's communist ruler [[Joseph Broz Tito]] subdues the Croatian Spring movement and arrests its leaders, but does initiate major constitutional reform resulting in the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]] which decentralized powers to the republics, gave them the official right to separate from Yugoslavia, and weakened the influence of Serbia (Yugoslavia's largest and most populous constituent republic) in the federation by granting significant powers to the Serbian autonomous provinces of [[Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]]. In addition, the 1974 Constitution consolidated Tito's dictatorship by proclaiming him president-for-life. The 1974 Constitution would become resented by Serbs and began a gradual escalation of ethnic tensions.\n\n===Coups===\n[[File:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Haile Selassie]] was overthrown from power in [[Ethiopia]], ending one of the longest-lasting monarchies in world history.]]\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1970\u20131979}}\nThe most prominent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade include:\n* 1970 \u2013 Coup in [[Syria]], led by [[Hafez al-Assad]].\n* 1971 \u2013 [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|Military coup]] in [[Uganda]] led by [[Idi Amin]].\n* 1973 \u2013 [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|Coup d'\u00e9tat in Chile on September 11th]], Salvador Allende was overthrown and killed in a military attack on the presidential palace.

It would ultimately lead to the decolonization of all its colonies, but leave power vacuums that led to civil war in newly independent Lusophone African nations.\n* 1975 - [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[President of Bangladesh]], and almost his entire family was [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassinated]] in the early hours of August 15, 1975, when a group of [[Bangladesh Army]] personnel went to his residence and killed him, during a coup d'\u00e9tat.\n* 1976 \u2013 [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] seizes control of [[Argentina]] in 1976 through a coup sponsored by the Argentine military, establishing himself as a dictator of a [[military junta]] government in the country.\n* 1977 \u2013 Military coup in Pakistan political leaders including Zulfikar Ali Bhutto arrested.

Groups in Europe like the [[Red Brigades]] and the [[Baader-Meinhof]] Gang were responsible for a spate of bombings, kidnappings, and murders. Violence continued in [[Northern Ireland]] and the Middle East. Radical American groups existed as well, such as the Weather Underground and the Symbionese Liberation Army, but they never achieved the size or strength of their European counterparts.\n*On September 6, 1970, the world witnessed the beginnings of modern rebellious fighting in what is today called as [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Skyjack Sunday]]. Palestinian terrorists hijacked four [[airliner]]s and took over 300 people on board as hostage. The hostages were later released, but the planes were blown up.\n\n===Prominent political events===\n'''Worldwide'''\n* [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]\n* The presence and rise of a significant number of women as heads of state and heads of government in a number of countries across the world, many being the first women to hold such positions, such as [[Soong Ching-ling]] continuing as the first Chairwoman of the People's Republic of China until 1972, [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]] as the first woman President in [[Argentina]] in 1974 until being deposed in 1976, [[Elisabeth Domitien]] becomes the first woman Prime Minister of [[Lesotho]], [[Indira Gandhi]] continuing as Prime Minister of India until 1977, [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]] becoming the interim President of [[Bolivia]] beginning from 1979 to 1980, [[Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Portugal in 1979, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n'''Americas'''<br />\n[[File:Nixon-depart.png|thumb|right|Nixon displays the [[V sign|V-for-victory sign]] as he departs the White House after resigning]]\n* United States President [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President on August 9, 1974, while facing charges for impeachment for the [[Watergate scandal]].\n* [[Augusto Pinochet]] rose to power as ruler of [[Chile]] after overthrowing the country's Socialist president [[Salvador Allende]] in 1973 with the assistance of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) of the United States. Pinochet would remain the dictator of Chile until 1990.\n* [[Suriname]] was granted independence from the [[Netherlands]] on November 25, 1975.\n* In [[Guyana]], the Rev. [[Jim Jones]] led several hundred people from the United States to establish a Utopian Marxist commune in the jungle named [[Jonestown]]. Amid allegations of corruption, mental and physical abuse by Jones on his followers, and denying them the right to leave Jonestown, a Congressional committee visited Guyana to investigate in November 1978. They were attacked by Jones' guards, and Congressman [[Leo Ryan]] was killed. The demented Jones then ordered everyone in the commune to commit suicide. The people drank or were forced to drink, cyanide-laced fruit punch. A total of 900 dead were found, including Jones, who had shot himself.\n* [[Greenland]] was granted [[Devolution|self-government]] (or \"[[home rule]]\") within the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] on November 29, 1979.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greenland Takes a Step Towards Autonomy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/independence-day-greenland-takes-a-step-towards-autonomy-a-592880.html|newspaper=Spiegel Online|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=2008-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Greenland Profile - BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18249815|website=bbc.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Europe'''<br />\n[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and Soviet Union leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] sign the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT&nbsp;II treaty]], June 18, 1979, in [[Vienna]], Austria.]]\n\n* [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the Conservative party rose to power in the United Kingdom in 1979, initiating a [[neoliberal]] economic policy of reducing government spending, weakening the power of trade unions, and promoting economic and trade liberalization.\n* [[Francisco Franco]] died after 39 years in power. [[Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]] was crowned king of Spain and called for the reintroduction of democracy. The dictatorship in Spain ended. The first general elections were held in 1977 and [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez]] became [[Prime minister of Spain]] after his Centrist Democratic Union won. The Socialist and Communist parties were legalized. The current Spanish Constitution was signed in 1978.\n* In 1972, [[Erich Honecker]] was chosen to lead [[East Germany]], a role he would fill for the whole of the 1970s and 1980s. The mid-1970s were a time of extreme recession for East Germany, and as a result of the country's higher debts, consumer goods became more and more scarce. If East Germans had enough money to procure a television set, a telephone, or a [[Trabant]] automobile, they were placed on waiting lists which caused them to wait as much as a decade for the item in question.\n* The Soviet Union under the leadership of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], having the largest armed forces and the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, pursued an agenda to lessen tensions with its rival [[superpower]], the United States, for most of the seventies. That policy known as [[d\u00e9tente]] abruptly ended with the [[Soviet-Afghan war|Soviet invasion in Afghanistan]] at the end of 1979. While known as a \"period of stagnation\" in Soviet historiography, the Seventies are largely considered as a sort of a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of the USSR in terms of stability and relative well-being. Nevertheless, hidden inflation continued to increase for the second straight decade, and production consistently fell short of demand in agriculture and consumer goods manufacturing. By the end of the 1970s, signs of social and economic stagnation were becoming very pronounced.\n* [[Enver Hoxha]]'s rule in [[Albania]] was characterized in the 1970s by growing isolation, first from a very public schism with the Soviet Union the decade before, and then by a [[Sino-Albanian Split|split]] in friendly relations with China in 1978. Albania normalized relations with [[Yugoslavia]] in 1971, and attempted trade agreements with other European nations, but was met with vocal disapproval by the United Kingdom and United States.\n* 1978 would become known as the \"Year of Three Popes\". In August, [[Paul&nbsp;VI]], who had ruled since 1963, died. His successor was Cardinal Albino Luciano, who took the name [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul]]. But only 33 days later, he was found dead, and the Catholic Church had to elect another pope. On October 16, Karol Wojty\u0142a, a Polish cardinal, was elected, becoming [[Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]]. He was the first non-Italian pope since 1523.\n\n'''Asia'''<br />\n[[File:Camp David, Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camp David Accords]], 1978]]\n[[File:Nixon and Zhou toast.jpg|thumb|right|Nixon and Zhou toast, 1972]]\n* On September 17, 1978 the [[Camp David Accords]] are signed between [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]]. The Accords led directly to the 1979 [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]]. They also resulted in Sadat and Begin sharing the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize.\n* Major changes in the People's Republic of China. US president [[Richard Nixon]] visited the country in 1972, restoring relations between the two countries, although diplomatic ties were not established until 1979. In 1976, [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] both died, beginning a new era. After the brief rule of Mao's chosen successor [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's paramount leader, and began to shift the country towards market economics and away from ideologically driven policies.\n* In [[Iraq]], [[Saddam Hussein]] began to rise to power by helping to modernize the country. One major initiative was removing the Western monopoly on [[Petroleum|oil]], which later during the high prices of [[1973 oil crisis]] would help Hussein's ambitious plans. On July 16, 1979, he assumed the [[President of Iraq|presidency]] cementing his rise to power.

D\u00e9tente was partially a reaction against the policies of the previous 25 years, which had brought the world dangerously close to nuclear war on several occasions, and because the US was in a weakened position following the failure of the Vietnam War. As part of d\u00e9tente, the US also restored ties with the People's Republic of China, partially as a counterweight against Soviet expansionism.\n\nThe US\u2013Soviet geopolitical rivalry nonetheless continued through the decade, although in a more indirect faction as the two superpowers jockeyed relentlessly for control of smaller countries. American and Soviet intelligence agencies gave funding, training, and material support to insurgent groups, governments, and armies across the globe, each seeking to gain a geopolitical advantage and install friendly governments. Coups, civil wars, and terrorism went on across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also in Europe where a spate of Soviet-backed Marxist terrorist groups were active throughout the decade. Over half the world's population in the 1970s lived under a repressive dictatorship, although nothing exceeded the brutalities of [[Pol Pot]]'s Cambodia in 1975\u201378 and [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]]'s Equatorial Guinea. In 1979, a new wrinkle appeared in the form of Islamic fundamentalism, as the Shia theocracy of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] overthrew the Shah of Iran and declared itself hostile to both Western democracy and godless communism.\n\nPeople were deeply influenced by the rapid pace of societal change and the aspiration for a more egalitarian society in cultures that were long colonized and have an even longer history of hierarchical [[social structure]].\n\nThe [[Green Revolution]] of the late 1960s brought about self-sufficiency in food in many developing economies. At the same time an increasing number of people began to seek urban prosperity over agrarian life. This consequently saw the duality of transition of diverse interaction across social [[communities]] amid increasing information blockade across [[social class]].\n\nOther common global ethos of the 1970s world included increasingly flexible and varied gender roles for women in industrialized societies. More women could enter the work force. However, the gender role of men remained as that of a breadwinner. The period also saw the socioeconomic effect of an ever-increasing number of women entering the non-agrarian economic workforce. The [[Iranian revolution]] also affected global attitudes to and among those of the Muslim faith toward the end of the 1970s.\n\nThe global experience of the cultural transition of the 1970s and an experience of a global [[zeitgeist]] revealed the interdependence of economies since World War&nbsp;II, in a world increasingly polarized between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n==Assassinations and attempts==\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n[[File:King_Faisal_of_Saudi_Arabia_in_1971_(cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]]]]\n\n* King of [[Saudi Arabia]] [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] is assassinated in March 25, 1975 by his half-brother's son, [[Faisal bin Musaid]].\n*[[Arthur Bremer]] plotted to assassinate Governor of Alabama, [[George Wallace]] on May 15, 1972, while Wallace was making a campaign trip in Laurel, Maryland.

As a result, the 1970s adversely distinguished itself from the prosperous postwar period between 1945 and 1973. The oil shocks [[Arab Oil Embargo|of 1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] added to the existing ailments and conjured high inflation throughout much of the world for the rest of the decade. U.S. manufacturing industries began to decline as a result, with the United States running its last trade surplus ({{as of|2009|lc=y}}) in 1975. In contrast, Japan and West Germany experienced economic booms and started overtaking the U.S. as the world's leading manufacturers. In 1970, Japan overtook West Germany to become the world's second-largest economy.<ref name=\"secondecon\" /> Japan would rank as the world's second-largest economy until 1994 when the [[European Economic Area]] (18 countries under a single market) came into effect.\n\nIn the US, the average annual inflation rate from 1900 to 1970 was approximately 2.5%. From 1970\u20131979, however, the average rate was 7.06%, and topped out at 13.29% in December 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inflation and CPI Consumer Price Index 1970\u20131979|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1970-1979/}}</ref> This period is also known for \"[[stagflation]]\", a phenomenon in which inflation and unemployment steadily increased. It led to double-digit interest rates that rose to unprecedented levels (above 12% per year). The prime rate hit 21.5 in December 1980, the highest in history.<ref name=\"'70s 292\"/> A rising cost of housing was reflected in the  average price of a new home in the U.S. The average price of a new home in the U.S. was $23,450 in 1970 up to $68,700 by 1980. By the time of 1980, when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was running for [[1980 United States presidential election|re-election]] against [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[Misery index (economics)|misery index]] (the sum of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate) had reached an all-time high of 21.98%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Misery Index|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/}}</ref> The economic problems of the 1970s would result in a sluggish cynicism replacing the optimistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s and a distrust of government and technology. Faith in government was at an all-time low in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, as exemplified by the low voter turnout in the 1976 United States presidential election.\nThere was also the [[1973\u201374 stock market crash]].\n\nGreat Britain also experienced considerable economic turmoil during the decade as outdated industries proved unable to compete with Japanese and German wares. Labor strikes happened with such frequency as to almost paralyze the country's infrastructure. Following the [[Winter of Discontent]], Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister in 1979 with the purpose of implementing extreme economic reforms.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Soviet-style command economies began showing signs of stagnation, in which successes were persistently dogged by setbacks. The oil shock increased East European, particularly Soviet, exports, but a growing inability to increase agricultural output caused growing concern to the governments of the [[COMECON]] block, and a growing dependence on food imported from democratic nations.\n[[File:Line at a gas station, June 15, 1979.jpg|thumb|right|Line at a gas station in Maryland, June 15, 1979.]]\nOn the other hand, export-driven economic development in Asia, especially by the [[Four Asian Tigers]] ([[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]]), resulted in rapid economic transformation and industrialization. Their abundance of cheap labor, combined with educational and other policy reforms, set the foundation for development in the region during the 1970s and beyond.\n\n===Oil crisis===\nEconomically, the 1970s were marked by the [[1970s Energy Crisis|energy crisis]] which peaked in 1973 and 1979 (see [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 oil crisis]]). After the first oil shock in 1973, [[gasoline]] was rationed in many countries. Europe particularly depended on the Middle East for oil; the United States was also affected even though it had its own oil reserves. Many European countries introduced car-free days and weekends. In the United States, customers with a license plate ending in an odd number were only allowed to buy gasoline on odd-numbered days, while even-numbered plate-holders could only purchase gasoline on even-numbered days. The realization that oil reserves were not endless and technological development was not [[sustainable development|sustainable]]{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} without potentially harming the environment ended the belief in limitless progress that had existed since the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} As a result, [[environmentalism|ecological awareness]] rose substantially, which had a major effect on the economy.\n\n==Science and technology==\n{{Main|1970s in science and technology}}\n\n===Science===\nThe 1970s witnessed an explosion in the understanding of solid-state physics, driven by the development of the [[integrated circuit]], and the [[laser]]. [[Stephen Hawking]] developed his theories of [[black holes]] and the boundary-condition of the universe at this period with his theory called [[Hawking radiation]]. The biological sciences greatly advanced, with molecular biology, bacteriology, virology, and genetics achieving their modern forms in this decade. Biodiversity became a cause of major concern as habitat destruction, and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] revolutionized evolutionary thought.\n\n====Space exploration====\nAs the 1960s ended, the United States had made two successful manned [[lunar landing]]s. Many Americans lost interest afterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions. There was also a growing sentiment that the billions of dollars spent on the [[space program]] should be put to other uses. The Moon landings continued through 1972, but the near loss of the [[Apollo&nbsp;13]] mission in April 1970 served to further anti-[[NASA]] feelings. Plans for missions up to [[Apollo 20]] were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and [[Saturn]] hardware was used for the [[Skylab]] space station program in 1973\u20131974, and for the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975. Many of the ambitious projects NASA had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead it would devote most of the decade to the development of the [[Space Shuttle]]. ASTP was the last manned American space flight for the next five years. The year 1979 witnessed the spectacular reentry of Skylab over Australia. NASA had planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late to save it.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s, having failed in their attempt at manned lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972. By then, however, they had already begun [[Salyut programme|Salyut]], the world's first [[space station]] program, which began in 1971. This would have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the [[Soyuz&nbsp;11]] crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of the [[Soyuz 18a]] crew during launch in April 1975. It eventually proved a success, with missions as long as six months being conducted by the end of the decade.\n\nIn terms of unmanned missions, a variety of lunar and [[planetary probe]]s were launched by the US and Soviet programs during the decade. The most successful of these include the Soviet [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod]] program, a series of robotic lunar missions which included the first unmanned [[sample return mission|sample return]] from another world, and the American [[Voyager program|Voyager]]s, which took advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets to visit all of them except [[Pluto]] by the end of the 1980s.\n\nChina entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first [[satellite]], but technological backwardness and limited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration. Japan launched a satellite for the first time in 1972. The [[European Space Agency]] was founded during the decade as well.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Apollo 17 Cernan on moon.jpg|[[Apollo 17]] Astronaut [[Gene Cernan]] becomes the last man on the Moon, December 13, 1972\nFile:Apollo-Soyuz-Test-Program-artist-rendering.jpg|An artist impression of an American [[Apollo spacecraft]] and Soviet [[Soyuz spacecraft]] docking, a propaganda portrait for the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] mission\nFile:Skylab and Earth Limb - GPN-2000-001055.jpg|America's first space station [[Skylab]] in orbit February 8, 1974\nFile:Mars Viking 11h016.png|''[[Viking 1]]'', the first of two spacecraft sent to [[Mars]], takes this picture of the landing site in [[Chryse Planitia]] (1978)\nFile:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|''[[Voyager 1]]'' passing by Jupiter's Great Red Spot February 25, 1979\n</gallery>\n\n====Biology====\n* The first [[Rhytidectomy|face lifts]] were attempted in the 1970s.\n* The first [[MRI]] image was published in 1973.\n* C\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler reported their discovery of how to use hybridoma cells to isolate [[monoclonal antibodies]], effectively beginning the history of monoclonal antibody use in science.\n* [[Carl Woese]] and [[George E.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] caused a move towards smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars, but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars became a significant factor for the first time, and several domestic-built subcompact models entered the market.

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] followed suit two years later, with [[Chrysler]] offering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused by various factors. By 1979, the company was near [[bankruptcy]], and under its new president [[Lee Iacocca]] (who had been fired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout. [[American Motors]] beat out the U.S. [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] to subcompact sized model (the [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]]) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into a partnership with the French automaker [[Renault]] in 1979.\n\nEuropean car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to the need for performance with high fuel efficiency\u2014designs such as the [[Volkswagen Golf]] and Passat, BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, and [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] appeared at the latter half of the decade. Ford Europe, specifically Ford Germany, also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company. The designs of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] became dominant, along with those of Marcello Gandini in Italy. The 1970s also saw the decline and practical failure of the British car industry\u2014a combination of militant strikes and poor quality control effectively halted development at [[British Leyland]], owner of all other British car companies during the 1970s.\n\nThe [[Japanese automobile industry]] flourished during the 1970s, compared to other major auto markets. Japanese vehicles became internationally renowned for their affordability, reliability, and fuel-efficiency, which was very important to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973. Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerized robotic manufacturing techniques and [[lean manufacturing]], contributing to high-efficiency and low production costs. The [[Honda Civic]] was introduced in 1973, and sold well due to its high fuel-efficiency. Other popular compact cars included the [[Toyota Corolla]] and the [[Datsun Sunny]], in addition to other cars from those companies and others such as [[Subaru]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Mazda]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"80px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:1970 Dodge Challenger TransAm.jpg|1970 [[Dodge Challenger]] Trans Am, example of muscle cars in the earlier part of the decade.\nFile:1977 Honda Civic Front.jpg|[[Honda Civic]] sold well throughout the decade.\nFile:1973 Volvo sportwagon.JPG|1973 [[Volvo]] sportwagon.\n</gallery>\n\n==Society==\n\n===Role of women in society===\n[[File:Isabel Martinez de Peron.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]] becomes the first woman President of [[Argentina]] in 1974 and the first woman non-monarch head of state in the [[Western hemisphere]].]]\n[[File:Margaret Thatcher at White House.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]] shortly before becoming the United Kingdom's first woman Prime Minister in 1979. Thatcher's political and economic agenda began the first government committed to [[neoliberalism]].]]\nThe role of women in society was profoundly altered with growing [[feminism]] across the world and with the presence and rise of a significant number of women as heads of state outside monarchies and heads of government in a number of countries across the world during the 1970s, many being the first women to hold such positions. Non-monarch women heads of state and heads of government in this period included [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]] as the first woman President in [[Argentina]] and the first woman non-monarch head of state in the [[Western hemisphere]] in 1974 until being deposed in 1976, [[Elisabeth Domitien]] becomes the first woman Prime Minister of the [[Central African Republic]], [[Indira Gandhi]] continuing as Prime Minister of India until 1977 (and taking office again in 1980), Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] of [[Israel]] and acting Chairman [[Soong Ching-ling]] of the People's Republic of China continuing their leadership from the sixties, [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]] becoming the interim President of [[Bolivia]] beginning from 1979 to 1980, [[Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Portugal in 1979, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979. Both Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher would remain important political figures in the following decade in the 1980s.\n\n===Social movements===\n\n====Anti-war protests====\n[[File:Vietnam War protest in Washington DC April 1971.jpg|thumb|[[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Anti-war protest against the Vietnam War]] in Washington, D.C. on April 24, 1971.]]\nThe [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to]] the [[War in Vietnam]] that began in the 1960s grew exponentially during the early 1970s. One of the best-known anti-war demonstrations was the [[Kent State shootings]]. In 1970, university students were protesting the war and the draft. Riots ensued during the weekend and the National Guard was called in to maintain the peace. However, by 4 May 1970, tensions arose again, and as the crowd grew larger, the National Guard started shooting. Four students were killed and nine injured. This event caused disbelief and shock throughout the country and became a staple of anti-Vietnam demonstrations.\n\n====Environmentalism====\nThe 1970s started a mainstream affirmation of the [[environmentalism|environmental issues]] early activists from the 1960s, such as [[Rachel Carson]] and [[Murray Bookchin]], had warned of. The [[Apollo 11]] mission, which had occurred at the end of the previous decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as an integrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness to preserve nature. On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first [[Earth Day]], in which over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools participated.\n\n====Sexual Revolution====\n{{main|Sexual Revolution}}{{see|Golden Age of Porn|New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre}}\nThe 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existing social taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasingly accepted in the Western world. The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor. Western Europe was in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United States, as [[nudity in film]] and on TV had been gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countries during this time began allowing women to go topless in public places. Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany and Scandinavia. Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws in the 1980s to 1990s.\n\nThe market for adult entertainment in the 1970s was large, and driven in part by the sizable baby boomer population, and the 1972 movie ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'', an X-rated feature, became one of the top-grossing films of the year. ''[[Playboy Magazine]]'' appeared increasingly dull and old-fashioned next to new, more explicit sex-themed magazines such as ''[[Penthouse Magazine]]'' and ''[[Hustler Magazine]]''.\n\nBy the end of the decade, there was an increasing backlash against libertine sexual attitudes, and the event of the [[AIDS epidemic]] helped bring about an end to the Sexual Revolution. Adult movie theaters, which had exploded in numbers during the 1970s and were widely seen as a symptom of urban decay in the US, declined as pornographic movies would largely shift to VHS tapes during the succeeding decade.\n\n====Crime and urban decay====\nCrime rates in the US had been low from the 1940s until the mid-1960s, but began to escalate after 1965 due to a complex of social, economic, and demographic factors. By the 1970s, crime and blighted urban areas were a serious cause of concern, New York City being particularly affected. In 1972, the US Supreme Court ruled capital punishment unconstitutional, then reversed the ruling only four years later. Lax judicial and sentencing practices in the US during the 1960s and 1970s also contributed to high crime rates.\n[[File:Leffler - WomensLib1970 WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|A Women's Liberation march in Washington, D.C., 1970]]\n\n====Feminism====\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nThe Second-Wave Feminist Movement in the United States, which had begun in the 1960s, carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent role within society. The fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (which legalized female [[suffrage]]) in 1970 was commemorated by the Women's Strike for Equality and other protests.\n\n1971 saw [[Erin Pizzey]] establish the world's first domestic violence shelter in [[Chiswick]], London and Pizzey and her colleagues opened further facilities throughout the next few years. This work inspired similar networks of safe houses for female victims of abuse in other countries, with the first shelter in continental Europe opening in [[Amsterdam]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VPPapvrJsTcC&pg=PA262|title=Family Violence|first1=Mildred Daley|last1=Pagelow|first2=Lloyd W.|last2=Pagelow|date=September 18, 1984|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780275916237}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/domestic-violence-refuge-crisis-women-closure-safe-houses|title=Domestic violence refuge provision at crisis point, warn charities|first=Sandra|last=Laville|date=August 3, 2014|website=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nWith the anthology ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'' and other works, such as ''[[Sexual Politics]]'', being published at the start of the decade, feminism started to reach a larger audience than ever before.  In addition, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s 1973 decision of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which constitutionalized the right to an abortion, brought the women's rights movement into the national political spotlight.\n\n[[Gloria Steinem]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Shirley Chisholm]], [[Bella Abzug]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Kate Millet]] and [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], among many others, led the movement for women's equality.\n\nEven musically, the women's movement had its shining moment.  Australian-American singer [[Helen Reddy]], recorded the song \"[[I Am Woman]]\", which became an anthem for the [[women's liberation movement]]. \"I Am Woman\" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and even won Helen her one and only Grammy Award.\n\nMost efforts of the movement, especially aims at social equality and repeal of the remaining oppressive, sexist laws, were successful. Doors of opportunity were more numerous and much further open than before as women gained unheard of success in [[business]], [[politics]], [[education]], [[science]], the [[law]], and even [[homemaker|the home]]. Although most aims of the movement were successful, however, there were some significant failures, most notably the failure to ratify the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]] with only three more states needed to ratify it (efforts to ratify ERA in the unratified states continues to this day and twenty-two states have adopted state ERAs). Also, the [[Gender pay gap|wage gap]] failed to close, but it did become smaller.\n\nThe second wave feminist movement in the United States largely ended in 1982 with the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment, and with new conservative leadership in Washington, D.C..  American women created a brief, but powerful, [[Third-wave feminism|third-wave]] in the early 1990s which addressed [[sexual harassment]] (inspired by the [[Anita Hill]]\u2013[[Clarence Thomas]] [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings of 1991). The results of the movement included a new awareness of such issues among women, and unprecedented numbers of women elected to public office, [[Year of the Woman|particularly the United States Senate]].\n\n====Civil rights====\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s began to fracture in the 1970s, as social groups began defining themselves more by their differences than by their universalities. The Black Nationalist movement grew out of frustrations with the \"non-violent\" strategies of earlier Civil Rights Activists. With the assassinations of both [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]], many Black people were compelled to reject ideas of negotiation and instead embrace isolation. The feminist movement also splintered from a larger push for Civil Rights in the 1970s. The seventies were seen as the \"woman's turn\", though many feminists incorporated civil rights ideals into their movement. A feminist who had inherited the leadership position of the civil rights movement from her husband, [[Coretta Scott King]], as leader of the black movement, called for an end to all discrimination, helping and encouraging the [[Woman's Liberation]] movement, and other movements as well. At the [[National Women's Conference]] in 1977 a minority women's resolution, promoted by King and others, passed to ensure racial equality in the movement's goals. Similarly, the gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election of political figures such as [[Harvey Milk]] to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislation passed and not passed during the decade. Many celebrities, including [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Andy Warhol]], also \"[[Coming out|came out]]\" during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.\n\n====Youth suffrage====\n{{Main|Youth suffrage}}\nThe [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified on July 1, 1971, lowering the voting age for all federal and state elections from 21 years to 18 years. The primary impetus for this change was the fact that young men were being drafted to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] before they were old enough to vote.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe most prominent events and trends in popular culture of the decade (particularly in the [[Anglosphere]]) include:\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|1970s in music}}\n[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The British rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] was one of the most popular and influential bands of the 1970s. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].]]\n[[File:DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg|240px|thumb|[[Pink Floyd]] performing ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', the highest selling album of the 1970s.]]\nDuring the early 1970s, popular music continued to be dominated by musicians who had achieved fame during the 1960s such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Grateful Dead]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. In addition, many newcomer rock groups such as [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] appeared. [[The Beatles]] disbanded in 1970, but each member of the band immediately released a highly successful solo album, and [[Paul McCartney]] especially would remain extremely popular throughout the decade. Singer-songwriters such as [[Elton John]], [[James Taylor]] and [[Jackson Browne]] also came into vogue during the early 1970s.\n\nThe 1970s saw the rapid commercialization of rock music, and by mid-decade there were a spate of bands derisively dubbed \"corporate rock\" due to the notion that they had been created by record labels to produce simplistic, radio-friendly songs that offered cliches rather than meaningful lyrics. Such bands included [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Bread (band)|Bread]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], and [[REO Speedwagon]].\n\n[[Funk]], an offshoot of [[soul music]] with a greater emphasis on beats, and influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], and [[psychedelic rock]], was also very popular. The mid-1970s also saw the rise of [[disco]] music, which dominated during the last half of the decade with bands like the [[Bee Gees]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[ABBA]], [[Village People]], [[Boney M]], [[Donna Summer]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], and others. In response to this, rock music became increasingly hard-edged, with early metal artists like [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Deep Purple]]. [[Minimalism]] also emerged, led by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. This was a break from the intellectual serial music in the tradition of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], which lasted from the early 1900s to 1960s.\n\nExperimental classical music influenced both [[art rock]] and [[progressive rock]] genres with bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Todd Rundgren's Utopia]], [[Supertramp]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[King Crimson]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[Soft Machine]]. [[Hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] also emerged among British bands [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Who]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], and [[Judas Priest]].\nAustralian band [[AC/DC]] also found its hard-rock origins in the early 1970s and its breakthrough in 1979's ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', while popular American rock bands included [[Aerosmith]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[shock rock]]ers [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and guitar-oriented [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Van Halen]]. In Europe, there was a surge of popularity in the early decade for [[glam rock]].\n\n{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=The decade is of course an arbitrary schema itself\u2014time doesn't just execute a neat turn toward the future every ten years. But like a lot of artificial concepts\u2014money, say\u2014the category does take on a reality of its own once people figure out how to put it to work. 'The '60s are over,' a slogan one only began to hear in 1972 or so, mobilized all those eager to believe that idealism had become passe, and once they were mobilized, it had. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an [[elitist]] withdrawal from the messy concert and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in [[FM radio]] and [[album era|album rock]].|source=\u2014[[Robert Christgau]] in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]'' (1981)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/decade.php|title=CG 70s: The Decade|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1980|website=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=April 6, 2019}}</ref>|width=20%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nAfter a successful return to live performing in the late 60s with his [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|TV special]], [[Elvis Presley]] remained popular in [[Las Vegas|Vegas]] and on concert tours throughout the United States until his death in 1977. His 1973 televised concert, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite]]'', aired in over 40 countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the United States, making it one of the most popular concert events of the decade.\n\nThe second half of the decade saw the rise of punk rock, when a spate of fresh, young rock groups playing stripped-down hard rock came to prominence at a time when most of the artists associated with the 1960s to early 1970s were in creative decline. Punk bands included [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[The Ramones]], [[The Talking Heads]], and more.\n\nThe highest-selling album was [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973). It remained on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart for 741 weeks. Electronic instrumental progressive rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like [[Kraftwerk]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Can (band)|Can]], and [[Faust (band)|Faust]] to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy \"[[krautrock]]\", along with the work of [[Brian Eno]] (for a time the keyboard player with [[Roxy Music]]), would be a major influence on subsequent [[synthrock]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Prog>Unterberger, 2002, pp. 1330\u20131.</ref> The mid-1970s saw the rise of [[electronic art music]] musicians such as [[Jean Michel Jarre]], [[Vangelis]], and [[Isao Tomita|Tomita]], who with Brian Eno were a significant influence of the development of [[new-age music]]. Japanese band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] helped to pioneer synthpop, with their [[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|self-titled album]] (in [[1978 in music|1978]]) setting a template with less minimalism and with a strong emphasis on melody, and drawing from a wider range of influences than had been employed by [[Kraftwerk]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|YMO]] also introduced the microprocessor-based [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer|Roland MC-8]] sequencer and [[TR-808]] rhythm machine to popular music.\n\nIn the first half of the 1970s, many jazz musicians from the [[Miles Davis]] school achieved cross-over success through [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] with bands like [[Weather Report]], [[Return to Forever]], [[The Headhunters]] and [[The Mahavishnu Orchestra]] who also influenced this genre and many others. In Germany, [[Manfred Eicher]] started the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label, which quickly made a name for \"chamber jazz\". Towards the end of the decade, [[Jamaica]]n [[reggae]]  music, already popular in the Caribbean and Africa since the early 1970s, became very popular in the U.S. and in Europe, mostly because of reggae superstar and legend [[Bob Marley]]. The mid-1970s saw the reemergence of acoustic jazz with the return of artists like [[Dexter Gordon]] to the US music scene, who, along with a number of other artists, such as trumpet innovators like [[Don Ellis]] and [[Woody Shaw]], who were among the last of the decade's traditionally-oriented acoustic jazz musicians to be signed to major record labels, to receive critical and widespread commercial recognition and multiple Grammy nominations.\n\nThe late 1970s also saw the beginning of [[hip hop music]] with disc jockeys like [[DJ Kool Herc]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]] taking loops from funk and soul records and play them repeatedly at block parties and dance clubs. At the end of the 1970s, popular songs like \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\" by [[Sugarhill Gang]] gave hip hop a wider audience. Hip hop was also influenced by the song \"[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]\" by [[Gil Scott-Heron]].\n\n[[Country music]] also continued to increase in popularity in the 1970s. Between 1977 and 1979, it became more mainstream, particularly with the [[outlaw country|outlaw movement]], led by [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Other artists; such as [[Conway Twitty]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Don Williams]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Dolly Parton]], the [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Crystal Gayle]], and [[Barbara Mandrell]]; all scored hits throughout the 70s which reached both country and pop charts. The genre also saw its golden age of vocal [[duet|duo]]s and [[vocal group|group]]s in this decade; with [[Conway Twitty]] and [[Loretta Lynn]], [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Jim Ed Brown]] and [[Helen Cornelius]], the [[Bellamy Brothers]], the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], the [[Statler Brothers]], [[Dave & Sugar]], and [[The Kendalls]]. The genre also became more involved in [[Hollywood]] toward the end of the decade, with country-themed action films such as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and ''[[Every Which Way But Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'', a trend that continued into the early 80s with ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' and ''[[Bronco Billy]]''.\n\nA major event in music in the early 1970s was the deaths of popular rock stars [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]], all at the age of 27.  Two of popular music's most successful artists from other eras died within eight weeks of each other in 1977.

The movies of the Swedish director [[Ingmar Bergman]] reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1973).\n\n[[Car chase]] movies also became a popular film genre of the 1970s with such films as ''[[Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry]]'' in 1974, and perhaps the genre's most popular film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' in 1977.\n\nAsian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising middle class fantasies and struggles. In the [[Bollywood]] cinema of India, this was epitomized by the movies of Bollywood superhero [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Another Asian touchstone beginning in the early 1970s was [[Hong Kong martial arts film]] which sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts around the world. [[Martial arts film]] reached the peak of its popularity largely in part due to its greatest icon, [[Bruce Lee]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, Hollywood continued the [[New Hollywood]] revolution of the late-1960s with young film-makers. Top-grossing ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) ushered in the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era of filmmaking, though it was eclipsed two years later by the science-fiction film ''[[Star Wars]]'' (1977). ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) single-handedly touched off disco mania in the U.S. ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) was also one of the decade's greatest successes and its first follow-up, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) was also successful for a sequel.\n\n''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' flopped in its 1975 debut, only to reappear as a more-popular midnight show later in the decade. Still in limited release 36 years after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.\n\n''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) was a box office success for the horror genre, inspiring many other so-called \"devil (Satan)\" films like ''[[The Omen]]'' and both of their own sequels.\n\n''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'' (1979) gained high critical praise, winning four Oscars and several other awards. It was an inductee of the 2001 [[National Film Registry]] list.<ref>https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ | accessed 3/18/2018.</ref>\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|1970s in television}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the United Kingdom, colour channels were now available; three stations had begun broadcasting in colour between 1967 and 1969. However, many viewers continued to watch black-and-white television sets for most of the decade, which meant for example that televised [[snooker]] (in which the colour of balls is important) did not reach the heights of its popularity until the 1980s.\n\nNotable dramas included ''[[Play for Today]]'' and ''[[Pennies from Heaven (TV series)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. In police dramas, there was a move towards increasing realism; popular shows included ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', ''[[Z-Cars]]'', ''[[Softly, Softly (television series)|Softly, Softly]]'', and ''[[The Sweeney]]''.\n\nThe [[science fiction]] show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' reached its peak.\n\n1970s UK television featured a mix of traditional and more modern comedy. ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'', ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Dad's Army]]'' had their origins in the [[variety show]] and radio comedy of the first half of the century. Many popular British [[situation comedy|situation comedies]] (sit-coms) were gentle, unchallenging comedies of middle-class life; typical examples were ''[[Terry and June]]'' and ''[[Sykes (TV series)|Sykes]]''. However, the middle-class settings of ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' and ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' contrasted with their anti-establishment theme of people rejecting traditional social norms. A harsher side of society was shown by comedy series like ''[[Porridge (1974 TV series)|Porridge]]'' and ''[[Rising Damp]]'', while sitcoms such as ''[[Mind Your Language]]'', ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]'' and ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' reflected social unease brought about by post-war immigration. [[Spike Milligan]]'s ''[[Q (TV series)|Q]]'' and the still-popular ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' both used surreal comedy, originating from the 1950s ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nThe television information retrieval service [[Teletext]] was initially introduced when the BBC [[Ceefax]] system went live on 23 September 1974.\n\nIn the late 1970s, BBC2's unveiled a new identity, a twin-striped \"2\", which was the first electronically generated symbol and scrolled on and off the screen.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Redd Foxx Demond Wilson Sanford and Son 1972.JPG|thumb|right|Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson from ''Sanford and Son'']]\nAs the 1970s began, the Big Three TV networks were rapidly re-engineering their lineups, noting that existing programs were not attracting the youth audience. Most existing programs still operated on paradigms established in the 1950s, and some shows had literally been on the air since the dawn of TV broadcasting in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Shows that had low ratings or insufficient youth appeal were cancelled as networks scrambled to attract the large [[baby boomer]] audience.\n\nTo reflect the new social trends, television changed dramatically with more urban and edgy settings, and replaced the popular rural/country wholesome look of the 1950s and 1960s, seen as outmoded and unable to connect with young, educated urban audiences. This particular trend was known as the [[rural purge]]. Television was transformed by what became termed as \"social consciousness\" programming, such as ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', which broke down television barriers.\n\nThe women's movement ushered in a slew of programming featuring strong, independent females as central characters. Most notable was ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', which spawned the successful spin-offs ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'', and also resulted in Mary Tyler Moore becoming the first female to head a television production company of her own, [[MTM Enterprises]], which churned out groundbreaking programming in the late 1970s throughout the 1990s. Women were also established portraying action characters in programs like ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', and others.\n\nMinority-centric television programming also featured prominently during the 1970s. Shows featuring [[minorities]] as main characters, such as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[Good Times]]'', and ''[[What's Happening!!]]'' broke down barriers and became very popular. In addition, ''[[Soul Train]]'', the brainchild of [[Don Cornelius]], premiered in 1971 as the [[African-American]] counterpart to ''[[American Bandstand]]'', giving a forum for [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], [[disco]], and future [[rap]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists to gain exposure to American audiences, consumers, music lovers, enthusiasts, and those keen on learning new dance moves.\n\nThe television [[western (genre)|western]], which had been very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, all but died out during the 1970s, with ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' ending their runs. Replacing westerns were police and detective shows, a trend that would last through the 1980s.\n\nTelevision still had its medical shows of the 1970s, however, ''[[Emergency!]]'' was the first popular [[medical drama]] ever to feature both the paramedic program as well as the hospital emergency department, which also encouraged future people in the United States to develop their own paramedic program or hospital emergency department, and acted as an inspiration for many individuals.\n\n1950s nostalgia became a theme in prime time sitcoms with the [[Garry Marshall]]-produced ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its two [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Mork & Mindy]]''.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1970s, \"[[jiggle television]]\"\u2014programs oriented toward sexual gratification and bawdy humor and situations such as ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', and ''[[Three's Company]]''\u2014became popular.\n\n[[Soap opera]]s expanded their audiences beyond [[housewives]] with the rise of ''[[All My Children]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Somerset]]'', and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''; with many extending their episodes from 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n[[Game shows]] such as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Family Feud]]'', and many others saw its golden age on [[Daytime television in the United States|daytime television]]. The height of ''Match Game''{{'}}s popularity occurred between 1973 and 1977, before it was overtaken by ''Family Feud'' in 1978. Television's current longest-running game show, ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', began its run hosted by [[Bob Barker]] in 1972.\n\nAnother influential genre was the television newscast, which built on its initial widespread success in the 1960s.\n\nThe science fiction phenomenon of the late 1970s that began with ''[[Star Wars]]'' went to television with shows such as ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.\n\nVariety shows, a staple of TV programming since the beginning, were also re-engineered to appeal to young viewers. Old standbys such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' were canceled and replaced by hipper programming like ''[[Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]''. ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' also ended its historic 11-year run in 1978. In the end, rising production costs largely did in variety shows.\n\n=====Pay television=====\nAs [[cable television]] became more affordable and accessible by U.S. consumers, the race to bring the silver screen to the small screen commenced with the launch of [[pay television]] services showing premium content.\n\n[[HBO]] launched on November 8, 1972, becoming the nation's first pay-television channel. On September 30, 1975, HBO became the first television network to continuously deliver signals via satellite when it showed the \"[[Thrilla in Manila]]\" boxing-match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]].\n\nStar Channel launched their service offerings nationally in 1973 through the delivery of movies on video tapes for cable providers to broadcast. This proved problematic since the videotapes were often riddled with technical difficulties. Star Channel eventually was linked up to satellite in January 1978. Shortly after, Warner Communications acquired the channel and relaunched it on December 1, 1979, in its current form as [[The Movie Channel]].\n\nMedia giant [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] launched their premium service, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], nationally on July 1, 1976, after a brief, wildly successful test launch on their cable system in [[Dublin, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/corporate-profile-showtime|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120629195653/http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/corporate-profile-showtime|url-status=dead|title=Corporate profile: Showtime - Marketplace.org|date=29 June 2012|archivedate=29 June 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Australia====\nIn 1974, Australian TV tests color transmissions (full-time color comes in 1975).

The game is a cult classic and is still used today, in a wide variety of formats, through emulators and on smart phones.\n* The first commercially available video game console, entitled [[Magnavox Odyssey]], was released in May 24, 1972, created by [[Ralph H. Baer]].\n*[[1974 in video gaming|1974]]: Both ''[[Maze War]]'' (on the [[Imlac PDS-1]] at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in California) and ''[[Spasim]]'' (on PLATO) appeared, pioneering examples of early multiplayer 3D [[first-person shooter]]s.\n* In 1976, [[Mattel]] introduced the first [[handheld electronic game]] with the release of [[Mattel Auto Race]].\n* Then, in 1976, [[William Crowther (computer programmer)|William Crowther]] wrote the first modern text adventure game, [[Colossal Cave Adventure]].\n* [[Apple, Inc.]] ushered in the modern personal computing age with its June 1, 1977, launch of the first mass-produced personal computer, the [[Apple&nbsp;II]]. Although many business-focused personal workstations were available to corporations years earlier, the Apple&nbsp;II has the distinction of being the first to produce personal computers specifically targeted to home users, beating the [[Commodore PET]] and [[Atari 400]] to the market by five months. Its initial price tag was US$4999.99 for the [[CPU]] only.\n* The [[Atari 2600]] was released in October 1977 and was a huge commercial success. It is also credited for being the first gaming console to have a plug-in concept. It was challenged by the [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]] and [[Intellivision]].\n* [[Fairchild Channel F]] from 1976 becomes the first programmable [[ROM cartridge]]-based video game console.\n* The [[Microvision]] was the very first hand-held game console using interchangeable cartridges. It was released by the [[Milton Bradley Company]] in November 1979.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|1970s in sports}}\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], Germany saw swimmer [[Mark Spitz]] set seven World Records and won a record seven gold medals. The [[1976 Summer Olympics]] were held in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada. Brazil won the [[FIFA World Cup 1970|1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico, West Germany won the [[FIFA World Cup 1974|1974 FIFA World Cup]] in West Germany, and Argentina won the [[FIFA World Cup 1978|1978 FIFA World Cup]] in Argentina. The [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] was the first world cup to be televised in color.\n\nOn April 9, 1975, Asia's first professional basketball league, the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA) were played first game at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum|Araneta Coliseum]] in Cubao, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].\n\n====United States====\nThe [[Oakland Athletics]] three-peated at the World Series in [[1972 World Series|1972]]\u2013[[1974 World Series|1974]].\n\nThe [[Cincinnati Reds]] go to the [[World Series]] in [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1975 World Series|1975]], and [[1976 World Series|1976]], led by the [[Big Red Machine]] winning two out of four.\n\nThe [[New York Yankees]] won the World Series in [[1977 World Series|1977]] and [[1978 World Series|1978]] after losing in [[1976 World Series|1976]].\n\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] dominated the decade in the NFL. Steelers were led by [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Chuck Noll]], and the Cowboys were led by [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Tom Landry]], while the [[Miami Dolphins]] became the only team in NFL history to go \"all the way,\" winning the [[Super Bowl]] with an [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|undefeated record]]\u2014a feat that remains unmatched to this day.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia Flyers]] won the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1974 Stanley Cup Finals|1974]] and [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|1975]], a team best remembered as \"The Broad Street Bullies\".\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAs numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|isbn=978-3838311951}}</ref> What started with a few players like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and [[Ken Westerfield]] experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a frisbee, later would become known as playing [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Freestyle Players Hall of Fame Pioneer Class|work=FPA Hall of Fame|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/hall-of-fame/|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}</ref> Organized disc sports, in the 1970s, began with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Formative Years Frisbee Sports|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter2|accessdate=October 3, 2017|date=2017-05-11}}</ref> Disc sports such as freestyle, [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-flying-disc|work=History of the Flying Disc|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|1970s in literature}}\nFiction in the early '70s brought a return to old-fashioned storytelling, especially with [[Erich Segal]]'s ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. The seventies also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Peter De Vries]], who both released poorly received novels at the start of the decade. Racism remained a key literary subject. [[John Updike]] emerged as a major literary figure. Reflections of the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of the decade through the works of [[Joyce Carol Oates]] and [[Wright Morris]]. With the rising cost of hard-cover books and the increasing readership of \"[[genre fiction]]\", the [[paperback]] became a popular medium. Criminal non-fiction also became a popular topic. Irreverence and satire, typified in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', were common literary elements. The horror genre also emerged, and by the late 1970s [[Stephen King]] had become one of the most popular [[genre novelist]]s. The [[postmodern]] author [[Thomas Pynchon]] published his most famous work, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', in 1973.\n\nIn non-fiction, several books related to Nixon and the [[Watergate scandal]] topped the best-selling lists. 1977 brought many high-profile biographical works of literary figures, such as those of [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Agatha Christie]], and [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]].\n\n===Architecture===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width1    = 118\n | width2    = 130\n | footer    =\n | image1    = World Trade Center, New York City - aerial view (March 2001).jpg\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers were the world's tallest buildings from 1972 to 1973.\n | image2    = Sears Tower ss.jpg\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The [[Sears Tower]] became the world's tallest building when completed in 1973.\n}}\n[[File:CN Tower 1976.jpg|100px|thumb|The [[CN Tower]] was completed in 1976, becoming the world's tallest free-standing structure.]]\nArchitecture in the 1970s began as a continuation of styles created by such architects as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Early in the decade, several architects competed to build the tallest building in the world. Of these buildings, the most notable are the [[John Hancock Center]] and [[Sears Tower]] in Chicago, both designed by [[Bruce Graham]] and [[Fazlur Khan]], and the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York by American architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]]. The decade also brought experimentation in geometric design, [[pop-art]], [[postmodernism]], and early [[deconstructivism]].\n\nDesign trends in the 1970s were marked by a backlash against the bright colors and futurism of the 1950s and 1960s and a rise in popularity of dark, earthy tones with extensive use of brown, green, purple, and orange. Wood decor and paneling was integral to 1970s interior design as well, replacing the obsession of the 1950s and 1960s with chrome and aluminum. Darker colors not only reflected the back-to-nature mindset of the decade, but the sluggish world economy with its lowered optimism and expectations for the future.\n\nIn 1974, [[Louis Kahn]]'s last and arguably most famous building, the National Assembly Building of [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]], was completed. The building's use of open spaces and groundbreaking geometry brought rare attention to the small [[South Asia]]n country. [[Hugh Stubbins]]'s [[Citigroup Center|Citicorp Center]] revolutionized the incorporation of solar panels in office buildings. The seventies brought further experimentation in glass and steel construction and geometric design. Chinese architect [[I. M. Pei]]'s [[John Hancock Tower]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], is an example, although like many buildings of the time, the experimentation was flawed and glass panes fell from the fa\u00e7ade. In 1976, the completed [[CN&nbsp;Tower]] in Toronto became the world's tallest free-standing structure on land, an honor it held until 2007. The fact that no taller tower had been built between the construction of the CN Tower and the [[Burj Khalifa]] shows how innovative the architecture and engineering of the structure truly was.\n\nModern architecture was increasingly criticized as the decade went on from the point of view of postmodern architects, such as [[Philip Johnson]], Charles Moore, and [[Michael Graves]], who advocated a return to pre-modern styles of architecture and the incorporation of pop elements as a means of communicating with a broader public. Other architects, such as [[Peter Eisenman]] of the [[New York Five]], advocated the pursuit of form for the sake of form and drew on semiotics theory for support.\n\n\"High Tech\" architecture moved forward as [[Buckminster Fuller]] continued his experiments in [[geodesic domes]], while the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Georges Pompidou Center]], designed by [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Richard Rogers]], which opened in 1977, was a prominent example. As the decade drew to a close, [[Frank Gehry]] broke out in new direction with his own house in Santa Monica, a highly complex structure, half excavated out of an existing bungalow and half cheaply built construction using materials such as chicken wire fencing.\n\n[[Terracotta Army]] figures, dating from 210 BC, were discovered in 1974 by some local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor (Chinese: \u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u9675; pinyin: Q\u00edn Sh\u01d0hu\u00e1ng Ling). In 1978, electrical workers in [[Mexico City]] found the remains of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] in the middle of the city.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1970s in fashion}}\nClothing styles during the 1970s were influenced by outfits seen in popular music groups and in Hollywood films.<ref name=collectorsweekly>[http://www.collectorsweekly.com/1970s \"Time Machine > 1970s\".

Industrialized countries, except Japan, [[1970s recession|experienced an economic recession]] due to [[1973 oil crisis|an oil crisis]] caused by oil embargoes by the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]]. The crisis saw the first instance of [[stagflation]] which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of [[Keynesian]] economic theory with [[neoliberal]] economic theory, with the first [[neoliberal]] governments being created in [[Chile]], where a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] led by [[Augusto Pinochet]] took place in 1973.\n\nNovelist [[Tom Wolfe]] coined the term \"'Me' decade\" in his essay \"[[The 'Me' Decade and the Third Great Awakening]]\", published by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' in August 1976 referring to the 1970s. The term describes a general new attitude of Americans towards [[atomism (social)|atomized]] [[individualism]] and away from [[communitarianism]], in clear contrast with the 1960s.\n\nIn Asia, affairs regarding the [[People's Republic of China]] changed significantly following the recognition of the PRC by the [[United Nations]], the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors.

Political tensions in [[Iran]] exploded with the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, which overthrew the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] and established an [[Islamic republic]] of Iran under the leadership of the [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]].\n\nAfrica saw further [[decolonization]] in the decade, with [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] gaining their independence in 1975 from the [[Portuguese Empire]] after the restoration of democracy in [[Portugal]]. The continent was, however, plagued by endemic military coups, with the long-reigning [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] [[Haile Selassie]] being removed, civil wars and famine.\n\nThe economies of much of the [[developing world]] continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s because of the [[Green Revolution]]. They might have thrived and become stable in the way that Europe recovered after [[World War&nbsp;II]] through the [[Marshall Plan]]; however, their economic growth was slowed by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] but boomed immediately after.\n\n==Politics and wars==\n\n===Wars===\n[[File:DakToVietnam1966.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Vietnam War]] (1955\u20131975)]]\n{{Main|List of wars 1945\u20131989#1970\u20131979}}\nThe most notable wars and/or other conflicts of the decade include:\n*The [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131990)\n** The [[Vietnam War]] came to a close in 1975 with the fall of Saigon and the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. The following year, Vietnam was officially declared reunited.\n** [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] (1979\u20131989) \u2013 Although taking place almost entirely throughout the 1980s, the war officially started on December 27, 1979.\n** [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975\u20132002) \u2013 resulting in intervention by multiple countries on the Marxist and anti-Marxist sides, with [[Cuba]] and [[Mozambique]] supporting the [[Marxist]] faction while [[South Africa]] and [[Zaire]] support the anti-Marxists.\n** [[Ethiopian Civil War]] (1976\u20131991)\n* The [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974)\n* The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971 in [[South Asia]], engaging [[East Pakistan]], [[West Pakistan]], and [[India]]\n**[[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]\n**[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]\n* [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] (Early 20th century\u2013present)\n** [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973) \u2013 the war was launched by [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] against [[Israel]] in October 1973 to recover territories lost by the Arabs in the [[Six-Day War|1967 conflict]]. The Israelis were taken by surprise and suffered heavy losses before they rallied. In the end, they managed to repel the Egyptians (and a simultaneous attack by Syria in the Golan Heights) and crossed the Suez Canal into Egypt proper. In 1978, Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel at [[Camp David]] in the United States, ending outstanding disputes between the two countries. Sadat's actions would lead to his [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|assassination in 1981]].\n* [[The Emergency (India)|Indian emergency]] (1975\u20131977)\n* [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975\u20131990) \u2013 A civil war in the Middle East which at times also involved the PLO and Israel during the early 1980s.\n* [[Western Sahara War]] (1975\u20131991) \u2013 A regional war pinning the rebel [[Polisario Front]] against [[Morocco]] and [[Mauritania]].\n* [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War]] (1978\u20131979) \u2013 the war which was fought between [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]] was based on an [[Expansionism|expansionist]] agenda to annex territory from [[Tanzania]]. The war resulted in the overthrow of [[Idi Amin]]'s regime.\n* The [[Ogaden War]] (1977\u20131978) was another African conflict between [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] over control of the [[Ogaden]] region.\n* The [[Rhodesian Bush War]] (1964-1979)\n\n===International conflicts===\n[[File:1979 Iranian Revolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[1979 Iranian Revolution]]]]\nThe most notable International conflicts of the decade include:\n* Major conflict between capitalist and communist forces in multiple countries, while attempts are made by the Soviet Union and the United States to lessen the chance for conflict, such as both countries endorsing nuclear nonproliferation.\n* In 1976, peaceful student protests in the [[Soweto]] township of [[South Africa]] led to the [[Soweto Uprising]] when more than 700 black school children were killed by South Africa's [[Security Police]].\n* Rise of separatism in the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada. In 1970, radical [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] militants of the ''[[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]]'' (FLQ) kidnapped the Quebec labour minister [[Pierre Laporte]] and British Trade Commissioner [[James Cross]] during the [[October Crisis]], resulting in Laporte being killed, and the enactment of [[martial law]] in Canada under the [[War Measures Act]], resulting in a campaign by the Canadian government which arrests suspected FLQ supporters. The election of the ''[[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' led by [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] in the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada, brings the first political party committed to Quebec independence into power in Quebec. L\u00e9vesque's government pursues an agenda to secede Quebec from Canada by democratic means and strengthen Francophone Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois culture in the late 1970s, such as the controversial [[Charter of the French Language]] more commonly known in Quebec and Canada as \"Bill 101\".\n* [[Martial law]] was declared in the [[Philippines]] on September 21, 1972, by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n* In [[Cambodia]], the communist leader [[Pol Pot]] led a revolution against the American-backed government of [[Lon Nol]]. On April 17, 1975, Pot's forces captured [[Phnom Penh]], the capital, two years after America had halted the bombings of their positions. His communist government, the [[Khmer Rouge]], forced people out of the cities to clear jungles and establish a radical, Marxist agrarian society. Buddhist priests and monks, along with anyone who spoke foreign languages, had any sort of education, or even wore glasses were tortured or killed. As many as 3 million people may have died. Vietnam [[Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia|invaded the country]] at the start of 1979, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge and installing a [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|satellite government]]. This provoked a brief, but furious [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border war with China]] in February of that year.\n* The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 transformed Iran from an autocratic pro-Western monarchy under Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] to a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Islamist]] government under the leadership of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Distrust between the revolutionaries and Western powers led to the [[Iran hostage crisis]] on November 4, 1979, where 66 diplomats, mainly from the United States, were held captive for 444 days.\n* Growing internal tensions take place in [[Yugoslavia]] beginning with the [[Croatian Spring]] movement in 1971 which demands greater decentralization of power to the constituent republics of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's communist ruler [[Joseph Broz Tito]] subdues the Croatian Spring movement and arrests its leaders, but does initiate major constitutional reform resulting in the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]] which decentralized powers to the republics, gave them the official right to separate from Yugoslavia, and weakened the influence of Serbia (Yugoslavia's largest and most populous constituent republic) in the federation by granting significant powers to the Serbian autonomous provinces of [[Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]]. In addition, the 1974 Constitution consolidated Tito's dictatorship by proclaiming him president-for-life. The 1974 Constitution would become resented by Serbs and began a gradual escalation of ethnic tensions.\n\n===Coups===\n[[File:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Haile Selassie]] was overthrown from power in [[Ethiopia]], ending one of the longest-lasting monarchies in world history.]]\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1970\u20131979}}\nThe most prominent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade include:\n* 1970 \u2013 Coup in [[Syria]], led by [[Hafez al-Assad]].\n* 1971 \u2013 [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|Military coup]] in [[Uganda]] led by [[Idi Amin]].\n* 1973 \u2013 [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|Coup d'\u00e9tat in Chile on September 11th]], Salvador Allende was overthrown and killed in a military attack on the presidential palace.

It would ultimately lead to the decolonization of all its colonies, but leave power vacuums that led to civil war in newly independent Lusophone African nations.\n* 1975 - [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[President of Bangladesh]], and almost his entire family was [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassinated]] in the early hours of August 15, 1975, when a group of [[Bangladesh Army]] personnel went to his residence and killed him, during a coup d'\u00e9tat.\n* 1976 \u2013 [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] seizes control of [[Argentina]] in 1976 through a coup sponsored by the Argentine military, establishing himself as a dictator of a [[military junta]] government in the country.\n* 1977 \u2013 Military coup in Pakistan political leaders including Zulfikar Ali Bhutto arrested.

Groups in Europe like the [[Red Brigades]] and the [[Baader-Meinhof]] Gang were responsible for a spate of bombings, kidnappings, and murders. Violence continued in [[Northern Ireland]] and the Middle East. Radical American groups existed as well, such as the Weather Underground and the Symbionese Liberation Army, but they never achieved the size or strength of their European counterparts.\n*On September 6, 1970, the world witnessed the beginnings of modern rebellious fighting in what is today called as [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Skyjack Sunday]]. Palestinian terrorists hijacked four [[airliner]]s and took over 300 people on board as hostage. The hostages were later released, but the planes were blown up.\n\n===Prominent political events===\n'''Worldwide'''\n* [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]\n* The presence and rise of a significant number of women as heads of state and heads of government in a number of countries across the world, many being the first women to hold such positions, such as [[Soong Ching-ling]] continuing as the first Chairwoman of the People's Republic of China until 1972, [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]] as the first woman President in [[Argentina]] in 1974 until being deposed in 1976, [[Elisabeth Domitien]] becomes the first woman Prime Minister of [[Lesotho]], [[Indira Gandhi]] continuing as Prime Minister of India until 1977, [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]] becoming the interim President of [[Bolivia]] beginning from 1979 to 1980, [[Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Portugal in 1979, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n'''Americas'''<br />\n[[File:Nixon-depart.png|thumb|right|Nixon displays the [[V sign|V-for-victory sign]] as he departs the White House after resigning]]\n* United States President [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President on August 9, 1974, while facing charges for impeachment for the [[Watergate scandal]].\n* [[Augusto Pinochet]] rose to power as ruler of [[Chile]] after overthrowing the country's Socialist president [[Salvador Allende]] in 1973 with the assistance of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) of the United States. Pinochet would remain the dictator of Chile until 1990.\n* [[Suriname]] was granted independence from the [[Netherlands]] on November 25, 1975.\n* In [[Guyana]], the Rev. [[Jim Jones]] led several hundred people from the United States to establish a Utopian Marxist commune in the jungle named [[Jonestown]]. Amid allegations of corruption, mental and physical abuse by Jones on his followers, and denying them the right to leave Jonestown, a Congressional committee visited Guyana to investigate in November 1978. They were attacked by Jones' guards, and Congressman [[Leo Ryan]] was killed. The demented Jones then ordered everyone in the commune to commit suicide. The people drank or were forced to drink, cyanide-laced fruit punch. A total of 900 dead were found, including Jones, who had shot himself.\n* [[Greenland]] was granted [[Devolution|self-government]] (or \"[[home rule]]\") within the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] on November 29, 1979.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greenland Takes a Step Towards Autonomy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/independence-day-greenland-takes-a-step-towards-autonomy-a-592880.html|newspaper=Spiegel Online|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=2008-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Greenland Profile - BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18249815|website=bbc.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Europe'''<br />\n[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and Soviet Union leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] sign the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT&nbsp;II treaty]], June 18, 1979, in [[Vienna]], Austria.]]\n\n* [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the Conservative party rose to power in the United Kingdom in 1979, initiating a [[neoliberal]] economic policy of reducing government spending, weakening the power of trade unions, and promoting economic and trade liberalization.\n* [[Francisco Franco]] died after 39 years in power. [[Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]] was crowned king of Spain and called for the reintroduction of democracy. The dictatorship in Spain ended. The first general elections were held in 1977 and [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez]] became [[Prime minister of Spain]] after his Centrist Democratic Union won. The Socialist and Communist parties were legalized. The current Spanish Constitution was signed in 1978.\n* In 1972, [[Erich Honecker]] was chosen to lead [[East Germany]], a role he would fill for the whole of the 1970s and 1980s. The mid-1970s were a time of extreme recession for East Germany, and as a result of the country's higher debts, consumer goods became more and more scarce. If East Germans had enough money to procure a television set, a telephone, or a [[Trabant]] automobile, they were placed on waiting lists which caused them to wait as much as a decade for the item in question.\n* The Soviet Union under the leadership of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], having the largest armed forces and the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, pursued an agenda to lessen tensions with its rival [[superpower]], the United States, for most of the seventies. That policy known as [[d\u00e9tente]] abruptly ended with the [[Soviet-Afghan war|Soviet invasion in Afghanistan]] at the end of 1979. While known as a \"period of stagnation\" in Soviet historiography, the Seventies are largely considered as a sort of a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of the USSR in terms of stability and relative well-being. Nevertheless, hidden inflation continued to increase for the second straight decade, and production consistently fell short of demand in agriculture and consumer goods manufacturing. By the end of the 1970s, signs of social and economic stagnation were becoming very pronounced.\n* [[Enver Hoxha]]'s rule in [[Albania]] was characterized in the 1970s by growing isolation, first from a very public schism with the Soviet Union the decade before, and then by a [[Sino-Albanian Split|split]] in friendly relations with China in 1978. Albania normalized relations with [[Yugoslavia]] in 1971, and attempted trade agreements with other European nations, but was met with vocal disapproval by the United Kingdom and United States.\n* 1978 would become known as the \"Year of Three Popes\". In August, [[Paul&nbsp;VI]], who had ruled since 1963, died. His successor was Cardinal Albino Luciano, who took the name [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul]]. But only 33 days later, he was found dead, and the Catholic Church had to elect another pope. On October 16, Karol Wojty\u0142a, a Polish cardinal, was elected, becoming [[Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]]. He was the first non-Italian pope since 1523.\n\n'''Asia'''<br />\n[[File:Camp David, Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camp David Accords]], 1978]]\n[[File:Nixon and Zhou toast.jpg|thumb|right|Nixon and Zhou toast, 1972]]\n* On September 17, 1978 the [[Camp David Accords]] are signed between [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]]. The Accords led directly to the 1979 [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]]. They also resulted in Sadat and Begin sharing the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize.\n* Major changes in the People's Republic of China. US president [[Richard Nixon]] visited the country in 1972, restoring relations between the two countries, although diplomatic ties were not established until 1979. In 1976, [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] both died, beginning a new era. After the brief rule of Mao's chosen successor [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's paramount leader, and began to shift the country towards market economics and away from ideologically driven policies.\n* In [[Iraq]], [[Saddam Hussein]] began to rise to power by helping to modernize the country. One major initiative was removing the Western monopoly on [[Petroleum|oil]], which later during the high prices of [[1973 oil crisis]] would help Hussein's ambitious plans. On July 16, 1979, he assumed the [[President of Iraq|presidency]] cementing his rise to power. His presidency led to the breaking off of a [[Syria]]n-Iraqi unification, which had been sought under his predecessor [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and would lead to the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] starting in the 1980s.\n* Japan's economic growth surpassed the rest of the world in the 1970s, unseating the United States as the world's foremost industrial power.\n* On April 17, 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]], led by [[Pol Pot]], took over Cambodia's capital [[Phnom Penh]].\n**From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge carried out the [[Cambodian genocide]] that killed nearly two million.\n*On April 13, 1975, the Lebanese Civil War began.\n*1978 Zia ul Haq comes to power\n*1979 Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto hanged in jail\n\n'''Africa'''\n* [[Idi Amin]], President of Uganda from 1971 to 1979, after rising to power in a coup becomes infamous for his brutal dictatorship in [[Uganda]].

Amin initiates the [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War]] in 1978 in alliance with [[Libya]] based on an [[Expansionism|expansionist]] agenda to annex territory from [[Tanzania]] which results in Ugandan defeat and Amin's overthrow in 1979.\n* South African activist [[Steve Biko]] dies in 1977.\n* [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] ruled [[Equatorial Guinea]] as a brutal dictator from 1969 until his overthrow and execution in 1979.\n* [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]], who had ruled the [[Central African Republic]] since 1965, proclaimed himself Emperor Bokasa&nbsp;I and renamed his impoverished country the Central African Empire in 1977.

D\u00e9tente was partially a reaction against the policies of the previous 25 years, which had brought the world dangerously close to nuclear war on several occasions, and because the US was in a weakened position following the failure of the Vietnam War. As part of d\u00e9tente, the US also restored ties with the People's Republic of China, partially as a counterweight against Soviet expansionism.\n\nThe US\u2013Soviet geopolitical rivalry nonetheless continued through the decade, although in a more indirect faction as the two superpowers jockeyed relentlessly for control of smaller countries. American and Soviet intelligence agencies gave funding, training, and material support to insurgent groups, governments, and armies across the globe, each seeking to gain a geopolitical advantage and install friendly governments. Coups, civil wars, and terrorism went on across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also in Europe where a spate of Soviet-backed Marxist terrorist groups were active throughout the decade. Over half the world's population in the 1970s lived under a repressive dictatorship, although nothing exceeded the brutalities of [[Pol Pot]]'s Cambodia in 1975\u201378 and [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]]'s Equatorial Guinea. In 1979, a new wrinkle appeared in the form of Islamic fundamentalism, as the Shia theocracy of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] overthrew the Shah of Iran and declared itself hostile to both Western democracy and godless communism.\n\nPeople were deeply influenced by the rapid pace of societal change and the aspiration for a more egalitarian society in cultures that were long colonized and have an even longer history of hierarchical [[social structure]].\n\nThe [[Green Revolution]] of the late 1960s brought about self-sufficiency in food in many developing economies. At the same time an increasing number of people began to seek urban prosperity over agrarian life. This consequently saw the duality of transition of diverse interaction across social [[communities]] amid increasing information blockade across [[social class]].\n\nOther common global ethos of the 1970s world included increasingly flexible and varied gender roles for women in industrialized societies. More women could enter the work force. However, the gender role of men remained as that of a breadwinner. The period also saw the socioeconomic effect of an ever-increasing number of women entering the non-agrarian economic workforce. The [[Iranian revolution]] also affected global attitudes to and among those of the Muslim faith toward the end of the 1970s.\n\nThe global experience of the cultural transition of the 1970s and an experience of a global [[zeitgeist]] revealed the interdependence of economies since World War&nbsp;II, in a world increasingly polarized between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n==Assassinations and attempts==\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n[[File:King_Faisal_of_Saudi_Arabia_in_1971_(cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]]]]\n\n* King of [[Saudi Arabia]] [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] is assassinated in March 25, 1975 by his half-brother's son, [[Faisal bin Musaid]].\n*[[Arthur Bremer]] plotted to assassinate Governor of Alabama, [[George Wallace]] on May 15, 1972, while Wallace was making a campaign trip in Laurel, Maryland.

As a result, the 1970s adversely distinguished itself from the prosperous postwar period between 1945 and 1973. The oil shocks [[Arab Oil Embargo|of 1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] added to the existing ailments and conjured high inflation throughout much of the world for the rest of the decade. U.S. manufacturing industries began to decline as a result, with the United States running its last trade surplus ({{as of|2009|lc=y}}) in 1975. In contrast, Japan and West Germany experienced economic booms and started overtaking the U.S. as the world's leading manufacturers. In 1970, Japan overtook West Germany to become the world's second-largest economy.<ref name=\"secondecon\" /> Japan would rank as the world's second-largest economy until 1994 when the [[European Economic Area]] (18 countries under a single market) came into effect.\n\nIn the US, the average annual inflation rate from 1900 to 1970 was approximately 2.5%. From 1970\u20131979, however, the average rate was 7.06%, and topped out at 13.29% in December 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inflation and CPI Consumer Price Index 1970\u20131979|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1970-1979/}}</ref> This period is also known for \"[[stagflation]]\", a phenomenon in which inflation and unemployment steadily increased. It led to double-digit interest rates that rose to unprecedented levels (above 12% per year). The prime rate hit 21.5 in December 1980, the highest in history.<ref name=\"'70s 292\"/> A rising cost of housing was reflected in the  average price of a new home in the U.S. The average price of a new home in the U.S. was $23,450 in 1970 up to $68,700 by 1980. By the time of 1980, when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was running for [[1980 United States presidential election|re-election]] against [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[Misery index (economics)|misery index]] (the sum of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate) had reached an all-time high of 21.98%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Misery Index|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/}}</ref> The economic problems of the 1970s would result in a sluggish cynicism replacing the optimistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s and a distrust of government and technology. Faith in government was at an all-time low in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, as exemplified by the low voter turnout in the 1976 United States presidential election.\nThere was also the [[1973\u201374 stock market crash]].\n\nGreat Britain also experienced considerable economic turmoil during the decade as outdated industries proved unable to compete with Japanese and German wares. Labor strikes happened with such frequency as to almost paralyze the country's infrastructure. Following the [[Winter of Discontent]], Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister in 1979 with the purpose of implementing extreme economic reforms.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Soviet-style command economies began showing signs of stagnation, in which successes were persistently dogged by setbacks. The oil shock increased East European, particularly Soviet, exports, but a growing inability to increase agricultural output caused growing concern to the governments of the [[COMECON]] block, and a growing dependence on food imported from democratic nations.\n[[File:Line at a gas station, June 15, 1979.jpg|thumb|right|Line at a gas station in Maryland, June 15, 1979.]]\nOn the other hand, export-driven economic development in Asia, especially by the [[Four Asian Tigers]] ([[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]]), resulted in rapid economic transformation and industrialization. Their abundance of cheap labor, combined with educational and other policy reforms, set the foundation for development in the region during the 1970s and beyond.\n\n===Oil crisis===\nEconomically, the 1970s were marked by the [[1970s Energy Crisis|energy crisis]] which peaked in 1973 and 1979 (see [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 oil crisis]]). After the first oil shock in 1973, [[gasoline]] was rationed in many countries. Europe particularly depended on the Middle East for oil; the United States was also affected even though it had its own oil reserves. Many European countries introduced car-free days and weekends. In the United States, customers with a license plate ending in an odd number were only allowed to buy gasoline on odd-numbered days, while even-numbered plate-holders could only purchase gasoline on even-numbered days. The realization that oil reserves were not endless and technological development was not [[sustainable development|sustainable]]{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} without potentially harming the environment ended the belief in limitless progress that had existed since the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} As a result, [[environmentalism|ecological awareness]] rose substantially, which had a major effect on the economy.\n\n==Science and technology==\n{{Main|1970s in science and technology}}\n\n===Science===\nThe 1970s witnessed an explosion in the understanding of solid-state physics, driven by the development of the [[integrated circuit]], and the [[laser]]. [[Stephen Hawking]] developed his theories of [[black holes]] and the boundary-condition of the universe at this period with his theory called [[Hawking radiation]]. The biological sciences greatly advanced, with molecular biology, bacteriology, virology, and genetics achieving their modern forms in this decade. Biodiversity became a cause of major concern as habitat destruction, and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] revolutionized evolutionary thought.\n\n====Space exploration====\nAs the 1960s ended, the United States had made two successful manned [[lunar landing]]s. Many Americans lost interest afterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions. There was also a growing sentiment that the billions of dollars spent on the [[space program]] should be put to other uses. The Moon landings continued through 1972, but the near loss of the [[Apollo&nbsp;13]] mission in April 1970 served to further anti-[[NASA]] feelings. Plans for missions up to [[Apollo 20]] were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and [[Saturn]] hardware was used for the [[Skylab]] space station program in 1973\u20131974, and for the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975. Many of the ambitious projects NASA had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead it would devote most of the decade to the development of the [[Space Shuttle]]. ASTP was the last manned American space flight for the next five years. The year 1979 witnessed the spectacular reentry of Skylab over Australia. NASA had planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late to save it.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s, having failed in their attempt at manned lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972. By then, however, they had already begun [[Salyut programme|Salyut]], the world's first [[space station]] program, which began in 1971. This would have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the [[Soyuz&nbsp;11]] crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of the [[Soyuz 18a]] crew during launch in April 1975. It eventually proved a success, with missions as long as six months being conducted by the end of the decade.\n\nIn terms of unmanned missions, a variety of lunar and [[planetary probe]]s were launched by the US and Soviet programs during the decade. The most successful of these include the Soviet [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod]] program, a series of robotic lunar missions which included the first unmanned [[sample return mission|sample return]] from another world, and the American [[Voyager program|Voyager]]s, which took advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets to visit all of them except [[Pluto]] by the end of the 1980s.\n\nChina entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first [[satellite]], but technological backwardness and limited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration. Japan launched a satellite for the first time in 1972. The [[European Space Agency]] was founded during the decade as well.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Apollo 17 Cernan on moon.jpg|[[Apollo 17]] Astronaut [[Gene Cernan]] becomes the last man on the Moon, December 13, 1972\nFile:Apollo-Soyuz-Test-Program-artist-rendering.jpg|An artist impression of an American [[Apollo spacecraft]] and Soviet [[Soyuz spacecraft]] docking, a propaganda portrait for the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] mission\nFile:Skylab and Earth Limb - GPN-2000-001055.jpg|America's first space station [[Skylab]] in orbit February 8, 1974\nFile:Mars Viking 11h016.png|''[[Viking 1]]'', the first of two spacecraft sent to [[Mars]], takes this picture of the landing site in [[Chryse Planitia]] (1978)\nFile:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|''[[Voyager 1]]'' passing by Jupiter's Great Red Spot February 25, 1979\n</gallery>\n\n====Biology====\n* The first [[Rhytidectomy|face lifts]] were attempted in the 1970s.\n* The first [[MRI]] image was published in 1973.\n* C\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler reported their discovery of how to use hybridoma cells to isolate [[monoclonal antibodies]], effectively beginning the history of monoclonal antibody use in science.\n* [[Carl Woese]] and [[George E.

The fields of [[generative linguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]] went through a renewed vigor with symbolic modeling of semantic knowledge while the final devastation of the long-standing tradition of [[behaviorism]] came about through the severe criticism of [[B.&nbsp;F.

The trains consisted of [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|British Rail Class 43]] diesel-electric locomotives at either end with [[British Rail Mark 3]] carriages. The trains were built in the United Kingdom by [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]. The high speed trains ran at {{convert|125|mph}} speeding up journeys between towns and cities and is still known as the ''[[InterCity 125]]''.\n\n[[Amtrak]] was formed in the United States in 1971, assuming responsibility for inter-city passenger operations throughout the country. In 1976, [[Conrail]] was formed to take over assets of six bankrupt freight railroads in the northeastern US.\n\n====Automobiles====\nThe 1970s was an era of fuel price increases, rising insurance rates, safety concerns, and emissions controls. The [[1973 oil crisis]] caused a move towards smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars, but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars became a significant factor for the first time, and several domestic-built subcompact models entered the market. American-made cars such as the \"quirky\" [[AMC Gremlin]], the [[jelly bean]] shaped [[AMC Pacer]], and [[Pontiac Firebird]]'s powerful Trans Am \"sum up\" the decade.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hinckley |first=James |last2=Robinson |first2=Jon G. |title=The Big Book of Car Culture: The Armchair Guide to Automotive Americana |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company |year=2005 |page=9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vziU_ZfY-0cC&pg=PA8|isbn=978-0-7603-1965-9}}</ref> [[Muscle car]]s and [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] models faded from favor during the early-1970s.

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] followed suit two years later, with [[Chrysler]] offering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused by various factors. By 1979, the company was near [[bankruptcy]], and under its new president [[Lee Iacocca]] (who had been fired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout. [[American Motors]] beat out the U.S. [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] to subcompact sized model (the [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]]) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into a partnership with the French automaker [[Renault]] in 1979.\n\nEuropean car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to the need for performance with high fuel efficiency\u2014designs such as the [[Volkswagen Golf]] and Passat, BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, and [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] appeared at the latter half of the decade. Ford Europe, specifically Ford Germany, also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company. The designs of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] became dominant, along with those of Marcello Gandini in Italy. The 1970s also saw the decline and practical failure of the British car industry\u2014a combination of militant strikes and poor quality control effectively halted development at [[British Leyland]], owner of all other British car companies during the 1970s.\n\nThe [[Japanese automobile industry]] flourished during the 1970s, compared to other major auto markets. Japanese vehicles became internationally renowned for their affordability, reliability, and fuel-efficiency, which was very important to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973. Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerized robotic manufacturing techniques and [[lean manufacturing]], contributing to high-efficiency and low production costs. The [[Honda Civic]] was introduced in 1973, and sold well due to its high fuel-efficiency. Other popular compact cars included the [[Toyota Corolla]] and the [[Datsun Sunny]], in addition to other cars from those companies and others such as [[Subaru]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Mazda]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"80px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:1970 Dodge Challenger TransAm.jpg|1970 [[Dodge Challenger]] Trans Am, example of muscle cars in the earlier part of the decade.\nFile:1977 Honda Civic Front.jpg|[[Honda Civic]] sold well throughout the decade.\nFile:1973 Volvo sportwagon.JPG|1973 [[Volvo]] sportwagon.\n</gallery>\n\n==Society==\n\n===Role of women in society===\n[[File:Isabel Martinez de Peron.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]] becomes the first woman President of [[Argentina]] in 1974 and the first woman non-monarch head of state in the [[Western hemisphere]].]]\n[[File:Margaret Thatcher at White House.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]] shortly before becoming the United Kingdom's first woman Prime Minister in 1979. Thatcher's political and economic agenda began the first government committed to [[neoliberalism]].]]\nThe role of women in society was profoundly altered with growing [[feminism]] across the world and with the presence and rise of a significant number of women as heads of state outside monarchies and heads of government in a number of countries across the world during the 1970s, many being the first women to hold such positions. Non-monarch women heads of state and heads of government in this period included [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]] as the first woman President in [[Argentina]] and the first woman non-monarch head of state in the [[Western hemisphere]] in 1974 until being deposed in 1976, [[Elisabeth Domitien]] becomes the first woman Prime Minister of the [[Central African Republic]], [[Indira Gandhi]] continuing as Prime Minister of India until 1977 (and taking office again in 1980), Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] of [[Israel]] and acting Chairman [[Soong Ching-ling]] of the People's Republic of China continuing their leadership from the sixties, [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]] becoming the interim President of [[Bolivia]] beginning from 1979 to 1980, [[Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Portugal in 1979, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979. Both Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher would remain important political figures in the following decade in the 1980s.\n\n===Social movements===\n\n====Anti-war protests====\n[[File:Vietnam War protest in Washington DC April 1971.jpg|thumb|[[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Anti-war protest against the Vietnam War]] in Washington, D.C. on April 24, 1971.]]\nThe [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to]] the [[War in Vietnam]] that began in the 1960s grew exponentially during the early 1970s. One of the best-known anti-war demonstrations was the [[Kent State shootings]]. In 1970, university students were protesting the war and the draft. Riots ensued during the weekend and the National Guard was called in to maintain the peace. However, by 4 May 1970, tensions arose again, and as the crowd grew larger, the National Guard started shooting. Four students were killed and nine injured. This event caused disbelief and shock throughout the country and became a staple of anti-Vietnam demonstrations.\n\n====Environmentalism====\nThe 1970s started a mainstream affirmation of the [[environmentalism|environmental issues]] early activists from the 1960s, such as [[Rachel Carson]] and [[Murray Bookchin]], had warned of. The [[Apollo 11]] mission, which had occurred at the end of the previous decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as an integrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness to preserve nature. On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first [[Earth Day]], in which over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools participated.\n\n====Sexual Revolution====\n{{main|Sexual Revolution}}{{see|Golden Age of Porn|New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre}}\nThe 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existing social taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasingly accepted in the Western world. The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor. Western Europe was in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United States, as [[nudity in film]] and on TV had been gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countries during this time began allowing women to go topless in public places. Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany and Scandinavia. Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws in the 1980s to 1990s.\n\nThe market for adult entertainment in the 1970s was large, and driven in part by the sizable baby boomer population, and the 1972 movie ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'', an X-rated feature, became one of the top-grossing films of the year. ''[[Playboy Magazine]]'' appeared increasingly dull and old-fashioned next to new, more explicit sex-themed magazines such as ''[[Penthouse Magazine]]'' and ''[[Hustler Magazine]]''.\n\nBy the end of the decade, there was an increasing backlash against libertine sexual attitudes, and the event of the [[AIDS epidemic]] helped bring about an end to the Sexual Revolution. Adult movie theaters, which had exploded in numbers during the 1970s and were widely seen as a symptom of urban decay in the US, declined as pornographic movies would largely shift to VHS tapes during the succeeding decade.\n\n====Crime and urban decay====\nCrime rates in the US had been low from the 1940s until the mid-1960s, but began to escalate after 1965 due to a complex of social, economic, and demographic factors. By the 1970s, crime and blighted urban areas were a serious cause of concern, New York City being particularly affected. In 1972, the US Supreme Court ruled capital punishment unconstitutional, then reversed the ruling only four years later. Lax judicial and sentencing practices in the US during the 1960s and 1970s also contributed to high crime rates.\n[[File:Leffler - WomensLib1970 WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|A Women's Liberation march in Washington, D.C., 1970]]\n\n====Feminism====\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nThe Second-Wave Feminist Movement in the United States, which had begun in the 1960s, carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent role within society. The fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (which legalized female [[suffrage]]) in 1970 was commemorated by the Women's Strike for Equality and other protests.\n\n1971 saw [[Erin Pizzey]] establish the world's first domestic violence shelter in [[Chiswick]], London and Pizzey and her colleagues opened further facilities throughout the next few years. This work inspired similar networks of safe houses for female victims of abuse in other countries, with the first shelter in continental Europe opening in [[Amsterdam]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VPPapvrJsTcC&pg=PA262|title=Family Violence|first1=Mildred Daley|last1=Pagelow|first2=Lloyd W.|last2=Pagelow|date=September 18, 1984|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780275916237}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/domestic-violence-refuge-crisis-women-closure-safe-houses|title=Domestic violence refuge provision at crisis point, warn charities|first=Sandra|last=Laville|date=August 3, 2014|website=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nWith the anthology ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'' and other works, such as ''[[Sexual Politics]]'', being published at the start of the decade, feminism started to reach a larger audience than ever before.  In addition, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s 1973 decision of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which constitutionalized the right to an abortion, brought the women's rights movement into the national political spotlight.\n\n[[Gloria Steinem]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Shirley Chisholm]], [[Bella Abzug]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Kate Millet]] and [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], among many others, led the movement for women's equality.\n\nEven musically, the women's movement had its shining moment.  Australian-American singer [[Helen Reddy]], recorded the song \"[[I Am Woman]]\", which became an anthem for the [[women's liberation movement]]. \"I Am Woman\" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and even won Helen her one and only Grammy Award.\n\nMost efforts of the movement, especially aims at social equality and repeal of the remaining oppressive, sexist laws, were successful. Doors of opportunity were more numerous and much further open than before as women gained unheard of success in [[business]], [[politics]], [[education]], [[science]], the [[law]], and even [[homemaker|the home]]. Although most aims of the movement were successful, however, there were some significant failures, most notably the failure to ratify the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]] with only three more states needed to ratify it (efforts to ratify ERA in the unratified states continues to this day and twenty-two states have adopted state ERAs). Also, the [[Gender pay gap|wage gap]] failed to close, but it did become smaller.\n\nThe second wave feminist movement in the United States largely ended in 1982 with the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment, and with new conservative leadership in Washington, D.C..  American women created a brief, but powerful, [[Third-wave feminism|third-wave]] in the early 1990s which addressed [[sexual harassment]] (inspired by the [[Anita Hill]]\u2013[[Clarence Thomas]] [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings of 1991). The results of the movement included a new awareness of such issues among women, and unprecedented numbers of women elected to public office, [[Year of the Woman|particularly the United States Senate]].\n\n====Civil rights====\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s began to fracture in the 1970s, as social groups began defining themselves more by their differences than by their universalities. The Black Nationalist movement grew out of frustrations with the \"non-violent\" strategies of earlier Civil Rights Activists. With the assassinations of both [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]], many Black people were compelled to reject ideas of negotiation and instead embrace isolation. The feminist movement also splintered from a larger push for Civil Rights in the 1970s. The seventies were seen as the \"woman's turn\", though many feminists incorporated civil rights ideals into their movement. A feminist who had inherited the leadership position of the civil rights movement from her husband, [[Coretta Scott King]], as leader of the black movement, called for an end to all discrimination, helping and encouraging the [[Woman's Liberation]] movement, and other movements as well. At the [[National Women's Conference]] in 1977 a minority women's resolution, promoted by King and others, passed to ensure racial equality in the movement's goals. Similarly, the gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election of political figures such as [[Harvey Milk]] to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislation passed and not passed during the decade. Many celebrities, including [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Andy Warhol]], also \"[[Coming out|came out]]\" during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.\n\n====Youth suffrage====\n{{Main|Youth suffrage}}\nThe [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified on July 1, 1971, lowering the voting age for all federal and state elections from 21 years to 18 years. The primary impetus for this change was the fact that young men were being drafted to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] before they were old enough to vote.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe most prominent events and trends in popular culture of the decade (particularly in the [[Anglosphere]]) include:\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|1970s in music}}\n[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The British rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] was one of the most popular and influential bands of the 1970s. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].]]\n[[File:DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg|240px|thumb|[[Pink Floyd]] performing ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', the highest selling album of the 1970s.]]\nDuring the early 1970s, popular music continued to be dominated by musicians who had achieved fame during the 1960s such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Grateful Dead]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. In addition, many newcomer rock groups such as [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] appeared. [[The Beatles]] disbanded in 1970, but each member of the band immediately released a highly successful solo album, and [[Paul McCartney]] especially would remain extremely popular throughout the decade. Singer-songwriters such as [[Elton John]], [[James Taylor]] and [[Jackson Browne]] also came into vogue during the early 1970s.\n\nThe 1970s saw the rapid commercialization of rock music, and by mid-decade there were a spate of bands derisively dubbed \"corporate rock\" due to the notion that they had been created by record labels to produce simplistic, radio-friendly songs that offered cliches rather than meaningful lyrics. Such bands included [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Bread (band)|Bread]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], and [[REO Speedwagon]].\n\n[[Funk]], an offshoot of [[soul music]] with a greater emphasis on beats, and influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], and [[psychedelic rock]], was also very popular. The mid-1970s also saw the rise of [[disco]] music, which dominated during the last half of the decade with bands like the [[Bee Gees]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[ABBA]], [[Village People]], [[Boney M]], [[Donna Summer]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], and others. In response to this, rock music became increasingly hard-edged, with early metal artists like [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Deep Purple]]. [[Minimalism]] also emerged, led by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. This was a break from the intellectual serial music in the tradition of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], which lasted from the early 1900s to 1960s.\n\nExperimental classical music influenced both [[art rock]] and [[progressive rock]] genres with bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Todd Rundgren's Utopia]], [[Supertramp]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[King Crimson]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[Soft Machine]]. [[Hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] also emerged among British bands [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Who]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], and [[Judas Priest]].\nAustralian band [[AC/DC]] also found its hard-rock origins in the early 1970s and its breakthrough in 1979's ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', while popular American rock bands included [[Aerosmith]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[shock rock]]ers [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and guitar-oriented [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Van Halen]]. In Europe, there was a surge of popularity in the early decade for [[glam rock]].\n\n{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=The decade is of course an arbitrary schema itself\u2014time doesn't just execute a neat turn toward the future every ten years. But like a lot of artificial concepts\u2014money, say\u2014the category does take on a reality of its own once people figure out how to put it to work. 'The '60s are over,' a slogan one only began to hear in 1972 or so, mobilized all those eager to believe that idealism had become passe, and once they were mobilized, it had. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an [[elitist]] withdrawal from the messy concert and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in [[FM radio]] and [[album era|album rock]].|source=\u2014[[Robert Christgau]] in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]'' (1981)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/decade.php|title=CG 70s: The Decade|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1980|website=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=April 6, 2019}}</ref>|width=20%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}\n\nAfter a successful return to live performing in the late 60s with his [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|TV special]], [[Elvis Presley]] remained popular in [[Las Vegas|Vegas]] and on concert tours throughout the United States until his death in 1977. His 1973 televised concert, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite]]'', aired in over 40 countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the United States, making it one of the most popular concert events of the decade.\n\nThe second half of the decade saw the rise of punk rock, when a spate of fresh, young rock groups playing stripped-down hard rock came to prominence at a time when most of the artists associated with the 1960s to early 1970s were in creative decline. Punk bands included [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[The Ramones]], [[The Talking Heads]], and more.\n\nThe highest-selling album was [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973). It remained on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart for 741 weeks. Electronic instrumental progressive rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like [[Kraftwerk]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Can (band)|Can]], and [[Faust (band)|Faust]] to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy \"[[krautrock]]\", along with the work of [[Brian Eno]] (for a time the keyboard player with [[Roxy Music]]), would be a major influence on subsequent [[synthrock]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Prog>Unterberger, 2002, pp. 1330\u20131.</ref> The mid-1970s saw the rise of [[electronic art music]] musicians such as [[Jean Michel Jarre]], [[Vangelis]], and [[Isao Tomita|Tomita]], who with Brian Eno were a significant influence of the development of [[new-age music]]. Japanese band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] helped to pioneer synthpop, with their [[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|self-titled album]] (in [[1978 in music|1978]]) setting a template with less minimalism and with a strong emphasis on melody, and drawing from a wider range of influences than had been employed by [[Kraftwerk]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|YMO]] also introduced the microprocessor-based [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer|Roland MC-8]] sequencer and [[TR-808]] rhythm machine to popular music.\n\nIn the first half of the 1970s, many jazz musicians from the [[Miles Davis]] school achieved cross-over success through [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] with bands like [[Weather Report]], [[Return to Forever]], [[The Headhunters]] and [[The Mahavishnu Orchestra]] who also influenced this genre and many others. In Germany, [[Manfred Eicher]] started the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label, which quickly made a name for \"chamber jazz\". Towards the end of the decade, [[Jamaica]]n [[reggae]]  music, already popular in the Caribbean and Africa since the early 1970s, became very popular in the U.S. and in Europe, mostly because of reggae superstar and legend [[Bob Marley]]. The mid-1970s saw the reemergence of acoustic jazz with the return of artists like [[Dexter Gordon]] to the US music scene, who, along with a number of other artists, such as trumpet innovators like [[Don Ellis]] and [[Woody Shaw]], who were among the last of the decade's traditionally-oriented acoustic jazz musicians to be signed to major record labels, to receive critical and widespread commercial recognition and multiple Grammy nominations.\n\nThe late 1970s also saw the beginning of [[hip hop music]] with disc jockeys like [[DJ Kool Herc]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]] taking loops from funk and soul records and play them repeatedly at block parties and dance clubs. At the end of the 1970s, popular songs like \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\" by [[Sugarhill Gang]] gave hip hop a wider audience. Hip hop was also influenced by the song \"[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]\" by [[Gil Scott-Heron]].\n\n[[Country music]] also continued to increase in popularity in the 1970s. Between 1977 and 1979, it became more mainstream, particularly with the [[outlaw country|outlaw movement]], led by [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Other artists; such as [[Conway Twitty]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Don Williams]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Dolly Parton]], the [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Crystal Gayle]], and [[Barbara Mandrell]]; all scored hits throughout the 70s which reached both country and pop charts. The genre also saw its golden age of vocal [[duet|duo]]s and [[vocal group|group]]s in this decade; with [[Conway Twitty]] and [[Loretta Lynn]], [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Jim Ed Brown]] and [[Helen Cornelius]], the [[Bellamy Brothers]], the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], the [[Statler Brothers]], [[Dave & Sugar]], and [[The Kendalls]]. The genre also became more involved in [[Hollywood]] toward the end of the decade, with country-themed action films such as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and ''[[Every Which Way But Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'', a trend that continued into the early 80s with ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' and ''[[Bronco Billy]]''.\n\nA major event in music in the early 1970s was the deaths of popular rock stars [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]], all at the age of 27.  Two of popular music's most successful artists from other eras died within eight weeks of each other in 1977. [[Elvis Presley]], the best-selling singer of all time, died on August 16, 1977.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,337778,00.html |journal=Time |first=Jessica |last=Reaves |title=Person of the Week: Elvis Presley |date=August 15, 2002}}</ref> Presley's funeral was held at [[Graceland]], on Thursday, August 18, 1977.

[[German New Wave]] and [[Rainer Fassbinder]]'s existential movies characterized film-making in Germany. The movies of the Swedish director [[Ingmar Bergman]] reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1973).\n\n[[Car chase]] movies also became a popular film genre of the 1970s with such films as ''[[Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry]]'' in 1974, and perhaps the genre's most popular film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' in 1977.\n\nAsian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising middle class fantasies and struggles. In the [[Bollywood]] cinema of India, this was epitomized by the movies of Bollywood superhero [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Another Asian touchstone beginning in the early 1970s was [[Hong Kong martial arts film]] which sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts around the world. [[Martial arts film]] reached the peak of its popularity largely in part due to its greatest icon, [[Bruce Lee]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, Hollywood continued the [[New Hollywood]] revolution of the late-1960s with young film-makers. Top-grossing ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) ushered in the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era of filmmaking, though it was eclipsed two years later by the science-fiction film ''[[Star Wars]]'' (1977). ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) single-handedly touched off disco mania in the U.S. ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) was also one of the decade's greatest successes and its first follow-up, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) was also successful for a sequel.\n\n''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' flopped in its 1975 debut, only to reappear as a more-popular midnight show later in the decade. Still in limited release 36 years after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.\n\n''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) was a box office success for the horror genre, inspiring many other so-called \"devil (Satan)\" films like ''[[The Omen]]'' and both of their own sequels.\n\n''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'' (1979) gained high critical praise, winning four Oscars and several other awards. It was an inductee of the 2001 [[National Film Registry]] list.<ref>https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ | accessed 3/18/2018.</ref>\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|1970s in television}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIn the United Kingdom, colour channels were now available; three stations had begun broadcasting in colour between 1967 and 1969. However, many viewers continued to watch black-and-white television sets for most of the decade, which meant for example that televised [[snooker]] (in which the colour of balls is important) did not reach the heights of its popularity until the 1980s.\n\nNotable dramas included ''[[Play for Today]]'' and ''[[Pennies from Heaven (TV series)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. In police dramas, there was a move towards increasing realism; popular shows included ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', ''[[Z-Cars]]'', ''[[Softly, Softly (television series)|Softly, Softly]]'', and ''[[The Sweeney]]''.\n\nThe [[science fiction]] show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' reached its peak.\n\n1970s UK television featured a mix of traditional and more modern comedy. ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'', ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Dad's Army]]'' had their origins in the [[variety show]] and radio comedy of the first half of the century. Many popular British [[situation comedy|situation comedies]] (sit-coms) were gentle, unchallenging comedies of middle-class life; typical examples were ''[[Terry and June]]'' and ''[[Sykes (TV series)|Sykes]]''. However, the middle-class settings of ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' and ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' contrasted with their anti-establishment theme of people rejecting traditional social norms. A harsher side of society was shown by comedy series like ''[[Porridge (1974 TV series)|Porridge]]'' and ''[[Rising Damp]]'', while sitcoms such as ''[[Mind Your Language]]'', ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]'' and ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' reflected social unease brought about by post-war immigration. [[Spike Milligan]]'s ''[[Q (TV series)|Q]]'' and the still-popular ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' both used surreal comedy, originating from the 1950s ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nThe television information retrieval service [[Teletext]] was initially introduced when the BBC [[Ceefax]] system went live on 23 September 1974.\n\nIn the late 1970s, BBC2's unveiled a new identity, a twin-striped \"2\", which was the first electronically generated symbol and scrolled on and off the screen.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Redd Foxx Demond Wilson Sanford and Son 1972.JPG|thumb|right|Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson from ''Sanford and Son'']]\nAs the 1970s began, the Big Three TV networks were rapidly re-engineering their lineups, noting that existing programs were not attracting the youth audience. Most existing programs still operated on paradigms established in the 1950s, and some shows had literally been on the air since the dawn of TV broadcasting in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Shows that had low ratings or insufficient youth appeal were cancelled as networks scrambled to attract the large [[baby boomer]] audience.\n\nTo reflect the new social trends, television changed dramatically with more urban and edgy settings, and replaced the popular rural/country wholesome look of the 1950s and 1960s, seen as outmoded and unable to connect with young, educated urban audiences. This particular trend was known as the [[rural purge]]. Television was transformed by what became termed as \"social consciousness\" programming, such as ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', which broke down television barriers.\n\nThe women's movement ushered in a slew of programming featuring strong, independent females as central characters. Most notable was ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', which spawned the successful spin-offs ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'', and also resulted in Mary Tyler Moore becoming the first female to head a television production company of her own, [[MTM Enterprises]], which churned out groundbreaking programming in the late 1970s throughout the 1990s. Women were also established portraying action characters in programs like ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', and others.\n\nMinority-centric television programming also featured prominently during the 1970s. Shows featuring [[minorities]] as main characters, such as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[Good Times]]'', and ''[[What's Happening!!]]'' broke down barriers and became very popular. In addition, ''[[Soul Train]]'', the brainchild of [[Don Cornelius]], premiered in 1971 as the [[African-American]] counterpart to ''[[American Bandstand]]'', giving a forum for [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], [[disco]], and future [[rap]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists to gain exposure to American audiences, consumers, music lovers, enthusiasts, and those keen on learning new dance moves.\n\nThe television [[western (genre)|western]], which had been very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, all but died out during the 1970s, with ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' ending their runs. Replacing westerns were police and detective shows, a trend that would last through the 1980s.\n\nTelevision still had its medical shows of the 1970s, however, ''[[Emergency!]]'' was the first popular [[medical drama]] ever to feature both the paramedic program as well as the hospital emergency department, which also encouraged future people in the United States to develop their own paramedic program or hospital emergency department, and acted as an inspiration for many individuals.\n\n1950s nostalgia became a theme in prime time sitcoms with the [[Garry Marshall]]-produced ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its two [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Mork & Mindy]]''.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1970s, \"[[jiggle television]]\"\u2014programs oriented toward sexual gratification and bawdy humor and situations such as ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', and ''[[Three's Company]]''\u2014became popular.\n\n[[Soap opera]]s expanded their audiences beyond [[housewives]] with the rise of ''[[All My Children]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Somerset]]'', and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''; with many extending their episodes from 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n[[Game shows]] such as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Family Feud]]'', and many others saw its golden age on [[Daytime television in the United States|daytime television]]. The height of ''Match Game''{{'}}s popularity occurred between 1973 and 1977, before it was overtaken by ''Family Feud'' in 1978. Television's current longest-running game show, ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', began its run hosted by [[Bob Barker]] in 1972.\n\nAnother influential genre was the television newscast, which built on its initial widespread success in the 1960s.\n\nThe science fiction phenomenon of the late 1970s that began with ''[[Star Wars]]'' went to television with shows such as ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.\n\nVariety shows, a staple of TV programming since the beginning, were also re-engineered to appeal to young viewers. Old standbys such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' were canceled and replaced by hipper programming like ''[[Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]''. ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' also ended its historic 11-year run in 1978. In the end, rising production costs largely did in variety shows.\n\n=====Pay television=====\nAs [[cable television]] became more affordable and accessible by U.S. consumers, the race to bring the silver screen to the small screen commenced with the launch of [[pay television]] services showing premium content.\n\n[[HBO]] launched on November 8, 1972, becoming the nation's first pay-television channel. On September 30, 1975, HBO became the first television network to continuously deliver signals via satellite when it showed the \"[[Thrilla in Manila]]\" boxing-match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]].\n\nStar Channel launched their service offerings nationally in 1973 through the delivery of movies on video tapes for cable providers to broadcast. This proved problematic since the videotapes were often riddled with technical difficulties. Star Channel eventually was linked up to satellite in January 1978. Shortly after, Warner Communications acquired the channel and relaunched it on December 1, 1979, in its current form as [[The Movie Channel]].\n\nMedia giant [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] launched their premium service, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], nationally on July 1, 1976, after a brief, wildly successful test launch on their cable system in [[Dublin, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/corporate-profile-showtime|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120629195653/http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/corporate-profile-showtime|url-status=dead|title=Corporate profile: Showtime - Marketplace.org|date=29 June 2012|archivedate=29 June 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Australia====\nIn 1974, Australian TV tests color transmissions (full-time color comes in 1975).

Although many business-focused personal workstations were available to corporations years earlier, the Apple&nbsp;II has the distinction of being the first to produce personal computers specifically targeted to home users, beating the [[Commodore PET]] and [[Atari 400]] to the market by five months. Its initial price tag was US$4999.99 for the [[CPU]] only.\n* The [[Atari 2600]] was released in October 1977 and was a huge commercial success. It is also credited for being the first gaming console to have a plug-in concept. It was challenged by the [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]] and [[Intellivision]].\n* [[Fairchild Channel F]] from 1976 becomes the first programmable [[ROM cartridge]]-based video game console.\n* The [[Microvision]] was the very first hand-held game console using interchangeable cartridges. It was released by the [[Milton Bradley Company]] in November 1979.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|1970s in sports}}\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], Germany saw swimmer [[Mark Spitz]] set seven World Records and won a record seven gold medals.

The [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] was the first world cup to be televised in color.\n\nOn April 9, 1975, Asia's first professional basketball league, the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA) were played first game at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum|Araneta Coliseum]] in Cubao, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].\n\n====United States====\nThe [[Oakland Athletics]] three-peated at the World Series in [[1972 World Series|1972]]\u2013[[1974 World Series|1974]].\n\nThe [[Cincinnati Reds]] go to the [[World Series]] in [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1975 World Series|1975]], and [[1976 World Series|1976]], led by the [[Big Red Machine]] winning two out of four.\n\nThe [[New York Yankees]] won the World Series in [[1977 World Series|1977]] and [[1978 World Series|1978]] after losing in [[1976 World Series|1976]].\n\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] dominated the decade in the NFL. Steelers were led by [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Chuck Noll]], and the Cowboys were led by [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Tom Landry]], while the [[Miami Dolphins]] became the only team in NFL history to go \"all the way,\" winning the [[Super Bowl]] with an [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|undefeated record]]\u2014a feat that remains unmatched to this day.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia Flyers]] won the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1974 Stanley Cup Finals|1974]] and [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|1975]], a team best remembered as \"The Broad Street Bullies\".\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAs numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|isbn=978-3838311951}}</ref> What started with a few players like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and [[Ken Westerfield]] experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a frisbee, later would become known as playing [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Freestyle Players Hall of Fame Pioneer Class|work=FPA Hall of Fame|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/hall-of-fame/|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}</ref> Organized disc sports, in the 1970s, began with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Formative Years Frisbee Sports|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter2|accessdate=October 3, 2017|date=2017-05-11}}</ref> Disc sports such as freestyle, [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-flying-disc|work=History of the Flying Disc|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|1970s in literature}}\nFiction in the early '70s brought a return to old-fashioned storytelling, especially with [[Erich Segal]]'s ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. The seventies also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Peter De Vries]], who both released poorly received novels at the start of the decade. Racism remained a key literary subject. [[John Updike]] emerged as a major literary figure. Reflections of the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of the decade through the works of [[Joyce Carol Oates]] and [[Wright Morris]]. With the rising cost of hard-cover books and the increasing readership of \"[[genre fiction]]\", the [[paperback]] became a popular medium. Criminal non-fiction also became a popular topic. Irreverence and satire, typified in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', were common literary elements. The horror genre also emerged, and by the late 1970s [[Stephen King]] had become one of the most popular [[genre novelist]]s. The [[postmodern]] author [[Thomas Pynchon]] published his most famous work, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', in 1973.\n\nIn non-fiction, several books related to Nixon and the [[Watergate scandal]] topped the best-selling lists. 1977 brought many high-profile biographical works of literary figures, such as those of [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Agatha Christie]], and [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]].\n\n===Architecture===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width1    = 118\n | width2    = 130\n | footer    =\n | image1    = World Trade Center, New York City - aerial view (March 2001).jpg\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers were the world's tallest buildings from 1972 to 1973.\n | image2    = Sears Tower ss.jpg\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The [[Sears Tower]] became the world's tallest building when completed in 1973.\n}}\n[[File:CN Tower 1976.jpg|100px|thumb|The [[CN Tower]] was completed in 1976, becoming the world's tallest free-standing structure.]]\nArchitecture in the 1970s began as a continuation of styles created by such architects as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Early in the decade, several architects competed to build the tallest building in the world. Of these buildings, the most notable are the [[John Hancock Center]] and [[Sears Tower]] in Chicago, both designed by [[Bruce Graham]] and [[Fazlur Khan]], and the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York by American architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]]. The decade also brought experimentation in geometric design, [[pop-art]], [[postmodernism]], and early [[deconstructivism]].\n\nDesign trends in the 1970s were marked by a backlash against the bright colors and futurism of the 1950s and 1960s and a rise in popularity of dark, earthy tones with extensive use of brown, green, purple, and orange. Wood decor and paneling was integral to 1970s interior design as well, replacing the obsession of the 1950s and 1960s with chrome and aluminum. Darker colors not only reflected the back-to-nature mindset of the decade, but the sluggish world economy with its lowered optimism and expectations for the future.\n\nIn 1974, [[Louis Kahn]]'s last and arguably most famous building, the National Assembly Building of [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]], was completed. The building's use of open spaces and groundbreaking geometry brought rare attention to the small [[South Asia]]n country. [[Hugh Stubbins]]'s [[Citigroup Center|Citicorp Center]] revolutionized the incorporation of solar panels in office buildings. The seventies brought further experimentation in glass and steel construction and geometric design. Chinese architect [[I. M. Pei]]'s [[John Hancock Tower]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], is an example, although like many buildings of the time, the experimentation was flawed and glass panes fell from the fa\u00e7ade. In 1976, the completed [[CN&nbsp;Tower]] in Toronto became the world's tallest free-standing structure on land, an honor it held until 2007. The fact that no taller tower had been built between the construction of the CN Tower and the [[Burj Khalifa]] shows how innovative the architecture and engineering of the structure truly was.\n\nModern architecture was increasingly criticized as the decade went on from the point of view of postmodern architects, such as [[Philip Johnson]], Charles Moore, and [[Michael Graves]], who advocated a return to pre-modern styles of architecture and the incorporation of pop elements as a means of communicating with a broader public. Other architects, such as [[Peter Eisenman]] of the [[New York Five]], advocated the pursuit of form for the sake of form and drew on semiotics theory for support.\n\n\"High Tech\" architecture moved forward as [[Buckminster Fuller]] continued his experiments in [[geodesic domes]], while the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Georges Pompidou Center]], designed by [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Richard Rogers]], which opened in 1977, was a prominent example. As the decade drew to a close, [[Frank Gehry]] broke out in new direction with his own house in Santa Monica, a highly complex structure, half excavated out of an existing bungalow and half cheaply built construction using materials such as chicken wire fencing.\n\n[[Terracotta Army]] figures, dating from 210 BC, were discovered in 1974 by some local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor (Chinese: \u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u9675; pinyin: Q\u00edn Sh\u01d0hu\u00e1ng Ling). In 1978, electrical workers in [[Mexico City]] found the remains of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] in the middle of the city.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1970s in fashion}}\nClothing styles during the 1970s were influenced by outfits seen in popular music groups and in Hollywood films.<ref name=collectorsweekly>[http://www.collectorsweekly.com/1970s \"Time Machine > 1970s\".

These combined with [[Polo neck|turtle necked shirts]] and flower-prints to form the characteristic 1970s look. In the later part of the decade, this gave way to three-piece suits, in large part because of the movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.\n* [[Sideburn]]s were popular for men, as were [[beard]]s and [[mustaches]] which had been out of fashion since the 19th and early 20th century.\n* Women's hairstyles went from long and straight in the first half of the decade to the feathery cut of [[Farrah Fawcett]].\n* [[Miniskirt]]s and [[minidress]]es were still fashionable in the first half of the decade, but were quickly phased out by the mid-70s in favor of [[hot pants]]. However, miniskirts and minidresses never totally went away, and they made a return to mainstream fashion in the mid-1980s and has remained a fashion staple in the decades since.\n* [[Platform shoes]]\n* [[Leisure suit]]s\n* [[Mohawk hairstyle]] was associated with [[punk subculture]]\n* [[Flokati rug]]s\n* [[Lava lamp]]s\n* [[Papasan chair]]s\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Redhead Beach Bell Bottoms.jpg| [[Bell-bottoms|Bell-bottomed pants]] were especially popular throughout the decade\nFile:Farrah_Fawcett_1977.JPG|The [[Farrah Fawcett]] hairstyle was considered particularly fashionable during the decade\nFile:Lavalamp_red.jpg|[[Lava lamp]]s were especially popular during the decade\n</gallery>\n\n== People ==\n=== Notable leaders ===\nThis is a list of leaders of states and notable organisations.

Usually, these will be recorded in Japanese, and presented by a Japanese presenter. Prior to Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's death, he would host Directs in both English and Japanese, with other languages' presentations being subtitled.\n\nUpon Iwata's death, Nintendo Directs did not receive a worldwide host until 2017, when Yoshiaki Koizumi from [[Nintendo EPD]] took over this role. Since 2018, Koizumi has shared this responsibility with Shinya Takahashi.\n\nSince 2017, the Japanese presenter and any narrators' roles will be dubbed or subtitled for international release, including into English.\n\nPresentations scheduled for around the time of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] are usually produced by [[Nintendo of America]], presented and narrated in English for international broadcast.\n\n==== Japan ====\nIn Japan, Nintendo Directs were most commonly presented by Nintendo's global president [[Satoru Iwata]] until his death in 2015, with [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] now serving as host.\n\nSince 2017, Japan has hosted region-specific \"Indie World\" presentations, focusing on [[Indie game]]s published for Nintendo Switch.\n\nDirects focused on Super Smash Bros. are typically hosted by series creator [[Masahiro Sakurai]].\n\n==== North America ====\nIn North America, the videos were often presented by [[Nintendo of America]] president, [[Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9]], and [[Bill Trinen]].\n\nFor international Directs produced in Japan since 2017, Nintendo of America will air a dubbed version of the Direct in English. Both the presenter and narrator will be dubbed by separate narrators.\n\nSince 2017, Nintendo of America has hosted presentations focusing on [[Indie game]]s published for Nintendo Switch. Between 2017 and 2019, these were branded as \"Nindies Showcase\", before aligning their branding to the Japanese \"Indie World\" banner.\n\n==== Europe and Australia ====\nEuropean Directs were presented by former [[Nintendo of Europe]] president, Satoru Shibata. These presentations were also broadcast in Australia.\n\nAustralia generally only airs the European output, but one Direct was created specifically for the region, broadcast on September 24, 2014. This Direct was hosted by Tom Enoki.\n\nFor international Directs produced in Japan since 2017, Nintendo of Europe airs the original Japanese audio for the presenters, but will use an English dub for the narrated sections. These are then subtitled for broadcast in other languages.\n\nSince 2017, Nintendo of Europe has broadcast presentations focussing on indie games published for Nintendo Switch. From 2017 to 2018, Nintendo of Europe broadcast the American \"Nindies Showcase\" presentations. In 2018 and 2019, Nintendo of Europe hosted its own \"Indie Highlights\" videos. From 2019, they returned to broadcasting Nintendo of America's presentations, now under the \"Indie World\" banner.\n\n==== South Korea ====\nSouth Korea has also aired exclusive Nintendo Directs hosted by Nintendo of Korea president, Hiroyuki Fukuda.\n\n==== Hong Kong and Taiwan ====\nA few Nintendo Direct presentations have been produced specifically for Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\n=== Types of Nintendo Direct presentations ===\nOutside of the general Nintendo Direct presentations, which cover a range of titles, there are also Directs centred around specific titles or series. These are usually presented by the producer or director of the game or series, or employ a narrator.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Nintendo Direct presentation types\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | Logo\n! scope=\"col\" | Duration\n! scope=\"col\" | Content\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Nintendo Direct\n|[[File:Nintendo Direct logo.svg|alt=Nintendo Direct Presentation logo|center|140x140px]]\n| 25\u201350 minutes\n| The main type of Nintendo Direct presentation.

Speaking at an annual March financial results briefing just two months prior, Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata stated that the company\u2019s decision was determined by the fact that \u201cdifferent people demand different types of information\u201d, and that the Nintendo Direct platform had established itself to the point that Nintendo would \u201cbe able to deliver [their] messages more appropriately and effectively \u2026 based on the various needs of different groups of people\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/library/events/130425/04.html|title=Financial Results Briefing For Fiscal Year Ended March 2013|date=April 25, 2013|website=[[Nintendo]]}}</ref> Christopher Dring of ''[[GamesIndustry.biz]]'' observed that the last press conference that Nintendo held at E3 in 2012 featured too much of a mix between Nintendo's new hardware for the [[Wii U]] and game announcements. Compared to other press conferences held that year, Nintendo's presentation left little for fans of the company to be excited for. By switching to Nintendo Directs, Dring opined that the company was able to better connect to fans using the Nintendo Direct presentations, made the faces of Nintendo's executives more visible, as well as having Directs outside of the E3 cycle to provide more frequent updates on game and hardware releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-01-12-nintendo-direct-has-transformed-the-companys-relationship-with-its-fans|title=Nintendo Direct has transformed the company's relationship with its fans|last=Dring|first=Christopher|date=January 12, 2018|work=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the stream of the prerecorded broadcast for E3 2013, Nintendo\u2019s website suffered from technical difficulties in the form of overloaded servers, rendering the live video unwatchable for many viewers, and prompting an official apology from Mr. Iwata.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Nintendo/posts/469863129764812|title=Nintendo - Hello everyone this is Satoru Iwata.

Usually, these will be recorded in Japanese, and presented by a Japanese presenter. Prior to Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's death, he would host Directs in both English and Japanese, with other languages' presentations being subtitled.\n\nUpon Iwata's death, Nintendo Directs did not receive a worldwide host until 2017, when Yoshiaki Koizumi from [[Nintendo EPD]] took over this role. Since 2018, Koizumi has shared this responsibility with Shinya Takahashi.\n\nSince 2017, the Japanese presenter and any narrators' roles will be dubbed or subtitled for international release, including into English.\n\nPresentations scheduled for around the time of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] are usually produced by [[Nintendo of America]], presented and narrated in English for international broadcast.\n\n==== Japan ====\nIn Japan, Nintendo Directs were most commonly presented by Nintendo's global president [[Satoru Iwata]] until his death in 2015, with [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] now serving as host.\n\nSince 2017, Japan has hosted region-specific \"Indie World\" presentations, focusing on [[Indie game]]s published for Nintendo Switch.\n\nDirects focused on Super Smash Bros. are typically hosted by series creator [[Masahiro Sakurai]].\n\n==== North America ====\nIn North America, the videos were often presented by [[Nintendo of America]] president, [[Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9]], and [[Bill Trinen]].\n\nFor international Directs produced in Japan since 2017, Nintendo of America will air a dubbed version of the Direct in English. Both the presenter and narrator will be dubbed by separate narrators.\n\nSince 2017, Nintendo of America has hosted presentations focusing on [[Indie game]]s published for Nintendo Switch. Between 2017 and 2019, these were branded as \"Nindies Showcase\", before aligning their branding to the Japanese \"Indie World\" banner.\n\n==== Europe and Australia ====\nEuropean Directs were presented by former [[Nintendo of Europe]] president, Satoru Shibata. These presentations were also broadcast in Australia.\n\nAustralia generally only airs the European output, but one Direct was created specifically for the region, broadcast on September 24, 2014. This Direct was hosted by Tom Enoki.\n\nFor international Directs produced in Japan since 2017, Nintendo of Europe airs the original Japanese audio for the presenters, but will use an English dub for the narrated sections. These are then subtitled for broadcast in other languages.\n\nSince 2017, Nintendo of Europe has broadcast presentations focussing on indie games published for Nintendo Switch. From 2017 to 2018, Nintendo of Europe broadcast the American \"Nindies Showcase\" presentations. In 2018 and 2019, Nintendo of Europe hosted its own \"Indie Highlights\" videos. From 2019, they returned to broadcasting Nintendo of America's presentations, now under the \"Indie World\" banner.\n\n==== South Korea ====\nSouth Korea has also aired exclusive Nintendo Directs hosted by Nintendo of Korea president, Hiroyuki Fukuda.\n\n==== Hong Kong and Taiwan ====\nA few Nintendo Direct presentations have been produced specifically for Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\n=== Types of Nintendo Direct presentations ===\nOutside of the general Nintendo Direct presentations, which cover a range of titles, there are also Directs centred around specific titles or series. These are usually presented by the producer or director of the game or series, or employ a narrator.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Nintendo Direct presentation types\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | Logo\n! scope=\"col\" | Duration\n! scope=\"col\" | Content\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Nintendo Direct\n|[[File:Nintendo Direct logo.svg|alt=Nintendo Direct Presentation logo|center|140x140px]]\n| 25\u201350 minutes\n| The main type of Nintendo Direct presentation.

Speaking at an annual March financial results briefing just two months prior, Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata stated that the company\u2019s decision was determined by the fact that \u201cdifferent people demand different types of information\u201d, and that the Nintendo Direct platform had established itself to the point that Nintendo would \u201cbe able to deliver [their] messages more appropriately and effectively \u2026 based on the various needs of different groups of people\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/library/events/130425/04.html|title=Financial Results Briefing For Fiscal Year Ended March 2013|date=April 25, 2013|website=[[Nintendo]]}}</ref> Christopher Dring of ''[[GamesIndustry.biz]]'' observed that the last press conference that Nintendo held at E3 in 2012 featured too much of a mix between Nintendo's new hardware for the [[Wii U]] and game announcements. Compared to other press conferences held that year, Nintendo's presentation left little for fans of the company to be excited for. By switching to Nintendo Directs, Dring opined that the company was able to better connect to fans using the Nintendo Direct presentations, made the faces of Nintendo's executives more visible, as well as having Directs outside of the E3 cycle to provide more frequent updates on game and hardware releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-01-12-nintendo-direct-has-transformed-the-companys-relationship-with-its-fans|title=Nintendo Direct has transformed the company's relationship with its fans|last=Dring|first=Christopher|date=January 12, 2018|work=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the stream of the prerecorded broadcast for E3 2013, Nintendo\u2019s website suffered from technical difficulties in the form of overloaded servers, rendering the live video unwatchable for many viewers, and prompting an official apology from Mr. Iwata.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Nintendo/posts/469863129764812|title=Nintendo - Hello everyone this is Satoru Iwata.

At first, she went by the name ''Fr\u00e4ulein Unbekannt'' (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity.<ref name=km93/> Later she used the name Tchaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a [[Grand duke#Russian grand dukes|Russian grand duchess]] first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family and those who had known her, including court tutor [[Pierre Gilliard]], said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], identified Anderson as '''Franziska Schanzkowska''', a Polish<!--ref>''I, Anastasia'', pp. 213, 217, 230; Klier and Mingay, p. 105; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 167; Massie, p. 178</ref--> factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 109; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 10, 53</ref>\n\nBetween 1922 and 1968, Anderson lived in Germany and the United States with various supporters and in nursing homes and sanatoria, including at least one asylum. She emigrated to the United States in 1968. Shortly before the expiration of her visa she married history professor Jack Manahan, who was later characterized as \"probably [[Charlottesville]]'s best-loved eccentric\".<ref name=hook>Tucker</ref> Upon her death in 1984, Anderson's body was cremated, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at [[Seeon Abbey|Castle Seeon, Germany]].\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] potato in the [[Soviet Union]], the locations of the bodies of the Tsar, Tsarina, and all five of their children were revealed. Multiple laboratories in different countries confirmed their identity through [[DNA testing]].<ref name=\"coble&rogaev\"/> DNA tests on a lock of Anderson's hair and surviving medical samples of her tissue showed that her DNA did not match that of the Romanov remains or that of living relatives of the Romanovs.<ref>Stoneking et al.; Van der Kiste and Hall, p. 174</ref> Instead, Anderson's [[mitochondrial DNA]] matched that of Karl Maucher, a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska.<ref name=stoneking>Stoneking et al.</ref> Most scientists, historians and journalists who have discussed the case accept that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person.<ref>Coble et al.; Gutterman; Massie, p. 249; Sieff; Sykes, p. 75</ref>\n\n==Dalldorf asylum (1920\u20131922)==\nOn 27 February 1920,<ref>Berlin Police report, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 89</ref> a young woman attempted to commit suicide in [[Berlin]] by jumping off a bridge called the [[Bendlerblock|Bendlerbr\u00fccke]] into the [[Landwehrkanal]]. She was rescued by a police sergeant and was admitted to the [[:de:Evangelisches Krankenhaus K\u00f6nigin Elisabeth Herzberge|Elisabeth Hospital]] on [[L\u00fctzowplatz|L\u00fctzowstrasse]]. As she was without papers and refused to identify herself, she was admitted as ''Fr\u00e4ulein Unbekannt'' (\"Miss Unknown\") to a mental hospital in Dalldorf (now [[Wittenau]], in [[Reinickendorf]]), where she remained for the next two years.<ref name=km93>Klier and Mingay, p. 93; Berlin Police report, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 89</ref> The unknown patient had scars on her head and body<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 82\u201384; Massie, p. 163</ref> and spoke German with an accent described as \"Russian\" by medical staff.<ref>Nurse Erna Buchholz and Dr Bonhoeffer quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\nIn early 1922, Clara Peuthert, a fellow psychiatric patient, claimed that the unknown woman was [[Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia]], one of the four daughters of [[Tsar Nicholas II]].<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 91; Klier and Mingay, p. 94; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 14</ref> On her release, Peuthert told [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9]] Captain [[Nicholas von Schwabe]] that she had seen Tatiana at Dalldorf.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 91; Klier and Mingay, p. 94, Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 16\u201317</ref> Schwabe visited the asylum and accepted the woman as Tatiana.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 21; Welch, p. 103</ref> Schwabe persuaded other \u00e9migr\u00e9s to visit the unknown woman, including [[Zinaida Tolstoy]], a friend of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]]. Eventually [[Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden]], a former [[lady-in-waiting]] to the Tsarina, visited the asylum with Tolstoy.

The Berlin policeman who handled the case, Detective Inspector Franz Gr\u00fcnberg, thought that Kleist \"may have had ulterior motives, as was hinted at in \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles: if the old conditions should ever be restored in Russia, he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman.\"<ref>Letter from Gr\u00fcnberg to his superior, Councillor Goehrke, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 92</ref>\n\nShe began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 96; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 53; Berlin police records, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 112</ref> choosing \"Anna\" as a short form of \"Anastasia\",<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 98; Klier and Mingay, p. 96</ref> although Peuthert \"described her everywhere as Anastasia\".<ref>Gr\u00fcnberg's notes, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 112</ref> Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances, including Kleist, Peuthert, a poor working-class family called Bachmann, and at Inspector Gr\u00fcnberg's estate at Funkenm\u00fchle, near [[Zossen]].<ref>''I, Anastasia'', pp. 100\u2013112; Klier and Mingay, pp. 97\u201398; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 29\u201363</ref> At Funkenm\u00fchle, Gr\u00fcnberg arranged for the Tsarina's sister, [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine]], to meet Tschaikovsky, but Irene did not recognize her.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 97\u201398; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 51\u201352; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', pp. 103, 106\u2013107; Welch, p. 108</ref> Gr\u00fcnberg also arranged a visit from [[Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia]], but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her, and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter.<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 115; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 64; Klier and Mingay, p. 98; Massie, p. 168</ref> Later, in the 1950s, Cecilie signed a declaration that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia,<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 343; Massie, p. 168; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 116</ref> but Cecilie's family disputed her statement and implied that she was suffering from dementia.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 343</ref>\n\nBy 1925, Tschaikovsky had developed a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she was placed in a succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 84\u201385; Massie, p. 172; Welch, p. 110</ref> She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber [[Aleksei Andreyevich Volkov|Alexei Volkov]]; Anastasia's tutor [[Pierre Gilliard]]; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]].

Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 138</ref> To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though \"the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was.\"<ref>Tatiana Melnik's declaration on oath, 1929, quoted (in negligibly different translations) by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 193; King and Wilson, p. 172 and Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 141\u2013142</ref> In a letter, Melnik wrote: \"Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child.

Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was extracted from the sample and compared with that of the Romanovs and their relatives. It did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones, confirming that Anderson was not related to the Romanovs. However, the sample matched DNA provided by Karl Maucher, a grandson of Franziska Schanzkowska's sister, Gertrude (Schanzkowska) Ellerik, indicating that Karl Maucher and Anna Anderson were maternally related and that Anderson was Schanzkowska.<ref>Godl (1998); Stoneking et al.</ref> Five years after the original testing was done, Dr. Terry Melton of the Department of Anthropology, [[Pennsylvania State University]], stated that the DNA sequence tying Anderson to the Schanzkowski family was \"still unique\", though the database of DNA patterns at the [[Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory]] had grown much larger, leading to \"increased confidence that Anderson was indeed Franziska Schanzkowska\".<ref>Godl (2000a)</ref>\n\nSimilarly, several strands of Anderson's hair, found inside an envelope in a book that had belonged to Anderson's husband, Jack Manahan, were also tested. Mitochondrial DNA from the hair matched Anderson's hospital sample and that of Schanzkowska's relative Karl Maucher, but not the Romanov remains or living relatives of the Romanovs.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 263\u2013266; Massie, p. 246; Stoneking et al.</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\nAlthough communists had killed the entire imperial Romanov family in July 1918, including 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia, for years afterwards [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|communist disinformation]] fed rumors that members of the Tsar's family had survived.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 67; Klier and Mingay, pp. 70\u201371, 82\u201384; Massie, pp. 144\u2013145</ref> The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make [[Romanov impostors|spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov]].<ref>King and Wilson, p. 71; Klier and Mingay, pp. 84, 91; Massie, pp. 144\u2013145</ref>\n\nMost of the impostors were dismissed; however, Anna Anderson's claim persisted.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 2; Massie, pp. 144\u2013162</ref> Books and pamphlets supporting her claims included [[Harriet von Rathlef]]'s book ''Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe'' (''Anastasia, a Woman's Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe''), which was published in Germany and Switzerland in 1928, though it was serialized by the tabloid newspaper ''Berliner Nachtausgabe'' in 1927. This was countered by works such as ''La Fausse Anastasie'' (''The False Anastasia'') by [[Pierre Gilliard]] and Constantin Savitch, published by Payot of Paris in 1929.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 103; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 273</ref> Conflicting testimonies and physical evidence, such as comparisons of facial characteristics, which alternately supported and contradicted Anderson's claim, were used either to bolster or to counter the belief that she was Anastasia.<ref>e.g. King and Wilson, pp. 229\u2013232; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 76</ref> In the absence of any direct documentary proof or solid physical evidence, the question of whether Anderson was Anastasia was for many a matter of personal belief.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 3\u20134; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 83</ref> As Anderson herself said in her own idiomatic English, \"You either believe it or you don't believe it. It doesn't matter. In no anyway whatsoever.\"<ref>Interview on ABC television, broadcast 26 October 1976, quoted in Klier and Mingay, p. 230, and Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 383</ref> The German courts were unable to decide her claim one way or another, and eventually, after 40 years of deliberation, ruled that her claim was \"neither established nor refuted\".<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 139; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 377; Massie, p. 190</ref> Dr. G\u00fcnter von Berenberg-Gossler, attorney for Anderson's opponents in the later years of the legal case, said that during the German trials \"the press were always more interested in reporting her side of the story than the opposing bench's less glamorous perspective; editors often pulled journalists after reporting testimony delivered by her side and ignored the rebuttal, resulting in the public seldom getting a complete picture.\"<ref name=godl2/>\n\nIn 1957, a version of Anderson's story, pieced together by her supporters and interspersed with commentary by [[:de:Roland Krug von Nidda|Roland Krug von Nidda]], was published in Germany under the title ''Ich, Anastasia, Erz\u00e4hle'' (''I, Anastasia, an autobiography'').<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 143; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 395; Massie, p. 294</ref> The book included the \"fantastic tale\"<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 96</ref> that Anastasia escaped from Russia on a farm cart with a man called Alexander Tschaikovsky, whom she married and had a child by, before he was shot dead on a [[Bucharest]] street, and that the child, Alexei, disappeared into an orphanage. Even Anderson's supporters admitted that the details of the supposed escape \"might seem bold inventions even for a dramatist\",<ref name=vN81>Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 81</ref> while her detractors considered \"this barely credible story as a piece of far-fetched romance\".<ref name=vN81/> Other works based on the premise that Anderson was Anastasia, written before the DNA tests, include biographies by Peter Kurth and James Blair Lovell. More recent biographies by [[John Klier]], [[Robert Massie]], and [[Greg King (author)|Greg King]] that describe her as an impostor were written after the DNA tests proved that she was not Anastasia.\n\nAssessments vary as to whether Anderson was a deliberate impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. [[Pierre Gilliard]] denounced Anderson as \"a cunning psychopath\".<ref>Godl (1998); {{citation|author=Gilliard, Pierre|date=25 June 1927|title=L'Histoire d'une imposture|journal=[[L'Illustration]]}} quoted in Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 179</ref> The equation of Anderson with members of the imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, rather than with Anderson herself.

In 1928, the silent film ''[[Clothes Make the Woman]]'' was based very loosely on her story.<ref>Welch, p. 183</ref> In 1953, Marcelle Maurette wrote a play based on Rathlef's and Gilliard's books called ''Anastasia'',<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 132</ref> which toured Europe and America with [[Viveca Lindfors]] in the title role. The play was so successful that in 1956 an English adaptation by [[Guy Bolton]] was made into a film, ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]''.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 268; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 274</ref> The plot revolves around a group of swindlers who attempt to raise money among Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s by pretending that Grand Duchess Anastasia is still alive. A suitable amnesiac, \"Anna\", is groomed by the swindlers to impersonate Anastasia. Anna's origins are unknown and as the play progresses hints are dropped that she could be the real Anastasia, who has lost her memory. The viewer is left to decide whether Anna really is Anastasia.<ref name=times/> Another film was released at the same time, ''[[The Story of Anastasia|Is Anna Anderson Anastasia?]]'' starring [[Lilli Palmer]], which covers much the same ground, but the central character is \"perhaps even more lost, mad and pathetic, but she, too, has moments when she is a woman of presence and dignity\".<ref name=times>{{citation|title=The Problem of Anastasia: Two films on a single pitiful theme|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=20 February 1957|issue=53770|page=11}}</ref>\n\nPlaywright [[Royce Ryton]] wrote ''I Am Who I Am'' about Anna Anderson in 1978.

At first, she went by the name ''Fr\u00e4ulein Unbekannt'' (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity.<ref name=km93/> Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a [[Grand duke#Russian grand dukes|Russian grand duchess]] first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family and those who had known her, including court tutor [[Pierre Gilliard]], said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], identified Anderson as '''Franziska Schanzkowska''', a Polish<!--ref>''I, Anastasia'', pp. 213, 217, 230; Klier and Mingay, p. 105; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 167; Massie, p. 178</ref--> factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 109; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 10, 53</ref>\n\nBetween 1922 and 1968, Anderson lived in Germany and the United States with various supporters and in nursing homes and sanatoria, including at least one asylum. She emigrated to the United States in 1968. Shortly before the expiration of her visa she married history professor Jack Manahan, who was later characterized as \"probably [[Charlottesville]]'s best-loved eccentric\".<ref name=hook>Tucker</ref> Upon her death in 1984, Anderson's body was cremated, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at [[Seeon Abbey|Castle Seeon, Germany]].\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] in the [[Soviet Union]], the locations of the bodies of the Tsar, Tsarina, and all five of their children were revealed. Multiple laboratories in different countries confirmed their identity through [[DNA testing]].<ref name=\"coble&rogaev\"/> DNA tests on a lock of Anderson's hair and surviving medical samples of her tissue showed that her DNA did not match that of the Romanov remains or that of living relatives of the Romanovs.<ref>Stoneking et al.; Van der Kiste and Hall, p. 174</ref> Instead, Anderson's [[mitochondrial DNA]] matched that of Karl Maucher, a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska.<ref name=stoneking>Stoneking et al.</ref> Most scientists, historians and journalists who have discussed the case accept that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person.<ref>Coble et al.; Gutterman; Massie, p. 249; Sieff; Sykes, p. 75</ref>\n\n==Dalldorf asylum (1920\u20131922)==\nOn 27 February 1920,<ref>Berlin Police report, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 89</ref> a young woman attempted to commit suicide in [[Berlin]] by jumping off a bridge called the [[Bendlerblock|Bendlerbr\u00fccke]] into the [[Landwehrkanal]]. She was rescued by a police sergeant and was admitted to the [[:de:Evangelisches Krankenhaus K\u00f6nigin Elisabeth Herzberge|Elisabeth Hospital]] on [[L\u00fctzowplatz|L\u00fctzowstrasse]]. As she was without papers and refused to identify herself, she was admitted as ''Fr\u00e4ulein Unbekannt'' (\"Miss Unknown\") to a mental hospital in Dalldorf (now [[Wittenau]], in [[Reinickendorf]]), where she remained for the next two years.<ref name=km93>Klier and Mingay, p. 93; Berlin Police report, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 89</ref> The unknown patient had scars on her head and body<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 82\u201384; Massie, p. 163</ref> and spoke German with an accent described as \"Russian\" by medical staff.<ref>Nurse Erna Buchholz and Dr Bonhoeffer quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\nIn early 1922, Clara Peuthert, a fellow psychiatric patient, claimed that the unknown woman was [[Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia]], one of the four daughters of [[Tsar Nicholas II]].<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 91; Klier and Mingay, p. 94; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 14</ref> On her release, Peuthert told [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9]] Captain [[Nicholas von Schwabe]] that she had seen Tatiana at Dalldorf.<ref>King and Wilson, p. 91; Klier and Mingay, p. 94, Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 16\u201317</ref> Schwabe visited the asylum and accepted the woman as Tatiana.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 21; Welch, p. 103</ref> Schwabe persuaded other \u00e9migr\u00e9s to visit the unknown woman, including [[Zinaida Tolstoy]], a friend of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]]. Eventually [[Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden]], a former [[lady-in-waiting]] to the Tsarina, visited the asylum with Tolstoy. On seeing the woman, Buxhoeveden declared \"She's too short for Tatiana,\"<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 95; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 25; Massie, p. 163</ref> and left convinced the woman was not a Russian grand duchess.<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 93; Hall, p. 340; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 25</ref> A few days later, the unknown woman noted, \"I did not say I was Tatiana.\"<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 95; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 26</ref>\n\nA nurse at Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed years after the patient's release from the asylum that the woman had told her she was another daughter of the Tsar, [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia]], in the autumn of 1921.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 12</ref> However, the patient herself could not recall the incident.<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 91</ref> Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim,<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 93\u201394, just describes Peuthert's claim.</ref> or weave it into their narrative.<ref>King and Wilson, pp. 88\u201389; Massie, p. 163</ref>\n\n==Germany and Switzerland (1922\u20131927)==\nBy May 1922, the woman was believed by Peuthert, Schwabe, and Tolstoy to be Anastasia, although Buxhoeveden said there was no resemblance.<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 93; Klier and Mingay, p. 95</ref> Nevertheless, the woman was taken out of the asylum and given a room in the Berlin home of Baron Arthur von Kleist, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had been a police chief in [[Russian Poland]] before the fall of the Tsar. The Berlin policeman who handled the case, Detective Inspector Franz Gr\u00fcnberg, thought that Kleist \"may have had ulterior motives, as was hinted at in \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles: if the old conditions should ever be restored in Russia, he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman.\"<ref>Letter from Gr\u00fcnberg to his superior, Councillor Goehrke, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 92</ref>\n\nShe began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky,<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 96; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 53; Berlin police records, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 112</ref> choosing \"Anna\" as a short form of \"Anastasia\",<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 98; Klier and Mingay, p. 96</ref> although Peuthert \"described her everywhere as Anastasia\".<ref>Gr\u00fcnberg's notes, quoted by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 112</ref> Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances, including Kleist, Peuthert, a poor working-class family called Bachmann, and at Inspector Gr\u00fcnberg's estate at Funkenm\u00fchle, near [[Zossen]].<ref>''I, Anastasia'', pp. 100\u2013112; Klier and Mingay, pp. 97\u201398; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 29\u201363</ref> At Funkenm\u00fchle, Gr\u00fcnberg arranged for the Tsarina's sister, [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine]], to meet Tschaikovsky, but Irene did not recognize her.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 97\u201398; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 51\u201352; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', pp. 103, 106\u2013107; Welch, p. 108</ref> Gr\u00fcnberg also arranged a visit from [[Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia]], but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her, and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter.<ref>''I, Anastasia'', p. 115; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 64; Klier and Mingay, p. 98; Massie, p. 168</ref> Later, in the 1950s, Cecilie signed a declaration that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia,<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 343; Massie, p. 168; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 116</ref> but Cecilie's family disputed her statement and implied that she was suffering from dementia.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 343</ref>\n\nBy 1925, Tschaikovsky had developed a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she was placed in a succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 84\u201385; Massie, p. 172; Welch, p. 110</ref> She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber [[Aleksei Andreyevich Volkov|Alexei Volkov]]; Anastasia's tutor [[Pierre Gilliard]]; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]]. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia.<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 99\u2013103; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 99\u2013124; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', pp. 135\u2013169</ref> In March 1926, she convalesced in [[Lugano]] with [[Harriet von Rathlef]] at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, [[Prince Valdemar of Denmark]]. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, [[Herluf Zahle]], while her identity was investigated.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 91; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 102</ref> To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as \"Anastasia Tschaikovsky\", with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 130</ref> After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at [[Oberstdorf]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]] in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.<ref>Klier and Mingay, p. 104; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 130\u2013134; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', pp. 180\u2013187</ref>\n\nAt Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky was visited by Tatiana Melnik, ''n\u00e9e'' Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, the head of the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the daughter of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. [[Eugene Botkin]], who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', p. 138</ref> To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though \"the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was.\"<ref>Tatiana Melnik's declaration on oath, 1929, quoted (in negligibly different translations) by Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 193; King and Wilson, p. 172 and Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 141\u2013142</ref> In a letter, Melnik wrote: \"Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration&nbsp;... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German&nbsp;... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight.\"<ref>Quoted (in two negligibly different translations) by Massie in p. 169 and Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 195</ref> Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state.<ref>Massie, p. 170; Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', pp. 197\u2013198</ref> Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to \"aid the patient's weak memory\"<ref>[[Pierre Gilliard|Gilliard, Pierre]] (1929) ''La Fausse Anastasie'' quoted in Krug von Nidda, p. 198</ref> or as part of a deliberate charade,<ref>Godl (1998)</ref> Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.\n\n==Castle Seeon (1927)==\n[[File:Franziska Schanzkowska.jpg|thumb|right|Franziska Schanzkowska, c. 1913|alt=Young woman wearing an apron and facing forwards]]\n\nIn 1927, under pressure from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off.<ref>Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 151\u2013153; Massie, p. 181</ref> [[Duke of Leuchtenberg|Duke George of Leuchtenberg]], a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at [[Seeon Abbey|Castle Seeon]].<ref>Klier and Mingay, pp. 105\u2013106; Kurth, ''Anastasia'', pp. 151\u2013153; Massie, p. 181</ref> The Tsarina's brother, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia.<ref>Anderson's supporters claimed that Ernest Louis's hostility towards Anderson arose from her allegation that they had last met when he had visited Russia in 1916. Anderson claimed that in the midst of a war between Russia and Germany, Ernest Louis had visited Russia to negotiate a separate peace. Ernest Louis denied the allegation, which if true would have been tantamount to treason. There was no conclusive proof either way.

Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was extracted from the sample and compared with that of the Romanovs and their relatives. It did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones, confirming that Anderson was not related to the Romanovs. However, the sample matched DNA provided by Karl Maucher, a grandson of Franziska Schanzkowska's sister, Gertrude (Schanzkowska) Ellerik, indicating that Karl Maucher and Anna Anderson were maternally related and that Anderson was Schanzkowska.<ref>Godl (1998); Stoneking et al.</ref> Five years after the original testing was done, Dr. Terry Melton of the Department of Anthropology, [[Pennsylvania State University]], stated that the DNA sequence tying Anderson to the Schanzkowski family was \"still unique\", though the database of DNA patterns at the [[Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory]] had grown much larger, leading to \"increased confidence that Anderson was indeed Franziska Schanzkowska\".<ref>Godl (2000a)</ref>\n\nSimilarly, several strands of Anderson's hair, found inside an envelope in a book that had belonged to Anderson's husband, Jack Manahan, were also tested.

Even Anderson's supporters admitted that the details of the supposed escape \"might seem bold inventions even for a dramatist\",<ref name=vN81>Krug von Nidda in ''I, Anastasia'', p. 81</ref> while her detractors considered \"this barely credible story as a piece of far-fetched romance\".<ref name=vN81/> Other works based on the premise that Anderson was Anastasia, written before the DNA tests, include biographies by Peter Kurth and James Blair Lovell. More recent biographies by [[John Klier]], [[Robert Massie]], and [[Greg King (author)|Greg King]] that describe her as an impostor were written after the DNA tests proved that she was not Anastasia.\n\nAssessments vary as to whether Anderson was a deliberate impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends.
