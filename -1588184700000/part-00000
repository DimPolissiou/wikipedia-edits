As part of its duty to conduct scientific research and provide continuous education on the importance of underwater cultural heritage, UNESCO strives to maintain these sites for the enjoyment of current and future generations. The convention may provide a customary framework to help raise awareness and seek to combat the illegal looting and pirating occurring in waters worldwide. As an international body, member states of the convention agree to work towards the preservation of sunken cultural property within their jurisdiction and the high seas.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\nAs an international body, UNESCO continues to work towards the preservation of cultural goods worldwide. Similar to cultural property, only physical goods that are bestowed to future generations may fall into the protection of cultural heritage. It is thus a form of inheritance that allows current and future generations to learn about significant historical events.<ref name = Frigo>Frigo, Manlio. \"Cultural property v. cultural heritage: A 'battle of concepts' in international law?.\" ''International Review of the Red Cross'' 86.854 (2004): 367\u201378 at 369.</ref> Particular to the concept of heritage, international agreements exist under the Council of Europe  such as the 1885 Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage of Europe and the European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. These bodies create broad legal protections around cultural heritage antiquities and sites that are specific to communities worldwide.<ref name = Frigo/> The 1954 Hague Convention was truly the first international convention that attempted to discuss the protection of cultural heritage. In defining property that is considered 'important' and 'valuable' for the good of the people, the issue of protecting cultural property became noticeable to international parties.<ref name = Forrest>Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3\u201311. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p.3</ref> It was only in the 1972 UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, that the term 'cultural heritage' was employed to define the cultural objects to be protected at an international level.<ref>Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3\u201311. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 7</ref> However, due to its expansive definition, the concept of cultural heritage was further revised in the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. They serve to assert the universal value of protecting cultural objects that make up the history and identity of nations.\n\nAlong with the 100-year limitation period, the 2001 UNESCO Convention included the phrase 'cultural, historical or archaeological character' as the qualifying concepts that define underwater cultural heritage.<ref>Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3\u201311. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 8</ref> Because many objects of cultural heritage lose their significance when taken out of water, this convention seeks to ensure the preservation of sunken sites.\n\n==Content==\n\n;Official text\n\nThe official text of the convention sets out the obligations of the states parties in regards to the protection of underwater cultural heritage, defined in Article 1 as:\n\n\"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water, periodically or continuously, for at least 100 years\"<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 1\u20134 define the Convention and its objectives, as well as its relation to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) and the [[law of salvage]].<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 5\u201312 define varying levels of obligations and procedures within the four [[maritime boundary|maritime zones]] ([[Territorial Waters|Territorial Sea]], Contiguous Zone, [[Exclusive Economic Zone]], [[International Seabed Authority|The Area]]) defined by [[UNCLOS]].<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 13\u201321 define further obligations, such as seizing illicitly recovered underwater cultural heritage, cooperating with other state parties, and providing training in [[underwater archaeology]].<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 22\u201335 clarify a number of points relevant to the functional aspects of the Convention, such as the creation of statutory bodies, the settlement of disputes between states parties, and modes of ratification.<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\n;\n;Annex\n\nIn addition to the official text of the convention, an annex of 36 rules governs the practical aspects of activities directed at underwater cultural heritage. State parties are required to ensure that these rules are applied within their territorial sea and contiguous zone,<ref name=Official_Text/>{{rp|Art.7\u20138}} and also that they are adhered to by all nationals and flag vessels.<ref name=Official_Text/>{{rp|Art.16}}\n\nRules 1\u20138 define general principles. Key among these are the complete prohibition of the commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage<ref name=Official_Text/>{{rp|Rule 2}} and the principle that ''[[in situ]]'' preservation should always be considered as a first option.<ref name=Official_Text/>{{rp|Rule 1}} The rules also cover aspects such as project design, conservation, documentation, and reporting.<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\n==International law==\nSituated between admiralty/private maritime law, the law of the sea, and cultural heritage law, the legal framework of underwater cultural heritage law is robust. [[Admiralty law]] is a branch entrenched within private international law relating to the control of maritime practices between private entities.<ref name=\"Dromgoole, S. 2013 p.8\">Dromgoole, S.

Due to the lawless waters along the eastern coasts of Italy, this area was prevalent in pirating. Modern scholars refer to this area as being \"inhabited by wild, uncivilized tribes, who were active marauders of the land and sea, and were constantly reinforced from the interior\".<ref>Heller-Roazen, Daniel. The Enemy of All: Piracy and the Law of Nations. New York: Zone Books, 2009. p. 49</ref> While many dispute the accounts of these events, the marauding nature of pirates may continue to remain true today. Although naval warfare has decreased in popularity, modern pirates are now turning to alternatives to attain their desired treasures.\n\nToday, it is estimated that three million undiscovered shipwrecks and ruins continue to lie at the bottom of the oceans. With the introduction and growing popularity of scuba-diving since the 1940s, the accessibility of such underwater cultural heritage sites are becoming easier to modern pirates in search of new treasure. Studies have already shown that as of 1974, all known shipwrecks off the coasts of Turkey have been exploited by underwater pirates.<ref name=\"unesco.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/underwater/infokit_en/|title=Publication Name|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref> Additionally, Israeli archaeologists estimate that at least 60 per cent of cultural objects that once lay in wrecks and sites have now disappeared without any trace.<ref name=\"unesco.org\"/> Due to the sheer mass of the world's oceans and the inability to monitor all activity that takes place therein, pirates and underwater thieves continue to pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage and cultural property.\n\nIn 2006, the UNESCO Convention was ratified by an additional state, [[Portugal]], needing international protection for the looting of its underwater cultural heritage sites. At least six international treasure hunting organizations had established themselves off the coasts of Portugal to reap the benefits of the nation's coastline after new legislation had allowed for the sale of artifacts collected underwater during archaeological excavations in 1993. Due to this, physical goods may have been looted without proper care, damaging the cultural property that was left behind. Not only did Portugal face a loss of cultural goods, but also possible facts about its historical events.  \n<ref name=\"unesco.org\"/> Today, Portugal is one of the nations that is protected by the body of the UNESCO Convention, wherein the commercial exploitation and dispersion are legally banned, and underwater archeological sites and wrecks are preserved for the future.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAbstaining from signing the 2001 UN Convention, the United States has stipulated that the term \"all traces of human existence\" is too broad, legally and as a mechanism tool for the protection of underwater cultural heritage for the preservation of future generations.<ref>Forrest, C.

Underwater Cultural Heritage''' is a treaty that was adopted on 2 November 2001 by the General Conference of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).<ref name=Official_Text>UNESCO [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/2001-convention/official-text/ \"2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage\"] 2 November 2001</ref> The convention is intended to protect \"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character\" which have been under water for over 100 years.<ref name=Official_Text/>{{rp|Art.1}} This extends to the protection of shipwrecks, sunken cities, prehistoric art work, treasures that may be looted, sacrificial and burial sites, and old ports that cover the oceans' floors.<ref>http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/the-underwater-heritage/</ref> The preservation of underwater cultural heritage is significant as it allows for the retelling of numerous historical events. As part of its duty to conduct scientific research and provide continuous education on the importance of underwater cultural heritage, UNESCO strives to maintain these sites for the enjoyment of current and future generations. The convention may provide a customary framework to help raise awareness and seek to combat the illegal looting and pirating occurring in waters worldwide. As an international body, member states of the convention agree to work towards the preservation of sunken cultural property within their jurisdiction and the high seas.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\nAs an international body, UNESCO continues to work towards the preservation of cultural goods worldwide. Similar to cultural property, only physical goods that are bestowed to future generations may fall into the protection of cultural heritage. It is thus a form of inheritance that allows current and future generations to learn about significant historical events.<ref name = Frigo>Frigo, Manlio. \"Cultural property v. cultural heritage: A 'battle of concepts' in international law?.\" ''International Review of the Red Cross'' 86.854 (2004): 367\u201378 at 369.</ref> Particular to the concept of heritage, international agreements exist under the Council of Europe  such as the 1885 Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage of Europe and the European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. These bodies create broad legal protections around cultural heritage antiquities and sites that are specific to communities worldwide.<ref name = Frigo/> The 1954 Hague Convention was truly the first international convention that attempted to discuss the protection of cultural heritage. In defining property that is considered 'important' and 'valuable' for the good of the people, the issue of protecting cultural property became noticeable to international parties.<ref name = Forrest>Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3\u201311. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p.3</ref> It was only in the 1972 UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, that the term 'cultural heritage' was employed to define the cultural objects to be protected at an international level.<ref>Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3\u201311. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 7</ref> However, due to its expansive definition, the concept of cultural heritage was further revised in the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. They serve to assert the universal value of protecting cultural objects that make up the history and identity of nations.\n\nAlong with the 100-year limitation period, the 2001 UNESCO Convention included the phrase 'cultural, historical or archaeological character' as the qualifying concepts that define underwater cultural heritage.<ref>Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\". ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 31(1), 3\u201311. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 8</ref> Because many objects of cultural heritage lose their significance when taken out of water, this convention seeks to ensure the preservation of sunken sites.\n\n==Content==\n\n;Official text\n\nThe official text of the convention sets out the obligations of the states parties in regards to the protection of underwater cultural heritage, defined in Article 1 as:\n\n\"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water, periodically or continuously, for at least 100 years\"<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 1\u20134 define the Convention and its objectives, as well as its relation to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) and the [[law of salvage]].<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 5\u201312 define varying levels of obligations and procedures within the four [[maritime boundary|maritime zones]] ([[Territorial Waters|Territorial Sea]], Contiguous Zone, [[Exclusive Economic Zone]], [[International Seabed Authority|The Area]]) defined by [[UNCLOS]].<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 13\u201321 define further obligations, such as seizing illicitly recovered underwater cultural heritage, cooperating with other state parties, and providing training in [[underwater archaeology]].<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\nArticles 22\u201335 clarify a number of points relevant to the functional aspects of the Convention, such as the creation of statutory bodies, the settlement of disputes between states parties, and modes of ratification.<ref name=Official_Text/>\n\n;\n;Annex\n\nIn addition to the official text of the convention, an annex of 36 rules governs the practical aspects of activities directed at underwater cultural heritage. State parties are required to ensure that these rules are applied within their territorial sea and contiguous zone,<ref name=Official_Text/>{{rp|Art.7\u20138}} and also that they are adhered to by all nationals and flag vessels.<ref name=Official_Text/>{{rp|Art.16}}\n\nRules 1\u20138 define general principles.

Today, the Swedish ''Vasa'' museum in Stockholm is an emblem of cultural heritage, dedicated to educating public citizens worldwide.\n\nIn 1985, a team of scientists discovered the [[RMS Titanic|''RMS'' Titanic]] in the northern waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada <ref>Dromgoole, S.

Due to the lawless waters along the eastern coasts of Italy, this area was prevalent in pirating. Modern scholars refer to this area as being \"inhabited by wild, uncivilized tribes, who were active marauders of the land and sea, and were constantly reinforced from the interior\".<ref>Heller-Roazen, Daniel. The Enemy of All: Piracy and the Law of Nations. New York: Zone Books, 2009. p. 49</ref> While many dispute the accounts of these events, the marauding nature of pirates may continue to remain true today. Although naval warfare has decreased in popularity, modern pirates are now turning to alternatives to attain their desired treasures.\n\nToday, it is estimated that three million undiscovered shipwrecks and ruins continue to lie at the bottom of the oceans. With the introduction and growing popularity of scuba-diving since the 1940s, the accessibility of such underwater cultural heritage sites are becoming easier to modern pirates in search of new treasure. Studies have already shown that as of 1974, all known shipwrecks off the coasts of Turkey have been exploited by underwater pirates.<ref name=\"unesco.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/underwater/infokit_en/|title=Publication Name|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref> Additionally, Israeli archaeologists estimate that at least 60 per cent of cultural objects that once lay in wrecks and sites have now disappeared without any trace.<ref name=\"unesco.org\"/> Due to the sheer mass of the world's oceans and the inability to monitor all activity that takes place therein, pirates and underwater thieves continue to pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage and cultural property.\n\nIn 2006, the UNESCO Convention was ratified by an additional state, [[Portugal]], needing international protection for the looting of its underwater cultural heritage sites. At least six international treasure hunting organizations had established themselves off the coasts of Portugal to reap the benefits of the nation's coastline after new legislation had allowed for the sale of artifacts collected underwater during archaeological excavations in 1993. Due to this, physical goods may have been looted without proper care, damaging the cultural property that was left behind. Not only did Portugal face a loss of cultural goods, but also possible facts about its historical events.  \n<ref name=\"unesco.org\"/> Today, Portugal is among one of the nations that is protected by the body of the UNESCO Convention, wherein the commercial exploitation and dispersion are legally banned, and underwater archeological sites and wrecks are preserved for the future.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAbstaining from signing the 2001 UN Convention, the United States has stipulated that the term \"all traces of human existence\" is too broad, legally and as a mechanism tool for the protection of underwater cultural heritage for the preservation of future generations.<ref>Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\".

Its original venue was the Casino Rooms in [[Rochester, Kent]] in 1998 and 1999, and then for one year only in 2000 at the Crosbie Cedars Hotel in [[Rosslare Strand|Rosslare]], [[Wexford|County Wexford]]. In 2001, the tournament moved further north to the [[Citywest]] in [[Dublin]]. In 2009, the tournament moved from the Reception Hall at the main Citywest Hotel to the newly completed bigger venue on site, the Citywest Hotel Convention Centre. In 2012, the tournament moved back to the Reception Hall for that year, before returning to the Convention Centre in 2013. When the World Grand Prix was founded in 1998, it replaced the earlier World Pairs tournament which ran from 1995 to 1997.\n\nThe World Grand Prix was sponsored by bookmakers [[Paddy Power]] from 2001 to 2003, before [[Sky Betting and Gaming|Sky Bet]] took over in 2004. The subsidiary Sky Poker was the tournament's sponsor in 2008. In 2010, online gambling company Bodog became the event's title sponsor, while [[PartyPoker.com]] took over as sponsor in 2011. In 2016, [[Unibet]] took over as sponsor, with [[BoyleSports]] sponsoring the event in 2019.\n\nAlthough he has dominated the event with eleven title wins, [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] has been knocked out of the World Grand Prix five times in the first round. In 2001, he lost 2\u20131 to qualifier [[Kevin Painter]], in 2004 by 2\u20130 in sets to [[Andy Callaby]], in 2007 by 2\u20130 in sets to [[Adrian Gray]], in 2015 by 2\u20130 in sets to [[Vincent van der Voort]] and in 2016 by 2\u20131 to [[Steve West (darts player)|Steve West]].\n\nThe current champion is [[Michael van Gerwen]] of the [[Netherlands]], who defeated [[England|English]] [[Dave Chisnall]] 5\u20132 in the final on 13 October 2019 for his fifth World Grand Prix title.\n\n==Tournament format==\nThe tournament is unusual in that it is the only televised event in which players must commence and finish each leg on a double (including the bullseye).\n\nThere have been several different formats for the tournament. The first event in 1998 event was a straight knock-out tournament played in a setplay format with each set being contested over the best of three legs. The following year this changed to the best of five legs per set. Furthermore, a group stage was introduced in 1999, with there only being four seeded players for the event, all of whom reached the semi-finals. In 2000, the tournament reverted to being a straight knock-out and has remained so ever since.\n\nThe double-start format also makes landing a perfect [[nine-dart finish]] even more difficult, as it limits the number of combinations and guarantees that a player must finish on the bullseye (unless they start with one). The first nine-darter in Grand Prix history was completed by [[Brendan Dolan]] in the 2011 semi-final. In 2014, [[James Wade]] (who was coincidentally on the receiving end of Dolan\u2019s nine dart finish) and [[Robert Thornton (darts player)|Robert Thornton]] both hit perfect legs in the same match, the first time this happened in any televised event. On all three occasions, the leg started with a score of 160 (starting on double 20), followed by 180, followed by finishing 161 with treble 20, treble 17, and bullseye.\n\n==World Grand Prix Finals==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Champion <small>(average in final)</small>\n! rowspan=2 | Score\n! rowspan=2 | Runner-up <small>(average in final)</small>\n! colspan=3 | Prize money\n! rowspan=2 | Sponsor\n! rowspan=2 | Venue\n|-\n!

Its original venue was the Casino Rooms in [[Rochester, Kent]] in 1998 and 1999, and then for one year only in 2000 at the Crosbie Cedars Hotel in [[Rosslare Strand|Rosslare]], [[Wexford|County Wexford]]. In 2001, the tournament moved further north to the [[Citywest]] in [[Dublin]]. In 2009, the tournament moved from the Reception Hall at the main Citywest Hotel to the newly completed bigger venue on site, the Citywest Hotel Convention Centre. In 2012, the tournament moved back to the Reception Hall for that year, before returning to the Convention Centre in 2013. When the World Grand Prix was founded in 1998, it replaced the earlier World Pairs tournament which ran from 1995 to 1997.\n\nThe World Grand Prix was sponsored by bookmakers [[Paddy Power]] from 2001 to 2003, before [[Sky Betting and Gaming|Sky Bet]] took over in 2004. The subsidiary Sky Poker was the tournament's sponsor in 2008. In 2010, online gambling company Bodog became the event's title sponsor, while [[PartyPoker.com]] took over as sponsor in 2011. In 2016, [[Unibet]] took over as sponsor, with [[BoyleSports]] sponsoring the event in 2019.\n\nAlthough he has dominated the event with eleven title wins, [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] has been knocked out of the World Grand Prix five times in the first round. In 2001, he lost 2\u20131 to qualifier [[Kevin Painter]], in 2004 by 2\u20130 in sets to [[Andy Callaby]], in 2007 by 2\u20130 in sets to [[Adrian Gray]], in 2015 by 2\u20130 in sets to [[Vincent van der Voort]] and in 2016 by 2\u20131 to [[Steve West (darts player)|Steve West]].\n\nThe current champion is [[Michael van Gerwen]] of the [[Netherlands]], who defeated [[England|English]] [[Dave Chisnall]] 5\u20132 in the final on 13 October 2019 for his fifth World Grand Prix title.\n\n==Tournament format==\nThe tournament is unusual in that it is the only televised event in which players must commence and finish each leg on a double (including the bullseye).\n\nThere have been several different formats for the tournament. The first event in 1998 event was a straight knock-out tournament played in a setplay format with each set being contested over the best of three legs. The following year this changed to the best of five legs per set. Furthermore, a group stage was introduced in 1999, with there only being four seeded players for the event, all of whom reached the semi-finals. In 2000, the tournament reverted to being a straight knock-out and has remained so ever since.\n\nThe double-start format also makes landing a perfect [[nine-dart finish]] even more difficult, as it limits the number of combinations and guarantees that a player must finish on the bullseye (unless they start with one). The first nine-darter in Grand Prix history was completed by [[Brendan Dolan]] in the 2011 semi-final. In 2014, [[James Wade]] (who was coincidentally on the receiving end of Dolan\u2019s nine dart finish) and [[Robert Thornton (darts player)|Robert Thornton]] both hit perfect legs in the same match, the first time this happened in any televised event. On all three occasions, the leg started with a score of 160 (starting on double 20), followed by 180, followed by finishing 161 with treble 20, treble 17, and bullseye.\n\n==World Grand Prix Finals==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Champion <small>(average in final)</small>\n! rowspan=2 | Score\n! rowspan=2 | Runner-up <small>(average in final)</small>\n! colspan=3 | Prize money\n! rowspan=2 | Sponsor\n! rowspan=2 | Venue\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Dispositional affect", "text_new": "'''Dispositional affect''', similar to [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], is a [[Personality type|personality]] trait or overall tendency to respond to situations in stable, predictable ways. This trait is expressed by the tendency to see things in a positive or negative way. People with high positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]]ivity tend to perceive things through \"pink lens\" while people with high negative affectivity tend to perceive things through \"black lens\".<ref name=\"Barsade & Gibson 2007\">Barsade, S.G., & Gibson, D.E. (2007). Why does affect matter in organizations? Academy of Management Perspectives, 36-59.</ref> The level of dispositional affect affects the sensations and behavior immediately and most of the time in unconscious ways, and its effect can be prolonged (between a few weeks to a few months). Research shows that there is a [[correlation]] between dispositional affect (both positive and negative) and important aspects in [[psychology]] and [[social science]], such as personality, [[culture]], [[decision making]], [[negotiation]], [[psychological resilience]], perception of [[career barriers]], and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stressful life events. That is why this topic is important both in [[social psychology]] research and [[organizational psychology]] research.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Conceptual distinctions from emotion and mood===\nBesides dispositional affect, there are other concepts for expressions of emotion such as [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or discrete [[emotion]]s. These concepts are different from dispositional affect though there is a connection among them.\n*Dispositional affect is different from [[emotion]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], by being a personality trait while emotion is a general concept for subjective responses of people to certain situations. Emotion includes both general responses (positive or negative emotion) and specific responses ([[love]], [[anger]], [[hate]], [[fear]], [[jealousy]], [[sadness]] etc. The strength of emotions a person feels can stem from his level of dispositional affect.\n*Dispositional affect is also different from moods since mood relates to general feeling that usually tends to be diffusing and not focused on a specific cause or object. Though mood is specific, it is not a personality trait. Still, [[positive affectivity]] can explain why a person has good mood in general, since positive affectivity means viewing the world in a good light. The same thing is true for [[negative affectivity]], which can explain why a person has bad mood in general, since negative affectivity means viewing the world in a dark light.\n\n===Dimensions===\nIn general, though emotion researchers disagree about the way that emotions and dispositional affect should be classified,<ref>James A. R., &  James M. C. (1999). The Phoenix of Bipolarity: Reply to Watson and Tellegen (1999). ''Psychological Bulletin''. 125, (5), ,611-617</ref> a common classification of emotions assumes that each emotion is a combination of pleasantness (pleasant or unpleasant) and activation (high or low).<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1985\"/> For example, excitement is a combination of pleasantness and high activation, while calmness is a combination of pleasantness and low activation. Dispositional Affect is also a combination of pleasantness and activation. According to this classification, the different combinations of high or low pleasantness and high or low activation create four Quarters.\nIn line with the classification mentioned above, there is a well-known and common model that is being used in organizational psychology research to analyze and classify dispositional affect, which was developed by Watson and Tellegen.<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1985\">Watson, D, & Tellegen, A. (1985). Toward a consensual structure of mood. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 98, 219\u201323</ref> The researchers claim that there are two dimensions of dispositional affect: positive affectivity and negative affectivity and that each person has a certain level of both positive affectivity and negative affectivity. Hence, according to the model and contrary to intuition, positive affectivity does not represent the opposite of negative affectivity, but a different aspect from it.  According to Watson & Tellegen<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1988\">Watson, D., Clark, L. A., & Tellegen, A. (1988). Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 54, 1063\u20131070.</ref> one must regard these quarters as two pivots which determine the positive affectivity and negative affectivity of a person. These two dimensions of dispositional affect are bipolar, distinct and independent, relating to different emotion groups, so that each person can be classified with a positive affectivity and negative affectivity grade.\n*'''Positive affectivity'''  \u2013 describes a person's tendency to be cheerful and energetic, and who experience positive moods, (such as pleasure or well-being), across a variety of situations, perceiving things through a \"pink lens\". Individuals who have low levels of positive affectivity tend to be low energy and sluggish or melancholy. High level of positive affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels energetic and excited, while low level of positive affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels sadness, sluggishness or weariness \".<ref name=\"Barsade & Gibson 2007\"/>\n*'''Negative affectivity'''  \u2013 describes a person's tendency to be distressed and upset, and have a negative view of self over time and across situations, perceiving things through a \"black lens\". It is important to explain that low levels of negative affectivity are perceived as positive traits since they represent individuals who are more calm, serene and relaxed. High levels of negative affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels anger, irritability, fear or nervousness, while low level of negative affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels calm and serene \".<ref name=\"Barsade & Gibson 2007\"/>\n\n==== Relation to Personality Traits ====\nThere has been some debate over how closely related affect and some of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Model of personality]] traits are related. Some maintain that negative affect and positive affect are should be viewed as the same concept as [[Neuroticism]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|Extraversion]] from the Big Five Model, respectively.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thoresen|first=Carl J.|last2=Kaplan|first2=Seth A.|last3=Barsky|first3=Adam P.|last4=Warren|first4=Christopher R.|last5=de Chermont|first5=Kelly|date=2003|title=The Affective Underpinnings of Job Perceptions and Attitudes: A Meta-Analytic Review and Integration.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=129|issue=6|pages=914\u2013945|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.914|pmid=14599288|issn=1939-1455}}</ref> However, other researchers maintain that these concepts are related but should remain distinctly separate as they have traditionally had weak to moderate correlations, around .4.<ref>{{Citation|last=Corr|first=Philip J.|title=Personality Assessment and Theory|date=2016-04-29|work=The Wiley Handbook of Personality Assessment|pages=19\u201330|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-1-119-17348-9|last2=Poropat|first2=Arthur E.|doi=10.1002/9781119173489.ch2}}</ref>\n\n==Measurement==\nOperationalizations for dispositional affect can be measured by [[questionnaire]]s. In [[English language|English]] researchers use the [[Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale]] ('''PANAS''').<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1988\"/> According to the instructions of this questionnaire, the individual is asked to indicate to what extent he or she feels a certain feeling or emotion such as happy, sad, excited, enthusiastic, guilty, distressed, afraid, etc. An individual has to indicate the most appropriate answer to each item (feeling or emotion) on a scale ranging from 1-5 (1- Very slightly or not at all, 5- Extremely). Early mapping of these emotions by the researchers, helps determine the positive affectivity and negative affectivity of the individual. \nAnother advantage that was discovered while developing this questionnaire is that though it is intended for personality analysis, people can respond to the questions according to specific time frames, for example people can indicate the emotions or sensations they feel at this moment, in the past week, or in general. This way we can learn about dispositional affect to a certain situation and not only about dispositional affect as a general personality trait. By responding to the questions about feelings \"in general\" we can learn about positive and negative affectivity as a personality trait. By responding to the questions about feelings \"at this moment\" we can learn about '''situational dispositional affect''' as a response to a certain situation. For example, Rafaeli et al.,<ref>Rafaeli, A., Barron, G. & Haber, K. (2002). The effects of queue structure on attitudes. ''Journal of Service Research', 5(2), 125-139.</ref> showed in their research that waiting in line cause an increase in negative affectivity levels.\n\n==Physical and mental aspects==\n*'''Physical health''' \u2013 When it comes to people with different illness, it is interesting to see that there are differences in the physical health according to the levels of dispositional affect. Individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity, had longer [[Longevity|life span]], reported fewer [[pain]]s and illness symptoms (such as [[blood pressure]]), and were less likely to develop a cold when exposed to a virus compared with individuals who have high levels of negative affectivity, while both had the same [[illness]]. It was also discovered that when it comes to people with chronic diseases that has decent prospects for long-term survival, (such as coronary [[heart disease]]), people may benefit from high levels of positive affectivity. However, when it comes to people with chronic diseases that has short-term prognoses (e.g., metastatic breast cancer) and poor survival chances, high levels of positive affectivity may be detrimental to the health of these individuals, possibly as a consequence of underreporting of symptoms resulting in inadequate care, or of a lack of adherence to treatment.<ref name=\"cohen & pressman 2006\">Cohen S & Pressman, S.D. (2006). Positive Affect and Health. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', 15 (3) 122</ref>\n*'''Lifestyle''' \u2013 Even when it comes to healthy individuals, it seems that there are differences between people's life style, due to their dispositional affect trait. Individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity tend to attend healthier activities such as improved [[sleep]] quality, more [[physical exercise]], and more intake of dietary [[vitamins]], and tend to socialize more often and maintain more and higher-quality social ties. It was also found that high levels of positive affectivity may result in more and closer social contacts because it facilitates approach behavior, and because others are drawn to form attachments with pleasant individuals.\n*'''Psychological resilience''' \u2013 Individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity have lower levels of the stress [[hormones]] (such as [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[cortisol]]), thus [[physiology]] gives one explanation in favor of psychological resilience that provides positive resources to confront stressful life events.<ref name=\"cohen & pressman 2006\"/> On the other hand, the [[broaden-and-build]] theory<ref>Fredrickson, B. L. (1998). What good are positive emotions? ''Review of General Psychology'', 2, 300\u2013319.</ref> provides a different explanation from the physiological one, and claim that individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity and experience positive events in the present, create a spiral or \"snow ball\" effect, that may lead to higher probability to experience positive events in the future as well. This means that [[happiness]] and [[health|well-being]] sensations in the present, are the ones which creates the likelihood to feel the same in the future, which helps us in building a strong and improved system of coping with stressful life events.<ref>Fredrickson, B. L. (2001). The role of positive emotions in positive psychology: The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. ''American Psychologist'', 56, 218\u2013226.</ref><ref>Fredrickson, B. & Joiner, T. (2002). Positive emotions trigger upward spirals toward emotional well-being. ''Psychological Science'', 13, 172-175.</ref>\n*'''Dispositional Affect and the Workplace''' - Some studies have suggested that worker's perceived career barriers might be due to their dispositional affect. Career barriers are barriers, such as race or gender, that prevent one from moving up in career opportunities. Individuals with more [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]] perceived more career barriers.  Males and non-Hispanic Whites showed less perceived barriers than females and minorities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novakovic|first=Alexandra|last2=Gnilka|first2=Philip B.|date=December 2015|title=Dispositional Affect and Career Barriers: The Moderating Roles of Gender and Coping|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cdq.12034|journal=The Career Development Quarterly|language=en|volume=63|issue=4|pages=363\u2013375|doi=10.1002/cdq.12034}}</ref>\n*'''Positive/Negative Affect''' - When strictly examining [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]], studies looking at sentence processing showed that people with less positive affect rely on local cues instead of global cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Selvanayagam|first=Janahan|last2=Witte|first2=Victoria|last3=Schmidt|first3=Louis A.|last4=Dwivedi|first4=Veena D.|date=October 2019|title=A preliminary investigation of dispositional affect, the P300, and sentence processing|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006899319303555|journal=Brain Research|language=en|volume=1721|pages=146309|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146309}}</ref>\n* '''Coping''' - Some studies have found a relationship between Dispositional affect and the [[coping mechanism]]s used in attaining ones goals. Those with a positive dispositional affect were more successful in using task-oriented coping methods ( which involve directly addressing the issue at hand), while those with a negative dispositional affect were more successful in using avoidant coping strategies (which involve managing stressful situations in an indirect way.)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soucy Chartier|first=Isabelle|last2=Gaudreau|first2=Patrick|last3=Fecteau|first3=Marie-Claude|date=January 2011|title=From dispositional affect to academic goal attainment: the mediating role of coping|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10615801003725360|journal=Anxiety, Stress & Coping|volume=24|issue=1|pages=43\u201358|doi=10.1080/10615801003725360|issn=1061-5806}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThough it is agreed that there are differences between one culture and another, most of the differences that were addressed in researches are related to the comparison between [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].

This trait is expressed by the tendency to see things in a positive or negative way. People with high positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]]ivity tend to perceive things through \"pink lens\" while people with high negative affectivity tend to perceive things through \"black lens\".<ref name=\"Barsade & Gibson 2007\">Barsade, S.G., & Gibson, D.E. (2007). Why does affect matter in organizations? Academy of Management Perspectives, 36-59.</ref> The level of dispositional affect affects the sensations and behavior immediately and most of the time in unconscious ways, and its effect can be prolonged (between a few weeks to a few months). Research shows that there is a [[correlation]] between dispositional affect (both positive and negative) and important aspects in [[psychology]] and [[social science]], such as personality, [[culture]], [[decision making]], [[negotiation]], [[psychological resilience]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stressful life events. That is why this topic is important both in [[social psychology]] research and [[organizational psychology]] research. There has also been research that suggests dispositional affect plays an important role in the workplace.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Conceptual distinctions from emotion and mood===\nBesides dispositional affect, there are other concepts for expressions of emotion such as [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or discrete [[emotion]]s. These concepts are different from dispositional affect though there is a connection among them.\n*Dispositional affect is different from [[emotion]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], by being a personality trait while emotion is a general concept for subjective responses of people to certain situations. Emotion includes both general responses (positive or negative emotion) and specific responses ([[love]], [[anger]], [[hate]], [[fear]], [[jealousy]], [[sadness]] etc. The strength of emotions a person feels can stem from his level of dispositional affect.\n*Dispositional affect is also different from moods since mood relates to general feeling that usually tends to be diffusing and not focused on a specific cause or object. Though mood is specific, it is not a personality trait. Still, [[positive affectivity]] can explain why a person has good mood in general, since positive affectivity means viewing the world in a good light. The same thing is true for [[negative affectivity]], which can explain why a person has bad mood in general, since negative affectivity means viewing the world in a dark light.\n\n===Dimensions===\nIn general, though emotion researchers disagree about the way that emotions and dispositional affect should be classified,<ref>James A. R., &  James M. C. (1999). The Phoenix of Bipolarity: Reply to Watson and Tellegen (1999). ''Psychological Bulletin''. 125, (5), ,611-617</ref> a common classification of emotions assumes that each emotion is a combination of pleasantness (pleasant or unpleasant) and activation (high or low).<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1985\"/> For example, excitement is a combination of pleasantness and high activation, while calmness is a combination of pleasantness and low activation. Dispositional Affect is also a combination of pleasantness and activation. According to this classification, the different combinations of high or low pleasantness and high or low activation create four Quarters.\nIn line with the classification mentioned above, there is a well-known and common model that is being used in organizational psychology research to analyze and classify dispositional affect, which was developed by Watson and Tellegen.<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1985\">Watson, D, & Tellegen, A. (1985). Toward a consensual structure of mood. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 98, 219\u201323</ref> The researchers claim that there are two dimensions of dispositional affect: positive affectivity and negative affectivity and that each person has a certain level of both positive affectivity and negative affectivity. Hence, according to the model and contrary to intuition, positive affectivity does not represent the opposite of negative affectivity, but a different aspect from it.  According to Watson & Tellegen<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1988\">Watson, D., Clark, L. A., & Tellegen, A. (1988). Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 54, 1063\u20131070.</ref> one must regard these quarters as two pivots which determine the positive affectivity and negative affectivity of a person. These two dimensions of dispositional affect are bipolar, distinct and independent, relating to different emotion groups, so that each person can be classified with a positive affectivity and negative affectivity grade.\n*'''Positive affectivity'''  \u2013 describes a person's tendency to be cheerful and energetic, and who experience positive moods, (such as pleasure or well-being), across a variety of situations, perceiving things through a \"pink lens\". Individuals who have low levels of positive affectivity tend to be low energy and sluggish or melancholy. High level of positive affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels energetic and excited, while low level of positive affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels sadness, sluggishness or weariness \".<ref name=\"Barsade & Gibson 2007\"/>\n*'''Negative affectivity'''  \u2013 describes a person's tendency to be distressed and upset, and have a negative view of self over time and across situations, perceiving things through a \"black lens\". It is important to explain that low levels of negative affectivity are perceived as positive traits since they represent individuals who are more calm, serene and relaxed. High levels of negative affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels anger, irritability, fear or nervousness, while low level of negative affectivity represents the extent to which an individual feels calm and serene \".<ref name=\"Barsade & Gibson 2007\"/>\n\n==== Relation to Personality Traits ====\nThere has been some debate over how closely related affect and some of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Model of personality]] traits are related. Some maintain that negative affect and positive affect are should be viewed as the same concept as [[Neuroticism]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|Extraversion]] from the Big Five Model, respectively.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thoresen|first=Carl J.|last2=Kaplan|first2=Seth A.|last3=Barsky|first3=Adam P.|last4=Warren|first4=Christopher R.|last5=de Chermont|first5=Kelly|date=2003|title=The Affective Underpinnings of Job Perceptions and Attitudes: A Meta-Analytic Review and Integration.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=129|issue=6|pages=914\u2013945|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.914|pmid=14599288|issn=1939-1455}}</ref> However, other researchers maintain that these concepts are related but should remain distinctly separate as they have traditionally had weak to moderate correlations, around .4.<ref>{{Citation|last=Corr|first=Philip J.|title=Personality Assessment and Theory|date=2016-04-29|work=The Wiley Handbook of Personality Assessment|pages=19\u201330|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-1-119-17348-9|last2=Poropat|first2=Arthur E.|doi=10.1002/9781119173489.ch2}}</ref>\n\n==Measurement==\nOperationalizations for dispositional affect can be measured by [[questionnaire]]s. In [[English language|English]] researchers use the [[Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale]] ('''PANAS''').<ref name=\"Watson & Tellegen 1988\"/> According to the instructions of this questionnaire, the individual is asked to indicate to what extent he or she feels a certain feeling or emotion such as happy, sad, excited, enthusiastic, guilty, distressed, afraid, etc. An individual has to indicate the most appropriate answer to each item (feeling or emotion) on a scale ranging from 1-5 (1- Very slightly or not at all, 5- Extremely). Early mapping of these emotions by the researchers, helps determine the positive affectivity and negative affectivity of the individual. \nAnother advantage that was discovered while developing this questionnaire is that though it is intended for personality analysis, people can respond to the questions according to specific time frames, for example people can indicate the emotions or sensations they feel at this moment, in the past week, or in general. This way we can learn about dispositional affect to a certain situation and not only about dispositional affect as a general personality trait. By responding to the questions about feelings \"in general\" we can learn about positive and negative affectivity as a personality trait. By responding to the questions about feelings \"at this moment\" we can learn about '''situational dispositional affect''' as a response to a certain situation. For example, Rafaeli et al.,<ref>Rafaeli, A., Barron, G. & Haber, K. (2002). The effects of queue structure on attitudes. ''Journal of Service Research', 5(2), 125-139.</ref> showed in their research that waiting in line cause an increase in negative affectivity levels.\n\n==Physical and mental aspects==\n*'''Physical health''' \u2013 When it comes to people with different illness, it is interesting to see that there are differences in the physical health according to the levels of dispositional affect. Individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity, had longer [[Longevity|life span]], reported fewer [[pain]]s and illness symptoms (such as [[blood pressure]]), and were less likely to develop a cold when exposed to a virus compared with individuals who have high levels of negative affectivity, while both had the same [[illness]]. It was also discovered that when it comes to people with chronic diseases that has decent prospects for long-term survival, (such as coronary [[heart disease]]), people may benefit from high levels of positive affectivity. However, when it comes to people with chronic diseases that has short-term prognoses (e.g., metastatic breast cancer) and poor survival chances, high levels of positive affectivity may be detrimental to the health of these individuals, possibly as a consequence of underreporting of symptoms resulting in inadequate care, or of a lack of adherence to treatment.<ref name=\"cohen & pressman 2006\">Cohen S & Pressman, S.D. (2006). Positive Affect and Health. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', 15 (3) 122</ref>\n*'''Lifestyle''' \u2013 Even when it comes to healthy individuals, it seems that there are differences between people's life style, due to their dispositional affect trait. Individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity tend to attend healthier activities such as improved [[sleep]] quality, more [[physical exercise]], and more intake of dietary [[vitamins]], and tend to socialize more often and maintain more and higher-quality social ties. It was also found that high levels of positive affectivity may result in more and closer social contacts because it facilitates approach behavior, and because others are drawn to form attachments with pleasant individuals.\n*'''Psychological resilience''' \u2013 Individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity have lower levels of the stress [[hormones]] (such as [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[cortisol]]), thus [[physiology]] gives one explanation in favor of psychological resilience that provides positive resources to confront stressful life events.<ref name=\"cohen & pressman 2006\"/> On the other hand, the [[broaden-and-build]] theory<ref>Fredrickson, B. L. (1998). What good are positive emotions? ''Review of General Psychology'', 2, 300\u2013319.</ref> provides a different explanation from the physiological one, and claim that individuals who have high levels of positive affectivity and experience positive events in the present, create a spiral or \"snow ball\" effect, that may lead to higher probability to experience positive events in the future as well. This means that [[happiness]] and [[health|well-being]] sensations in the present, are the ones which creates the likelihood to feel the same in the future, which helps us in building a strong and improved system of coping with stressful life events.<ref>Fredrickson, B. L. (2001). The role of positive emotions in positive psychology: The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. ''American Psychologist'', 56, 218\u2013226.</ref><ref>Fredrickson, B. & Joiner, T. (2002). Positive emotions trigger upward spirals toward emotional well-being. ''Psychological Science'', 13, 172-175.</ref>\n*'''Dispositional Affect and the Workplace''' - Some studies have suggested that worker's perceived career barriers might be due to their dispositional affect. Career barriers are barriers, such as race or gender, that prevent one from moving up in career opportunities. Individuals with more [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]] perceived more career barriers.  Males and non-Hispanic Whites showed less perceived barriers than females and minorities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novakovic|first=Alexandra|last2=Gnilka|first2=Philip B.|date=December 2015|title=Dispositional Affect and Career Barriers: The Moderating Roles of Gender and Coping|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cdq.12034|journal=The Career Development Quarterly|language=en|volume=63|issue=4|pages=363\u2013375|doi=10.1002/cdq.12034}}</ref>\n*'''Positive/Negative Affect''' - When strictly examining [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]], studies looking at sentence processing showed that people with less positive affect rely on local cues instead of global cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Selvanayagam|first=Janahan|last2=Witte|first2=Victoria|last3=Schmidt|first3=Louis A.|last4=Dwivedi|first4=Veena D.|date=October 2019|title=A preliminary investigation of dispositional affect, the P300, and sentence processing|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006899319303555|journal=Brain Research|language=en|volume=1721|pages=146309|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146309}}</ref>\n* '''Coping''' - Some studies have found a relationship between Dispositional affect and the [[coping mechanism]]s used in attaining ones goals.
