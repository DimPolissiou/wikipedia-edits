It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on a tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as reflection in the front window.

First released into [[early access]] in February 2018, the full release of the game is scheduled for April 30, 2020 for [[Microsoft Windows]], with [[macOS]] and [[Linux]] versions to follow.\n\nThe project is a [[spiritual successor]] to the Mane6's original planned fighting game '''''Fighting Is Magic''''' based on the animated television show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''.

These fans were drawn in by the creativity of [[Lauren Faust]] and her team, who wrote the show to appeal across generations. The show's characters, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animations, adventure-themed stories, and occasional pop cultural references are considered other draws for the older audience.<ref name=\"wired brony\">{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/ | title = My Little Pony Corrals Unlikely Fanboys Known as \u2018Bronies\u2019 | first = Angela | last = Wattercutter | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2013-01-14 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref>\n\nMany members of the brony fandom are technology-savvy,<ref name=\"wired brony\"/> a common activity in the fandom being the creation of images of the show's ponies, parodying other commercial works including video games. ''Fighting Is Magic'' grew out of a set of images for a hypothetical \"Marevel vs. Clopcom\" game, parodying the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' fighting game series, created by Anukan, who would later become one of the Mane6 developers.<ref name=\"gamespot\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-most-unlikely-fighter-you-ve-never-heard-of/1100-6402004/ | title = The Most Unlikely Fighter You've Never Heard Of | first = Maxwell | last = McGee | date = 4 January 2013 | accessdate = 5 January 2013 | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] |work= [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Anukan didn't expect anything to come from these images, but found that at discussion boards, fans were postulating how the various pony characters would translate into fighting games; such as what sorts of moves that they would use. One of these users, Nappy, recognized the potential in realizing a complete game, and began the formation of Mane6, including Anukan, Jay Wright, Lucas Ellinghaus, James Workman, and Prominence.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\nThe team decided on using the ''[[Fighter Maker|Fighter Maker 2D]]'' game engine, despite having no prior experience with the software.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> After getting in the basics of having characters hit one another, they discovered that they could get the engine to include wall bounces - the rebounding of a character from walls at the edges of the screen - which according to Ellinghaus, show \"the potential for both the game and the team.\"<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> Much of the development work was spent in trying to achieve certain effects within the ''Fighter Maker'' engine, referred to by the team as \"taming\" the engine.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\nThe game was initially developed as a three button-based fighter, allowing to remain simple to be picked up by players but still offering a variety of combinations of moves, while limiting the amount of animations for the various moves for all characters. The three buttons were designed to mimic the light, medium, and heavy attacks of the ''Marvel vs. Capcom'' series.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> However, the development team also wanted to include an EX system like the one in ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' where pressing two attack buttons at the same time executes a special move. Within the initial game engine, ''Fighter Maker'', the game would only register two simultaneous button presses if they were within the same processing time frame, which would hinder gameplay. To work around this, the team designed a fourth button, (a \"magic\" button as described by Mane6), used to have the character remain still while doing a specific activity that would build up an EX meter, such as Twilight Sparkle reading a book. With a full EX meter, the player would then be able to execute special moves with any of the other three buttons.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\n[[File:Fighting is Magic Character Selection Screen.png|thumb|left|250px|Character selection screen, in its form at the time of the cease and desist]]\nMane6 focused initial efforts to build up the six main characters from the show as the initial fighters, but have stated that an expanded roster of up to seventeen characters would be in their planned final version.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> The game was to be downloadable and free-to-play, with [[Local multiplayer#Single-system|local]] and [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] modes as well as a story mode.

They had designed one move where Pinkie would use her \"party cannon\" to launch a present at the opponent, and then she would then pop out of the present at close range. As they were developing the game, ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'' was released, in which the character of Kuma/Teddie had a similar move. They realized they were thinking along the same lines as the professional developers and continue to work more of Pinkie's moves based on Teddie's moveset.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> While these other characters helped to inspire additional moves, the Mane6 team made sure to stay true to the characterization on the show and not introduce moves that would be outside of this, such as Fluttershy herself making an aggressive attack.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\nAfter each character's moveset was tested and refined based on testing feedback, the team then began to animate each character, first by creating Flash-based animations and then transforming these to sprites needed for ''Fighter Maker''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> The team noted that the pony shape of the characters proved an additional challenge both visually and for the engine. With most fighting games, players can easily identify heads, arms, and legs, and know where to watch for attacks, but the same was not true for the ponies. They proceeded to add effects like sparks on the attacking character and opponent responses to help players recognize attacks.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> In terms of the engine, the [[hitbox]]es for the ponies were more horizontal than vertical as would be the case with humanoid fighter characters, and they had to work around this in the engine to accurately model attacks.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> Additionally the more horizontal shapes of the characters limited how much of the fighting stage space they could use; they overcame this within the game by using a 3/4ths view of the characters that shortened their on-screen lengths giving them more space to work with.<ref name=\"themarysue\" />\n\n===Release===\nThe team had released early [[Software release life cycle#Pre-alpha|pre-alpha]] gameplay footage as they added the main six characters to the game.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111190-My-Little-Ponies-Throw-Down-in-Fan-Made-Fighter |title=My Little Ponies Throw Down in Fan-Made Fighter |first=John |last=Funk |date=21 July 2010 |work=The Escapist Magazine |publisher=Themis Group, Inc|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/11/05/twilight-sparkle-is-a-my-little-pony-to-be-reckoned-with-in-figh/ |title=Twilight Sparkle is a My Little Pony to be reckoned with in Fighting is Magic |first=Jessica |last=Conduit |date=5 November 2011 |work=Joystiq |publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> Though the team had expected the game to be popular within the brony community, the game has been noticed by other fighting game players through these videos.

One of these users, Nappy, recognized the potential in realizing a complete game, and began the formation of Mane6, including Anukan, Jay Wright, Lucas Ellinghaus, James Workman, and Prominence.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\nThe team decided on using the ''[[Fighter Maker|Fighter Maker 2D]]'' game engine, despite having no prior experience with the software.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> After getting in the basics of having characters hit one another, they discovered that they could get the engine to include wall bounces - the rebounding of a character from walls at the edges of the screen - which according to Ellinghaus, show \"the potential for both the game and the team.\"<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> Much of the development work was spent in trying to achieve certain effects within the ''Fighter Maker'' engine, referred to by the team as \"taming\" the engine.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\nThe game was initially developed as a three button-based fighter, allowing to remain simple to be picked up by players but still offering a variety of combinations of moves, while limiting the amount of animations for the various moves for all characters. The three buttons were designed to mimic the light, medium, and heavy attacks of the ''Marvel vs. Capcom'' series.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> However, the development team also wanted to include an EX system like the one in ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' where pressing two attack buttons at the same time executes a special move. Within the initial game engine, ''Fighter Maker'', the game would only register two simultaneous button presses if they were within the same processing time frame, which would hinder gameplay. To work around this, the team designed a fourth button, (a \"magic\" button as described by Mane6), used to have the character remain still while doing a specific activity that would build up an EX meter, such as Twilight Sparkle reading a book. With a full EX meter, the player would then be able to execute special moves with any of the other three buttons.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\n[[File:Fighting is Magic Character Selection Screen.png|thumb|left|250px|Character selection screen, in its form at the time of the cease and desist]]\nMane6 focused initial efforts to build up the six main characters from the show as the initial fighters, but have stated that an expanded roster of up to seventeen characters would be in their planned final version.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> The game was to be downloadable and free-to-play, with [[Local multiplayer#Single-system|local]] and [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] modes as well as a story mode.

They had designed one move where Pinkie would use her \"party cannon\" to launch a present at the opponent, and then she would then pop out of the present at close range. As they were developing the game, ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'' was released, in which the character of Kuma/Teddie had a similar move. They realized they were thinking along the same lines as the professional developers and continue to work more of Pinkie's moves based on Teddie's moveset.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> While these other characters helped to inspire additional moves, the Mane6 team made sure to stay true to the characterization on the show and not introduce moves that would be outside of this, such as Fluttershy herself making an aggressive attack.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n\nAfter each character's moveset was tested and refined based on testing feedback, the team then began to animate each character, first by creating Flash-based animations and then transforming these to sprites needed for ''Fighter Maker''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> The team noted that the pony shape of the characters proved an additional challenge both visually and for the engine. With most fighting games, players can easily identify heads, arms, and legs, and know where to watch for attacks, but the same was not true for the ponies. They proceeded to add effects like sparks on the attacking character and opponent responses to help players recognize attacks.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> In terms of the engine, the [[hitbox]]es for the ponies were more horizontal than vertical as would be the case with humanoid fighter characters, and they had to work around this in the engine to accurately model attacks.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/> Additionally the more horizontal shapes of the characters limited how much of the fighting stage space they could use; they overcame this within the game by using a 3/4ths view of the characters that shortened their on-screen lengths giving them more space to work with.<ref name=\"themarysue\" />\n\n===Release===\nThe team had released early [[Software release life cycle#Pre-alpha|pre-alpha]] gameplay footage as they added the main six characters to the game.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111190-My-Little-Ponies-Throw-Down-in-Fan-Made-Fighter |title=My Little Ponies Throw Down in Fan-Made Fighter |first=John |last=Funk |date=21 July 2010 |work=The Escapist Magazine |publisher=Themis Group, Inc|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/11/05/twilight-sparkle-is-a-my-little-pony-to-be-reckoned-with-in-figh/ |title=Twilight Sparkle is a My Little Pony to be reckoned with in Fighting is Magic |first=Jessica |last=Conduit |date=5 November 2011 |work=Joystiq |publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> Though the team had expected the game to be popular within the brony community, the game has been noticed by other fighting game players through these videos.

Now known as \"Fighting is Magic: Tribute Edition\", the game is now openly available for download and play.\n\n==''Them's Fightin' Herds''==\nWith no legal option to continue to use the ''My Little Pony'' characters, the Mane6 team opted to keep most of their work to date and reworked the game with new art assets, retaining the theme of four-legged creatures.<ref name=\"faust team\"/> Faust herself supported the fan effort, understanding the \"irony\" of a fighting game based on a show about friendship, but appreciated that \"the original version of the game was that they made the Ponies fight in character\" without resorting to typical fighter elements like weapons, and praising the animations that the team has already built.<ref name=\"polygon\"/><ref name=\"themarysue\"/> On hearing of the cease and desist, Faust contacted the team, offering to provide some of her time to create new characters for their game,<ref name=\"polygon\"/><ref name=\"forbes\">{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/02/11/youtube-vatican-timberlake-apple-my-little-pony/2/ | title = First World Problems: YouTube At The Vatican, Justin Timberlake, Apple Dividends And My Little Pony | first = Daniel Nye | last = Griffiths | work = [[Forbes]] | date = 2013-02-11 | accessdate = 2013-02-14 }}</ref> and her official involvement with the project was announced at the end of February.<ref name=\"faust team\"/> The team accepted her offer; developer Jay Wright noted that \"you can't copyright Lauren's distinctive style\", and that while the game will still be unique, it will likely still carry the spirit of ''My Little Pony''.<ref name=\"polygon\"/> According to Faust, she was happy to provide \"my little part to help Mane6 finish up this game in a way that stays true to the spirit of the original - but in a way that can freely be shared\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/122494-Fighting-is-Magic-Rebounds-Thanks-To-MLP-Producer | title = Fighting is Magic Rebounds Thanks To MLP Producer | first = Ian | last = Davis | date = 2013-03-04 | accessdate = 2013-03-27 | publisher = [[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}</ref> Faust also helped to develop the story and setting for the game. She noted that the common story concept for fighting games, where the characters would be fighting to be the champions of a tourney, was overused, and instead designed one around where the individual characters have already been determined to be champions from their individual tribes, and now are fighting each other for the key, each believing it is their destiny to obtain and use the key against the Predators.<ref name=\"themarysue\"/>\n\nThe characters in the game will remain four-legged as with the ''My Little Pony'' version, which Mane6 developer Francisco Copado believes is a first for a fighting game.<ref name=\"polygon\"/> [[Silhouette]] teaser images released by the Mane6 team showed a trio of four-legged non-pony characters as preliminary designs for the new game, while as of April 2013, three additional characters are still in development.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/4/23/4252660/friendship-really-is-magic | title = Bronies Fighting Ponies: The Magic of Friendship | date = 2013-04-23 | accessdate = 2013-04-23 | first = Colin | last = Campbell | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\nThe Mane6 also gained contributions from Lab Zero Games, developers of ''[[Skullgirls]]''. Lab Zero had developed a fighting game engine, named Z-Engine, from scratch for their own title. Lab Zero used an [[Indiegogo]] crowd-sourcing effort to gain development funds, and having readily cleared their initial target of $150,000 and with additional stretch goals of new characters and content for their game, included a $725,000 target that would allow Mane6 to use and distribute the Z-Engine for free as part of their new game, and challenged the brony community to help towards that via online [[donation]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-18-skullgirls-dev-offers-its-engine-to-my-little-pony-fighting-is-magic-dev-for-free | title = Skullgirls dev offers its engine to My Little Pony: Fighting is Magic dev for free | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = 2013-03-18 | accessdate = 2013-03-18 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The goal was met on the final day of the funding campaign, which was on March 27, 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/28/4156020/fighting-is-magic-gets-skullgirls-engine-skullgirls-campaign-ends | title = Fighting is Magic gets Skullgirls engine; Skullgirls campaign ends with five DLC fighters | first = Jenna | last = Pitcher | date = 2013-03-28 | accessdate = 2013-03-28 | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> The Z-engine allowed the Mane6 team to expand beyond the limitations of Fighter Maker, thought they kept some of the conventions learned from working with Fighter Maker, such as the use of 3/4rd views to reduce the horizontal lengths of the four-legged characters.<ref name=\"themarysue\"/>\n\nIn August 2015, the Mane6 revealed the revamped title, ''Them's Fightin' Herds'', which was suggested by [[Craig McCracken]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6vNZgBn-y8?t=5275|author=ManeSix DevTeam|accessdate=2020-02-23|date=2020-02-18}}</ref>.

Lundgren led a [[Latter Day Saint movement]]-based cult in Kirtland where he and several of his followers murdered the Avery family, fellow members of his cult, for which he was convicted and sentenced to [[death penalty|death]].\n\nLundgren was [[executed]] in 2006.\n\n== Background ==\nLundgren was born on May 3, 1950, in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri, and grew up as a member of the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church).  According to his allegations (supported by some of his former neighbors), he was severely [[child abuse|abused]] as a child, particularly by his father, and his mother reportedly did not defend him.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}  Lundgren was, by most accounts, a [[loner]] when he was in middle and high school. He became an expert [[hunting|hunter]] when he began to spend time with his father as a teenager. The pair would go on hunting trips, and Lundgren became a gun expert, learning shooting and maintenance techniques.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nLundgren enrolled at [[Central Missouri State University]]<ref name=Sasse/> and he spent time at a house that was specially built for RLDS youth. While at the house, he became friends with Alice Keeler and Keith Johnson. Keeler, who had also been abused by her father, quickly bonded with Lundgren, and the two became lovers. The couple married in 1970 and Lundgren enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], and on December 2, 1970, the couple's first child, a boy, was born.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> By 1974, Keeler was [[pregnant]] for the second time. Prior to receiving an [[honorable discharge]] from the U.S. Navy at the end of his first term, Lundgren sought an early release from his term of duty by arguing that his presence was necessary for the sustenance of his family. He was denied an early release for reasons that were non-necessary according to military recommendations. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy days before his four-year enlistment was completed. His second son was born soon afterward.\n\nLundgren and his new family settled in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California after he was discharged from the Navy, but once economic problems began to set in, the Lundgrens moved back to Missouri. In 1979, Keeler gave birth to a third child, a daughter. People close to the couple claim that Lundgren seemed frustrated by the family's money problems and was generally tired of his wife, and he allegedly became abusive after the birth of his daughter. According to hospital records, his wife was hospitalized for a ruptured [[spleen]], which may have been caused by Lundgren pushing her into a closet door handle. In 1980, the couple had their fourth child, another boy.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren was dismissed as a lay minister by the RLDS Church.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\n== Religious activities ==\nWhile Lundgren was living in a church-owned home, located next to the [[Kirtland Temple]], on Chillicothe Road, in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], Ohio, he volunteered as a tour guide of the historic [[Kirtland Temple]], for the RLDS Church. He began to teach the concept of \"dividing the word\", known as \"chiastic interpretation\" or \"[[chiasmus]]\", to interpret scriptures. Lundgren falsely claimed to have created chiastic interpretation. The foundation was that in everything created by God, the right side is a mirror image and, therefore, scripture had to be interpreted using that same method. He cited the Kirtland Temple as an example because the right side was a mirror image of the left side. To apply this concept to scripture, one takes a sentence from scripture; if the sentences before and after are consistent, the center sentence is the \"truth\"; when the sentences before and after conflict, the center sentence is a lie. His teaching of scriptural interpretations attracted his followers. Lundgren claimed that he moved to Ohio from Missouri because the word, <small>\"OHIO\"</small> is \"chiastic\". About 1987, Lundgren was asked to leave the church-owned house and his job as tour guide was terminated due to suspicions of theft.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren and his family moved to a rented farm house, located at 8671 Chardon Road on [[U.S. Route 6]] (aka: Euclid-Chardon Road), east of Ohio State Route #306. Some of the followers knew Lundgren in Missouri while others were attracted to Lundgren when they were exposed to his teachings when he was working as a Kirtland Temple tour guide. At that time, some followers started to move into his home. Those who moved into the house were Kevin Currie, Richard Brand, Greg Winship, Sharon Bluntschly, Daniel Kraft, and Debbie Olivarez. Ronald and Susan Luff; Dennis and Tonya Patrick; and Dennis and Cheryl Avery maintained their own residences. There were others whose names were not made public because they were not significant to the criminal investigation (conspiracy to deprive civil rights, the Kirtland Temple takeover, and multiple homicide of the Avery family).  While Lundgren was living at the farm house, Lundgren's teachings continued and he began to practice methods of \"mind control\", which were consistent with [[Robert Lifton]]'s criteria for mind control. For example, cult members were forbidden to talk amongst themselves; doing so was a sin, called \"murmuring\".  He would eavesdrop on cult members to cause them to believe that he could read their minds.\n\nOn April 23, 1988, a neighbor told Kirtland police officer Ron Andolsek that she suspected that a cult was living at the farm house and that Lundgren's son warned the neighbor's children that on May 15 the earth would open up and demons would emerge. On April 28, 1988, a former cult member, referred by the FBI, called Kirtland Police and reported the cult's conspiracy to take over the Kirtland Temple to Chief Dennis T. Yarborough. Yarborough did not believe the informant's information and on May 2, 1988, Yarborough confronted Lundgren at the Kirtland Police Station. When Lundgren left, Yarborough said that he \"neutralized the situation\" by warning Lundgren that there were complaints about gunfire on Lundgren's property. Lundgren went back to his followers and told them that the planned May 3 Kirtland Temple takeover was off because he had spoken to a higher power. The Kirtland Police initiated surveillance of Lundgren's residence and of church-owned properties. In September 1988, a second informant came forward. Officer Andolsek cultivated the informant and made contact with the ATF and the FBI. The FBI initiated a domestic terrorism investigation.\n\nOn October 10, 1988, the day that Lundgren was excommunicated from the RLDS Church, there was a thunderstorm at the south end of Kirtland. When the sun emerged, a large rainbow appeared to the east. Lundgren told his followers that the rainbow signified the opening of the \"Seven Seals\". Lundgren and his family soon abandoned the religious group, and Lundgren began to feel a call to teach the [[Bible]] in the way he understood it. He formed his own [[sect]] soon after. Membership never exceeded twenty. These were some of the most conservative members of the RLDS Church who believed that God communicated through regular revelations although some members admitted that they claimed to have revelations even when they did not. The conservatives were also opposed to more liberal rights for women. This was during a rift with the more liberal members of the church. Alice Lundgren often acted as a cheerleader to Jeffrey Lundgren. She had claimed she had once had a revelation that she would meet an important leader of the RLDS Church. She later concluded that this alleged revelation referred to Jeffrey.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nLundgren began to offer Bible study services at his home. Lundgren would dominate the services himself and he would intimidate anyone who did not agree with him. He would later encourage others to intimidate those who disagreed as well. He sought to convince his congregation that he was God's last prophet. He asked for money from his supporters, and some would give him their life's savings, which often were calculated to be thousands of dollars.\n\nLundgren then proclaimed he had received a call from God to move to Kirtland, Ohio. According to Lundgren, he was told by God that he and his supporters would soon witness the [[second coming of Christ]] if they moved to Kirtland. Lundgren was attracted to Kirtland because it was the home of the Kirtland Temple, built by [[Joseph Smith]] and Smith's followers. Lundgren would tell his followers that on May 3 (no year specified\u2014May 3 was also Lundgren's birthday) the second coming would happen at the Kirtland Temple and that he and his followers would have to seize the Kirtland Temple by force and hold it for the second coming. The conspiracy involved burglarizing adjacent church-homes and committing murder as part of the \"Kirtland Temple takeover\". Lundgren called the land around the temple \"The Vineyards\", which had to be \"redeemed\" or \"cleansed\" for him and his followers to take the temple.\n\nBy this time, seven of Lundgren's 12 followers had moved into the family home. The remaining five were members of Dennis Avery's family. Lundgren felt that the Averys were committing a sin by not living in his house. The Avery family father, Dennis, sold his Missouri house in order for his family to move to Ohio. Dennis Avery believed in Jeffrey completely and trusted him. Jeffrey, however, considered Dennis Avery to be weak and, when Dennis was no longer useful to Jeffrey, he began talking about Dennis behind his back. Jeffrey often used Dennis as a scapegoat for their troubles even though Dennis was one of the leading contributors. Dennis Avery decided to set apart a relatively small amount of money for his family's use, with a bank account. Once again, Lundgren considered this a sin, because Lundgren wanted all of his followers' money to be given exclusively to him.\n\nIn time, Lundgren convinced his followers that they had to seize the temple, from which he had stolen about $40,000, and to kill anyone who stood in their way. He changed his mind, however, and started telling his followers that they had to kill a family of five instead if they wanted to see God. As punishment for their \"disloyalty\", he chose the Averys. At some point, he referred to the slaughter of the Avery family as \"pruning the vineyard\".\n\n== Murders ==\nOn April 10, 1989, in Kirtland, Lundgren ordered two of his followers to dig a pit in the barn, in anticipation of burying the Averys' bodies there. The expectation was that there could be five bodies buried in the pit. Lundgren told the rest of his followers, including the Averys, that they would go on a wilderness trip. On April 17, he rented a motel room and had dinner with all of his followers. He then called his group's men into his room. He questioned each as to their purpose in the action. All of the men assured Lundgren that they were with him in the sacrifice. Dennis Avery was not invited to the meeting in Lundgren's bedroom.\n\nAccording to followers' admissions, Lundgren later went inside the barn, with a church member named Ron Luff luring Dennis Avery into a place where the other men awaited by asking him for help with equipment for the camping trip. Luff attempted to render Avery unconscious with a stun gun, but due to a malfunction, a stun bullet struck Avery but failed to knock him out.\n\nAvery then was gagged and dragged to the place where Lundgren awaited. He was shot twice in the back, dying almost instantly. To mask the sound of the gun, a chainsaw was left running. Luff then told Avery's wife, Cheryl, that her husband needed help. She was gagged, like her husband, but also had duct tape put over her eyes, and dragged to Lundgren. She was shot three times, twice in the breasts and once in the abdomen. Her body lay next to her husband's. The Averys' 15-year-old daughter, Trina, was shot twice in the head. The first shot entered but ricocheted off of her skull, missing her brain, but the second killed her instantly. Thirteen-year-old Becky Avery was shot twice and left to die, while six-year-old Karen Avery was shot in the chest and head.\n\nThe barn where the incident took place was demolished on November 13, 2007.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Glasier1/>\n\n== Arrest and conviction ==\nOn April 18, 1989, the day after the murders, officers coincidentally came to Lundgren's farm to talk to him. After this encounter Lundgren became [[paranoid]] about being caught, and left Ohio with the rest of his cult, moving south to [[West Virginia]]. As months went by and nothing happened, Lundgren became disillusioned, and he and his family moved to [[California]], leaving the rest of the surviving cult members behind in West Virginia.\n\nNine months after the killings, on January 3, 1990, a tip from an informant led police back to the long-abandoned farm, where the five bodies of the Avery family were uncovered.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/> The Lundgrens became [[fugitive]]s, media attention increased, and police began to track the cult members, with the [[FBI]] joining in the manhunt. Eventually, Lundgren's abandoned followers were found back east, and they helped catch him and his family. Thirteen members of Lundgren's sect were arrested in early 1990, including Lundgren and his wife.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nJeffrey Lundgren was given the [[death sentence|death penalty]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Alice Lundgren received five [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life]] sentences (140 years to life) for [[Conspiracy (law)|conspiracy]], complicity and [[kidnapping]], while their son, Damon, was sentenced to 120 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/>  Ronald Luff, the key planner and facilitator of the murders with Lundgren, was sentenced to 170 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/> Daniel Kraft was sentenced to 50 years to life.<ref name=Timeline/> Five of the cult members were released in 2010 or early 2011, after roughly 20 years of [[prison|incarceration]] (including pre-trial period).<ref name=FourParoled/>  Prosecutor Charles Coulson confirmed that the original plea agreements meant that the five were to be eligible for release \"at the earliest possible time\", but the Ohio State Parole Board had repeatedly denied earlier requests for parole by Richard Brand and Greg Winship (both were serving 15 years to life), as well as Sharon Bluntschly, Debbie Olivarez and Susan Luff (all were serving 7 to 25 years).<ref name=FourParoled/> Lundgren followers Kathryn Johnson, Tonya Patrick and Dennis Patrick were determined not to have been involved in the murders, and each received a one year sentence for [[obstruction of justice]] (the Patricks' sentences were suspended).<ref name=Timeline/>\n\n=== Execution ===\nThe [[Ohio Supreme Court]] set October 24, 2006, as Lundgren's execution date, and according to the state attorney general's office, as of August 2006, he had exhausted his appeals.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nOn October 17, 2006, Judge [[Gregory L.

Lundgren led a [[Latter Day Saint movement]]-based cult in Kirtland where he and several of his followers murdered the Avery family, fellow members of his cult, for which he was convicted and sentenced to [[death penalty|death]].\n\nLundgren was [[executed]] in 2006.\n\n== Background ==\nLundgren was born on May 3, 1950, in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri, and grew up as a member of the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church).  According to his allegations (supported by some of his former neighbors), he was severely [[child abuse|abused]] as a child, particularly by his father, and his mother reportedly did not defend him.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}  Lundgren was, by most accounts, a [[loner]] when he was in middle and high school. He became an expert [[hunting|hunter]] when he began to spend time with his father as a teenager. The pair would go on hunting trips, and Lundgren became a gun expert, learning shooting and maintenance techniques.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nLundgren enrolled at [[Central Missouri State University]]<ref name=Sasse/> and he spent time at a house that was specially built for RLDS youth. While at the house, he became friends with Alice Keeler and Keith Johnson. Keeler, who had also been abused by her father, quickly bonded with Lundgren, and the two became lovers. The couple married in 1970 and Lundgren enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], and on December 2, 1970, the couple's first child, a boy, was born.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> By 1974, Keeler was [[pregnant]] for the second time. Prior to receiving an [[honorable discharge]] from the U.S. Navy at the end of his first term, Lundgren sought an early release from his term of duty by arguing that his presence was necessary for the sustenance of his family. He was denied an early release for reasons that were non-necessary according to military recommendations. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy days before his four-year enlistment was completed. His second son was born soon afterward.\n\nLundgren and his new family settled in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California after he was discharged from the Navy, but once economic problems began to set in, the Lundgrens moved back to Missouri. In 1979, Keeler gave birth to a third child, a daughter. People close to the couple claim that Lundgren seemed frustrated by the family's money problems and was generally tired of his wife, and he allegedly became abusive after the birth of his daughter. According to hospital records, his wife was hospitalized for a ruptured [[spleen]], which may have been caused by Lundgren pushing her into a closet door handle. In 1980, the couple had their fourth child, another boy.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren was dismissed as a lay minister by the RLDS Church.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\n== Religious activities ==\nWhile Lundgren was living in a church-owned home, located next to the [[Kirtland Temple]], on Chillicothe Road, in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], Ohio, he volunteered as a tour guide of the historic [[Kirtland Temple]], for the RLDS Church. He began to teach the concept of \"dividing the word\", known as \"chiastic interpretation\" or \"[[chiasmus]]\", to interpret scriptures. Lundgren falsely claimed to have created chiastic interpretation. The foundation was that in everything created by God, the right side is a mirror image and, therefore, scripture had to be interpreted using that same method. He cited the Kirtland Temple as an example because the right side was a mirror image of the left side. To apply this concept to scripture, one takes a sentence from scripture; if the sentences before and after are consistent, the center sentence is the \"truth\"; when the sentences before and after conflict, the center sentence is a lie. His teaching of scriptural interpretations attracted his followers. Lundgren claimed that he moved to Ohio from Missouri because the word, <small>\"OHIO\"</small> is \"chiastic\". About 1987, Lundgren was asked to leave the church-owned house and his job as tour guide was terminated due to suspicions of theft.\n\nIn 1987, Lundgren and his family moved to a rented farm house, located at 8671 Chardon Road on [[U.S. Route 6]] (aka: Euclid-Chardon Road), east of Ohio State Route #306. Some of the followers knew Lundgren in Missouri while others were attracted to Lundgren when they were exposed to his teachings when he was working as a Kirtland Temple tour guide. At that time, some followers started to move into his home. Those who moved into the house were Kevin Currie, Richard Brand, Greg Winship, Sharon Bluntschly, Daniel Kraft, and Debbie Olivarez. Ronald and Susan Luff; Dennis and Tonya Patrick; and Dennis and Cheryl Avery maintained their own residences. There were others whose names were not made public because they were not significant to the criminal investigation (conspiracy to deprive civil rights, the Kirtland Temple takeover, and multiple homicide of the Avery family).  While Lundgren was living at the farm house, Lundgren's teachings continued and he began to practice methods of \"mind control\", which were consistent with [[Robert Lifton]]'s criteria for mind control. For example, cult members were forbidden to talk amongst themselves; doing so was a sin, called \"murmuring\".  He would eavesdrop on cult members to cause them to believe that he could read their minds.\n\nOn April 23, 1988, a neighbor told Kirtland police officer Ron Andolsek that she suspected that a cult was living at the farm house and that Lundgren's son warned the neighbor's children that on May 15 the earth would open up and demons would emerge. On April 28, 1988, a former cult member, referred by the FBI, called Kirtland Police and reported the cult's conspiracy to take over the Kirtland Temple to Chief Dennis T. Yarborough. Yarborough did not believe the informant's information and on May 2, 1988, Yarborough confronted Lundgren at the Kirtland Police Station. When Lundgren left, Yarborough said that he \"neutralized the situation\" by warning Lundgren that there were complaints about gunfire on Lundgren's property. Lundgren went back to his followers and told them that the planned May 3 Kirtland Temple takeover was off because he had spoken to a higher power. The Kirtland Police initiated surveillance of Lundgren's residence and of church-owned properties. In September 1988, a second informant came forward. Officer Andolsek cultivated the informant and made contact with the ATF and the FBI. The FBI initiated a domestic terrorism investigation.\n\nOn October 10, 1988, the day that Lundgren was excommunicated from the RLDS Church, there was a thunderstorm at the south end of Kirtland. When the sun emerged, a large rainbow appeared to the east. Lundgren told his followers that the rainbow signified the opening of the \"Seven Seals\". Lundgren and his family soon abandoned the religious group, and Lundgren began to feel a call to teach the [[Bible]] in the way he understood it. He formed his own [[sect]] soon after. Membership never exceeded twenty. These were some of the most conservative members of the RLDS Church who believed that God communicated through regular revelations although some members admitted that they claimed to have revelations even when they did not. The conservatives were also opposed to more liberal rights for women. This was during a rift with the more liberal members of the church. Alice Lundgren often acted as a cheerleader to Jeffrey Lundgren. She had claimed she had once had a revelation that she would meet an important leader of the RLDS Church. She later concluded that this alleged revelation referred to Jeffrey.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nLundgren began to offer Bible study services at his home. Lundgren would dominate the services himself and he would intimidate anyone who did not agree with him. He would later encourage others to intimidate those who disagreed as well. He sought to convince his congregation that he was God's last prophet. He asked for money from his supporters, and some would give him their life's savings, which often were calculated to be thousands of dollars.\n\nLundgren then proclaimed he had received a call from God to move to Kirtland, Ohio. According to Lundgren, he was told by God that he and his supporters would soon witness the [[second coming of Christ]] if they moved to Kirtland. Lundgren was attracted to Kirtland because it was the home of the Kirtland Temple, built by [[Joseph Smith]] and Smith's followers. Lundgren would tell his followers that on May 3 (no year specified\u2014May 3 was also Lundgren's birthday) the second coming would happen at the Kirtland Temple and that he and his followers would have to seize the Kirtland Temple by force and hold it for the second coming. The conspiracy involved burglarizing adjacent church-homes and committing murder as part of the \"Kirtland Temple takeover\". Lundgren called the land around the temple \"The Vineyards\", which had to be \"redeemed\" or \"cleansed\" for him and his followers to take the temple.\n\nBy this time, seven of Lundgren's 12 followers had moved into the family home. The remaining five were members of Dennis Avery's family. Lundgren felt that the Averys were committing a sin by not living in his house. The Avery family father, Dennis, sold his Missouri house in order for his family to move to Ohio. Dennis Avery believed in Jeffrey completely and trusted him. Jeffrey, however, considered Dennis Avery to be weak and, when Dennis was no longer useful to Jeffrey, he began talking about Dennis behind his back. Jeffrey often used Dennis as a scapegoat for their troubles even though Dennis was one of the leading contributors. Dennis Avery decided to set apart a relatively small amount of money for his family's use, with a bank account. Once again, Lundgren considered this a sin, because Lundgren wanted all of his followers' money to be given exclusively to him.\n\nIn time, Lundgren convinced his followers that they had to seize the temple, from which he had stolen about $40,000, and to kill anyone who stood in their way. He changed his mind, however, and started telling his followers that they had to kill a family of five instead if they wanted to see God. As punishment for their \"disloyalty\", he chose the Averys. At some point, he referred to the slaughter of the Avery family as \"pruning the vineyard\".\n\n== Murders ==\nOn April 10, 1989, in Kirtland, Lundgren ordered two of his followers to dig a pit in the barn, in anticipation of burying the Averys' bodies there. The expectation was that there could be five bodies buried in the pit. Lundgren told the rest of his followers, including the Averys, that they would go on a wilderness trip. On April 17, he rented a motel room and had dinner with all of his followers. He then called his group's men into his room. He questioned each as to their purpose in the action. All of the men assured Lundgren that they were with him in the sacrifice. Dennis Avery was not invited to the meeting in Lundgren's bedroom.\n\nAccording to followers' admissions, Lundgren later went inside the barn, with a church member named Ron Luff luring Dennis Avery into a place where the other men awaited by asking him for help with equipment for the camping trip. Luff attempted to render Avery unconscious with a stun gun, but due to a malfunction, a stun bullet struck Avery but failed to knock him out.\n\nAvery then was gagged and dragged to the place where Lundgren awaited. He was shot twice in the back, dying almost instantly. To mask the sound of the gun, a chainsaw was left running. Luff then told Avery's wife, Cheryl, that her husband needed help. She was gagged, like her husband, but also had duct tape put over her eyes, and dragged to Lundgren. She was shot three times, twice in the breasts and once in the abdomen. Her body lay next to her husband's. The Averys' 15-year-old daughter, Trina, was shot twice in the head. The first shot entered but ricocheted off of her skull, missing her brain, but the second killed her instantly. Thirteen-year-old Becky Avery was shot twice and left to die, while six-year-old Karen Avery was shot in the chest and head.\n\nThe barn where the incident took place was demolished on November 13, 2007.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Glasier1/>\n\n== Arrest and conviction ==\nOn April 18, 1989, the day after the murders, officers coincidentally came to Lundgren's farm to talk to him. After this encounter Lundgren became [[paranoid]] about being caught, and left Ohio with the rest of his cult, moving south to [[West Virginia]]. As months went by and nothing happened, Lundgren became disillusioned, and he and his family moved to [[California]], leaving the rest of the surviving cult members behind in West Virginia.\n\nNine months after the killings, on January 3, 1990, a tip from an informant led police back to the long-abandoned farm, where the five bodies of the Avery family were uncovered.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/> The Lundgrens became [[fugitive]]s, media attention increased, and police began to track the cult members, with the [[FBI]] joining in the manhunt. Eventually, Lundgren's abandoned followers were found back east, and they helped catch him and his family. Thirteen members of Lundgren's sect were arrested in early 1990, including Lundgren and his wife.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nJeffrey Lundgren was given the [[death sentence|death penalty]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Alice Lundgren received five [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life]] sentences (140 years to life) for [[Conspiracy (law)|conspiracy]], complicity and [[kidnapping]], while their son, Damon, was sentenced to 120 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/>  Ronald Luff, the key planner and facilitator of the murders with Lundgren, was sentenced to 170 years to life.<ref name=FourParoled/> Daniel Kraft was sentenced to 50 years to life.<ref name=Timeline/> Five of the cult members were released in 2010 or early 2011, after roughly 20 years of [[prison|incarceration]] (including pre-trial period).<ref name=FourParoled/>  Prosecutor Charles Coulson confirmed that the original plea agreements meant that the five were to be eligible for release \"at the earliest possible time\", but the Ohio State Parole Board had repeatedly denied earlier requests for parole by Richard Brand and Greg Winship (both were serving 15 years to life), as well as Sharon Bluntschly, Debbie Olivarez and Susan Luff (all were serving 7 to 25 years).<ref name=FourParoled/> Lundgren followers Kathryn Johnson, Tonya Patrick and Dennis Patrick were determined not to have been involved in the murders, and each received a one year sentence for [[obstruction of justice]] (the Patricks' sentences were suspended).<ref name=Timeline/>\n\n=== Execution ===\nThe [[Ohio Supreme Court]] set October 24, 2006, as Lundgren's execution date, and according to the state attorney general's office, as of August 2006, he had exhausted his appeals.<ref name=\"AP-Aug-2006\"/>\n\nOn October 17, 2006, Judge [[Gregory L. Frost]] issued an order temporarily delaying Lundgren's execution. Lundgren attempted to join a [[lawsuit]] with five other Ohio [[death row]] inmates challenging the state's death penalty law, claiming that because of his [[obesity]] the [[lethal injection]] would be particularly painful and amount to [[cruel and unusual punishment]].

The week is divided into seven days, and each day into 24 hours, 96 ''puncta'' (quarter-hours), 240 ''minuta'' (tenths of an hour) and 960 ''[[moment (time)|momenta]]'' (40th parts of an hour).]]\nA '''week''' is a [[time unit]] equal to seven [[day]]s. It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside\u2014although not strictly part of\u2014the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nIn many languages, the '''days of the week''' [[names of the days of the week|are named]] after [[classical planets]] or gods of a [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]]. In English, the names are [[Monday]], [[Tuesday]], [[Wednesday]], [[Thursday]], [[Friday]], [[Saturday]] and [[Sunday]]. Such a week may be called a ''planetary week''.{{cn|date=April 2020}} This is in contrast to the lunar week in the [[Bible]] in which the seven days are simply numbered with the seventh day being kept as a sabbath day.\n\nWhile, for example, the United States, Canada and Japan consider Sunday as the first day of the week, and while the week begins with Saturday in much of the Middle East, the international [[ISO 8601]] standard{{efn|\"ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times\" is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data.}} has Monday as the first day of the week. The ISO standard includes the [[ISO week date]] system, a numbering system for weeks within a given year, where each week starting on a Monday is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday\u2013Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). ISO 8601 assigns numbers to the days of the week, running from 1 to 7 for Monday through to Sunday.\n{|border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ An ISO 8601 week\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n|[[Monday]]||[[Tuesday]]||[[Wednesday]]||[[Thursday]]||[[Friday]]||[[Saturday]]||[[Sunday]]\n|}\n\nThe term \"week\" is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days, such as the [[nundinal cycle]] of the ancient Roman calendar, the \"work week\", or \"school week\" referring only to the days spent on those activities.\n\n{{anchor|Etymology|Names}}\n\n==Name==\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:week|week]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''wice'', ultimately from a [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wik\u014dn-}}'', from a root ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wik-}}'' \"turn, move, change\". The Germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the [[Roman calendar]], perhaps \"succession series\", as suggested by [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''wik\u014d'' translating ''taxis'' \"order\" in [[gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:8.\n\nThe seven-day week is named in many languages by a word derived from \"seven\". The [[archaism]] '''sennight''' (\"seven-night\") preserves the old Germanic practice of reckoning time by nights, as in the more common ''[[fortnight]]'' (\"fourteen-night\").<ref name=worldwidewords>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-sen1.htm sennight] at worldwidewords.org (retrieved 12 January 2017)</ref> '''Hebdomad''' and '''hebdomadal week''' both derive from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''hebdom\u00e1s'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u1f11\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2}}}}, \"a seven\"). The obsolete '''septimane''' is cognate with the [[Romance languages|Romance]] terms derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:septimana|septimana]]'' (\"a seven\").\n\nSlavic has a formation ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/t\u044ad\u044cn\u044c|*t\u044a(\u017e\u044c)d\u044cn\u044c]]'' (Serbian \u0442\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d, Croatian tjedan, Ukrainian \u0442\u0438\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c, Czech ''t\u00fdden'', Polish ''tydzie\u0144''), from ''*t\u044a'' \"this\" + ''*d\u044cn\u044c'' \"day\". Chinese has [[:wikt:\u661f\u671f|\u661f\u671f]], as it were \"[[:wikt:\u661f|planetary]] [[:wikt:\u671f|time unit]]\".\n\n==Definition and duration==\nA week is defined as an interval of exactly seven [[day]]s,{{efn|1=In pre-modern times, days were measured either from sunset to sunset, or from sunrise to sunrise, so that the length of the week (and the day) would be subject to slight variations depending upon the time of year and the observer's geographical latitude.}} so that technically, except at [[daylight saving time]] transitions or [[leap second]]s,\n:1 week = 7 days = 168 hours = 10,080 minutes = 604,800 seconds.\nWith respect to the [[Gregorian calendar]]:\n*1 Gregorian calendar year = 52 weeks + 1 day (2 days in a [[leap year]])\n*1 week = {{frac|1600|6957}} \u2248 22.9984% of an average Gregorian month\n\nIn a [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] mean year, there are 365.2425 days, and thus exactly {{frac|52|71|400}} or 52.1775 weeks (unlike the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]] of 365.25 days or {{frac|52|5|28}} \u2248 52.1786 weeks, which cannot be represented by a finite decimal expansion). There are exactly 20,871 weeks in 400 Gregorian years, so {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} -400}} was a {{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}} just as was {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}.\n\nRelative to the path of the [[Moon]], a week is 23.659% of an average [[lunation]] or 94.637% of an average quarter lunation.\n\nHistorically, the system of [[dominical letter]]s (letters A to G identifying the weekday of the first day of a given year) has been used to facilitate [[determination of the day of the week|calculation of the day of week]].\nThe day of the week can be easily calculated given a date's [[Julian day number]] (JD, i.e. the integer value at [[noon]] [[Universal Time|UT]]):\nAdding one to the [[remainder]] after dividing the Julian day number by seven (JD ''[[modulo operation|modulo]]'' 7 + 1) yields that date's [[ISO 8601]] day of the week. For example, the Julian day number of {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} is {{#expr: floor({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}+.5)}}. Calculating {{math|1={{#expr: floor({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}+.5)}} mod 7 + 1}} yields {{#expr: (floor({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}+.5) mod 7) + 1}}, corresponding to {{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}}<!-- +.5 because the JD is integer at noon UT-->.<ref>Richards, E.

Mill Valley, Calif.: University Science Books. 2013, pp. 592, 618.\nThis is equivalent to saying that JD0, i.e. 1 January 4713 BC of the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], was a Monday.</ref>\n\n==Days of the week==\n{{Main|Names of the days of the week}}\n[[File:Weekday heptagram.ant.png|thumb|Schematic comparison of the ordering of the classical planets (arranged in a circle) and the sequence of days in the week (forming a {7/3} [[heptagram]] within the circle).]]\n\nThe days of the week were originally named for the [[classical planet]]s. This naming system persisted alongside an \"ecclesiastical\" tradition of numbering the days, in [[ecclesiastical Latin]] beginning with ''dominica'' (the [[Lord's Day]]) as the first day. The Greco-Roman gods associated with the classical planets were rendered in their ''[[interpretatio germanica]]'' at some point during the late Roman Empire, yielding the Germanic tradition of names based on indigenous deities.\n\nThe ordering of the weekday names is not the classical order of the planets (by distance in the [[planetary spheres]] model, nor, equivalently, by their apparent speed of movement in the night sky). Instead, the [[planetary hours]] systems resulted in succeeding days being named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing. This characteristic was apparently discussed in [[Plutarch]] in a treatise written in c.

According to the (contemporary) Julian calendar, 6 February 60 was, however, a [[Wednesday]].

In German, the phrase ''heute in acht Tagen'' (literally \"today in eight days\") means one week from today (i.e. on the same weekday). The same is true of the Italian phrase ''oggi otto'' (literally \"today eight\").\n\n==Week numbering==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[ISO 8601]] -->\n{{further|Leap week calendar}}\nWeeks in a Gregorian calendar year can be numbered for each year. This style of numbering is commonly used (for example, by schools and businesses) in some European and Asian countries, but rare elsewhere.\n\n[[ISO 8601]] includes the [[ISO week date]] system, a numbering system for weeks \u2013 each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday\u2013Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). For example, week 1 of 2004 (2004W01) ran from Monday, 29 December 2003 to Sunday, 4 January 2004, because its Thursday was 1 January 2004, whereas week 1 of 2005 (2005W01) ran from Monday, 3 January 2005 to Sunday, 9 January 2005, because its Thursday was 6 January 2005 and so the first Thursday of 2005. The highest week number in a year is either 52 or 53 (it was 53 in the year 2004).

The Gregorian calendar with its irregular month lengths and the traditional seven-day week were used in the Soviet Union during its entire existence, including 1929\u20131940; for example, in the masthead of [[Pravda]], the official Communist newspaper, and in both Soviet calendars displayed here. The traditional names of the seven-day week continued to be used, including \"Resurrection\" (\u0412\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435) for Sunday and \"Sabbath\" (\u0421\u0443\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430) for Saturday, despite the government's [[Marxist\u2013Leninist atheism|official]] [[state atheism|atheism]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons}}\n*[[Names of the days of the week]]\n*[[Workweek and weekend]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Zerubavel |first=Eviatar |title=The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week |date=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd5ZjRsNj4sC |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-98165-9}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n| last = Colson\n| first = Francis Henry\n| authorlink =\n| title = The Week: An Essay on the Origin and Development of the Seven-day Cycle\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| year = 1926\n| oclc = 59110177}}\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=week}}\n\n{{Time topics}}\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Weeks| ]]\n[[Category:Units of time]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Time unit equal to seven days}}\n{{Other uses|Week (disambiguation)|Weeks (disambiguation)|Weekly (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Italian - Bracelet - Walters 41269.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|An Italian [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] bracelet representing the days of the week by their eponymous deities (mid-19th century, [[Walters Art Museum]])]]\n[[File:CLM 14456 71r detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Circular diagrams showing the division of the day and of the week, from a [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] ms.

It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside\u2014although not strictly part of\u2014the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nIn many languages, the '''days of the week''' [[names of the days of the week|are named]] after [[classical planets]] or gods of a [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]]. In English, the names are [[Monday]], [[Tuesday]], [[Wednesday]], [[Thursday]], [[Friday]], [[Saturday]] and [[Sunday]]. Such a week may be called a ''planetary week''.{{cn|date=April 2020}} This is in contrast to the lunar week in the [[Bible]] in which the seven days are simply numbered with the seventh day being kept as a sabbath day.\n\nWhile, for example, the United States, Canada and Japan consider Sunday as the first day of the week, and while the week begins with Saturday in much of the Middle East, the international [[ISO 8601]] standard{{efn|\"ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times\" is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data.}} has Monday as the first day of the week. The ISO standard includes the [[ISO week date]] system, a numbering system for weeks within a given year, where each week starting on a Monday is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday\u2013Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). ISO 8601 assigns numbers to the days of the week, running from 1 to 7 for Monday through to Sunday.\n{|border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ An ISO 8601 week\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n|[[Monday]]||[[Tuesday]]||[[Wednesday]]||[[Thursday]]||[[Friday]]||[[Saturday]]||[[Sunday]]\n|}\n\nThe term \"week\" is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days, such as the [[nundinal cycle]] of the ancient Roman calendar, the \"work week\", or \"school week\" referring only to the days spent on those activities.\n\n{{anchor|Etymology|Names}}\n\n==Name==\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:week|week]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''wice'', ultimately from a [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wik\u014dn-}}'', from a root ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wik-}}'' \"turn, move, change\". The Germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the [[Roman calendar]], perhaps \"succession series\", as suggested by [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''wik\u014d'' translating ''taxis'' \"order\" in [[gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:8.\n\nThe seven-day week is named in many languages by a word derived from \"seven\". The [[archaism]] '''sennight''' (\"seven-night\") preserves the old Germanic practice of reckoning time by nights, as in the more common ''[[fortnight]]'' (\"fourteen-night\").<ref name=worldwidewords>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-sen1.htm sennight] at worldwidewords.org (retrieved 12 January 2017)</ref> '''Hebdomad''' and '''hebdomadal week''' both derive from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''hebdom\u00e1s'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u1f11\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2}}}}, \"a seven\").

There are exactly 20,871 weeks in 400 Gregorian years, so {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} -400}} was a {{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}} just as was {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}.\n\nRelative to the path of the [[Moon]], a week is 23.659% of an average [[lunation]] or 94.637% of an average quarter lunation.\n\nHistorically, the system of [[dominical letter]]s (letters A to G identifying the weekday of the first day of a given year) has been used to facilitate [[determination of the day of the week|calculation of the day of week]].\nThe day of the week can be easily calculated given a date's [[Julian day number]] (JD, i.e. the integer value at [[noon]] [[Universal Time|UT]]):\nAdding one to the [[remainder]] after dividing the Julian day number by seven (JD ''[[modulo operation|modulo]]'' 7 + 1) yields that date's [[ISO 8601]] day of the week. For example, the Julian day number of {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} is {{#expr: floor({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}+.5)}}.

This naming system persisted alongside an \"ecclesiastical\" tradition of numbering the days, in [[ecclesiastical Latin]] beginning with ''dominica'' (the [[Lord's Day]]) as the first day. The Greco-Roman gods associated with the classical planets were rendered in their ''[[interpretatio germanica]]'' at some point during the late Roman Empire, yielding the Germanic tradition of names based on indigenous deities.\n\nThe ordering of the weekday names is not the classical order of the planets (by distance in the [[planetary spheres]] model, nor, equivalently, by their apparent speed of movement in the night sky). Instead, the [[planetary hours]] systems resulted in succeeding days being named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing. This characteristic was apparently discussed in [[Plutarch]] in a treatise written in c. AD 100, which is reported to have addressed the question of ''Why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order?'' (the text of Plutarch's treatise has been lost).<ref>E. G.

This style of numbering is commonly used (for example, by schools and businesses) in some European and Asian countries, but rare elsewhere.\n\n[[ISO 8601]] includes the [[ISO week date]] system, a numbering system for weeks \u2013 each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday\u2013Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). For example, week 1 of 2004 (2004W01) ran from Monday, 29 December 2003 to Sunday, 4 January 2004, because its Thursday was 1 January 2004, whereas week 1 of 2005 (2005W01) ran from Monday, 3 January 2005 to Sunday, 9 January 2005, because its Thursday was 6 January 2005 and so the first Thursday of 2005. The highest week number in a year is either 52 or 53 (it was 53 in the year 2004).

Fronted by singer-songwriter [[Jay Kay]], the band were a prominent component of the London-based funk/jazz movement of the 1990s. Their sound draws from [[List of musical genres of the African diaspora|black music]] of the 1970s, and their lyrics and visual concepts occasionally deal with social and environmental idealism. They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live.

While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]].

They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live. Over the years, Kay has consistently remained as the leader through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band d\u00e9buted with \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\" under [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz records]], which led to Kay signing a record deal with [[S2_Records|Sony Soho<sup>2</sup>]]. While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]].

Instead, they preferred the term \"[[flag officer]]\", in order to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the European navies. During the American Civil War, the US Congress honored [[David Glasgow Farragut]]'s successful assault on the city of New Orleans by creating the rank of rear admiral on July 16, 1862.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard both had a temporary one-star rank of commodore that was used in limited circumstances. By the end of the war, all incumbents had been advanced to the rank of two-star rear admiral and the commodore rank was eliminated in both services. Both the Navy and the Coast Guard divided their rear admirals into \"lower half\" and full rear admirals, or \"upper half\", the former being paid at the same rate as a one-star brigadier general in the [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and the newly independent [[U.S. Air Force]]. Lower-half rear admirals were eventually promoted to full rear admirals, or upper half status, where they would receive pay equivalent to a two-star major general.  However, both categories of rear admiral wore two-star insignia, an issue that was a source of consternation to the other services.\n\nAt the same time, the Navy also bestowed the title of commodore on selected U.S. Navy captains who commanded multiple subordinate units, such as destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons and air wings and air groups not designated as carrier air wings or carrier air groups.  Although not [[flag officer]]s, these officers were entitled to a personal blue and white command pennant containing the initials, acronym abbreviation or numerical designation of their command.<ref>[http://www.google.com/imgres?q=commodore+pennant&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1440&bih=795&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=bSGywyKi1FYoFM:&imgrefurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/cmdpen.html&docid=nH6cBkqGfKw3UM&imgurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/usbrdcp.GIF&w=279&h=216&ei=WZGEUKOgJoq08ATvlYDYBQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=624&vpy=311&dur=494&hovh=172&hovw=223&tx=71&ty=80&sig=116125559521526739827&page=1&tbnh=142&tbnw=184&start=0&ndsp=24&ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:92 Google Image Search]</ref>\n \nIn 1981, {{USPL|97|86}} expanded commodore from a title to an official permanent grade by creating the one-star rank of [[commodore admiral]].<ref name=\"rear admiral\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5501- 10 U.S.C. 5501 Notes]</ref> After only 11 months, the rank was reverted to just commodore but kept the one-star insignia.  However, this caused issues with the Navy due to the difficulty in discriminating those commodores who were flag officers from commodores who were senior captains in certain command positions. Then in 1985, {{USPL|99|145}} renamed commodore to the current grade of rear admiral (lower half) effective on November 8, 1985.<ref name=\"rear admiral\"/> \n\nUp until 1981 all rear admirals wore two stars on their shoulder bars and rank insignia. Since then, rear admirals (lower half) wear one star while rear admirals wear two; verbal address remains \"rear admiral\" for both ranks. On correspondence, where the rear admiral's rank is spelled out, the acronym (LH) and (UH) follows the rear admiral's rank title to distinguish between one and two stars.\n\nBeginning around 2001, the Navy, Coast Guard, and NOAA Corps started using the separate rank abbreviations RDML (one star) and RADM (two stars), while the Public Health Service continued to use the abbreviation RADM for both.<ref>[http://www.usphs.gov/aboutus/uniforms.aspx About the Commissioned Corps Uniforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175033/http://www.usphs.gov/AboutUs/uniforms.aspx |date=2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nAs flag officers, the flags flown for rear admirals of the unrestricted line of the U.S. Navy have one or two white, single-point-up stars on blue fields for the lower half or upper half, respectively. The flags of restricted line officers and staff corps officers have blue stars on a white field. All services officially list the two-star grade as rear admiral and not rear admiral (upper half) as stated by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|8111}} and  {{UnitedStatesCode|37|201}} of the [[United States Code|U.S. Code of law]]. However, the four uniformed services will sometimes list the rank as rear admiral (upper half) to help the general public distinguish between the two grades.<ref>[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=266 Navy.mil Rank Insignia of Navy Commissioned and Warrant Officers]</ref>\n\n== United States Maritime Service ==\nAlthough it exists largely as a maritime training organization, the United States Maritime Service does use the ranks of rear admiral (upper half) and rear admiral (lower half).  By law, the Service has the same rank structure of the United States Coast Guard, but its uniforms are more similar to the United States Navy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 46 USC Subtitle V: Merchant Marine|url = http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title46/subtitle5&edition=prelim|website = uscode.house.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory limits ==\n\nU.S. Code of law explicitly limits the total number of flag officers that may be on active duty at any given time.

Some of these slots are reserved or set by statute. For example, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy is a two-star rear admiral in the Navy.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5149- 10 U.S.C. 5149.

For one-star or two-star positions of office that are reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For the Navy and the Coast Guard, because the one-star and two-star grades are permanent ranks, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board to add their input on the nominee before the nomination can be sent to the Senate for approval. For the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one-star and two-star rank are achieved by appointment from the President, or from their department secretary,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 206] - Assignment of officers</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/207 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 - Grades], ranks, and titles of commissioned corps</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/3028 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 3028] - Positions of importance and responsibility</ref> and do not require senatorial approval.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.679: The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 strikes \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" for all officer appointments]</ref> \n\nThe standard tour length for most rear admiral positions is three years, but some are set at four or more years by statute.

Instead, they preferred the term \"[[flag officer]]\", in order to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the European navies. During the American Civil War, the US Congress honored [[David Glasgow Farragut]]'s successful assault on the city of New Orleans by creating the rank of rear admiral on July 16, 1862.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard both had a temporary one-star rank of commodore that was used in limited circumstances. By the end of the war, all incumbents had been advanced to the rank of two-star rear admiral and the commodore rank was eliminated in both services. Both the Navy and the Coast Guard divided their rear admirals into \"lower half\" and full rear admirals, or \"upper half\", the former being paid at the same rate as a one-star brigadier general in the [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and the newly independent [[U.S. Air Force]]. Lower-half rear admirals were eventually promoted to full rear admirals, or upper half status, where they would receive pay equivalent to a two-star major general.  However, both categories of rear admiral wore two-star insignia, an issue that was a source of consternation to the other services.\n\nAt the same time, the Navy also bestowed the title of commodore on selected U.S. Navy captains who commanded multiple subordinate units, such as destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons and air wings and air groups not designated as carrier air wings or carrier air groups.  Although not [[flag officer]]s, these officers were entitled to a personal blue and white command pennant containing the initials, acronym abbreviation or numerical designation of their command.<ref>[http://www.google.com/imgres?q=commodore+pennant&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1440&bih=795&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=bSGywyKi1FYoFM:&imgrefurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/cmdpen.html&docid=nH6cBkqGfKw3UM&imgurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/usbrdcp.GIF&w=279&h=216&ei=WZGEUKOgJoq08ATvlYDYBQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=624&vpy=311&dur=494&hovh=172&hovw=223&tx=71&ty=80&sig=116125559521526739827&page=1&tbnh=142&tbnw=184&start=0&ndsp=24&ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:92 Google Image Search]</ref>\n \nIn 1981, {{USPL|97|86}} expanded commodore from a title to an official permanent grade by creating the one-star rank of [[commodore admiral]].<ref name=\"rear admiral\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5501- 10 U.S.C. 5501 Notes]</ref> After only 11 months, the rank was reverted to just commodore but kept the one-star insignia.  However, this caused issues with the Navy due to the difficulty in discriminating those commodores who were flag officers from commodores who were senior captains in certain command positions. Then in 1985, {{USPL|99|145}} renamed commodore to the current grade of rear admiral (lower half) effective on November 8, 1985.<ref name=\"rear admiral\"/> \n\nUp until 1981 all rear admirals wore two stars on their shoulder bars and rank insignia. Since then, rear admirals (lower half) wear one star while rear admirals wear two; verbal address remains \"rear admiral\" for both ranks. On correspondence, where the rear admiral's rank is spelled out, the acronym (LH) and (UH) follows the rear admiral's rank title to distinguish between one and two stars.\n\nBeginning around 2001, the Navy, Coast Guard, and NOAA Corps started using the separate rank abbreviations RDML (one star) and RADM (two stars), while the Public Health Service continued to use the abbreviation RADM for both.<ref>[http://www.usphs.gov/aboutus/uniforms.aspx About the Commissioned Corps Uniforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175033/http://www.usphs.gov/AboutUs/uniforms.aspx |date=2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nAs flag officers, the flags flown for rear admirals of the unrestricted line of the U.S. Navy have one or two white, single-point-up stars on blue fields for the lower half or upper half, respectively. The flags of restricted line officers and staff corps officers have blue stars on a white field. All services officially list the two-star grade as rear admiral and not rear admiral (upper half) as stated by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|8111}} and  {{UnitedStatesCode|37|201}} of the [[United States Code|U.S. Code of law]]. However, the four uniformed services will sometimes list the rank as rear admiral (upper half) to help the general public distinguish between the two grades.<ref>[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=266 Navy.mil Rank Insignia of Navy Commissioned and Warrant Officers]</ref>\n\n== United States Maritime Service ==\nAlthough it exists largely as a maritime training organization, the United States Maritime Service does use the ranks of rear admiral (upper half) and rear admiral (lower half).  By law, the Service has the same rank structure of the United States Coast Guard, but its uniforms are more similar to the United States Navy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 46 USC Subtitle V: Merchant Marine|url = http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title46/subtitle5&edition=prelim|website = uscode.house.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory limits ==\n\nU.S. Code of law explicitly limits the total number of flag officers that may be on active duty at any given time.

Some of these slots are reserved or set by statute. For example, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy is a two-star rear admiral in the Navy.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5149- 10 U.S.C. 5149.

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] must then confirm the nominee by a majority vote before the officer can be promoted. Once confirmed, a nominee is promoted once he or she assumes an office that requires or allows an officer to hold that rank. For one-star or two-star positions of office that are reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For the Navy and the Coast Guard, because the one-star and two-star grades are permanent ranks, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board to add their input on the nominee before the nomination can be sent to the Senate for approval. For the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one-star and two-star rank are achieved by appointment from the President, or from their department secretary,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 206] - Assignment of officers</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/207 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 - Grades], ranks, and titles of commissioned corps</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/3028 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 3028] - Positions of importance and responsibility</ref> and do not require senatorial approval.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.679: The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 strikes \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" for all officer appointments]</ref> \n\nThe standard tour length for most rear admiral positions is three years, but some are set at four or more years by statute.

In contrast, Moldavia, Wallachia, and [[Transylvania]], came under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], but conserved fully internal autonomy and, until the 18th century, some external independence. During this period, the Romanian lands were characterized by the slow disappearance of the [[feudalism|feudal]] system and the distinguishment of some rulers like [[Vasile Lupu]] and [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] in Moldavia, [[Matei Basarab]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] in Wallachia, and [[Gabriel Bethlen]] in [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Transylvania]]. At that time the [[Russian Empire]] appeared to become the political and military power which threatened the Romanian principalities.\n\n[[John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John II]], the non-Habsburg [[king of Hungary]], moved his royal court to [[Alba Iulia]] in Transylvania, and after his abdication from the Hungarian throne, he became the first \"[[Prince of Transylvania]]\". His Edict of [[Turda]] was the first decree of [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] in the modern European history (1568). In the aftermath Transylvania was ruled by mostly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Hungarian princes (until the end of the 17th century), and [[Protestantism]] flourished in the region.\n\n[[Michael the Brave]] (Romanian: Mihai Viteazul) was the [[Prince of Wallachia]] (1593\u20131601), of [[Rulers of Transylvania|Transylvania]] (1599\u20131600), and of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavia]] (1600).

In 1699, Transylvania became a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], following the Austrian victory over the Turks. The Habsburgs, in their turn, rapidly expanded their empire: in 1718 a major part of Wallachia, [[Oltenia]], was annexed to the Habsburg monarchy and was only returned in 1739. In 1775, though the Habsburgs later occupied the north-western part of Moldavia, later on called [[Bukovina]], and was incorporated to the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804.

Alongside with that, the political autonomy of the Romanian principalities grew as their rulers were elected for life by a Community Assembly which was made of boyars, a method used to reduce political instability and Ottoman interventions. Following the war, Romanian lands became under Russian occupation until 1834 under the governance of General [[Pavel Kiselyov]]. During his rule the local boyars enacted the first [[Law of Romania|Romanian constitution]].\n\n=== Revolutions of 1848 ===\n[[File:Peles-Castle-Sinaia-Romania.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pele\u015f Castle]], retreat of Romanian monarchs]]\nAs in other European countries, [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 brought up the revolution]] upon Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania, through [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] and his [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandurs]] in the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]]. The goals of the revolutionaries - full independence for Moldavia and Wallachia, and national emancipation in Transylvania - remained unfulfilled, but were the basis of the subsequent revolutions. The uprising helped the population of all three principalities recognize their unity of language and interests; all three Romanian principalities were very close, not only in language, but also [[Geography of Romania|geographically]].\n\nAfter the unsuccessful [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]], the [[Great Powers]] rejected the Romanians' expressed desire to officially unite in a single state, forcing the Romanians to proceed alone their struggle against the Turks. Heavily taxed and badly administered under the Ottoman Empire, in 1859, people's representatives in both Moldavia and Wallachia elected the same \"[[Domnitor]]\" (ruling Prince of the Romanians) : [[Alexander John Cuza|Alexandru Ioan Cuza]].<ref>{{Citation|last =Bobango|first =Gerald J|title =The emergence of the Romanian national Stat\n|publisher =Boulder|year =1979|location =New York|isbn =  978-0-914710-51-6}}</ref>\n\nThus, Romania was created as a [[personal union]] albeit that did not include Transylvania, where the upper class and the aristocracy remained mainly Hungarian, although Romanian nationalist spirit inevitably ran up against the Hungarian nationalism at the end of the 19th century. As in the previous 900 years, Austria-Hungary, especially under the [[History of Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] of 1867, kept the territory firmly in control, even in parts of Transylvania where Romanians constituted a vast majority.\n\n===Status of women===\nIn Romania in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (1750\u20141830s), the exclusion of dowered girls from the family inheritance led to increased cohesion within the nuclear family.  The wife's male relatives controlled the dowry but she retained sole ownership of the dowry and wedding gifts. Her relatives could prosecute the husband for squandering a dowry; wives gained some ability to leave an abusive marriage. The long-term result was a greater legal empowerment of women, while providing economic security to divorced women, widows, and children.<ref>Angela Jianu,  \"Women, Dowries, and Patrimonial Law in Old Regime Romania (c. 1750\u20141830).\" ''Journal of family history'' 34.2 (2009): 189-205.</ref>\n\n== Independence and Kingdom of Romania ==\n{{Main|Romanian War of Independence|Kingdom of Romania|United Principalities}}\n\n[[File:RomaniaBorderHistoryAnnimation 1859-2010.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Timeline of the borders of Romania between 1859 and 2010]]\nIn an 1866 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza|Cuza]] was exiled and replaced by Prince Karl of [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], who became known as [[Charles I of Romania|Prince Carol of Romania]].\nHe was appointed [[Domnitor]] - Ruling Prince of the United Principality of Romania, as Prince Carol of Romania.\n\nRomania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78]] in which it fought on the Russian side.<ref>{{Citation|title =San Stefano Preliminary Treaty|year =1878|url =http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/FOREIGN/stefano.htm|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]],<ref>{{Citation|title =Modern History Sourcebook: The Treaty of Berlin, 1878 - Excerpts on the Balkans|date=13 July 1878|place=Berlin|url =http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1878berlin.html}}</ref> Romania was finally officially recognized as an [[Romanian War of Independence|independent]] state by the [[Great Powers]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Patterson |first=Michelle |title=The Road to Romanian Independence |journal=Canadian Journal of History |date=August 1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_199608/ai_n8755098 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3APatterson+intitle%3AThe+Road+to+Romanian+Independence&as_publication=Canadian+Journal+of+History&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324063246/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_199608/ai_n8755098 |archivedate=March 24, 2008 }}</ref> In return, Romania ceded the district of [[Bessarabia]] to [[Russia]] \"in exchange\" for the access to the ports on the Black Sea shore, and acquired [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1881, the Romanian [[principality]] was raised to a [[monarchy|kingdom]] and on 26 March Prince Carol became King [[Carol I]] of Romania.\n\nThe 1878\u20131914 period was one of [[Kingdom of Romania|stability and progress]] for Romania.

Ceau\u015fescu eventually initiated a project of total reimbursement of the foreign debt. To achieve this goal, he imposed [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|policies that impoverished Romanians and exhausted the Romanian economy]]. The project was completed in 1989, shortly before his overthrow. He greatly extended the authority of the [[Securitate|police state]] and imposed a [[cult of personality]]. These led to a dramatic decrease in Ceau\u015fescu's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and execution in the bloody [[Romanian Revolution]] in [[Revolutions of 1989|December 1989]].\n\nSeduced by Ceau\u015fescu's \"Independent\" foreign policy, Western leaders were slow to turn against a regime that, by the late 1970s, had become increasingly arbitrary, capricious and harsh. Rapid economic growth fueled by foreign credits gradually gave way to wrenching austerity and severe political repression, which became increasingly draconian through the 1980s.\n\n== 1989 Revolution ==\n{{Main|Romanian Revolution}}\n\nThe [[Romanian Revolution]] resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Bucharest]], and brought about the fall of Ceau\u015fescu and the end of the Communist regime in Romania. After a weeklong state of unrest in Timi\u015foara, a [[Ceau\u015fescu's last speech|mass rally]] summoned in Bucharest in support of Ceau\u015fescu on 21 December 1989 turned hostile. The Ceau\u015fescu couple, fleeing Bucharest by helicopter, ended up in the custody of the army.\n\nAfter being [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu|tried and convicted]] by a [[kangaroo court]] for [[genocide]] and other crimes, they were executed on 25 December 1989. The events of this revolution remain to this day a matter of debate, with many conflicting theories as to the motivations and even actions of some of the main players.\n\n[[Ion Iliescu]], a former Communist Party official marginalized by Ceau\u015fescu, attained national recognition as the leader of an impromptu governing coalition, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN) that proclaimed the establishment of democracy and civil liberties on 22 December 1989. The Communist Party was initially outlawed by Ion Iliescu, but he soon revoked that decision; as a consequence, Communism is not outlawed in Romania today. However, Ceau\u015fescu's most controversial measures, such as bans on [[abortion]] and [[contraception]], were among the first laws to be changed after the Revolution, and their legality has not been widely questioned since then.\n\n== Transition to free market (1990\u20132004) ==\n{{Undue weight section|date=April 2019}}\n{{Main|History of Romania since 1989}}\n\nAfter the fall of Ceau\u015fescu, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), led by [[Ion Iliescu]], took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures.<ref>{{Citation| last=Carothers| first= Thomas |title= Romania: The Political Background  |url= http://www.idea.int/publications/country/upload/Romania,%20The%20Political%20Background.pdf |quote= This seven-year period can be characterized as a gradualistic, often ambiguous transition away from communist rule towards democracy.| postscript=  }}</ref><ref>{{Citation| work=Transitions World Politics |volume=50 |number=2 |date=January 1998 |pages=203\u2013234| last=Hellman| first=Joel| title= Winners Take All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Postcommunist}}</ref> A university professor with strong family roots in the Communist Party, [[Petre Roman]], was named prime minister of the new government, which consisted mainly of former communist officials.

The FSN secured two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. Though most protesters left the University Square after the parliamentary elections provided the government with a strong majority, a minority did not recognize the results, which they deemed undemocratic, and were asking for the exclusion from the political life of the former high-ranking Communist Party members. The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, with some of the protesters attacking the police headquarters, national television station, and the Foreign Ministry. After the police failed to bring the demonstrators to order, [[Ion Iliescu]] called on the \"men of good will\" to come and defend the State institutions in Bucharest.<ref>{{Citation| last=Bohlen | first=Celestine |title = Evolution in Europe; Romanian miners invade Bucharest|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D6113DF936A25755C0A966958260|quote= Responding to an emergency appeal by President Ion Iliescu, thousands of miners from northern Romania descended on the capital city today | work=The New York Times | date=15 June 1990 | accessdate=2010-05-04| postscript= }}</ref><ref>{{Citation| title= Romania, Human Rights Developments|url= https://www.hrw.org/reports/1990/WR90/HELSINKI.BOU-02.htm| quote= \"The most dramatic example was then President-elect Iliescu's call on 13 June for miners to come to Bucharest to restore order\"}}</ref> Various worker groups from Romania's industrial platforms responded, some of whom engaged in altercations with the protesters.

Later Parliamentary inquiries showed that members of the government intelligence services were involved in the instigation and manipulation of both the protesters and the miners, and in June 1994 a Bucharest court found two former Securitate officers guilty of ransacking and stealing $100,000 from the house of a leading opposition politician.<ref name=\"Deletant\"/><ref name=\"Baleanu\"/> Petre Roman's government fell in late September 1991, when the miners returned to Bucharest to demand higher salaries. A technocrat, [[Theodor Stolojan]], was appointed to head an interim government until new elections could be held.\n\n=== New constitution ===\nIn December 1991, a new constitution was drafted and subsequently adopted, after a popular referendum, which, however, attracted criticism from international observers. The constitution was most recently revised by a national referendum on 18\u201319 October 2003, and took effect on 29 October 2003. Among the most significant revisions are the extension of the presidential mandate from four years to five, and the guaranteed protection of private property.\n\nMarch 1992 marked the split of the FSN into two groups: the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic National Front]] (FDSN), led by Ion Iliescu and the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), led by Petre Roman. Iliescu won the presidential elections in September 1992 by a clear margin, and his FDSN won the general elections held at the same time. [[Red Quadrilateral|With parliamentary support]] from the nationalist PUNR ([[Romanian National Unity Party]]), PRM ([[Greater Romania Party]]), and the ex-communist PSM (Socialist Workers' Party), a new government was formed in November 1992 under Prime Minister [[Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103roiu]], an economist. The FDSN changed its name to [[Party of Social Democracy in Romania]] (PDSR) in July 1993.\n\nThe subsequent disintegration of the FSN produced several political parties including the Romanian Democrat Social Party (PDSR, later [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]], PSD), the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD) and the ApR ([[List of political parties in Romania#Other post-1989 parties|Alliance for Romania]]). The PDSR party governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state.\n\n[[Emil Constantinescu]] of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention|Democratic Convention]] (CDR) emerged as the winner of the second round of the 1996 presidential elections and replaced Iliescu as chief of state. The PDSR won the largest number of seats in Parliament, but was unable to form a viable coalition. Constituent parties of the CDR joined the Democratic Party (PD), the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and the [[Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania]] (UDMR) to form a centrist coalition government, holding 60% of the seats in Parliament.\n\nThis coalition of sorts frequently struggled for survival, as decisions were often delayed by long periods of negotiations among the involved parties. Nevertheless, this coalition was able to implement several critical reforms. The new coalition government, under prime minister [[Victor Ciorbea]] remained in office until March 1998, when [[Radu Vasile]] (PN\u0162CD) took over as prime minister. The former governor of the National Bank, [[Mugur Is\u0103rescu]], eventually replaced [[Radu Vasile]] as head of the government.\n\nThe [[2000 Romanian general election|2000 elections]], brought Iliescu's PDSR, known as [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) after the merger with the PSDR, back to power. Iliescu won a third term as the country's president. [[Adrian N\u0103stase]] became the prime minister of the newly formed government.\n\nIn 2004 [[Traian B\u0103sescu]] was elected president, with an electoral coalition called [[Justice and Truth|Justice and Truth Alliance]] (DA). The government was formed by a larger coalition which also included the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] and the [[UDMR|ethnic Hungarian party]].\n\n== NATO and European Union membership (2004\u2013present) ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}\n{{Main|Accession of Romania to the European Union|Romanian membership of the European Union|2012 Romanian protests}}\n\nPost\u2013[[Cold War]] Romania developed closer ties with [[Western Europe]], eventually joining [[NATO]] in 2004.<ref>{{Citation|title =NATO update: NATO welcomes seven new members|url =http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/04-april/e0402a.htm}}</ref>\n\nPresidential and parliamentary elections took place again on 28 November 2004.

Alongside with that, the political autonomy of the Romanian principalities grew as their rulers were elected for life by a Community Assembly which was made of boyars, a method used to reduce political instability and Ottoman interventions. Following the war, Romanian lands became under Russian occupation until 1834 under the governance of General [[Pavel Kiselyov]].

The wife's male relatives controlled the dowry but she retained sole ownership of the dowry and wedding gifts. Her relatives could prosecute the husband for squandering a dowry; wives gained some ability to leave an abusive marriage. The long-term result was a greater legal empowerment of women, while providing economic security to divorced women, widows, and children.<ref>Angela Jianu,  \"Women, Dowries, and Patrimonial Law in Old Regime Romania (c. 1750\u20141830).\" ''Journal of family history'' 34.2 (2009): 189-205.</ref>\n\n== Independence and Kingdom of Romania ==\n{{Main|Romanian War of Independence|Kingdom of Romania|United Principalities}}\n\n[[File:RomaniaBorderHistoryAnnimation 1859-2010.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Timeline of the borders of Romania between 1859 and 2010]]\nIn an 1866 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'', [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza|Cuza]] was exiled and replaced by Prince Karl of [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], who became known as [[Charles I of Romania|Prince Carol of Romania]].\nHe was appointed [[Domnitor]] - Ruling Prince of the United Principality of Romania, as Prince Carol of Romania.\n\nRomania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78]] in which it fought on the Russian side.<ref>{{Citation|title =San Stefano Preliminary Treaty|year =1878|url =http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/FOREIGN/stefano.htm|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]],<ref>{{Citation|title =Modern History Sourcebook: The Treaty of Berlin, 1878 - Excerpts on the Balkans|date=13 July 1878|place=Berlin|url =http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1878berlin.html}}</ref> Romania was finally officially recognized as an [[Romanian War of Independence|independent]] state by the [[Great Powers]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Patterson |first=Michelle |title=The Road to Romanian Independence |journal=Canadian Journal of History |date=August 1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_199608/ai_n8755098 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3APatterson+intitle%3AThe+Road+to+Romanian+Independence&as_publication=Canadian+Journal+of+History&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324063246/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_199608/ai_n8755098 |archivedate=March 24, 2008 }}</ref> In return, Romania ceded the district of [[Bessarabia]] to [[Russia]] \"in exchange\" for the access to the ports on the Black Sea shore, and acquired [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1881, the Romanian [[principality]] was raised to a [[monarchy|kingdom]] and on 26 March Prince Carol became King [[Carol I]] of Romania.\n\nThe 1878\u20131914 period was one of [[Kingdom of Romania|stability and progress]] for Romania.

Ceau\u015fescu eventually initiated a project of total reimbursement of the foreign debt. To achieve this goal, he imposed [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|policies that impoverished Romanians and exhausted the Romanian economy]]. The project was completed in 1989, shortly before his overthrow. He greatly extended the authority of the [[Securitate|police state]] and imposed a [[cult of personality]]. These led to a dramatic decrease in Ceau\u015fescu's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and execution in the bloody [[Romanian Revolution]] in [[Revolutions of 1989|December 1989]].\n\nSeduced by Ceau\u015fescu's \"Independent\" foreign policy, Western leaders were slow to turn against a regime that, by the late 1970s, had become increasingly arbitrary, capricious and harsh. Rapid economic growth fueled by foreign credits gradually gave way to wrenching austerity and severe political repression, which became increasingly draconian through the 1980s.\n\n== 1989 Revolution ==\n{{Main|Romanian Revolution}}\n\nThe [[Romanian Revolution]] resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Bucharest]], and brought about the fall of Ceau\u015fescu and the end of the Communist regime in Romania. After a weeklong state of unrest in Timi\u015foara, a [[Ceau\u015fescu's last speech|mass rally]] summoned in Bucharest in support of Ceau\u015fescu on 21 December 1989 turned hostile. The Ceau\u015fescu couple, fleeing Bucharest by helicopter, ended up in the custody of the army.\n\nAfter being [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu|tried and convicted]] by a [[kangaroo court]] for [[genocide]] and other crimes, they were executed on 25 December 1989. The events of this revolution remain to this day a matter of debate, with many conflicting theories as to the motivations and even actions of some of the main players.\n\n[[Ion Iliescu]], a former Communist Party official marginalized by Ceau\u015fescu, attained national recognition as the leader of an impromptu governing coalition, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN) that proclaimed the establishment of democracy and civil liberties on 22 December 1989. The Communist Party was initially outlawed by Ion Iliescu, but he soon revoked that decision; as a consequence, Communism is not outlawed in Romania today. However, Ceau\u015fescu's most controversial measures, such as bans on [[abortion]] and [[contraception]], were among the first laws to be changed after the Revolution, and their legality has not been widely questioned since then.\n\n== Transition to free market (1990\u20132004) ==\n{{Undue weight section|date=April 2019}}\n{{Main|History of Romania since 1989}}\n\nAfter the fall of Ceau\u015fescu, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), led by [[Ion Iliescu]], took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures.<ref>{{Citation| last=Carothers| first= Thomas |title= Romania: The Political Background  |url= http://www.idea.int/publications/country/upload/Romania,%20The%20Political%20Background.pdf |quote= This seven-year period can be characterized as a gradualistic, often ambiguous transition away from communist rule towards democracy.| postscript=  }}</ref><ref>{{Citation| work=Transitions World Politics |volume=50 |number=2 |date=January 1998 |pages=203\u2013234| last=Hellman| first=Joel| title= Winners Take All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Postcommunist}}</ref> A university professor with strong family roots in the Communist Party, [[Petre Roman]], was named prime minister of the new government, which consisted mainly of former communist officials.

Presidential and parliamentary elections were held on 20 May 1990. Taking advantage of FSN's tight control of the national radio and television, Iliescu won 85% of the vote. The FSN secured two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. Though most protesters left the University Square after the parliamentary elections provided the government with a strong majority, a minority did not recognize the results, which they deemed undemocratic, and were asking for the exclusion from the political life of the former high-ranking Communist Party members. The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, with some of the protesters attacking the police headquarters, national television station, and the Foreign Ministry. After the police failed to bring the demonstrators to order, [[Ion Iliescu]] called on the \"men of good will\" to come and defend the State institutions in Bucharest.<ref>{{Citation| last=Bohlen | first=Celestine |title = Evolution in Europe; Romanian miners invade Bucharest|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D6113DF936A25755C0A966958260|quote= Responding to an emergency appeal by President Ion Iliescu, thousands of miners from northern Romania descended on the capital city today | work=The New York Times | date=15 June 1990 | accessdate=2010-05-04| postscript= }}</ref><ref>{{Citation| title= Romania, Human Rights Developments|url= https://www.hrw.org/reports/1990/WR90/HELSINKI.BOU-02.htm| quote= \"The most dramatic example was then President-elect Iliescu's call on 13 June for miners to come to Bucharest to restore order\"}}</ref> Various worker groups from Romania's industrial platforms responded, some of whom engaged in altercations with the protesters.

Later Parliamentary inquiries showed that members of the government intelligence services were involved in the instigation and manipulation of both the protesters and the miners, and in June 1994 a Bucharest court found two former Securitate officers guilty of ransacking and stealing $100,000 from the house of a leading opposition politician.<ref name=\"Deletant\"/><ref name=\"Baleanu\"/> Petre Roman's government fell in late September 1991, when the miners returned to Bucharest to demand higher salaries. A technocrat, [[Theodor Stolojan]], was appointed to head an interim government until new elections could be held.\n\n=== New constitution ===\nIn December 1991, a new constitution was drafted and subsequently adopted, after a popular referendum, which, however, attracted criticism from international observers. The constitution was most recently revised by a national referendum on 18\u201319 October 2003, and took effect on 29 October 2003. Among the most significant revisions are the extension of the presidential mandate from four years to five, and the guaranteed protection of private property.\n\nMarch 1992 marked the split of the FSN into two groups: the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic National Front]] (FDSN), led by Ion Iliescu and the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), led by Petre Roman. Iliescu won the presidential elections in September 1992 by a clear margin, and his FDSN won the general elections held at the same time. [[Red Quadrilateral|With parliamentary support]] from the nationalist PUNR ([[Romanian National Unity Party]]), PRM ([[Greater Romania Party]]), and the ex-communist PSM (Socialist Workers' Party), a new government was formed in November 1992 under Prime Minister [[Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103roiu]], an economist. The FDSN changed its name to [[Party of Social Democracy in Romania]] (PDSR) in July 1993.\n\nThe subsequent disintegration of the FSN produced several political parties including the Romanian Democrat Social Party (PDSR, later [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]], PSD), the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD) and the ApR ([[List of political parties in Romania#Other post-1989 parties|Alliance for Romania]]). The PDSR party governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state.\n\n[[Emil Constantinescu]] of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention|Democratic Convention]] (CDR) emerged as the winner of the second round of the 1996 presidential elections and replaced Iliescu as chief of state. The PDSR won the largest number of seats in Parliament, but was unable to form a viable coalition. Constituent parties of the CDR joined the Democratic Party (PD), the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and the [[Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania]] (UDMR) to form a centrist coalition government, holding 60% of the seats in Parliament.\n\nThis coalition of sorts frequently struggled for survival, as decisions were often delayed by long periods of negotiations among the involved parties. Nevertheless, this coalition was able to implement several critical reforms. The new coalition government, under prime minister [[Victor Ciorbea]] remained in office until March 1998, when [[Radu Vasile]] (PN\u0162CD) took over as prime minister. The former governor of the National Bank, [[Mugur Is\u0103rescu]], eventually replaced [[Radu Vasile]] as head of the government.\n\nThe [[2000 Romanian general election|2000 elections]], brought Iliescu's PDSR, known as [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) after the merger with the PSDR, back to power. Iliescu won a third term as the country's president. [[Adrian N\u0103stase]] became the prime minister of the newly formed government.\n\nIn 2004 [[Traian B\u0103sescu]] was elected president, with an electoral coalition called [[Justice and Truth|Justice and Truth Alliance]] (DA). The government was formed by a larger coalition which also included the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] and the [[UDMR|ethnic Hungarian party]].\n\n== NATO and European Union membership (2004\u2013present) ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}\n{{Main|Accession of Romania to the European Union|Romanian membership of the European Union|2012 Romanian protests}}\n\nPost\u2013[[Cold War]] Romania developed closer ties with [[Western Europe]], eventually joining [[NATO]] in 2004.<ref>{{Citation|title =NATO update: NATO welcomes seven new members|url =http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/04-april/e0402a.htm}}</ref>\n\nPresidential and parliamentary elections took place again on 28 November 2004.

In December 2004, the new coalition government (PD, PNL, PUR [[Romanian Humanist Party]] - which eventually changed its name to [[Romanian Conservative Party]] and UDMR), was sworn in under Prime Minister T\u0103riceanu.\n[[File:Protest against corruption - Bucharest 2017 - Piata Universitatii - 5.jpg|thumb|Romania has seen large waves of protests against judicial reforms during the [[2017\u20132019 Romanian protests]].]]\n\nThe country applied in June 1993 for membership in the [[European Union]] (EU).

For example, hunters assure that they were much less willing to hunt in areas where [[African wild dogs]] or [[cheetahs]] were illegally shot than their hunting operators perceived, and they also showed greater concern for social issues than their operators realized, with a huge willingness to hunt in areas were local people lived and benefited from hunting (Fig.1). Eighty-six percent of hunters told the researchers they preferred hunting in an area where they knew that a portion of the proceeds went back into local communities.<ref name=\"conservationmagazine.org\" /> A certification system could therefore allow hunters to select those operators who benefit local people and conduct themselves in a conservation-friendly manner.<ref name=\"lindsey1\" />\n\n=== In America ===\nCougar hunting quotas have had a negative effect on the animals' population.{{Clarify|date=December 2016}} According to Robert Wieglus, director of Large Carnivore Conservation Lab at Washington State University, when too many cougars are killed demographic issues can be seen in the cat's population. The male cougar is extremely territorial and will often seek out females in the territory to both mate and kill any cubs to ensure room for their own offspring. Oftentimes these are young \"teenage\" males who are hormonal and unpredictable.\n\nThese \"teenage\" lions are mostly responsible for killed livestock and unwanted human interaction. In addition, they often drive females with cubs into hiding or new territory, forcing the females to hunt new prey they did not before.\n\n\"Basically the bottom line was this heavy hunting of cougars was actually causing all the problems we were seeing\", Wielgus said of his work in Washington.<ref name=\"Cruise\">{{Cite web|title = Is Trophy Hunting Helping Save African Elephants?|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151715-conservation-trophy-hunting-elephants-tusks-poaching-zimbabwe-namibia/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-11-23|first = Adam|last = Cruise|date = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n== Economic influence ==\n{{unbalanced section|September=2015|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== Perceived economic benefits of trophy hunting ===\nAccording to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], trophy hunting \"provides an economic incentive\" for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting \"reduces the threat of the species' extinction\".<ref>http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-17432.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-hunting-endangered-animals-save-the-species/ | title=Can hunting endangered animals save the species?}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alces alces elan trophee chateau Tanlay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Moose]] head and deer [[antler]]s mounted as hunting trophies]]\nAccording to Dr G.C. Dry, former President of Wildlife Ranching South Africa, wildlife ranches have contributed greatly to the South African economy. In his paper \"COMMERCIAL WILDLIFE RANCHING\u2019S CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREEN ECONOMY\", he states that \"commercial wildlife ranching is about\nappropriate land-use and rural development; it is less about animals per se, not a white affluent issue, not a conservation at-all-cost\nissue, but about economic sustainability\".<ref>http://www.sawma.co.za/images/Dry_Gert_Full_paper.pdf</ref> Dr Dry's paper concludes that \"It is a land-use option that is\necologically appropriate, economically sustainable, politically sensitive, and finally, socially just\", however no references or sources are provided for the data used.\n\nThe [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] reports in \"The baby and the bathwater:\ntrophy hunting, conservation and rural livelihoods\", that trophy hunting, when well-managed, can be sustainable and generate significant economic incentives for the conservation of target species, but that there are valid concerns about the legality, sustainability and ethics of some hunting practices. The paper concludes that \"in some contexts, there may be valid and\nfeasible alternatives to trophy hunting that can deliver the above-mentioned benefits, but identifying, funding and implementing these requires genuine consultation and engagement with affected governments, the private sector and communities.<ref>https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/trophy_hunting_conservation_and_rural_livelihoods.pdf</ref>\n\n== Regulations, ban and effects ==\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service imposed a ban on imports.

''[[National Geographic]]'', for example, published a report in 2015 which says government corruption, especially in Zimbabwe, prevents elephant hunting fees from going towards any conservation efforts, with authorities keeping the fees for themselves. Governments also take more wildlife areas to profit from poaching and trophy hunting.

The removal the most significant animals (because of the size of their horns or mane for example) can severely affect the health of a species population. As Dr Rob Knell states 'Because these high-quality males with large secondary sexual traits tend to father a high proportion of the offspring, their 'good genes' can spread rapidly, so populations of strongly sexually selected animals can adapt quickly to new environments. Removing these males reverses this effect and could have serious and unintended consequences. If the population is having to adapt to a new environment and you remove even a small proportion of these high quality males, you could drive it to extinction.'<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42152393|title=Trophy hunting removes 'good genes'|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2017-11-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nCited from [https://web.archive.org/web/20151123080850/http://www.league.org.uk/search?searchTerm=ecotourism%20can%20earn%20local%20communities The League Against Cruel Sports] \"A November 2004 study by the University of Port Elizabeth estimated that eco-tourism on private game reserves generated more than 15 times the income of livestock or game rearing or overseas hunting.

The trophy is the animal or part of the animal kept, and usually displayed, to represent the success of the hunt. The game sought is typically a large or impressively ornamented male, such as one having large horns or antlers. Generally, only parts of the animal are kept as a trophies (usually the head, skin, horns or antlers) and the carcass itself is used for food.\n\nTrophies are often displayed in the hunter's home or office, and often in specially designed \"trophy rooms\", sometimes called \"game rooms\" or \"gun rooms\", in which the hunter's weaponry is displayed as well.<ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/news/article.asp?docKey=600-200910110625KRTRIB__BUSNEWS_62982-2SO76MJGKK56MUPV67QJKEVUF2&params=timestamp%7C%7C10/11/2009%206:25%20AM%20ET%7C%7Cheadline%7C%7COn%20the%20hunt%20for%20a%20gun%20room%3F%3A%20Business%20celebrates%20a%20love%20of%20firearms%2C%20hunting%20big%20animals%20%5BThe%20Hutchinson%20News%2C%20Kan.%5D%7C%7CdocSource%7C%7CKnight%20Ridder/Tribune%7C%7Cprovider%7C%7CACQUIREMEDIA&ric=MHP Business Week] On the hunt for a gun room?: Business celebrates a love of firearms, hunting big animals, Knight Ridder, 10/11/2009 (retrieved 10/11/2009)</ref>\n\nTrophy hunting has both firm supporters and strong opponents.

The male cougar is extremely territorial and will often seek out females in the territory to both mate and kill any cubs to ensure room for their own offspring. Oftentimes these are young \"teenage\" males who are hormonal and unpredictable.\n\nThese \"teenage\" lions are mostly responsible for killed livestock and unwanted human interaction. In addition, they often drive females with cubs into hiding or new territory, forcing the females to hunt new prey they did not before.\n\n\"Basically the bottom line was this heavy hunting of cougars was actually causing all the problems we were seeing\", Wielgus said of his work in Washington.<ref name=\"Cruise\">{{Cite web|title = Is Trophy Hunting Helping Save African Elephants?|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151715-conservation-trophy-hunting-elephants-tusks-poaching-zimbabwe-namibia/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-11-23|first = Adam|last = Cruise|date = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n== Economic influence ==\n{{unbalanced section|September=2015|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== Perceived economic benefits of trophy hunting ===\nAccording to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], trophy hunting \"provides an economic incentive\" for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting \"reduces the threat of the species' extinction\".<ref>http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-17432.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-hunting-endangered-animals-save-the-species/ | title=Can hunting endangered animals save the species?}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alces alces elan trophee chateau Tanlay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Moose]] head and deer [[antler]]s mounted as hunting trophies]]\nAccording to Dr G.C.

In his paper \"COMMERCIAL WILDLIFE RANCHING\u2019S CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREEN ECONOMY\", he states that \"commercial wildlife ranching is about\nappropriate land-use and rural development; it is less about animals per se, not a white affluent issue, not a conservation at-all-cost\nissue, but about economic sustainability\".<ref>http://www.sawma.co.za/images/Dry_Gert_Full_paper.pdf</ref> Dr Dry's paper concludes that \"It is a land-use option that is\necologically appropriate, economically sustainable, politically sensitive, and finally, socially just\", however no references or sources are provided for the data used.\n\nThe [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] reports in \"The baby and the bathwater:\ntrophy hunting, conservation and rural livelihoods\", that trophy hunting, when well-managed, can be sustainable and generate significant economic incentives for the conservation of target species, but that there are valid concerns about the legality, sustainability and ethics of some hunting practices.

The removal the most significant animals (because of the size of their horns or mane for example) can severely affect the health of a species population. As Dr Rob Knell states 'Because these high-quality males with large secondary sexual traits tend to father a high proportion of the offspring, their 'good genes' can spread rapidly, so populations of strongly sexually selected animals can adapt quickly to new environments. Removing these males reverses this effect and could have serious and unintended consequences. If the population is having to adapt to a new environment and you remove even a small proportion of these high quality males, you could drive it to extinction.'<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42152393|title=Trophy hunting removes 'good genes'|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2017-11-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nCited from [https://web.archive.org/web/20151123080850/http://www.league.org.uk/search?searchTerm=ecotourism%20can%20earn%20local%20communities The League Against Cruel Sports] \"A November 2004 study by the University of Port Elizabeth estimated that eco-tourism on private game reserves generated more than 15 times the income of livestock or game rearing or overseas hunting.

Further reference to the incident was made in the India special, where Hammond \"accidentally\" painted a [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]] on his car after he intended to paint an [[Flag of India|Indian one]]. The incident was made reference to yet again in the second episode of series 19, in which the presenters had to race three high-performance cars from [[Los Angeles]] to the Mexican border, where the last person to arrive would have to do a review of the MXT in an upcoming episode, which aired as part of the fourth episode of series 19.\n\nHowever the UK broadcast regulator Ofcom cleared the programme due to its \"comedic intent and the context\":<ref name=ofcom>{{cite news|title=Broadcast Bulletin Issue number 179 04/04/11|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb179/|work=[[Ofcom]]|date=4 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In this case, Ofcom took into account that ''Top Gear'' is well known for its irreverent style and sometimes outspoken humour, as well as the regular format of the studio banter between the three presenters. We considered that viewers of ''Top Gear'' were likely to be aware that the programme frequently uses national stereotypes as a comedic trope and that there were few, if any, nationalities that had not at some point been the subject of the presenters\u2019 mockery throughout the history of this long running programme. For example, this same episode featured a competition between the UK\u2019s ''Top Gear'' presenters and their Australian counterparts, throughout which the Australians were ridiculed for various national traits.\n\nIn this instance, therefore, Ofcom considered that the majority of the audience would be familiar with the presenters\u2019 approach to mocking, playground-style humour, and would have considered that applying that approach to national stereotypes was in keeping with the programme\u2019s usual content, and the presenters\u2019 typical style. Ofcom was of the view that the majority of the audience would therefore be likely to have understood that the comments were being made for comic effect.</blockquote>\n\n===Argentina===\n\nIn September and October 2014, the three presenters and a crew of 29 people were recording the ''[[Patagonia Special]]'' in [[Argentina]], featuring three cars\u2014a [[Porsche 928|Porsche 928 GT]], a [[Lotus Esprit]] and a [[Ford Mustang|Ford Mustang Mach&nbsp;I]].

May later stated that, prior to flying back to [[UK|Britain]], he and the other presenters had assisted in planning possible [[airlift]]s if the journey to the border became too dangerous.

He mumbles through that part of the rhyme, and the ''Daily Mirror'' accused him of mumbling \"nigger\". In the aired version of the review, he says the word 'teacher' instead of the racial epithet.\n\nAfter denying the incident, once video evidence surfaced, Clarkson issued the following apology, though maintaining that he did not use the word.\n\n<blockquote>\"Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception. A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear in which I quote the rhyme \"eeny, meeny, miny, moe\". Of course, I was well aware that in the best-known version of this rhyme there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid. The full rushes show that I did three takes. In two, I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third I replaced it altogether with the word teacher. Now when I viewed this footage several weeks later I realised that in one of the mumbled versions if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe and I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted.\"\n\n\"I have here the note that was sent at the time to the production office and it says: \"I didn't use the N-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. Is there another take that we could use?\"\n\n\"Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word, as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for the fact my efforts obviously weren't quite good enough, thank you.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/01/jeremy-clarkson-begs-forgiveness-n-word-top-gear|title=Jeremy Clarkson 'begs forgiveness' over N-word footage|first1=Josh|last1=Halliday|first2=Nicholas|last2=Watt|first3=Kevin|last3=Rawlinson|date=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough this incident happened before the 'slope' comment in the Burma special, it did not surface until afterwards and the combined complaints caused many public figures to call for Clarkson to be fired and ultimately resulted in a 'final warning' from the BBC regarding racist remarks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/video-watch-jeremy-clarkson-use-3481201|title=Video: Watch Jeremy Clarkson use n-word in unseen Top Gear footage|first=David|last=Collins|date=1 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Series 21===\n\nThe ''Top Gear'' presenters go across Burma and Thailand in lorries with the goal of building a bridge over the river Kwai.

Further reference to the incident was made in the India special, where Hammond \"accidentally\" painted a [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]] on his car after he intended to paint an [[Flag of India|Indian one]]. The incident was made reference to yet again in the second episode of series 19, in which the presenters had to race three high-performance cars from [[Los Angeles]] to the Mexican border, where the last person to arrive would have to do a review of the MXT in an upcoming episode, which aired as part of the fourth episode of series 19.\n\nHowever the UK broadcast regulator Ofcom cleared the programme due to its \"comedic intent and the context\":<ref name=ofcom>{{cite news|title=Broadcast Bulletin Issue number 179 04/04/11|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb179/|work=[[Ofcom]]|date=4 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In this case, Ofcom took into account that ''Top Gear'' is well known for its irreverent style and sometimes outspoken humour, as well as the regular format of the studio banter between the three presenters. We considered that viewers of ''Top Gear'' were likely to be aware that the programme frequently uses national stereotypes as a comedic trope and that there were few, if any, nationalities that had not at some point been the subject of the presenters\u2019 mockery throughout the history of this long running programme. For example, this same episode featured a competition between the UK\u2019s ''Top Gear'' presenters and their Australian counterparts, throughout which the Australians were ridiculed for various national traits.\n\nIn this instance, therefore, Ofcom considered that the majority of the audience would be familiar with the presenters\u2019 approach to mocking, playground-style humour, and would have considered that applying that approach to national stereotypes was in keeping with the programme\u2019s usual content, and the presenters\u2019 typical style. Ofcom was of the view that the majority of the audience would therefore be likely to have understood that the comments were being made for comic effect.</blockquote>\n\n===Argentina===\n\nIn September and October 2014, the three presenters and a crew of 29 people were recording the ''[[Patagonia Special]]'' in [[Argentina]], featuring three cars\u2014a [[Porsche 928|Porsche 928 GT]], a [[Lotus Esprit]] and a [[Ford Mustang|Ford Mustang Mach&nbsp;I]].

Believing that the presenters were the main targets of the controversy, the crew decided to send Clarkson, May, Hammond and the women from the crew to [[Buenos Aires]], while the rest would drive the cars and their equipment to the border into Chile. May later stated that, prior to flying back to [[UK|Britain]], he and the other presenters had assisted in planning possible [[airlift]]s if the journey to the border became too dangerous.

However, one of their spoof ads saw crowds of people leaving [[Warsaw]] in terror on buses and trains, because of the imminent [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]]. At the end of the advert, Clarkson announced \"Volkswagen Scirocco TDI: Berlin to Warsaw in one tank\". The advert was uploaded to [[YouTube]] minutes after its broadcast, spurring angry comments from Polish viewers. A spokeswoman for the show told the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that the BBC had only received a handful of complaints, but complaints submitted to national broadcast watchdog [[Ofcom]] were expected to be higher.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,28383,25885190-10229,00.html/ |title=Jeremy Clarkson adds Polish to outraged ranks|publisher=News.com.au |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> Complaints were also received for three other incidents in the programme: a remake of a VW advertisement, in which a suicide is shown on-screen; Clarkson mocking people who have [[autism]], and the use of the word \"[[pikey]]\", which Clarkson claims to be someone who sells \"pegs and heather\" to describe drivers of the [[HSV Clubsport|Vauxhall VXR8 Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/06/top-gear/ | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jodie | last=Matthews | title=Top Gear goes backwards | date=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Series 15===\n\nIn a conversation about women distracting the presenters while driving, Clarkson said he recently saw a woman wearing a burka who \"tripped over the pavement\" and revealed a \"red g-string and stockings\".

He mumbles through that part of the rhyme, and the ''Daily Mirror'' accused him of mumbling \"nigger\". In the aired version of the review, he says the word 'teacher' instead of the racial epithet.\n\nAfter denying the incident, once video evidence surfaced, Clarkson issued the following apology, though maintaining that he did not use the word.\n\n<blockquote>\"Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception. A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear in which I quote the rhyme \"eeny, meeny, miny, moe\". Of course, I was well aware that in the best-known version of this rhyme there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid. The full rushes show that I did three takes. In two, I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third I replaced it altogether with the word teacher. Now when I viewed this footage several weeks later I realised that in one of the mumbled versions if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe and I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted.\"\n\n\"I have here the note that was sent at the time to the production office and it says: \"I didn't use the N-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. Is there another take that we could use?\"\n\n\"Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word, as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for the fact my efforts obviously weren't quite good enough, thank you.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/01/jeremy-clarkson-begs-forgiveness-n-word-top-gear|title=Jeremy Clarkson 'begs forgiveness' over N-word footage|first1=Josh|last1=Halliday|first2=Nicholas|last2=Watt|first3=Kevin|last3=Rawlinson|date=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough this incident happened before the 'slope' comment in the Burma special, it did not surface until afterwards and the combined complaints caused many public figures to call for Clarkson to be fired and ultimately resulted in a 'final warning' from the BBC regarding racist remarks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/video-watch-jeremy-clarkson-use-3481201|title=Video: Watch Jeremy Clarkson use n-word in unseen Top Gear footage|first=David|last=Collins|date=1 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Series 21===\n\nThe ''Top Gear'' presenters go across Burma and Thailand in lorries with the goal of building a bridge over the river Kwai. After building a bridge over the [[Kok River]], Clarkson is quoted as saying \"That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it.\" as a native crosses the bridge, 'slope' being a pejorative for Asians.\n\n''Top Gear'' Executive Producer Andy Wilman responded:\n\n<blockquote>When we used the word slope in the recent Top Gear Burma Special it was a light-hearted word play joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local Asian man who was crossing it. We were not aware at the time, and it has subsequently been brought to our attention, that the word slope is considered by some to be offensive and although it might not be widely recognised in the UK, we appreciate that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas, for example in Australia and the USA.

While they were originally just toying with the idea, it became a reality when Elad Tabakov \u2013 a long-time fan of the series who had become aware of the conversation \u2013 brought the brothers to his hometown of [[Haifa]] to commence development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Design ===\nWhile the original game was created by only the Gluzmans, the new title has a team of seven people. As with the 1999's ''Piposh'', the brothers are writing the title. Meanwhile, Gal Pasternak and Gal Hajaj are working on the technical aspects, while Elad Tabakov is managing the project. The animation team consists of Adir Priewer working on character design and Amir Dwek designing the game world.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ronen has noted that the staff members resurrecting the game were once the generation that grew up on it, who genuinely want it to come back.<ref name=\":0\" /> He has acknowledged that there had never been a logical [[Business Strategy|business strategy]] behind ''Piposh,'' which extends to this title.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ronen said they're \"working out of the joy of creation\" since its development cannot be justified from a financial perspective, noting that he closed Guillotine down in 2003 specifically due to a lack of sales.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/consumer/articles/0,7340,L-3752947,00.html|title=The Little Bang: Let Piposh win|last=Kling|first=Amit|date=December 27, 2018|website=Calcalist|language=he|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile at the time of the original ''Piposh'''s release its target audience was a relatively small niche who understood computer games and how to operate them, in the 2010s the developers wanted to make the game accessible to the [[mass market]].<ref name=\":0\" /> One way they did this is to make it compatible with mobile devices. Secondly, taking a cue from [[Telltale Games]] projects like [[The Walking Dead (video game)|''The Walking Dead'']] the originally plan was to divide the experience into easy-to-digest chapters of three to four hours each, with decisions affecting the future narrative.<ref name=\":0\" /> Segmenting the title was to allow the development time to be dramatically shortened, with the first chapter able be released within a year.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, later they decided to release the entire game in one for early 2020.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe \"interactive, serialized adventure\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://il.ign.com/pypvsh-pc/39057/news/khry-20-shnh-pypvsh-khvzr|title=AFTER 20 YEARS PIPOSH IS BACK|last=Freund|first=Gad|date=November 18, 2018|website=IGN Israel|language=he|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> will feature two-dimensional graphics as in the first two games of the series, moving way from the 3D animation used in the third title. The Gluzmans chose this as they could see finished visual assets very quickly. Dweck has noted the level of creative freedom the team has, in that while character designs are being kept to the same proportions as the original, the team is able to build upon the \"grotesque...unique, wild style\" of the original game. Meanwhile, the title's game world is being designed to be \"rich, diverse and intriguing\", and animations are intended to be an improvement.  A new character \u2013 Egyptian film star Tawfiq Bibush \u2013 is being given a three-dimensional personality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn November 2018, Ronen suggested the plot might revolve around Piposh trying to sabotage a Hollywood production in order to promote himself to leading man, only for his plan to be halted by the discovery of a murder. Noting that the voice actor for Fritz von Bezzez, [[:he:\u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05e1 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1|Amos Shuv]] passed way in 2015, Roy acknowledged that they would have to find a creative solution to putting him into the game as a guest star is they chose to. Additionally Mani Peer has similarly died since the original games were published. However the developers were interested in getting Shai Avivi to reprise his role.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Announcement and release ===\nOn September 18, 2018, Ronen Gluzman announced on the Facebook group for GamesIS \u2013 a non-profit organisation promoting and supporting the Israeli digital gaming industry<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GameISorg/|title=GameIS|date=2018|website=Facebook|language=he|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> \u2013 that he was currently working on four gaming projects, without mentioning ''Piposh''.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgalaxy.co.il/2018/09/18/new-piposh-games/|title=The creator of the Israeli game Piposh is working on a new game|last=Chalfon|first=Lidor|date=September 18, 2018|website=PC Galaxy|language=he-IL|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> In mid September, he posted to Facebook asking for developers and designers to contact him via private message to work on an upcoming ''Piposh'' project.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOn November 15, the developers set up a ''Piposh'' campaign on [[crowdfunding]] site [[Patreon]] for fans of the series to be able to contribute financially to the reboot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/piposh|title=Piposh are creating Video Games|last=Renan and Roi Gluzman|date=November 15, 2018|website=Patreon|language=he|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> The same day the Patreon page was linked to the official \"\u05e4\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e9 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d7\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\" Facebook page for the reboot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/piposh.game/|title=New Piposh game (Official site)|last=Renan and Roi Gluzman|date=November 15, 2018|website=Facebook|language=he|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> Tabajov wanted to pursue this for the fans who wanted to see Piposh return despite content creation, especially game-making, being difficult within Israel.

While they were originally just toying with the idea, it became a reality when Elad Tabakov \u2013 a long-time fan of the series who had become aware of the conversation \u2013 brought the brothers to his hometown of [[Haifa]] to commence development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Design ===\nWhile the original game was created by only the Gluzmans, the new title has a team of seven people. As with the 1999's ''Piposh'', the brothers are writing the title. Meanwhile Gal Pasternak and Gal Hajaj are working on the technical aspects, while Elad Tabakov is managing the project. The animation team consists of Adir Priewer working on character design and Amir Dwek designing the game world.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ronen has noted that the staff members resurrecting the game were once the generation that grew up on it, who genuinely want it to come back.<ref name=\":0\" /> He has acknowledged that there had never been a logical [[Business Strategy|business strategy]] behind ''Piposh,'' which extends to this title.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ronen said they're \"working out of the joy of creation\" since its development cannot be justified from a financial perspective, noting that he closed Guillotine down in 2003 specifically due to a lack of sales.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/consumer/articles/0,7340,L-3752947,00.html|title=The Little Bang: Let Piposh win|last=Kling|first=Amit|date=December 27, 2018|website=Calcalist|language=he|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile at the time of the original ''Piposh'''s release its target audience was a relatively small niche who understood computer games and how to operate them, in the 2010s the developers wanted to make the game accessible to the [[mass market]].<ref name=\":0\" /> One way they did this is to make it compatible with mobile devices. Secondly, taking a cue from [[Telltale Games]] projects like [[The Walking Dead (video game)|''The Walking Dead'']] the originally plan was to divide the experience into easy-to-digest chapters of three to four hours each, with decisions affecting the future narrative.<ref name=\":0\" /> Segmenting the title was to allow the development time to be dramatically shortened, with the first chapter able be released within a year.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, later they decided to release the entire game in one for early 2020.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe \"interactive, serialized adventure\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://il.ign.com/pypvsh-pc/39057/news/khry-20-shnh-pypvsh-khvzr|title=AFTER 20 YEARS PIPOSH IS BACK|last=Freund|first=Gad|date=November 18, 2018|website=IGN Israel|language=he|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> will feature two-dimensional graphics as in the first two games of the series, moving way from the 3D animation used in the third title. The Gluzmans chose this as they could see finished visual assets very quickly. Dweck has noted the level of creative freedom the team has, in that while character designs are being kept to the same proportions as the original, the team is able to build upon the \"grotesque...unique, wild style\" of the original game. Meanwhile the title's game world is being designed to be \"rich, diverse and intriguing\", and animations are intended to be an improvement.  A new character \u2013 Egyptian film star Tawfiq Bibush \u2013 is being given a three-dimensional personality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn November 2018, Ronen suggested the plot might revolve around Piposh trying to sabotage a Hollywood production in order to promote himself to leading man, only for his plan to be halted by the discovery of a murder. Noting that the voice actor for Fritz von Bezzez, [[:he:\u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05e1 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1|Amos Shuv]] passed way in 2015, Roy acknowledged that they would have to find a creative solution to putting him into the game as a guest star is they chose to. Additionally Mani Peer has similarly died since the original games were published.
