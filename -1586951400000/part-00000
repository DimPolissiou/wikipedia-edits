In the late 1950s and early 1960s poor management and failure to develop new products in the motorcycle division led to a dramatic decline of sales to its major USA market. The management had failed to appreciate the importance of the resurgent Japanese motorcycle industry, leading to problems for the entire BSA group.\n\nWhen Norton Villiers Triumph was liquidated in 1978, the rights to use the brand name of BSA were purchased by a new business, the [[B.S.A. Company]].\n\n==Motorcycles==\n{{Main|List of BSA motorcycles}}\nMotor bicycles were added to bicycle products in 1910.  The BSA 3\u00bd hp was exhibited at the 1910 Olympia Show, London for the 1911 season.  The entire BSA production sold out in 1911, 1912 and 1913.<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\">Ryerson, Barry (1980). ''The Giants of Small Heath: The History of BSA''. [Sparkford: Haynes]. {{ISBN|0-85429-255-1}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1919 BSA launched their first 50 degree [[V-twin engine|vee-twin]], [[BSA Model E|Model E]], 770cc side valve (6\u20137&nbsp;hp) motorcycle for the 1920 season.<ref>BSA Cycles Ltd 1920 ''Advertisement Suggestions for BSA Bicycles and Motor Bicycles'', The Birmingham Small Arms Company, no ISBN</ref> The machine had interchangeable valves, total loss oil system with mechanical pump and an emergency hand one. Retail price was \u00a3130. Other features were [[Amal (motorcycle)|Amal]] carburettor, chain drive, choice of [[ignition magneto|magneto]] or Magdyno, 7-plate clutch, 3 speed gear box with [[Kick start|kickstarter]] and new type of cantilever fork<ref>Ryerson, Barry 1980 ''The Giants of Small Heath \u2013 The History of BSA'', Sparkford, {{ISBN|0-85429-255-1}}</ref>\n\nAs the result of increased post war demand the [[Small Heath, Birmingham]] factory was turned over entirely to motorcycle production.\n\nIn 1953 BSA withdrew motorcycle production from BSA Cycles Ltd, the company it had established in 1919,  by creating BSA Motorcycles Ltd.   BSA also produced its 100,000th [[BSA Bantam]] motorcycle, a fact celebrated at the 1953 motorcycle show with a visit by Sir [[Anthony Eden]] to the BSA stand.\n\n==Norton-Villiers-Triumph==\n{{Main|Norton Villiers Triumph}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe Group continued to expand and acquire throughout the 1950s, but by 1965 competition from Japan (in the shape of companies like [[Honda]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[Suzuki]]) and Europe from [[Jawa Motors|Jawa]]/[[\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka Strakonice|CZ]], [[Bultaco]] and [[Husqvarna Motorcycles|Husqvarna]] was eroding BSA's market share. The BSA (and Triumph range) were no longer aligned with the markets; [[moped]]s were displacing [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] sales and the [[motorcycle trial|trials]] and [[Motorcycle scrambling|scrambles]] areas were now the preserve of European [[two-stroke engine|two-strokes]]. Some poor marketing decisions and expensive projects contributed to substantial losses. For example, the development and production investment of the Ariel 3, an ultra stable 3-wheel moped, was not recouped by sales; the loss has been estimated at \u00a32&nbsp;million.  Furthermore, BSA failed to take seriously the threat that electric-start Japanese motorcycles might completely destroy the market for kick-started BSA motorcycles.\n\nIn 1968, BSA announced many changes to its product line of singles, twins and the new three-cylinder machine named the \"Rocket three\" for the 1969 model year. It now concentrated on the more promising USA, and to a lesser extent, Canadian markets. However, despite the adding of modern accessories, for example, turn signals and even differing versions of the A65 twins for home and export sale, the damage had been done and the end was near.\n\nReorganisation in 1971 concentrated motorcycle production at Meriden, Triumph's site, with production of components and engines at BSA's Small Heath. At the same time there were [[Layoff|redundancies]] and the selling of assets. [[Barclays Bank]] arranged financial backing to the tune of \u00a310&nbsp;million.\n\nUpgrades and service bulletins continued until 1972, but the less service-intensive Japanese bikes had by then flooded the market on both sides of the Atlantic. The merger with Norton Villers was started in late 1972, and for a brief time a Norton 500 single was built with the [[BSA B50|B50]]-based unit-single engine, but few if any were sold publicly. The BSA unit single B50's 500 cc enjoyed much improvement in the hands of the CCM motorcycle company allowing the basic BSA design to continue until the mid to late 1970s in a competitive form all over Europe.\n\nThe final BSA range was just four models: Gold Star 500, 650 Thunderbolt/Lightning and the 750 cc [[BSA Rocket 3|Rocket Three]]. By 1972, BSA was so moribund that, with [[bankruptcy]] imminent, its motorcycle businesses were merged (as part of a government-initiated rescue plan) with the [[Manganese Bronze]] company, [[Norton-Villiers]], to become [[Norton-Villiers-Triumph|NVT]], headed by [[Dennis Poore]].  The intention was to produce and market [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] and [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] motorcycles at home and abroad; but Poore's rationalisation led to redundancies of two-thirds of the workforce.  In response, the Triumph workers at Meriden set up their own [[Meriden Cooperative|cooperative]].  This left Poore with neither BSA nor the iconic Triumph Bonneville model  and the only NVT models listed for the 1975 model year were the [[Norton Commando]] and the Triumph T160  Trident.<ref name=\"mc\">{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Roland |title=Triumph's T160 Trident \u2013 Classic British Motorcycles |url=https://www.motorcycleclassics.com/classic-british-motorcycles/triumph-trident-t160 |website=Motorcycle Classics |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en |date=January 2006}}</ref> Although the Commando won the ''[[Motor Cycle News]]'' \"Bike of the Year\" award for several years running, nothing could hide the fact that the Commando engine was an old design, being a pre-unit pushrod [[Straight-twin engine|parallel-twin]], notwithstanding its effective and revolutionary vibration-damping 'Isolastic' engine mounting system.\n\nThe T160 was an upgraded triple with a host of improvements such as electric starting and all-disc braking whose engine, built at BSA's Small Heath plant bore, in many ways, a striking similarity to that of the original BSA Rocket 3, being forward-inclined in the frame rather than vertically mounted. This layout was found to give better weight distribution and allowed ancillary components like the starter to be mounted behind the cylinder block, thus apparently vindicating the earlier BSA 'inclined -parallel 3' design.<ref name=\"mc\"/>\n\nIn exchange for its motorcycle businesses, Manganese Bronze received BSA Group's non-motorcycle-related divisions\u2014namely, [[Carbodies]]. Although the BSA name was left out of the new company's name, a few products continued to be made carrying it until 1973.  However, the plan involved the axing of some brands, large redundancies and consolidation of production at two sites. This scheme to rescue and combine Norton, BSA and Triumph failed in the face of worker resistance. Norton's and BSA's factories were eventually shut down, while Triumph staggered on to fail four years later.\n\n==Trademarks==\n===Motorcycles===\nRights went to Norton Villiers Triumph and on its liquidation were purchased by a new company formed by management and named [[BSA Company|BSA Company Limited]].\n\n===Motorcycles from 1910===\nBSA Motorcycles were made by BSA Cycles Ltd, under the BSA parent, up until 1953 when the motorcycle business was moved into holding ''BSA Motorcycles Ltd''. The first instance of intention to produce motorcycles was reported in [[The Motor Cycle]], a British motorcycling journal, in July 1906.<ref>[[The Motor Cycle|Motor Cycle]], 7 July 1966. p.26 ''Flashbacks to 1906. 16 July 1906. \"We hear that the Birmingham Small Arms Co Ltd, the makers of well known and renowned BSA fittings, who recently purchased the Government Small Arms factory at Sparkbrook, Birmingham, for motor work, have decided to take up the manufacture of a light motor bicycle''\".

Sir [[Hallewell Rogers]], BSA Chairman, had informed the shareholders at the Company's 1910 AGM in Birmingham \"We have decided to put a motor-bicycle on the market for the coming season&nbsp;.... These machines will be on exhibit at the Cycle and Motor Show on November 21st, after which date we look forward to commencing delivery\".<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/> The machines were available for the 1911 season and entire production sold out. BSA had previously acquired a commercially available engine in 1905 and fitted it to one of their bicycle frames and discovered at first hand the problems that needed to be overcome. BSA Cycles Ltd was set up as a subsidiary company in 1919 under Managing Director Charles Hyde to manufacture both bicycles and motorcycles.<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/>\n\nBSA produced their only [[two-stroke]] motorcycle design for the 1928 season, the 1.74 H.P. Model A28 with two speed gearbox.<ref>[https://hindmaharider.com/bike-movies-to-watch-in-quarantine-hindmaharider/]{{|date=April 15}}</ref> It was produced as the A29 and A30 the following two years and became the A31 with a three-speed gearbox in 1931, the last year of production.  The post-war 'Bantam' was a German [[Dampf-Kraft-Wagen|DKW]] design, part of war reparation, and not a true BSA design.\n\nBSA motorcycles were sold as affordable motorcycles with reasonable performance for the average user. BSA stressed the reliability of their machines, the availability of spares and dealer support. The motorcycles were a mixture of sidevalve and OHV engines offering different performance for different roles, e.g. hauling a [[sidecar]]. The bulk of use would be for commuting. BSA motorcycles were also popular with \"fleet buyers\" in Britain, who (for example) used the Bantams for telegram delivery for the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] or motorcycle/sidecar combinations for AA patrols [[The Automobile Association]] (AA) breakdown help services. This mass market appeal meant they could claim \"one in four is a BSA\" on advertising.\n\nMachines with better specifications were available for those who wanted more performance or for competition work.\n\nInitially, after the Second World War, BSA motorcycles were not generally seen as racing machines, compared to the likes of [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]]. In the immediate post-war period few were entered in races such as the TT races, though this changed dramatically in the Junior Clubman event (smaller engine motorcycles racing over some 3 or 4 laps around one of the Isle of Man courses). In 1947 there were but a couple of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 [[Velocette]].\n\nTo improve US sales, in 1954, for example, BSA entered a team of riders in the [[Daytona 200|200 mile Daytona beach race]] with a mixture of single cylinder [[BSA Gold Star|Gold Stars]] and twin cylinder [[BSA Shooting Star|Shooting Stars]] assembled by Roland Pike. The BSA team riders took first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places with two more riders finishing at 8th and 16th. This was the first case of a one brand sweep.<ref>[http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/news/2004/DaytonaBSA.asp BSA: 50 years later<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180305/http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/news/2004/DaytonaBSA.asp |date=3 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe BSA factory experienced success in the sport of [[motocross]] with [[Jeff Smith (motorcyclist)|Jeff Smith]] riding a B40 to capture the 1964 and 1965 [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] [[List of motocross World Championship results|500 cc Motocross World Championships]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b50.org/mead.htm |title=BSA B50 Racing History |publisher=b50.org |accessdate=20 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicmotorcycles.org.uk/bikemuseum/museum_bsa.htm |title=BSA |publisher=classicmotorcycles.org.uk |accessdate=20 March 2012 }}</ref> It would be the last year the title would be won by a [[four-stroke]] machine until the mid-1990s.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s poor management and failure to develop new products in the motorcycle division led to a dramatic decline of sales to its major USA market. The management had failed to appreciate the importance of the resurgent Japanese motorcycle industry, leading to problems for the entire BSA group.\n\nWhen Norton Villiers Triumph was liquidated in 1978, the rights to use the brand name of BSA were purchased by a new business, the [[B.S.A. Company]].\n\n==Motorcycles==\n{{Main|List of BSA motorcycles}}\nMotor bicycles were added to bicycle products in 1910.  The BSA 3\u00bd hp was exhibited at the 1910 Olympia Show, London for the 1911 season.  The entire BSA production sold out in 1911, 1912 and 1913.<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\">Ryerson, Barry (1980). ''The Giants of Small Heath: The History of BSA''.

Retail price was \u00a3130. Other features were [[Amal (motorcycle)|Amal]] carburettor, chain drive, choice of [[ignition magneto|magneto]] or Magdyno, 7-plate clutch, 3 speed gear box with [[Kick start|kickstarter]] and new type of cantilever fork<ref>Ryerson, Barry 1980 ''The Giants of Small Heath \u2013 The History of BSA'', Sparkford, {{ISBN|0-85429-255-1}}</ref>\n\nAs the result of increased post war demand the [[Small Heath, Birmingham]] factory was turned over entirely to motorcycle production.\n\nIn 1953 BSA withdrew motorcycle production from BSA Cycles Ltd, the company it had established in 1919,  by creating BSA Motorcycles Ltd.   BSA also produced its 100,000th [[BSA Bantam]] motorcycle, a fact celebrated at the 1953 motorcycle show with a visit by Sir [[Anthony Eden]] to the BSA stand.\n\n==Norton-Villiers-Triumph==\n{{Main|Norton Villiers Triumph}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe Group continued to expand and acquire throughout the 1950s, but by 1965 competition from Japan (in the shape of companies like [[Honda]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[Suzuki]]) and Europe from [[Jawa Motors|Jawa]]/[[\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka Strakonice|CZ]], [[Bultaco]] and [[Husqvarna Motorcycles|Husqvarna]] was eroding BSA's market share. The BSA (and Triumph range) were no longer aligned with the markets; [[moped]]s were displacing [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] sales and the [[motorcycle trial|trials]] and [[Motorcycle scrambling|scrambles]] areas were now the preserve of European [[two-stroke engine|two-strokes]]. Some poor marketing decisions and expensive projects contributed to substantial losses. For example, the development and production investment of the Ariel 3, an ultra stable 3-wheel moped, was not recouped by sales; the loss has been estimated at \u00a32&nbsp;million.  Furthermore, BSA failed to take seriously the threat that electric-start Japanese motorcycles might completely destroy the market for kick-started BSA motorcycles.\n\nIn 1968, BSA announced many changes to its product line of singles, twins and the new three-cylinder machine named the \"Rocket three\" for the 1969 model year. It now concentrated on the more promising USA, and to a lesser extent, Canadian markets. However, despite the adding of modern accessories, for example, turn signals and even differing versions of the A65 twins for home and export sale, the damage had been done and the end was near.\n\nReorganisation in 1971 concentrated motorcycle production at Meriden, Triumph's site, with production of components and engines at BSA's Small Heath. At the same time there were [[Layoff|redundancies]] and the selling of assets. [[Barclays Bank]] arranged financial backing to the tune of \u00a310&nbsp;million.\n\nUpgrades and service bulletins continued until 1972, but the less service-intensive Japanese bikes had by then flooded the market on both sides of the Atlantic. The merger with Norton Villers was started in late 1972, and for a brief time a Norton 500 single was built with the [[BSA B50|B50]]-based unit-single engine, but few if any were sold publicly. The BSA unit single B50's 500 cc enjoyed much improvement in the hands of the CCM motorcycle company allowing the basic BSA design to continue until the mid to late 1970s in a competitive form all over Europe.\n\nThe final BSA range was just four models: Gold Star 500, 650 Thunderbolt/Lightning and the 750 cc [[BSA Rocket 3|Rocket Three]]. By 1972, BSA was so moribund that, with [[bankruptcy]] imminent, its motorcycle businesses were merged (as part of a government-initiated rescue plan) with the [[Manganese Bronze]] company, [[Norton-Villiers]], to become [[Norton-Villiers-Triumph|NVT]], headed by [[Dennis Poore]].  The intention was to produce and market [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] and [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] motorcycles at home and abroad; but Poore's rationalisation led to redundancies of two-thirds of the workforce.  In response, the Triumph workers at Meriden set up their own [[Meriden Cooperative|cooperative]].  This left Poore with neither BSA nor the iconic Triumph Bonneville model  and the only NVT models listed for the 1975 model year were the [[Norton Commando]] and the Triumph T160  Trident.<ref name=\"mc\">{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Roland |title=Triumph's T160 Trident \u2013 Classic British Motorcycles |url=https://www.motorcycleclassics.com/classic-british-motorcycles/triumph-trident-t160 |website=Motorcycle Classics |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=en |date=January 2006}}</ref> Although the Commando won the ''[[Motor Cycle News]]'' \"Bike of the Year\" award for several years running, nothing could hide the fact that the Commando engine was an old design, being a pre-unit pushrod [[Straight-twin engine|parallel-twin]], notwithstanding its effective and revolutionary vibration-damping 'Isolastic' engine mounting system.\n\nThe T160 was an upgraded triple with a host of improvements such as electric starting and all-disc braking whose engine, built at BSA's Small Heath plant bore, in many ways, a striking similarity to that of the original BSA Rocket 3, being forward-inclined in the frame rather than vertically mounted. This layout was found to give better weight distribution and allowed ancillary components like the starter to be mounted behind the cylinder block, thus apparently vindicating the earlier BSA 'inclined -parallel 3' design.<ref name=\"mc\"/>\n\nIn exchange for its motorcycle businesses, Manganese Bronze received BSA Group's non-motorcycle-related divisions\u2014namely, [[Carbodies]]. Although the BSA name was left out of the new company's name, a few products continued to be made carrying it until 1973.  However, the plan involved the axing of some brands, large redundancies and consolidation of production at two sites. This scheme to rescue and combine Norton, BSA and Triumph failed in the face of worker resistance. Norton's and BSA's factories were eventually shut down, while Triumph staggered on to fail four years later.\n\n==Trademarks==\n===Motorcycles===\nRights went to Norton Villiers Triumph and on its liquidation were purchased by a new company formed by management and named [[BSA Company|BSA Company Limited]].\n\n===Motorcycles from 1910===\nBSA Motorcycles were made by BSA Cycles Ltd, under the BSA parent, up until 1953 when the motorcycle business was moved into holding ''BSA Motorcycles Ltd''. The first instance of intention to produce motorcycles was reported in [[The Motor Cycle]], a British motorcycling journal, in July 1906.<ref>[[The Motor Cycle|Motor Cycle]], 7 July 1966. p.26 ''Flashbacks to 1906. 16 July 1906. \"We hear that the Birmingham Small Arms Co Ltd, the makers of well known and renowned BSA fittings, who recently purchased the Government Small Arms factory at Sparkbrook, Birmingham, for motor work, have decided to take up the manufacture of a light motor bicycle''\".

Sir [[Hallewell Rogers]], BSA Chairman, had informed the shareholders at the Company's 1910 AGM in Birmingham \"We have decided to put a motor-bicycle on the market for the coming season&nbsp;.... These machines will be on exhibit at the Cycle and Motor Show on November 21st, after which date we look forward to commencing delivery\".<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/> The machines were available for the 1911 season and entire production sold out. BSA had previously acquired a commercially available engine in 1905 and fitted it to one of their bicycle frames and discovered at first hand the problems that needed to be overcome. BSA Cycles Ltd was set up as a subsidiary company in 1919 under Managing Director Charles Hyde to manufacture both bicycles and motorcycles.<ref name=\"Ryerson Barry 1980\"/>\n\nBSA produced their only [[two-stroke]] motorcycle design for the 1928 season, the 1.74 H.P. Model A28 with two speed gearbox.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3259521645/in/set-72157606633777810/]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> It was produced as the A29 and A30 the following two years and became the A31 with a three-speed gearbox in 1931, the last year of production.  The post-war 'Bantam' was a German [[Dampf-Kraft-Wagen|DKW]] design, part of war reparation, and not a true BSA design.\n\nBSA motorcycles were sold as affordable motorcycles with reasonable performance for the average user. BSA stressed the reliability of their machines, the availability of spares and dealer support. The motorcycles were a mixture of sidevalve and OHV engines offering different performance for different roles, e.g. hauling a [[sidecar]]. The bulk of use would be for commuting. BSA motorcycles were also popular with \"fleet buyers\" in Britain, who (for example) used the Bantams for telegram delivery for the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] or motorcycle/sidecar combinations for AA patrols [[The Automobile Association]] (AA) breakdown help services. This mass market appeal meant they could claim \"one in four is a BSA\" on advertising.\n\nMachines with better specifications were available for those who wanted more performance or for competition work.\n\nInitially, after the Second World War, BSA motorcycles were not generally seen as racing machines, compared to the likes of [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]]. In the immediate post-war period few were entered in races such as the TT races, though this changed dramatically in the Junior Clubman event (smaller engine motorcycles racing over some 3 or 4 laps around one of the Isle of Man courses). In 1947 there were but a couple of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 [[Velocette]].\n\nTo improve US sales, in 1954, for example, BSA entered a team of riders in the [[Daytona 200|200 mile Daytona beach race]] with a mixture of single cylinder [[BSA Gold Star|Gold Stars]] and twin cylinder [[BSA Shooting Star|Shooting Stars]] assembled by Roland Pike. The BSA team riders took first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places with two more riders finishing at 8th and 16th. This was the first case of a one brand sweep.<ref>[http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/news/2004/DaytonaBSA.asp BSA: 50 years later<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180305/http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/news/2004/DaytonaBSA.asp |date=3 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe BSA factory experienced success in the sport of [[motocross]] with [[Jeff Smith (motorcyclist)|Jeff Smith]] riding a B40 to capture the 1964 and 1965 [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] [[List of motocross World Championship results|500 cc Motocross World Championships]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b50.org/mead.htm |title=BSA B50 Racing History |publisher=b50.org |accessdate=20 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicmotorcycles.org.uk/bikemuseum/museum_bsa.htm |title=BSA |publisher=classicmotorcycles.org.uk |accessdate=20 March 2012 }}</ref> It would be the last year the title would be won by a [[four-stroke]] machine until the mid-1990s.

He first gained attention in the 1970s with his intimate portraits of his wife, Edith, and her family. Later he turned his attention to the landscapes of the American West, taking aerial photographs of places that had been changed by humans or nature, including the [[Hanford Site]], [[Mount St. Helens]], and the [[Nevada Test Site]]. Gowin taught at [[Princeton University]] for 25 years.\n\n==Life and career==\n\nGowin was born in [[Danville, Virginia]]. His father, Emmet Sr., was a [[Methodist]] minister and his [[Quaker]] mother played the organ in church.<ref name=AF>{{cite book|first=Akira|last=Fukii|title=Emmet Gowin, Photographs: 1967-2000|publisher=Tokyo: Nihon University|year=2004|pages=9\u201314}}</ref> When he was two his family moved to [[Chincoteague Island]], where he spent much of his free time in the marshes around their home.<ref name=FAP>{{cite web|url=http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/10/21/pages/2069/index.xml|title=Finding a Place: Emmet Gowin,  A portrait of the artist|first=Merrell|last=Noden|accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref>  At about age 12 his family moved back to Danville, where Gowin first showed an interest in art by taking up drawing. When he was 16 he saw an [[Ansel Adams]] photograph of a burnt tree with a young bud growing from the stump. This inspired him to go into the woods near his home and draw from nature.<ref name=AF/> Later, he applied what he learned from his early years wandering in the woods and marshes to his photography. A student of his said \"Photography, with Emmet, became the study of everything.\"<ref name=FAP/>\n\nAfter graduating from high school he attended the [[Richmond Professional Institute]] (now [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]). During his first year in college he saw a catalog of the [[Family of Man]] exhibit and was particularly inspired by the works of [[Robert Frank]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]].<ref name=AF/> About this same time he met his future wife, Edith Morris, who had grown up about a mile away from Gowin in Danville.<ref name=EGP>{{cite book|first=Emmet|last=Gowin|title=Photographs|publisher=NY: Knopf|year=1976|pages=99\u2013101}}</ref> They married in 1964, and she quickly became both his muse and his model. Later they had two sons, [[Elijah Gowin]] (also a photographer in his own right) and Isaac.\n\nSome of his earliest photographic vision was inspired by Edith's large and engaging family, who allowed him to record what he called \"a family freshly different from my own.\"<ref name=EGP/> He said \"I wanted to pay attention to the body and personality that had agreed out of love to reveal itself.\"<ref name=EGP/> \nIn 1965, Gowin attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. While earning his MFA, Gowin studied under influential American photographers [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]] and [[Aaron Siskind]]. Three years later he was given his first solo exhibition at the [[Dayton Art Institute]]. In 1970 his work was shown at the [[George Eastman House]] and a year later at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. About this same time he was introduced to the photographer [[Frederick Sommer]], who became his lifelong mentor and friend.<ref name=EGP/>\n\nGowin was invited by [[Peter Bunnell]] in 1973 to teach photography at [[Princeton University]]. Over the next 25 years he both taught new students and, by his own admission, continually learned from those he taught. At the end of each academic year he asked his students to contribute one photograph to a portfolio that was open to critique by all of the students; he intentionally included one of his own photographs as a reminder that, while a teacher, \"he was just another humble student of art.\"<ref name=FAP/>\n\nGowin received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1974|1974]], which allowed him to travel throughout Europe. He was also awarded a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Fellowship in 1979 and a [[Pew Fellowships in the Arts|Pew Fellowship in the Arts]] in 1994.\n\nIn 1980 Gowin received a scholarship from the [[Seattle Arts Commission]] which provided funding for him to travel in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].  Beginning with a trip to [[Mount St. Helens]] soon after it erupted, Gowin began taking aerial photographs.

He first gained attention in the 1970s with his intimate portraits of his wife, Edith, and her family. Later he turned his attention to the landscapes of the American West, taking aerial photographs of places that had been changed by humans or nature, including the [[Hanford Site]], [[Mount St. Helens]], and the [[Nevada Test Site]]. Gowin taught at [[Princeton University]] for 25 years. \n\n==Life and career==\n\nGowin was born in [[Danville, Virginia]]. His father, Emmet Sr., was a [[Methodist]] minister and his [[Quaker]] mother played the organ in church.<ref name=AF>{{cite book|first=Akira|last=Fukii|title=Emmet Gowin, Photographs: 1967-2000|publisher=Tokyo: Nihon University|year=2004|pages=9\u201314}}</ref> When he was two his family moved to [[Chincoteague Island]], where he spent much of his free time in the marshes around their home.<ref name=FAP>{{cite web|url=http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/10/21/pages/2069/index.xml|title=Finding a Place: Emmet Gowin,  A portrait of the artist|first=Merrell|last=Noden|accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref>  At about age 12 his family moved back to Danville, where Gowin first showed an interest in art by taking up drawing. When he was 16 he saw an [[Ansel Adams]] photograph of a burnt tree with a young bud growing from the stump. This inspired him to go into the woods near his home and draw from nature.<ref name=AF/> Later, he applied what he learned from his early years wandering in the woods and marshes to his photography. A student of his said \"Photography, with Emmet, became the study of everything.\"<ref name=FAP/>\n\nAfter graduating from high school he attended the [[Richmond Professional Institute]] (now [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]). During his first year in college he saw a catalog of the [[Family of Man]] exhibit and was particularly inspired by the works of [[Robert Frank]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]].<ref name=AF/> About this same time he met his future wife, Edith Morris, who had grown up about a mile away from Gowin in Danville.<ref name=EGP>{{cite book|first=Emmet|last=Gowin|title=Photographs|publisher=NY: Knopf|year=1976|pages=99\u2013101}}</ref> They married in 1964, and she quickly became both his muse and his model. Later they had two sons, [[Elijah Gowin ]] (also a photographer in his own right) and Isaac.\n\nSome of his earliest photographic vision was inspired by Edith\u2019s large and engaging family, who allowed him to record what he called \"a family freshly different from my own.\"<ref name=EGP/> He said \"I wanted to pay attention to the body and personality that had agreed out of love to reveal itself.\"<ref name=EGP/> \nIn 1965, Gowin attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. While earning his MFA, Gowin studied under influential American photographers [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]] and [[Aaron Siskind]]. Three years later he was given his first solo exhibition at the [[Dayton Art Institute]]. In 1970 his work was shown at the [[George Eastman House]] and a year later at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. About this same time he was introduced to the photographer [[Frederick Sommer]], who became his lifelong mentor and friend.<ref name=EGP/>\n\nGowin was invited by [[Peter Bunnell]] in 1973 to teach photography at [[Princeton University]]. Over the next 25 years he both taught new students and, by his own admission, continually learned from those he taught. At the end of each academic year he asked his students to contribute one photograph to a portfolio that was open to critique by all of the students; he intentionally included one of his own photographs as a reminder that, while a teacher, \"he was just another humble student of art.\"<ref name=FAP/>\n\nGowin received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1974|1974]], which allowed him to travel throughout Europe. He was also awarded a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Fellowship in 1979 and a [[Pew Fellowships in the Arts|Pew Fellowship in the Arts]] in 1994.\n\nIn 1980 Gowin received a scholarship from the [[Seattle Arts Commission]] which provided funding for him to travel in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].  Beginning with a trip to [[Mount St. Helens]] soon after it erupted, Gowin began taking aerial photographs. For the next twenty years, Gowin captured [[strip mining]] sites, nuclear testing fields, large-scale agricultural fields and other scars in the natural landscape.\n\nIn 1982 the Gowins were invited by [[Queen Noor of Jordan]], who had studied with Gowin at Princeton, to photograph historic places in her country. He traveled there over the next three years and took a series of photographs of the archaeological site at [[Petra]]. The prints he made of these images were the first time he introduced [[photographic print toning]] in his work.\n\nGowin retired from teaching at [[Princeton University]] at the end of 2009<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A1415ABD5B23&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=Google|title=HIS ART IMITATES SCIENCE - AND LIFE PHOTOGRAPHER EMMET GOWIN'S SHOW AT THE ART MUSEUM REVEALS A DEEP COMMITMENT TO HIS FAMILY AND HIS WORK|accessdate=2012-11-15 | date=1990-12-12}}</ref> and lives in Pennsylvania with his wife Edith.\n\n==Style and aesthetics==\n\nGowin has acknowledged that the photographs of [[Eugene Atget]], [[Bill Brandt]], [[Walker Evans]], [[Robert Frank]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]], and especially [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]] and [[Frederick Sommer]] have influenced him.<ref name=AF/>\n\nMost of his early family pictures were taken with a 4 X 5 camera on a tripod, a situation in which he said \"both the sitter and photographer look at each other, and what they both see and feel is part of the picture.\"<ref name=EGA>{{cite journal|first=Emmet|last=Gowin|journal=Aperture|year=1974|title=Photographs/Emmet Gowin| volume=16|issue=2|pages=unpaged}}</ref> These photos feel both posed and highly intimate at the same time, often capturing seemingly long and direct stares from his wife or her family members or appearing to intrude on a personal family moment.

Each [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|MP]], represents a single geographic constituency. There are currently 543 constituencies.\n\nThe maximum size of the Lok Sabha as outlined in the [[Constitution of India]] is 550 members made up of up to 530 members representing people of the [[States and union territories of India|states of India]] and up to 20 members representing people from the [[States and union territories of India|Union Territories]] on the basis of their population.\n\n==Delimitation of constituencies==\nUnder the [http://www.delimitation-india.com/Acts/act_2002.pdf Delimitation Act of 2002], the [[Delimitation Commission of India]] has redefined the list of parliamentary constituencies, their constituent assembly segments and reservation status (whether reserved for [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled castes (SC)]] candidates or [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled tribes (ST)]] candidates or unreserved).

Government of India promulgated an Ordinance amending the Delimitation Act,2002 nullifies the Final Order of the Delimitation Commission for the state of Jharkhand.

Each [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|MP]], represents a single geographic constituency. There are currently 543 constituencies.\n\nThe maximum size of the Lok Sabha as outlined in the [[Constitution of India]] is 550 members made up of up to 530 members representing people of the [[States and union territories of India|states of India]] and up to 20 members representing people from the [[States and union territories of India|Union Territories]] on the basis of their population.\n\n==Delimitation of constituencies==\nUnder the [http://www.delimitation-india.com/Acts/act_2002.pdf Delimitation Act of 2002], the [[Delimitation Commission of India]] has redefined the list of parliamentary constituencies, their constituent assembly segments and reservation status (whether reserved for [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled castes (SC)]] candidates or [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled tribes (ST)]] candidates or unreserved). [[2008 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election]], which took place in May 2008, was the first state election to use newly demarcated assembly constituencies.<ref>http://www.elections.in/karnataka/assembly-constituencies/2008-election-results.html</ref>\nConsequently, all assembly elections scheduled in 2008, viz. in the states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, NCT of Delhi, Mizoram and Rajasthan were based on newly defined assembly constituencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eci.gov.in/pn141008.pdf|title=Press Note (Subject: Schedule for General Election to the Legislative Assemblies of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and NCT of Delhi)|publisher=Election Commission of India|date=2008-10-14|accessdate=2008-11-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031132454/http://www.eci.gov.in/pn141008.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe size and shape of the Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies are determined, according to section 4 of the [[Representation of the People Act, 1951]], by an independent Delimitation Commission. Under a constitutional amendment of 1976,<ref>[[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}} delimitation was suspended until after the census of 2001. However, certain amendments to the Constitution made in 2001 and 2003 have, while putting a freeze on the total number of existing seats as allocated to various States in the House of the People and the State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of 1971 census until the first census to be taken after the year 2026,<ref name=\"elections.tn.nic.in\">[http://elections.tn.nic.in/delimitation.html]{{dead link|date=January 2019}}</ref> provided that each State shall be delimited into territorial Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies on the basis of [[2001 Census of India|2001 census]] and the extent of such constituencies as delimited shall remain frozen until the first census to be taken after the year 2026.<ref name=\"elections.tn.nic.in\"/> The number of seats to be reserved for SC/ ST shall be re-worked out on the basis of 2001 census. The constituency shall be delimited in a manner that the population of each Parliamentary and Assembly Constituency in a State so far as practicable be the same throughout the State.<ref name=\"elections.tn.nic.in\"/>\n\n==Summary==\nThe Delimitation Commission, set up under the Delimitation Act, 2002, was entrusted with the task of readjusting all parliamentary and assembly constituencies in the country in all the states of India, except the state of Jammu and Kashmir, on the basis of population ascertained in 2001 Census. Government of India promulgated an Ordinance amending the Delimitation Act,2002 nullifies the Final Order of the Delimitation Commission for the state of Jharkhand. Later on, the Government have passed four separate Orders under Sec 10 A of the Delimitation Act, 2002, deferring the delimitation exercise in the four North Eastern states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland.
