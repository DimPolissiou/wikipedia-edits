The reserve protects the [[Blyde River Canyon]], including sections of the [[Ohrigstad River|Ohrigstad]] and [[Blyde River]]s and the geological formations around Bourke's Luck Potholes, where the [[Treur River]] tumbles into the Blyde below. Southwards of the canyon, the reserve follows the escarpment, to include the Devil's and God's Window, the latter a popular viewpoint to the lowveld at the reserve's southern extremity.\n\nThe Mogologolo (1,794 m), [[Mariepskop]] (1,944 m) and Hebronberg (1,767 m) massifs are partially included in the reserve.

The reserve's nature conservation headquarters is located here, beside the village of Moremela, at the canyon's southern, or upper reaches.\n\nSustained [[Kolk (vortex)|kolk]]s in the Treur River's [[plunge pool]]s have eroded a number of cylindrical potholes or [[giant's kettle]]s, which can be viewed from the crags above. It was named after a local prospector, Tom Bourke, who predicted the presence of gold, though he found none himself. The [[Footbridge|pedestrian bridges]] connect the various [[overlook]]s of the potholes and the gorge downstream.\n\n==The Three Rondavels==\n[[File:Three Rondavels - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The three rondavels]]\nThe Three Rondavels are three round, grass-covered mountain tops with somewhat pointed peaks. They resemble the traditional round or oval [[rondavels]] or African homesteads quite closely, which are made with local materials. Sometimes they are also called the Three Sisters, though this may confuse them with a similar threesome visible from the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1 road]] in the [[Northern Cape]], very far to the south.<ref name=SA-Venues>{{cite web | url=http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsmpl/three-rondavels.htm | title=Three Rondavels | publisher=SA-Venues | accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the peaks commemorate a 19th century chief, Maripi, and three of his wives. The flat-topped peak adjacent to the rondavels is Mapjaneng, \"the chief\", who is remembered for opposing invading [[Swazis]] in a memorable battle. The three rondavels are named for three of his more troublesome wives \u2013 Magabolle, Mogoladikwe and Maseroto. Behind the rondavels the distant high plateau of [[Mariepskop]] may be visible. Beside the dam, the isolated Thabaneng hill is known as the \"sundial\" or \"mountain with a shadow that moves\". It is said that the position of its shadow indicates the time of day.<ref name=\"rowe\">{{cite web |last1=Rowe |first1=Christine |title=Heritage management of archaeological, historical and industrial resources on the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve |url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/27115/dissertation.pdf |website=repository.up.ac.za |publisher=[[University of Pretoria]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn a clear day the lookout point provides extensive views. From here one looks over the canyon to the Three Rondavels on the other side, which is flanked on various sides by promontories of the northern [[Drakensberg]] range.<ref name=SA-Venues/>\n\nThe formation of the attractive sedimentary formations are explained geologically as the slow erosion of underlying soft stone, leaving the exposed the more resistant quartzite and shale rondavels.\n\n==God's Window==\n[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A southward view from God's Window towards [[Kowyn Pass]]]]\nGod\u2019s Window <small>{{coord|24|52|28|S|30|53|29|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window}}</small> is a popular vantage point along the [[Drakensberg]] [[escarpment]], at the southern extremity of the Nature Reserve.\n\nHere, sheer cliffs plunge over 700 metres to the [[lowveld]]. From this escarpment&mdash;a mostly unbroken rampart of cliffs&mdash;opens a vista into the lowvelt expanse and escarpment forests, the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]-like aesthetic appearance of which prompted the name. On a clear day it is possible to see over the [[Kruger National Park]] towards the [[Lebombo Mountains]] on the border with [[Mozambique]].\n\nGod\u2019s Window features prominently in the plot of the 1980 [[cult film]] ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]''. Near the end of the movie, the [[Bushmen|Bushman]] character Xi (played by [[Namibia]]n bush farmer [[N!xau]]) travels to God\u2019s Window, and due to some low-lying cloud cover believes it to be the end of the Earth.\n\nThe original Window is a rock that is set further back on a private farm and due to Quarry operations and tree plantation farming this actual rock that looks like a square window could not be used, therefore the site was moved by the government to the edge of the escarpment.\n\nA viewing platform <small>{{coord|24|52|35.8|S|30|53|19.6|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window viewing platform}}</small> near the car park gives extensive views down the gorge to the plain below.\n\n==Fauna==\nThe high plateaus are inhabited by [[mountain reedbuck]], [[Chacma baboon|baboon]] troops and [[rock hyrax]]es. [[Impala]], [[kudu]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[waterbuck]] and [[zebra]] roam the wooded lowveld area. [[Hippopotamus|Hippo]] and [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] are present in the [[Blyderivierpoort Dam]].\n\nThree species of [[Afroedura|flat gecko]] were described in 2014 from the reserve and its vicinity.

The reserve protects the [[Blyde River Canyon]], including sections of the [[Ohrigstad River|Ohrigstad]] and [[Blyde River]]s and the geological formations around Bourke's Luck Potholes, where the [[Treur River]] tumbles into the Blyde below. Southwards of the canyon, the reserve follows the escarpment, to include the Devil's and God's Window, the latter a popular viewpoint to the lowveld at the reserve's southern extremity.\n\nThe Mogologolo (1,794 m), [[Mariepskop]] (1,944 m) and Hebronberg (1,767 m) massifs are partially included in the reserve.

The reserve's nature conservation headquarters is located here, beside the village of Moremela, at the canyon's southern, or upper reaches.\n\nSustained [[Kolk (vortex)|kolk]]s in the Treur River's [[plunge pool]]s have eroded a number of cylindrical potholes or [[giant's kettle]]s, which can be viewed from the crags above. It was named after a local prospector, Tom Bourke, who predicted the presence of gold, though he found none himself. The [[Footbridge|pedestrian bridges]] connect the various [[overlook]]s of the potholes and the gorge downstream.\n\n==The Three Rondavels==\n[[File:Three Rondavels - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The three rondavels]]\nThe Three Rondavels are three round, grass-covered mountain tops with somewhat pointed peaks. They resemble the traditional round or oval [[rondavels]] or African homesteads quite closely, which are made with local materials. Sometimes they are also called the Three Sisters, though this may confuse them with a similar threesome visible from the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1 road]] in the [[Northern Cape]], very far to the south.<ref name=SA-Venues>{{cite web | url=http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsmpl/three-rondavels.htm | title=Three Rondavels | publisher=SA-Venues | accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the peaks commemorate a 19th century chief, Maripi, and three of his wives. The flat-topped peak adjacent to the rondavels is Mapjaneng, \"the chief\", who is remembered for opposing invading [[Swazis]] in a memorable battle. The three rondavels are named for three of his more troublesome wives \u2013 Magabolle, Mogoladikwe and Maseroto. Behind the rondavels the distant high plateau of [[Mariepskop]] may be visible. Beside the dam, the isolated Thabaneng hill is known as the \"sundial\" or \"mountain with a shadow that moves\". It is said that the position of its shadow indicates the time of day.<ref name=\"rowe\">{{cite web |last1=Rowe |first1=Christine |title=Heritage management of archaeological, historical and industrial resources on the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve |url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/27115/dissertation.pdf |website=repository.up.ac.za |publisher=[[University of Pretoria]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn a clear day the lookout point provides extensive views. From here one looks over the canyon to the Three Rondavels on the other side, which is flanked on various sides by promontories of the northern [[Drakensberg]] range.<ref name=SA-Venues/>\n\nThe formation of the attractive sedimentary formations are explained geologically as the slow erosion of underlying soft stone, leaving the exposed the more resistant quartzite and shale rondavels.\n\n==God's Window==\n[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A southward view from God's Window towards [[Kowyn Pass]]]]\nGod\u2019s Window <small>{{coord|24|52|28|S|30|53|29|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window}}</small> is a popular vantage point along the [[Drakensberg]] [[escarpment]], at the southern extremity of the Nature Reserve.\n\nHere, sheer cliffs plunge over 700 metres to the [[lowveld]]. From this escarpment&mdash;a mostly unbroken rampart of cliffs&mdash;opens a vista into the lowvelt expanse and escarpment forests, the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]-like aesthetic appearance of which prompted the name. On a clear day it is possible to see over the [[Kruger National Park]] towards the [[Lebombo Mountains]] on the border with [[Mozambique]].\n\nGod\u2019s Window features prominently in the plot of the 1980 [[cult film]] ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]''. Near the end of the movie, the [[Bushmen|Bushman]] character Xi (played by [[Namibia]]n bush farmer [[N!xau]]) travels to God\u2019s Window, and due to some low-lying cloud cover believes it to be the end of the Earth.\n\nThe original Window is a rock that is set further back on a private farm and due to Quarry operations and tree plantation farming this actual rock that looks like a square window could not be used, therefore the site was moved by the government to the edge of the escarpment.\n\nA viewing platform <small>{{coord|24|52|35.8|S|30|53|19.6|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window viewing platform}}</small> near the car park gives extensive views down the gorge to the plain below.\n\n==Fauna==\nThe high plateaus are inhabited by [[mountain reedbuck]], [[Chacma baboon|baboon]] troops and [[rock hyrax]]es.

The whip may be either long or short. The short whip corresponds to the [[sjambok|cambuk]] of Java and measures 3 feet in length. The long whip is 5-6 feet long and made from palm stems tied together with either [[rattan]] or strips of [[water buffalo]] hide. The stick is an undecorated piece of hardwood measuring 1-1.5 yards long and 2 inches in diameter. \n\nThe shield is of round or elliptical shape. Also traditionally undecorated, it is known as ''giling'' or ''nggiling'' when made of buffalo hide and ''perisai kayu'' when made of wood. Both the whip and the stick form were traditionally practiced in [[Manggarai Regency]], but the stick is rarely seen today. In Bali and [[Ngada Regency]], only the stick form exists.\n\n==Rules and technique==\n[[File:Caci warrior whip.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Caci warrior holding a rattan whip and shield.]]\nA caci whip fight is performed by two contenders \u2014 always male \u2014 whom each opponents usually came from different villages. After a starting signal, the whip and shield duel commences.<ref name=\"Flores\"/> In a caci match, the two fighters take turns alternately attacking and defending. The attacker is permitted three blows to any part of the anatomy, while the defender attempts to block with his shield. The defender is not allowed to attack while defending, but in the case of whip-fighting the defender may spin the whip above his head to prevent the attacker from closing in. Stick techniques are all swings without any thrusting.\n\nSuffering a hit in the face or on the head means instantly losing the game. While a hit on the back is considered as a good strike, and believed as a sign that next year's harvest will be plentiful.<ref name=\"Flores\"/> The roles of attacker and defender are reversed in turns after each whip strikes.

According to local belief, if the back of a fighter's body gets whipped, there will be a good harvest. The blood dripping from the wound constitutes as an offering to the ancestors for fertility of the soil.<ref name=\"Flores\"/> \n\nMatches are usually held in the yard of a communal house. Younger boys compete during the early part of the day, while senior fighters and champions take part during the afternoon. During the match, musicians, whom usually women are gathering and playing drums and gongs as a musical accompaniment to encourage the contestants as well as the spectators.\n\nCaci in modern times is often mistaken for a dance but throughout its history until as recently as the 1970s, it was a realistic fighting art.<ref name=\"Draeger\"/> Seasoned fighters were heavily scarred on their upper body and losers further had the mark of the defeating blow on their face. Today, injuries are shallow enough to heal within a few days.\n[[File:Caci Dance.jpg|thumb|right|Caci whip fighting is one of the traditional fighting arts of the Manggarai community on Flores Island, East Nusa Tenggara.]]\n\nFights were traditionally held almost weekly but waned in popularity until they only took place during festivals. Today however, the interest from tourists has made caci more common but with changing agricultural circumstances, the art today is disconnected from its traditional symbolism. The length of the ritual is drastically shortened, showing only fragments of the process.\n\nCaci can still be seen in its original context during the Penti ceremony, usually held at 5-year intervals. Caci is most frequently performed during Penti, a traditional harvest festival to mark the the end of harvest and the beginning of the new crop cycle. During Penti festival, caci fights might last at least a full day \u2014 but more often it may takes two or three days \u2014 accompanied with the musics of gongs and drums, attracting people to come for cheering and supporting their champion from their village, and it was held in such festivities.<ref name=\"Flores\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Martial arts|Indonesia}}\n* [[Indonesian martial arts]]\n* [[Pencak silat]]\n* [[Stick-fighting]]\n* [[Whip fighting]]\n* [[Perang pandan]]\n* [[Cakalele]]\n* [[Kabasaran]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons+cat|Caci}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YdwOSfMeR8 Caci fighting video Caci Congko Lokap Gendang Poncung \"beke\" in Ruteng]\n\n{{Indonesia topics}}\n{{martial arts}}\n\n[[Category:Indonesian martial arts]]\n[[Category:Indonesian culture]]\n[[Category:Sport in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Combat sports]]\n[[Category:Whip arts]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Floresian whip fighting}}\n{{other uses|Caci}}\n{{Infobox martial art\n| logo = \n| logocaption =\n| logosize =\n| image = Tari Caci.jpg \n| imagecaption = Caci duel using whip and shield, Manggarai on Flores Island, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia.\n| imagesize = \n| name = Caci\n| aka = \n| focus = [[Whip fighting]]\n| hardness = Full-contact, [[semi-contact]], [[light-contact]]\n| country = [[Indonesia]]\n| parenthood = \n| famous_pract =\n| olympic = No\n}}\n\n'''Caci''' ({{IPA-id|t\u0283at\u0283i}}) is a form of [[Whip fighting|fighting with a whip]] or [[Stick-fighting|stick]].<ref name=\"Draeger\">{{cite book | title= Weapons & Fighting Arts of Indonesia | edition= Tuttle martial arts |first=Donn |last=Draeger |publisher = Tuttle Publishing |year=1992 |isbn=9781462905096 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1YbQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA177-IA13&lpg=PA177-IA13&dq=Fitimaen&source=bl&ots=TfrlT6-cro&sig=_Ayef4JAtopalCq4md2UxjjSqc8&hl=id&sa=X&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAmoVChMIkrq59p2IyQIVA1eOCh29VAG3#v=onepage&q=Fitimaen&f=false |accessdate= 11 November 2015 }}</ref> It appears to be indigenous to [[Flores]] in [[East Nusa Tenggara]], but it is also practiced in neighboring islands of [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]], [[Indonesia]].<ref name=\"Draeger\"/> The art is sometimes called ''cacing'' or ''ende'' in Flores, and ''larik'' or ''kebat'' in Riung, while in [[Balinese language|Balinese]] it is known as ''ende''. \n\nCaci performance is most prevalent in [[Manggarai Regency]], especially in the town of [[Ruteng]], where this ritual whip fight has become a major element of its people's cultural identity.

According to local belief, if the back of a fighter's body gets whipped, there will be a good harvest. The blood dripping from the wound constitutes as an offering to the ancestors for fertility of the soil.<ref name=\"Flores\"/> \n\nMatches are usually held in the yard of a communal house. Younger boys compete during the early part of the day, while senior fighters and champions take part during the afternoon. During the match, musicians, whom usually women are gathering and playing drums and gongs as a musical accompaniment to encourage the contestants as well as the spectators.\n\nCaci in modern times is often mistaken for a dance but throughout its history until as recently as the 1970s, it was a realistic fighting art.<ref name=\"Draeger\"/> Seasoned fighters were heavily scarred on their upper body and losers further had the mark of the defeating blow on their face. Today, injuries are shallow enough to heal within a few days.\n[[File:Caci Dance.jpg|thumb|right|Caci whip fighting is one of the traditional fighting arts of the Manggarai community on Flores Island, East Nusa Tenggara.]]\n\nFights were traditionally held almost weekly but waned in popularity until they only took place during festivals. Today however, the interest from tourists has made caci more common but with changing agricultural circumstances, the art today is disconnected from its traditional symbolism. The length of the ritual is drastically shortened, showing only fragments of the process.\n\nCaci can still be seen in its original context during the Penti ceremony, usually held at 5-year intervals. Caci is most frequently performed during Penti, a traditional harvest festival to mark the the end of harvest and the beginning of the new crop cycle. During Penti festival, caci fights might last at least a full day \u2014 but more often it may takes two or three days \u2014 accompanied with the musics of gongs and drums, attracting people to come for cheering and supporting their champion from their village, and it was held in such festivities.<ref name=\"Flores\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Martial arts|Indonesia}}\n* [[Indonesian martial arts]]\n* [[Pencak silat]]\n* [[Stick-fighting]]\n* [[Whip fighting]]\n* [[Perang pandan]]\n* [[Cakalele]]\n* [[Kabasaran]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons+cat|Caci}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YdwOSfMeR8 Caci fighting video Caci Congko Lokap Gendang Poncung \"beke\" in Ruteng]\n\n{{Indonesia topics}}\n{{martial arts}}\n\n[[Category:Indonesian martial arts]]\n[[Category:Indonesian culture]]\n[[Category:Sport in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Combat sports]]\n[[Category:Whip arts]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStyles, equipments and weapons", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caci_(fighting)"}

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.
