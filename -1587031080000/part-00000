{"title_page": "List of Shameless (British TV series) characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{About|the characters in the original UK version|a list of characters in the U.S. version|List of Shameless (American TV series) characters}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Shameless'' (British TV series) characters}}\n{{in-universe|date=January 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\nThe following is a list of fictional characters from the English comedy-drama '''''[[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]''''', created by [[Paul Abbott]], which began broadcasting on [[Channel 4]] in 2004. The programme is set on the fictional Chatsworth Estate in suburban [[Manchester]] and the surrounding area, and primarily follows the lives of the [[List of Shameless (British TV series) characters#Gallagher family|Gallagher family]] and the neighbouring [[List of Shameless (British TV series) characters#The Maguire family|Maguire family]], and their friends and neighbours in the town's shops and local pub The Jockey.\n\nThe first series focuses on layabout [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] and the lives of his six children, [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] and boyfriend [[#Steve McBride|Steve]], [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]], [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]], [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]], [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] and [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]], and next-door neighbours, [[#Kev Ball|Kev]] and [[#Veronica Ball|Veronica]].\n\nWhen the second series begins, the [[#The Maguire family|Maguire family]] are introduced, with certain episodes just focusing on their family, and both the Maguire family and Gallagher coming into contact and conflict, with marriage, teenage pregnancies and neighbourhood rivalry.\n\nOther characters also take major focus throughout the years after starting as minor characters, such as the [[#The Karib family|Karib family]]. Since the series started, the [[#Gallagher family|Gallagher family]] has split hugely, with many of the Gallagher children departing the show, due to the actors' moving onto other projects.\n\n==Credited cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Key'''\n|-\n| style=\"background: #dfd\"| Series regular || style=\"background: #fdd\" | Series guest || style=\"background: #ececec\" | No appearances\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:15px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000;\" colspan=\"12\"|\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 1 (2004)|1]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 2 (2005)|2]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 3 (2006)|3]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 4 (2007)|4]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 5 (2008)|5]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 6 (2009)|6]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 7 (2010)|7]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 8 (2011)|8]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 9 (2012)|9]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 10 (2012)|10]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 11 (2013)|11]]\n|-\n!

He appeared in 136 episodes in total.\n\nFrank's hallmarks are drunken rants on a wide variety of literary, historical and philosophical subjects, usually returning to how decent, hard-working people, among whom he erroneously seems to count himself, are discriminated against. Frank frequently quotes [[Shakespeare]], the [[Bible]], references international current events and uses poetry and soliloquy to express his feelings or view, as he does at the start of each episode. Thus, in spite of his drunken ramblings, sometimes he does come across as being well-educated owing to the issues he raises during his interactions with others.\n\nFrank is an unemployed alcoholic, and the son of [[#Neville Gallagher|Neville]] ([[John Woodvine]]) and Sarah Elizabeth Gallagher (1935\u20131972). He was married to [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]), with whom he has six children: [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee), and one, [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), to whom he is [[de jure]] father. He also has two children with [[#Sheila Gallagher|Sheila Jackson]] ([[Maggie O'Neill]]), Nigel and Delia, and is the father of Monica's half-sister, whom he fathered with Monica's mother at Monica's birthday party. He has two grandchildren, Lip's daughter, Katie Maguire, and an unnamed child of Fiona's. During one of Frank's drunken rants, it is implied that he got many girls pregnant in school. Although this is never elaborated upon, it is unclear precisely how many children Frank has actually fathered.\n\nFrank was apparently convicted and sentenced to imprisonment several times in his youth. He claimed to have been incarcerated in [[Strangeways]] Prison. It has not been mentioned what exactly were the reasons for his string of past convictions.\n\nFrank's alcoholism intensified after his first wife Monica left him for [[#Norma Starkey|Norma Starkey]] ([[Dystin Johnson]]). He then left the younger children in the care of Fiona, and moved in with agoraphobic Sheila. Often known to make a fool out of himself and shirk all responsibility, Frank nonetheless shows signs of loving his children. He can offer good advice, for example saving Liam from being taken into care when a parent was needed. When he is rendered completely sober by a new drug, Frank appears reflective and even quite intelligent, wondering why Sheila would add to her problems by marrying a mess like him. We also understand his character a bit better when Frank's father pays a visit and treats his son in a condescending and abrasive manner. Frank's father shows extreme sympathy towards Sheila and even takes care of the twins. It is also stated that his father did not always treat Frank kindly when Frank was growing up.\n\nIn early series Frank comes across as a drunken bully, even headbutting his son Ian on one occasion. Most of his children initially hate Frank for his drunken bullying ways. Lip and Ian are never scared to show their feelings towards him, and even physically attack him on a few occasions. However, his middle daughter Debbie shows sympathy throughout the series when her father is either in serious trouble or presumed dead, something which has happened three times to date. The family have generally warmed towards him more as the series has progressed, mostly because he isn't bothering them hugely on a daily basis. However, Debbie finally grew sick of taking care of the family, and cleaning up after Frank in particular, and left to join the army after series 6. Frank and Liam came into serious conflict in series 7, when Liam was forced by circumstances to take over Debbie's former burden as the de facto head of the family. At one point, Frank headbutted Liam, and a furious Carl had to be restrained from beating Frank to a pulp. Frank finally softened towards Liam when Liam threatened to commit suicide.\n\nIn series 7, Frank falls for a librarian named [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]). Libby believes Frank is a man of the arts and he encourages her to rise up against her library closing, which leads to a violent protest and her imprisonment. When Libby is released from prison, she tries to find him, but her upscale appearance causes various characters to warn Frank that the [[Department of Social Security|DSS]] is after him. Finally, they meet again, and although Libby is initially put off by his poor character and the frosty reception from Liam, she and her mother move into the Gallagher home. Frank and her mother soon set up a mutual loathing society, with Frank painting her bedroom a bright yellow just to keep her awake. However, he must also endure the endless put-downs from Libby's wheelchair-bound mother, [[#Patty Croker|Patty]] ([[Valerie Lilley]]). In Series 8 Frank is kept hostage in a psychiatric hospital by former wife Monica's girlfriend, part of Monica's plan to snatch her family back from Libby and prevent the pair from getting married. On Frank's escape, the pair stay unmarried and he eventually loses Libby in Episode 13 after cheating on her with [[#Letitia Powell|Letitia Powell]]'s (Kira Martin) headmistress ([[Annie Wallace]]).\n\nIn series 8, Frank is ready to marry Libby and he goes missing on his stag night. Libby starts putting up posters because of his disappearance. Carl and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) find a video on the internet; it is Frank having sex in public. Libby walks in and sees the video. In the feature-length 100th episode Frank is accused of beating an old lady who is well known on the estate for her scratch-card winnings. Frank suffers a blackout and throughout the episode has flashbacks of that evening. Not knowing if he actually carried out the attack he hands himself into the police. Carl is convinced Frank is innocent. He digs into the events of that night and finds that a local gangster's brother had actually carried out the attack. Frank, along with Kev devise a plan to work with the police and cut a deal with the gangster that sees Frank set free.\n\nFrom Series 9, Frank is the only original member of the Gallagher family left after Carl leaves to join the police. He now wears a darker version of his fond parka and occasionally slips on a pair of glasses when reading.\n\nBy Series 11, he and his daughter Stella who is now six years old, live at the Gallagher House along with Aidan who both are left to contend with Frank's outrageous behaviour. He is still neglectful to his sole child who shows great maturity for her age, and is shown to be thoughtful and caring to him still calling him \"Dad\". While out Frank finds his son [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), and invites him along with his granddaughter, [[#Katie Maguire|Katie]] (Bethany Thompson). He reaches an understanding with his son who treats him much better. Frank has begun a three-way relationship with prostitutes Sherilee (Sarah Totty) and Derilee (Sue Vincent), Derilee's husband Baxter arrives at the Gallagher household and holds Frank, Stella and Derilee hostage at gunpoint. While negotiating with Baxter their freedom, Monica returns to Chatsworth to take Stella's place in the hostage situation. However, Stella ends up running back inside, with Monica also being held captive. While Derilee and Baxter solve their differences, Frank and Monica have sex, resulting in Monica falling pregnant with twins. Frank was arrested and visited by her and tells her to have an abortion, however one of the twins survives, and she gives birth to [[#Ben Gallagher|Ben Gallagher]] in The Jockey. Frank shows a lack of interest in the child and leaves care to Stella. Meanwhile, Monica feigns bereavement over the baby she \"miscarried\". Frank's oldest daughter, [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona McBride]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), returns to Chatsworth with Carl and Lip. Frank learns he has a grandson from Fiona who attempts to make Frank and Monica see that their disastrous parenting is only going to damage Stella and Ben. When Fiona decides to take Stella and Ben back to Amsterdam with her, leaving her in the care of her old friend, [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]), however he loses them. Frank has an argument with Monica and decides to leave Chatsworth since he believes he is better off without his family. However, Stella follows Frank to the bus stop with Ben in her arms, as Frank rages at an upset Stella that she was a mistake and that she ruined his life, leading to her sadly walk away alone. A guilty Frank later finds Stella and Ben at a local park, he apologizes for his harsh behavior and confirms that he does love her, much to her joy. He lets Stella play while he finally takes an active role in caring for Ben. Frank soon takes them back to the Gallagher household, walking into Fiona and Monica fighting over the upbringing of the two children. He refuses to let Fiona to take his youngest children. Even though Lip and Carl try to convince Fiona otherwise, Fiona refuses to believe they will change and offer Frank money to leave as he intended. However, he refused to take it as she sees that he couldn't live without his family and is pleased to see this side. In the end, Fiona sees Stella and Ben will be fine in Frank and Monica's care, and they remain in Chatsworth.

She is [[bisexual]] and left Frank for a lorry driver named [[#Norma Starkey|Norma Starkey]] ([[Dystin Johnson]]). She came home at the end of series 1 but had left by the start of series 2, she then returned for good at the beginning of series 4 and resumed co-habiting with Frank. Although her intentions for this were unknown at first, a visit from her mother in series 5 explained her backstory and a possible reason of why she returned to be with her children. Monica announced at the beginning of series 5 that she was pregnant again, giving birth to Stella at the end of the series. She has two known grandchildren, an unnamed child from Fiona when she left in Series 2, and Lip's daughter, Katie Maguire. Monica appeared in 40 episodes overall.\n\nWhen she returned home in series 1 and series 3, her children, apart from Carl, treated her with nothing but suspicion and hostility for leaving them with Frank. Fiona (in series 1) and Debbie (in series 4\u20136) were especially hostile since they were the ones who were forced to take on the household duties. Even when Monica returned for an extended stay, Debbie was still the one to look after Liam and to an extent, her older brothers. Although Monica wanted to be a good mother, and was shown doing some household chores, laziness and selfishness prevented her from being any real help.\n\nIn series 6, feeling unloved by her children and Frank, Monica left once again. However, Monica returned in series 8,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/tv/previews/v/10241-shameless-recommissioned-for-series-8-in-2011.html|title=CultBox \u2013 British TV drama and comedy \u2013 News, reviews and interviews...|work=CultBox}}</ref> after the family receives news that her daughter, Debbie, has been killed. She acted the same way with Frank's new partner, [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]), as she earlier did with Sheila. It soon became apparent that the death was a hoax set up by Monica and her [[civil partner]], a psychiatric nurse called Mildred, who dresses up as an army officer and tells Libby that Debbie was killed in Afghanistan. Monica looked set to claim back her family, even going as far as to demand custody of her youngest children and, when Frank and Libby were reunited, Monica admitted that the reason she returned was truly for Frank as he was the one and she would \"always come back\". However, Frank knew that she would leave again, the same as she did before to him and to Norma and wouldn't let her ruin another of his relationships, so chose to stay with Libby. It was then revealed that Liam (who started warming up to her before leaving in series 6) had decided to live with Monica permanently so he could help her to see love inside herself. She returns in the show's penultimate episode when she sees on the news Frank and Stella are held hostage and tries to negotiate a deal where she would take Stella's place, but ends up locked with her daughter and ex-husband. Soon, Monica and Frank admit to still having feelings and they have sex. In the final episode, she gives birth to her eighth child, [[#Ben Gallagher|Ben]], but feels guilty about aborting his twin brother and drowns in her own guilt and neglects Ben, and the returning Fiona is disgusted to know that Monica is still the same person that abandoned her, though this time she\u2019s remorseful for letting her children down constantly.

She has a fixation with performing anal sexual acts upon Frank. She named her twins after two famous chefs, [[Delia Smith]] and [[Nigel Slater]] (although it is possible that the latter was named after [[Nigella Lawson]]). Sheila left with the twins to go on a cruise after discovering Frank had not divorced his former wife [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]), who had suddenly reappeared with her lesbian girlfriend.\n\nIn the last episode of series 5, Frank goes into a coma and dreams of his unusual family, where Monica still has her physical body, but the mental state of Sheila, In which Frank refers to her as Sheila-Monica. This is shown in the way that she dressed and the sound of her voice while holding up a sign of Sheila's face.

During the early episodes, Fiona had a part-time job as a teaching assistant at a local nursery. Fiona appeared in 19 episodes in total.\n\nDuring her childhood, she used to be referred to by the other kids at school as \"Pov Gallagher\" due to her family's low income and her parents' perpetual unemployment. Fiona also once claimed to be proud that she was the only girl in her year-group during secondary school not to fall pregnant before taking her GCSEs.\n\nAfter her boyfriend [[#Steve McBride|Steve McBride]] ([[James McAvoy]]) got caught up in a botched drug bust, he had to leave the Chatsworth Estate. Fiona was reluctant to leave with him, as she did not want to abandon her siblings and friends. During his absence, she briefly hooked up with [[#Craig Garland|Craig Garland]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and became pregnant with his child. But she still retained feelings for Steve, and when he returned briefly, he told Fiona that her siblings were more than capable of looking after themselves without her, and that she deserved a better life outside of Chatsworth. With the support of her family and friends, Fiona left with Steve at the end of series 2 and now resides in [[Amsterdam]]. In series 8, [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]) mentioned that Fiona was married.\n\nIn the final episode of the show, Fiona is called back to Chatsworth by her mother Monica after hearing she has lost a baby.

She is disgusted to find Monica and Frank are neglecting Ben and choosing to let Fiona's six-year-old sister [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] to take care of him. Reminded of her own past as sole parental guidance for her other siblings, as well as overhearing [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]) talk about the mistreatment her younger siblings will receive once Monica gets over the aborted child, Fiona plots to snatch Stella and Ben to free them of the lifestyle she and her younger siblings went through. She leaves the kids with [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]) so that she can contact Steve. However, Stella runs away and takes her brother. When they are found by Frank, he stops Fiona's plans and she still isn't convinced to leave the kids with her parents after Lip and [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) plead with her not go through with it. Fiona learns from Stella that Frank tried to leave though didn't because he had no money and offers her father money but he doesn't take it and she is convinced of his change.

His half-brothers are [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]), Sean Bennett and 3 unnamed sons of Gary Bennett, while his half-sisters are [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona Gallagher]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella Gallagher]] (Nikita Brownlee). He has one niece, Katie Maguire and through Fiona a nephew. He used to work at The Jockey as a barman but in more recent series his employment, if he has any, has not been shown. Ian appeared in 80 episodes overall.\n\nIn the early series, Ian is depicted as closest to his brother Lip, with whom he shares a room, and is initially the only member of his family to know that he was gay. The brothers often have to look out for each other more than any of the other characters, due to being party to each other's secrets. In later series, all the family, except [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]), are aware of his sexuality. However, it was often implied Frank knew all along but didn't care and accepted Ian for who he was.\n\nIan often identifies as [[Homosexual|gay]], having various relationships with older men throughout the first four or five series. [[#Kash Karib|Kash Karib]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) was his only long-term boyfriend, though he has a brief relationship with Sean Bennett, and an ongoing friendship, sometimes sexual, with [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]). Because he is unaware of his parentage at the time, Ian also unknowingly sleeps with his half-brother. Ian sees Sean Bennett at their biological father's funeral and later tells the truth to Sean, who wants to keep seeing Ian, but eventually agrees that they can not ignore their familial relationship. Beginning in the fourth series, Ian has a number of relationships with women. He repeatedly has sex with a girl he is briefly hiding in his home for her protection, but when she asks him to leave with her, he declines, knowing a relationship would not work. He has a relationship of convenience with [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]), to protect his secret, which nearly turns sexual when they're both at a low point, but they fumble about until Ian decides it's a bad idea. In the seventh series, Ian begins a serious relationship with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]). When Maxine's brother, [[#Bruce Donnelly|Bruce]] ([[Philip Hill-Pearson]]) asks if their being in a relationship means Ian is now \"bisexual\", Ian pauses, before saying he just believes he has found the right person.\n\nDue to Gerard Kearns break to work on a film,<ref>Paul English.

He returns in the seventh episode; this features the debut of Danny, a deaf teenager whom Ian unwittingly transports back to the UK in the boot of his car. Ian now lives in the house of Danny's deceased grandfather, which was leased to him by Danny's Aunt Pegg, in gratitude for looking after him. Danny and Pegg later move to Spain he later lets Mickey move in with him.\n\nIn Series 7, it appears Ian has remained at Danny's old address and has accepted Micky as a tenant. Ian supports Carl's girlfriend Maxine when she decides to have an abortion and break up with Carl. Maxine moves in with Micky and Ian. The situation becomes complicated when Maxine asks Ian to pose as her boyfriend to impress her parents. Ian and Maxine begin to develop feelings for each other and have sex. Micky sees them and tries to convince Ian he shouldn't be with a woman, but Ian says the labels don't matter, he wants to be with Maxine. This leads to a major falling out with Micky, who feels betrayed. Micky tells Carl, who then beats up Ian in the toilets at The Jockey before Frank breaks it up. In spite of the remaining tensions, Ian and Maxine become a couple.\n\nEven with the lingering animosity from Carl and Micky, Ian and Maxine are happy but they are thrown into turmoil when Carl, along with [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]), runs away after being accused of murder. Ian is initially not bothered with Carl's absence, and is more concerned at just how concerned Maxine is over Carl. When Ian and Maxine are in The Jockey, Maxine confronts Jimmy, whom everyone knows is the killer. As Ian looks on, Jimmy's sister hits Maxine in the head with a pool cue. Ian feels ashamed that he let Maxine fight the battle on her own and in spite of her reassurances, he begins to believe that she would have been better off with Carl. To try to prove his worth, Ian attempts to tape a confession from Jimmy, but Jimmy sees through his plan and savagely beats him. Ian begins to further withdraw and is unable to have sex with Maxine; during the time they do spend together, he becomes more paranoid about her feelings every time she mentions Carl. Carl's name is soon cleared and he attempts to make amends with Ian, but Ian isn't interested. He again accuses Maxine of wanting to be with Carl, to which she tells Ian she just doesn't want to be with him. In spite of this conflict, Ian and Maxine still have strong feelings for each other, and Carl convinces Maxine that she and Ian belong together. Ian shows up at hospital soon after Carl and Maxine talk, and he and Maxine smile at each other, and they reconcile.\n\nIn the finale of series 7, Ian and Maxine were returning home after a night out, when they are accosted by a ruffian who attempts to mug them. But they fight back and overpower the thug, and drag him back unconscious to their house. The thug turns out to be a hireling of Roscoe, a Moss Side-based crime lord. After hours of deciding what to do with him, Maxine overhears a conversation where Ian admits that he would \"rather fuck him than kill him\". This seems to be the end of the relationship, as Ian's sexuality may might turn out to be the source of future infidelities. When Ian prepares himself to kill the thug, Maxine and he find that he escaped from his bonds while they were conversing. Ian is seen later with a backpack, apparently leaving Chatsworth. It is not stated whether it is because he is leaving Maxine or if it is to avoid retribution by Roscoe's gang. He happens upon [[Karen Maguire]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), as she and [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]) are about to leave Chatsworth themselves. After witnessing Joe's abusive treatment of Karen, Ian stows away in the boot of Joe's car. After Joe tries to beat and abuse Karen, Ian kills him and makes his exit from the show to dispose of the body.\n\nIn a later episode in series 8, Carl is shown to get a \"Happy Birthday\" text from Ian. In the final episode of the show, Lip mentions that Ian is engaged to a transsexual.\n\n===Debbie Gallagher===\n\n*'''Played by:''' [[Rebecca Ryan]] (Series 1\u20136)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Debbie Gallagher\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = [[Rebecca Ryan]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

She is [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) and [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica Gallagher]]'s ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) second eldest daughter. [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) and [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) are her brothers. Her sisters are [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee); her half-brothers are [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) and Nigel; and her half-sister is Delia. Although Debbie is only 16 (at the time of her last appearance on the show in 2009), she is old beyond her years because she grew up without a mother and undertook the majority of the domestic tasks, At the start of the series Debbie tended to use her childlike innocence to get out of any mess she or family get themselves into. Since Fiona went to [[Amsterdam]], Debbie is often tasked with saving the family from ruin. For example, she steps in when Liam denounces God and the school he attends makes a move to expel him. Although the results are disastrous, she shows herself to be a diligent individual upon whom her family can depend. Originally Debbie was presented as a slightly unusual and awkward child, she retains her high intelligence and resourcefulness throughout the show. This allows Debbie to be successful when she becomes head of the household and takes care of the domestic duties such as cooking, ironing, cleaning and taking Liam to school. She also provides her family members with a high level of emotional support. As a consequence, Debbie missed out on socialising and has become mature beyond her years. When Fiona left Chatsworth at the end of series 2, Debbie seemed, at first, to relish the responsibility of running Gallagher household. Debbie appeared in 65 episodes in total.\n\nIn series one, Debbie abducts a three-year-old boy because she \"wanted a girl, but none of the girls on the estate would take the chocolate\". So she dressed him up in girls clothes. The child's disappearance caused the majority of the estate to go up in arms in search for young \"Jody\". When Debbie finally admits her actions to her family, a furious and bewildered Fiona, [[#Steve McBride|Steve McBride]] ([[James McAvoy]]), Lip, and Ian, formulate a plan to return the youngster back to his family without incriminating Debbie. After circulating false rumours of sightings around the Chatsworth Estate for much of the day, Debbie emerges as the hero of the hour when she returns the boy to his distressed family.\n\nDebbie's closest familial relationship is with her father, Frank. Unlike Fiona, Lip, Ian and Carl, Debbie admires him and often shows her love for him, often seen to be the most affected when he is in danger or trouble. For example, she screams in terror when she believes that Frank's body has been found in a nearby canal. Throughout the series, Frank often lets Debbie down and seems to be unappreciative of her efforts to keep the family together. For example, during some of his drunken rants, he presents himself as being lumbered with children whom he has the sole responsibility of caring for them and seems to forget occasionally what an asset Debbie is to the family. Debbie's feelings of closeness to Frank often leave her the most vulnerable to being let down by him. Debbie's loyalty to her father is occasionally rewarded, and it is strongly suggested that Frank appreciates \"Little Debbie\" more than anyone else in the world, though that changes when he tells her crush Luke that she sleeps around the estate in hopes she doesn't sacrifice money for charity, and even when Frank tries to do good and give her money for a trip she still refuses to forgive him. Debbie also detests her mother more than the rest of the family, refusing to forgive her for abandoning them years ago or for her continued laziness and self-absorption. She did respond sympathetically when more details became clear regarding Monica's abusive childhood at her mother's hands. In contrast, Debbie was close to Frank's ex-wife, [[#Sheila Jackson|Sheila]] ([[Maggie O'Neill]]).\n\nDebbie's relationship with the rest of her family is generally good. She views her siblings as her dependants and generally supports them through their various misadventures. The rest of her family generally recognises all she does for them. She's particularly protective of and very close to her younger brother Liam. Her relationship with him seems to border between surrogate-parent and partner-in-crime, as she has frequently enlisted Liam's help with some of her past schemes. These include faking Liam's kidnapping when Frank wouldn't admit that he hadn't won the lottery, and she once entered him in a modelling competition, which she wanted to keep a secret from Monica. She can also be seen to forge strong relationships with other characters, notably [[#Marty Fisher|Marty Fisher]] ([[Jack Deam]]) and [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]), she also tends to come up with numerous money-making schemes to provide income.\n\nIt is revealed in Series 5 that Debbie has been in a secret relationship with police officer [[#Tom O'Leary|Tom O'Leary]] ([[Michael Legge (actor)|Michael Legge]]), despite the fact that she is only 15 years old. Debbie and Tom break up at the beginning of series 6 during her 16th birthday party when she realises that Tom is too old for her and that he wants much more from the relationship. Tom begins to stalk her, although he tells workmate Carrie that Debbie has been stalking him.\n\nDebbie is now seemingly in a relationship with a man called Mark, whom she met on a night out with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]) and when she got drunk, he took her back to his student residence to sleep, but nothing more. Debbie left the students room the next morning, thinking that she'd never see him again. However, at a funeral the family had been invited to, they met again, and she discovered it was his Grandmothers funeral.\n\nAt first, Debbie was a little objective to a relationship with him after he made comments about Frank (who had decided to go to the toilet behind a tree at the funeral and then punched Mark) however she told Maxine of her feelings for him. He later appeared outside Debbie's home and when she refused to see him, he sat on a chair in the middle of the road until she did. He later used the chair when a hired gunman was going to kill both [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) and [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]), but Mark knocked the hit-man out with the chair.\n\nAfter this, Debbie and Mark have sex in on the kitchen floor, reminiscent to the scene in the first episode where Steve and Fiona also have sex in the kitchen, in the same place as Debbie does. Debbie does not return in 2010 for series 7. We find out from Frank's grandmother, who comes to visit, that Debbie has joined the army. At seventeen, Debbie perhaps had no wish to allow her role as the driving force of the Gallagher household hold her back from her potential. Liam, who had been virtually brought up by Debbie since the age of four, has taken on her former role in the Gallagher household or maybe after Child Services incident she realized she was unfit to being a parent figure to her dysfunctional family and joined the Army to find her place.\n\nIn episode 11 of series 7, Debbie sends the family a letter telling them she's being sent to [[Afghanistan]]. In Episode 1 of Series 8 an army SNCO visits the Gallagher household and reveals that Debbie has been killed in action. This subsequently turned out to be a malicious joke by Frank's ex-wife Monica.\n\n===Carl Gallagher===\n{{main|Carl Gallagher}}\n*'''Played by:''' [[Elliott Tittensor]] (Series 1\u20139, 11)<br>[[Luke Tittensor]] (Series 1)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Carl Gallagher\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = [[Elliott Tittensor]] (2004\u201313)<br>[[Luke Tittensor]] (2004)\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

The son of [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) and [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica Gallagher]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]), his brothers are [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]) and [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]); his sisters are [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee); his half-brothers are [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) and Nigel; and his half-sister is Delia. Initially he played only a minor role in the show, but since series two has been featured just as much as the other Gallagher children. Carl appeared in 117 episodes in total.\n\nIn the first series, Carl was jointly played by Tittensor's twin brother [[Luke Tittensor]], but since the second series he has played the role alone.\n\nIn series 3, Carl briefly worked for the Maguires by growing marijuana for them in his loft, until the police found out about the production. Carl was briefly taken into custody, and gave a statement that the marijuana was grown for the household's own personal use. But after a tip was given to the police about [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]) selling weed, her mother [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]) suspected that Carl betrayed them and sent her sons, [[#Donny Maguire|Donny]] (Clyve Bonelle) and [[Shane Maguire]] ([[Nicky Evans]]), after him. Later, Carl's siblings Lip, Ian and Debbie, figured out that the only person with the motive for informing the police about Mandy's dealings was in fact her brother Shane, who was angry that his mother chose his sister over him to oversee that area of the family business. After Lip confronted Shane over the matter, Shane agreed to call off the family hunt for Carl.\n\nCarl develops a long tally of sexual conquests in the later series, one notable example being the mother of one girl whom he was dating during his last year of secondary school.\n\nIn series 6, Carl realizes [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) is gay; he is one of the few people on the estate, along with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]), his brother Liam and his half-brother Ian, who is aware of this. Mickey makes several unsuccessful passes at Carl.\n\nThrough series 6 and early series 7, Carl pursues and begins a relationship with auxiliary nurse Maxine. Carl breaks up with Maxine after she admits to having aborted his child and feeling he is too immature to be a father. Carl soon decides he wants another chance with Maxine, and is encouraged when she has sex with him in the Jockey toilets. However, he does not know that Maxine only had sex with him to get her mind off Ian, whom she is beginning to have feelings for. Carl proposes to Maxine, but she turns him down. Carl continues to hope until Micky, out of hurt and jealousy, tells Carl about Maxine and Ian. A heartbroken and enraged Carl meets Ian in The Jockey toilets before savagely beating him. He smashes the engagement ring to pieces and cuts all ties to Maxine and Ian.\n\nCarl begins working for Michelle, the head of a male escort agency that [[Jamie Maguire]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]) briefly worked for; when Jamie no longer wants to have sex with her, an eager Carl is more than capable of taking over the job. Unfortunately this proves to be the one bright spot for Carl around this time. He and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) go to a party and afterwards are in the street with a boy named Bonehead, who shows them a video he took of a girl he'd taken advantage of. Her brother, Jimmy, a local tough, viciously attacks Bonehead in front of them, and threatens them into staying silent. When Bonehead dies, Jimmy makes sure they are seen as the prime suspects, and threatens them into fleeing town. Carl and Chesney end up on a farm in Wales, but when Carl is able to get reception for his mobile phone, the messages of support from Maxine and his family move him and he and Chesney decide to return home. They hide in Chesney's shop but when Jimmy again threatens Carl's family, Carl attacks him. Carl even gets a gun to use on Jimmy, but [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]) convinces him this would be a mistake. Ultimately, Joe makes Jimmy disappear, Jimmy's sister clears Carl and Chesney, and the Maguires convince Jimmy's gang to leave the Gallaghers and Chesney alone.\n\nCarl and Ian still have bad blood, with blood literally spilled for Ian as his attempt to tape a confession from Jimmy had ended in a beating. Ian did not accept Carl's apologies for what had happened over Maxine and he drives Maxine away by accusing her of still wanting to be with Carl. Carl visits Maxine at hospital and tells her he knows she was right to have the abortion. He convinces her to give Ian another chance, as he says that he can be her mate, but Ian is her soulmate. Ian and Maxine reconcile, and so do Carl and Ian.\n\nAs of series 8, Carl is the only original Gallagher child left, after Liam decided to stay with his mum, and Carl seems to have feelings for best mate Chesney's cousin, [[#Sita Desai|Sita Desai]] (Aysha Kala). He also had sexual relations with her. He proposes to Sita, but she turns him down. He isn't good enough for her. Carl also seems to fancy soon-to-be stepmother [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]), when he starts to get visibly aroused when he looks at her backside and legs.\n\nIn series 9, Carl becomes a police officer and leaves Chatsworth to move in with his girlfriend, Clem, thus leaving none of the original Gallagher children (besides Stella) on the estate.\n\nHe returns in the series finale, along with Fiona and Lip where they arrive for the birth of their new brother Ben. He tries to plead with Lip on not letting Fiona go with her choice of taking the kids Stella and Ben, since he was closest to Frank. At the end, Carl gets through to his brother and watched Lip plead to Fiona because turned out fine with or without their parents. He watches Fiona hand Frank money to leave however, the latter refused to take it as Carl sees that he couldn't live without his family and is pleased to see this side. In the end, he makes amends with his family and partakes in their activities.\n\n===Liam Gallagher===\n\n*'''Played by:''' Joseph Furnace (Series 1\u20132)/[[Johnny Bennett]] (Series 3\u20138)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Liam Gallagher\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = Joseph Furnace (Series 1\u20132)<br>[[Johnny Bennett]] (Series 3\u20138)\n| years          = 2004\u20132011\n| first          = 13 January 2004<br>Series 1 Episode 1<br>\"Meet the Gallaghers\"\n| last           = 12 January 2011<br>Series 8 Episode 2<br>\"Missing\"\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

He is named after [[Liam Gallagher|the singer of the same name]]. He apparently suffered from epileptic fits when he was smaller, although this has never been seen. It was also implied that he used to wet the bed, though he claims that it was only to help put out the fires, which he had a fondness for starting, as seen during his pyromania phase in series 4\u20135 \u2013 matchboxes and lighter-fluid were routinely found under his mattress by his brothers [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) and [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]). Throughout the series, Liam is practically raised by his older sisters, [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]) and [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), as his father [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) is lazy and mother [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) inept- when she is around. In later episodes, Liam shows considerable intelligence and resourcefulness like sister Debbie and is also an outspoken atheist. In series 5, signs of genius in Liam became obvious when he was shown to be an adept car thief, much like [[#Steve McBride|Steve McBride]] ([[James McAvoy]]), and was seen later to use a defibrillator on a comatose Frank when it was thought that his heart had stopped. In series 6, it is revealed that Liam is a talented musician, and also fluent in [[British Sign Language|Sign Language]]. Given his academic performance, the school determines Liam to be an exceptionally gifted pupil, which leads to him being awarded a special scholarship. During an interview at a local university, he initially fails to make a good impression due to nervousness. But that changed when his father Frank attempts to steal the \"Joy of Sex\" manual from the university library; Liam plucks up the courage to tell the panel of education directors why he deserves the scholarship in an impassioned speech. Liam appeared in 78 episodes in total.\n\nLiam was also persuaded by his brother Carl to create false identities on the internet for him, [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]), [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]), and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]), so they would be admitted into an exclusive nightclub.\n\nIn series 3, the then five-year-old Liam was almost expelled from his RC primary school when he openly denounced religion during a Christmas nativity play that was held by the school. Debbie learned of this development on New Year's Day 2006 when meeting with Liam's headteacher and a local parish priest. Debbie tried to warn Frank of the situation and the expected visit from the school, but to no avail. On the day of the school visit, and when it was apparent that Frank was not going to help, Debbie had to take matters into her own hands. She shaved Liam's head, and told the school administrators that her little brother had cancer. Unfortunately, the rumour got out of hand, and spread out across the Chatsworth community, until a fundraiser for \"Liam Day\" was set up by [[#Jez|Jez]] (Lindsey Dawson), the landlady of \"The Jockey\", ultimately ending it with Liam outing himself at not having cancer.\n\nWhile apparently an atheist, it was hinted in series 6 that Liam may have had change of perception on the matter, even when he expertly refuted the arguments of two Jehovah's Witnesses, whom Monica tricked into babysitting Liam and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee), he stated that \"they may not know it, but they're right and I'm wrong\". He also tried to get rid of the clothes Debbie and Maxine stole, thinking that they brought \"bad Karma\". In series 7, Liam quoted from passages in the Old and New Testaments that condoned prostitution when [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Maguire]] ([[Sally Carman]]) thought that her occupation would disqualify her as godmother of [[Karen Maguire|Karen]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]) and [[Jamie Maguire]]'s ([[Aaron McCusker]]) son, Connor. And was seen later with a copy of the Torah when counselling a Jewish convert with a penchant for pork-scratchings. Although knowledgeable about religion, Liam does not appear to endorse nor practice any of them.\n\nLiam is now one of the few people in Chatsworth who is aware of Micky homosexuality. He sarcastically tells Micky that he figured it out through his \"amazing powers of deduction\", despite Micky's stereotypically gay mannerisms and aesthetic preferences.\n\nIn series 7, Debbie has left Chatsworth to join the army, and perhaps due to this, Liam seems to have taken on more responsibility within the household, even getting a job delivering newspapers to support the family. His relationship with Frank has soured to the point that Liam has grown openly contemptuous of his father as he starts to develop more of Debbie's traits, (such as shouting at and attacking Frank and Carl for their antics). Liam now attends a prestigious senior school.\n\nHe soon falls for a girl called Holly, whom he meets during his music lessons. Holly takes Liam home to meet her parents, when he tells them his father is a deceased heart specialist. But an accident at school exposes the lie. Despite this, Holly wanted to continue the relationship, but her comments against Frank hurt Liam's feelings, and cause him to leave with Frank.\n\nAfter the Gallagher household falls behind on their HP payments, Liam gambles at [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]]'s ([[Ben Batt]]) shop to raise cash. Despite showing great aptitude early on, Liam ends up losing to Joe's bluff during a game of poker, owing him \u00a3100. Unable to come up with the money, Liam desperately asks his drunk father for help. Frank accidentally headbutts him, causing Liam to run out of The Jockey. Later on in the episode, Liam contacts Joe, asking \"if I die, would it clear my debt?\" Joe hurriedly seeks out Frank, Carl and Ian, who find Liam on top of a building threatening to jump. When a scuffle ensures between his brothers and father, he moves to a different ledge, and throws his phone down. After a heartfelt pledge by Frank to be more supportive, and from Joe to write-off his debt to him, Liam seemingly jumps, but he simply lands onto the balcony 7 feet down, recovers his mobile phone, and holds both Joe and Frank to their promises.\n\nWhen Carl is framed for the death of a local boy, Liam is instrumental in helping to clear his name and convincing him to come home.\n\nLiam struggles to adjust to Frank's new girlfriend [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]) taking over the mother role in the household. Liam begins to act more hostile towards her than ever. Liam feels that Frank is taking advantage of Libby, as he did with [[#Sheila Jackson|Sheila Jackson]] ([[Maggie O'Neill]]). The family realise why when Carl finds a letter Liam has kept from Debbie which tells them she has been sent to Afghanistan. Liam does a school report on a [[World War II]] veteran, Reggie. Slowly they become friends and Liam tries to help Reggie as he has no one to take care of him since being widowed. Carl, Kelly, and Libby all feel suspicious of their friendship, especially when Libby sees Liam wearing a dress (Liam wore one of Debbie's dresses as it reminded him of her smell). Liam defends Reggie, but when Reggie, knowing that he was close to death, desperately hugs him and doesn't want to let go. Liam completely mis-interprets Reggie's reasons, and flees the house. However, Liam begins to realise he was wrong about Reggie and returns to apologise and sit with Reggie as he dies.\n\nLiam skillfully plays an acoustic guitar during The Jockey's talent night in episode 12. By then, he seems to have eventually warmed to Libby after she promised him that she would never leave no matter how much Frank might put her off. In various episodes, Liam is seen to adopt Debbie's mannerisms and views in respect of his feelings about religion, figures of authority and the ways in which his family cope with one another. Debbie was Liam's main care-giver and role model since Fiona's departure from Chatsworth in series 2, being the main nurturing influence in his life from the ages of four to ten. Debbie and Liam had such a strong bond with each other, that she would frequently use his help in various activities. It was to Liam whom she addressed the letter to when she was assigned to Afghanistan.\n\nBetween Series 7\u20138, Liam was the remaining Gallagher on the Chatsworth estate that possesses any sense of responsibility and maturity. In series 8, when the family received the news of Debbie's death in Afghanistan, Liam was willing to travel on his own to personally break the news to Fiona. But there was no need, as the news turned out to be a cruel hoax by the returning Monica. When Monica came back, Liam finally confronted his mother on her attitude toward her family. Monica replied that her relationship with his father was \"above right or wrong\". When Monica left after her deception was revealed, Liam followed her to the bus stop, where her latest Lesbian lover greeted her. Liam realized this was the same person whom earlier dressed as an army NCO to falsely inform them of Debbie's death. Liam attends Frank's stagnight to keep him out of trouble, but the other drunken revellers playfully tie Frank up and leave him in a cemetery, while taking Liam to a brothel and leaving him with a prostitute. Libby is furious when she finds out, but Liam assures her that he didn't have sex. He only paid the girl for her time with him, and won the money back in a game of Three Card Brag. When Frank goes missing after his stag night, Monica demands custody of Liam and Stella. When she came to collect them, Liam forced Monica to take him rather than Stella, otherwise he would make her life difficult. Liam left with Monica after saying he would come back as soon as Monica gets her new house from the council, which was the true reason she wanted Liam and Stella in the first place. In the fifth episode, just before Frank and Libby's wedding, Carl reads a best man's speech written by Liam, which turns out to be a personal message from him. Liam says that he's decided to stay with Monica, saying that she's had a hard life and that he wants to help her love herself, much to the sadness of everyone in attendance. Liam had left the Chatsworth Estate to live with Monica. Although, by Series 11, Monica came to live with Frank, without Liam, indicating that Liam left his mother sometime after the events in Series 8. In the final episode of ''Shameless'', Liam was stated by Lip to be a practicing [[Buddhist]].\n\n===Stella Gallagher===\n\n*'''Played by:''' Alana & Anabelle Crampton (Series 6\u201310) / Nikita Brownlee (Series 11)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name = Stella Gallagher\n| series = Shameless\n| portrayer = Alana & Anabelle Crampton (Series 6\u201310)<br>Nikita Brownlee (Series 11)\n| years = 2008\u20132013\n| first = 15 April 2008<br>Series 5 Episode 16<br>\"The Ninth Time Around\"\n| last = 28 May 2013<br>Series 11 Episode 14<br>\"End of the Line\"\n| creator = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer = [[George S.

Stella appeared in 15 episodes overall.\n\nStella is born to Frank and Monica in April 2008, with Monica giving birth next to Frank, who is in a coma during the birth. Like before, Stella's siblings, primarily [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) and [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), look after her, while Frank and Monica continue with their previous disastrous parenting. During Series 6, Monica walks out on the family again, leading to Social Services temporarily taking Liam and Stella into care, however neighbours [[#Yvonne Karib|Yvonne Karib]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]) and [[#Stan Waterman|Stan Waterman]] (Warren Donnelly) offer to foster them in order to keep them close to the Gallaghers. When Frank's new partner [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]), her mother [[#Patty Croker|Patty]] ([[Valerie Lilley]]) and their relative [[#Aidan Croker|Aidan]] (Robbie Conway) move in, all of them look after Stella alongside Liam and Carl, while Frank continues to neglect his children.\n\nBy Series 11, Stella is now 6 years old, and is shown to be thoughtful and caring. She and Aidan are the only ones left to contend with Frank's outrageous behavior. She shows great maturity for her age, as she covered for her father after he was in involved in a riot. Stella still loves her father, still calling him \"Dad\" and taking caring of him when needed. She meets her older brother, [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), and gets on well with his daughter, [[#Katie Maguire|Katie]] (Bethany Thompson). After Frank begins a threeway relationship with prostitutes Sherilee (Sarah Totty) and Derilee (Sue Vincent), Derilee's husband Baxter arrives at the Gallagher household and holds Frank, Stella and Derilee hostage at gunpoint. While negotiating with Baxter their freedom, Monica returns to Chatsworth to take Stella's place in the hostage situation, holding no resentment like her other siblings is happy to see her mother. However, Stella ends up running back inside, after her father protects her from a stray bullet with Monica also being held captive. While Derilee and Baxter solve their differences, Frank and Monica have sex, resulting in Monica falling pregnant with twins. She has an abortion, however one of the twins survives, and she gives birth to [[#Ben Gallagher|Ben Gallagher]] in The Jockey. As Monica feigns bereavement over the baby she \"miscarried\", and Frank neglecting his newborn son, Stella is forced to take on the role of looking after Ben. Stella's oldest sibling, [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona McBride]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), returns to Chatsworth with Carl and Lip, and attempt to make Frank and Monica see that their disastrous parenting is only going to damage Stella and Ben. Fiona decides to take Stella and Ben back to Amsterdam with her, leaving her in the care of her old friend, [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]), however he loses them. Stella follows Frank to the bus stop with Ben in her arms, where she claims to her father that she wants to stay with him. However, Frank tells her she should go with Fiona and rages at an upset Stella that she (along with his other children) were a mistake and that she ruined his life, leading to her sadly walk away with her brother. A guilty Frank later finds Stella and Ben at a local park, he tries to apologize for his harsh behavior and after a series of events, he confirms that he does love her, much to her joy. Frank then takes the burden of Stella caring for Ben off her shoulders, while taking an active role himself.\n\nFrank takes them back to the Gallagher household, walking into Fiona and Monica fighting over the upbringing of the two children. Even though Lip and Carl try to convince Fiona otherwise, Fiona refuses to believe they will change and Stella stands up for their father by voicing his stopping himself from leaving the family. Stella watches as Fiona offer Frank money to leave as he intended. However, he refused to take it as she sees that he couldn't live without his family and is pleased to see this side.

She is somewhat resentful of Frank, calling him a \"selfish little shit\". She is close to all of his children, especially her great-grandson [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]). She is the carer for her husband Bunty, who does nothing but eat. Out of desperation, she shoots Bunty dead in front of Frank and willingly goes to prison for it. She is last seen when she is visited by her grandsons Liam and [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), and she appears to be loving prison life.

His cherished wife is [[Mimi Maguire|Mimi]] ([[Tina Malone]]), and he has an identical twin brother called Noel ([[Sean Gilder]]), who is gay. It was shown in Series 6 that he is a supporter of [[Celtic F.C.]] and in the background at the Maguire residence there is a statue of a Celtic player, who looks similar to the old Celtic captain, Bobby Lennox. Paddy appeared in 52 episodes in total.\n\nPaddy is extremely aggressive and violent and his presence puts fear into most people on the Chatsworth Estate. For example, when he and his family enter the local pub, The Jockey, the customers sitting at the table beside the entrance clear the seat for them. He and his family are also drug dealers on the Chatsworth estate. He has a particular dislike for the Gallagher family, particularly [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) and [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), which he has demonstrated on several occasions, both physically and verbally. However, in more recent series, Paddy has begun to show a more compassionate side, and since series four, he has also become much more accepting of Lip, as well as [[Karen Maguire|Karen Jackson]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), the wife of his oldest son [[Jamie Maguire|Jamie]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]). Paddy's identical twin brother Noel was credited as being played by Neil Grades, an anagram of actor Sean Gilder. Paddy also has a strong sense of family and is loyal toward them. For example, when his daughter-in-law Karen becomes severely depressed he becomes the rock upon which she can lean.\n\nDespite his initial dislike of Frank, this mindset was then turned after Paddy choked on a cashew nut in The Jockey and Frank performed the Heimlich manoeuvre, thus saving Paddy's life. Frank also saved Paddy's life again, stopping him from injecting himself with what would have been a lethal dose of [[heroin]]. Paddy now has some grudging respect for the Gallaghers.\n\nDespite showing open contempt for higher education, Paddy has occasionally shown knowledge of certain literary subjects.\n\nIn Series 6, Paddy was briefly abducted by the mother of a teenager who died after using his drugs, who in revenge repeatedly injected Paddy with heroin, causing him to become addicted to the substance. His attempts to conceal his new habit and deal with its effect on his life were a recurring theme of Series 6, with him finally going cold turkey later in the series, during which he had visions of his father Padraig. In addition to the visions of his father, Paddy fantasizes about sleeping with Karen and [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Maguire]] ([[Sally Carman]]), who are both his daughters-in-law.\n\nIn series 7, Paddy's marriage to Mimi is near enough over, due to the fact that his affair with Maureen results in the tragic circumstances of the series 6 finale, in which daughter [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]) is murdered in an explosion. Separated, living in separate houses and each given the freedom to see other people, Paddy takes a night out with sons Jamie, [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]) and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) as an opportunity to restart his love life with a meaningless one-night stand with a female clubber. When he can't \"pull\", he returns home, alone and defeated, and is greeted by Kelly. After a short conversation, Paddy hands Kelly an amount of money, in exchange for sex. Kelly accepts this money, and they have sex in the living room, while Kelly's boyfriend and Paddy's son Shane look all over the nightclub for him. Later on in the episode, an awkward Paddy and Kelly exchange moments, in which Paddy offers Shane and Kelly the master bedroom of the Maguire house, out of guilt. Some time later, Kelly rejected Shane's marriage proposal, as she could not marry him after lying to him. Shane insisted he would forgive her anything, no matter whom she had slept with, but the guilty looks between Paddy and Kelly made him realise what had happened between them. Paddy was so ashamed of his actions that he was willing to inject himself with heroin at Shane's request, but Shane stopped him at the last minute. Paddy then attended Shane's and Kelly's wedding.\n\nPaddy starts a relationship with a dance enthusiast named D'reen ([[Cathy Murphy]]), and makes plans to emigrate to [[Cuba]] with her. When he realises that he cannot leave his family and business, Paddy puts a stop{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} to his plans, and shares one last dance with D'reen before she leaves.\n\nPaddy begins applying heavy pressure on Jock, the owner of the boxing club, who had borrowed heavily from the Maguires. Meanwhile, he relentlessly belittles Micky when he wants to join the fire brigade. Micky's self-confidence falls through the floor and he berates Paddy for always putting him down. Paddy's belligerence towards Jock leads Jock to set himself and the club on fire. Micky risks his life to save Jock. When Jock is in hospital, Paddy reveals that he had been a young boxer at the club; he had real potential to use his skills to get a better life, but Jock essentially sold him to a crime family. Micky reveals to Paddy that he lied about passing his fire test. Paddy tells Micky it doesn't matter, Micky is still more of a man than he will ever be.\n\nOn 6 March 2010, it was announced that Sean Gilder had quit ''Shameless'' after five years with the show because of his rumoured dislike of [[Tina Malone]] who portrays Mimi.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He departed ''Shameless'' at the end of Series 7, Episode 14.\n\nAfter Paddy's departure, Mimi gives birth to her eighth child, Cilla. It is unclear whether or not Paddy has died. Frank utters the words, at one point in the show: \"I never thought I would say this, but bring back Paddy Maguire!\" Although, in the same episode, [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]) implied to Karen that Paddy was killed after returning to Ireland. In episode 14 of series 8 a coffin is carried through the estate, supposedly with Paddy inside, but it turns out this was Paddy's way of smuggling guns to the rest of the Maguires. Jamie tells Kelly that Paddy's plan was to make the police think he was dead, so he could start again, and that he is now living in Thailand.\n\n===Mimi Tutton===\n*'''Played by:''' [[Tina Malone]] (Series 2\u201311)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Mimi Tutton\n| series         = [[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]\n| portrayer      = [[Tina Malone]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

She is the wife of [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy Maguire]] ([[Sean Gilder]]), mother of [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]) and Cilla Tutton and the Maguire boys, [[Jamie Maguire|Jamie]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]), [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]), [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]), the late Fergal and the little seen [[#Joey Maguire|Joey]] (Will Willoughby) and [[#Donny Maguire|Donny]] (Clyve Bonelle), and the daughter of \"Nana\" Murphy. Her ex-boyfriend is also named Paddy. She is also a drug dealer on the Chatsworth Estate and is frequently seen doing so on the show. She is extremely violent, easily angered and arguably more intimidating than her husband, Paddy; though as the series progresses she becomes less hotheaded. She has headbutted several characters on the show including [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), Sue Garland ([[Gillian Kearney]]), Cassie Western ([[Moya Brady]]) and even her own son Shane and strike fear into the likes of [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]), Lip, [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), [[#Carol Fisher|Carol Fisher]] ([[Marjorie Yates]]), [[Karen Maguire]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), her own children and even Paddy. Mimi is as hard as nails, and she can hold her own with men and women. At one point during Series 3 a whole riot squad is needed to restrain her after she attempts to free her daughter Mandy from incarceration at the police station. Mimi appeared in 111 episodes overall.\n\nIn series 5 a more sensitive side to Mimi is shown after her ex-boyfriend, Paddy, makes a crass comment about her weight. She describes herself as a \"bulimic who can't stand vomit\". In the same series, she is shown attending [[anger management]] classes. In Series 6, Mimi experiences some regret over her lack of education when son Micky takes film classes. Mimi does most of his coursework for him, and when he decides the class isn't for him, he allows Mimi to take his place.\n\nMimi is presented as a character who behaves in ways which are polar opposites. For example, she has no qualms about selling drugs to children and behaving in a violent manner. However, she also has strong maternal instincts and shows compassion for others. For example, when [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) reacts badly after consuming drugs, she and Paddy care for Chesney by feeding him and ensuring that he sobers up safely. Later, when [[#Yvonne Karib|Yvonne Karib]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]) accuses Mimi of being an intolerant racist, Mimi retorts by describing the racism that Paddy faced when he arrived in England from Ireland. Yvonne and Mimi realize that they share love for their own children and would do anything to ensure their happiness. Also, Mimi is someone upon whom [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]) can depend when she seeks advice or assistance.\n\nThe Maguire family's drug dealing business comes back to haunt them when Mimi's beloved Paddy is abducted and forcibly addicted to heroin by the bereaved mother of one of their deceased customers. To make matters worse, she is arrested for an assault that her son Jamie carried out. However, she freely states that she wants to take the blame for the attack, claiming \"A mam's gotta do what a mam's gotta do\". This is because she does not want to see her ex-con son go to jail again. At the end of series 6, her beloved daughter Mandy is killed by the woman who got Paddy addicted to heroin. The strain of this loss causes Paddy and Mimi to split up.\n\nIn series 7 Mimi lives in The Jockey as landlord and has an affair with a friend of her son Micky named [[#Billy Tutton|Billy Tutton]] (Michael Taylor), until she finds out that he is only fourteen years old, although he looks just as old as Micky. After the boy starts to blackmail Mimi into a secret relationship, Mimi tries to threaten him to keep him away from her, finally giving him a gun filled with blanks and daring him to shoot her. When he pulls the trigger, she pretends to be dead, and he flees Chatsworth, believing he has killed her.\n\nMimi attempts to join a local women's group to find companionship and feel better about herself, but they rebuff her attempts to appear in their risque charity calendar, making her feel fat, unattractive, and worthless. To add insult to injury, they ask Mimi to supply them with some party drugs to help loosen them up before the photo shoot. In revenge, Mimi gives them such potent 'treats' that they begin cavorting around in their underwear, groping each other. Mimi films them and sets up a website to display the shots.\n\nMimi gives birth to a newborn daughter, later named Cilla, at the end of Series 7 after complaining of stomach pains and nausea which scared her into believing she had started menopause. The baby was presumably fathered by estranged husband Paddy. According to the ''Shameless'' website, Mimi will return to living in the Maguire house, with baby daughter Cilla, in Series 8. It is implied that she is unsure who fathered Cilla because of her fling with underage Billy. It is later revealed that Cilla's father is in fact Billy, who returns to Chatsworth to be part of the child's life. At the end of Series 8 the couple marry, despite ongoing controversy and disapproval of much of the family. In Series 9, Mimi forces Billy to have an open relationship because she is worried she is to old for him.

Much to his parents' disgust, he appeared to be reformed, rejected his family, got a job as a barman at \"The Jockey\", began training as a [[probation officer]], and became engaged to his Jockey co-worker, [[Karen Maguire|Karen Jackson]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]). Jamie has a tendency to sleepwalk on occasion. He appeared in 108 episodes in total.\n\nIn the last episode of Series 4, Jamie revealed that he had admitted his guilt in order to get parole so that he could hunt down his father's three former cellmates, who were planning to muscle in on Paddy's territory and dispose of him. His new reformed life was a sham to cover his murders of these three men. Karen assumed that his courtship of her was part of this pretence, but Jamie claimed that he really loved her and they were married at the end of the episode.\n\nDuring Series 5, Jamie does his best to avoid joining the family business. He and Karen take over The Jockey, and things go smoothly until Karen miscarries early in Series 6. She distances herself from him, questioning if she would want to have a child that would grow up in the Maguire family. Eventually, the two separate after Karen refuses put a \"Maguire\" on the pub's license with her. It is during this time that Karen begins sleeping with [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), able to break it off with her increasingly controlling lover only after she threatens to lie to the Maguires and tell them he continued to [[domestic violence|physically abuse]] [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]), Jamie's sister. Jamie moves home with Karen, and she soon finds out she's pregnant again, not sure if the father was Jamie or Joe.\n\nDespite being portrayed as one of the warmer of the Maguire family, Jamie has become somewhat of a dark and aggressive character, possibly due to him taking on the family business while his father was going [[cold turkey]] when recovering from drug addiction. Jamie is shown to go to extreme lengths to get revenge, sending one such message to Joe, after finding out about Karen's affair with him, by digging up his recently deceased father and leaving him slumped outside of the local shop. He also proves that unlike his two brothers, he is a very effective debt collector and head of the family business, having no qualms about threatening or injuring if it brings results.\n\nJamie becomes a father in Series 7, but afterward witnesses the gradual mental breakdown of his wife Karen, unaware that the overwhelming guilt and self-loathing she carries is eating away at her inside. After Karen's release from hospital, they fall behind on household bills, and Jamie is finding it difficult to cope with his wife's mental illness. He meets a woman named Michelle while on a night out, and has sex with her in the ladies toilets. Michelle runs a male escort agency, and leaves her card in Jamie's pocket, along with some money. They meet later when Michelle offers Jamie a job. Despite his obvious disgust at the thought of working as a \"man-whore\", Jamie agrees to the offer. He services Michelle and other women, needing the money as well as some time away from Karen. When Karen begins to suspect an affair, Michelle confesses her love for him, and Paddy uncovers what he's doing and tries to tell him to stop, Jamie finally has enough. Initially Michelle is reluctant to let him go, but when he introduces her to the virile young [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), she changes her mind.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s18/casualty/news/a169160/ex-casualty-actress-joins-shameless.html|title=Casualty actress and Maguire son|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=4 August 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Karen has continued her destructive affair with Joe, who seemed to have no concerns about her illness or her erratic behavior. Eventually, Joe announces to Jamie that he's having an affair with his wife, and claims that he is baby Connor's father. As his marriage implodes, Jamie is also trying to deal with a threat to both the family and their business, since his father has left Chatsworth for Ireland.\n\nAs series 8 begins, Jamie is in counseling with Karen who has returned with their son. He beats up a cab driver, erroneously believing the man is Joe, and Karen finally admits Joe is dead, although she does not tell him he was murdered while attempting to kill her. She and Connor move back with Jamie into The Jockey as they attempt to make their marriage work. In the meantime, Jamie tricks his brother, [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]), into willingly giving up his attempt to run the family business. When Shane finally realizes Jamie manipulated him into giving up leading the family business and killing a loan shark, he tells his wife, [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly]] ([[Sally Carman]]), that Jamie was born for this, \"Scammin', schemin' and killin'.\" Then Jamie finally accepts Karen back into their marital bed, telling her that he \"could tape his stiffy to his belly\" after watching her all day. In series 8, Jamie is shown to be scared of clowns since he saw one of them choke to death when he was young. This led to his discomfort with Karen's new business as a party clown, which lasted only until a customer attempted to molest her. Luckily, one of the guns Jamie was selling ended up in her bag, and she was able to shoot the customer and get away, leading to Jamie taking the gun back and soothing her in a hot shower.\n\nAfter losing to Karen in a card game, he agrees to put the pub back in her name, and the couple are seen looking up at the new sign, showing \"Jamie and Karen Maguire\" as the proprietors of the Jockey.\n\nIn Series 9, Jamie acts a spokesman for the estate when the majority of the people who live there are evicted. He later cheats on Karen with [[#Gloria Meak|Gloria Meak]] ([[Angeline Ball]]). He and a few others become trapped underground after a family job goes wrong; they are eventually saved and it is unclear if his and Gloria's affair will continue.\n\n===Shane Maguire===\n{{main|Shane Maguire}}\n*'''Played by:''' [[Nicky Evans]] (Series 3, 4\u201311)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Shane Maguire\n| series         = [[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]\n| portrayer      = [[Nicky Evans]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

Shane, overall, appeared in 114 episodes.\n\nShane is known for his short and unpredictable temper and limited intelligence, although he was once shown to possess great instincts for shopper's habits during Series 5 when he briefly worked in [[#Yvonne Karib|Yvonne Karib]]'s ([[Kelli Hollis]]) off-licence shop. Judging by certain scenes from the fourth to sixth series, the other Maguire boys, except for Jamie, seemed to be taking direction from Shane, in the absence of Paddy and Mimi, which might imply that Shane is the second oldest of the Maguire children. In Series 6 Shane suffers a [[head injury]] whilst running a hotel scam with his lover, [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Ball]] ([[Sally Carman]]). After coming out of a [[coma]], Shane is left partially paralysed and bed-ridden. Conflict arises between Kelly and Shane's overpowering mother, Mimi, over who will oversee his convalescence. However, with physiotherapy and speech therapy, his condition begins to improve.\n\nAfter a running a series of wedding scams together, Shane asks Kelly to marry him, but she was hesitant to do so. After they fall out during a party at The Jockey, he tries to make amends. But discovers that weeks earlier, Kelly had sex with his father, Paddy. A heartbroken Shane later asks his father why he betrayed him. Paddy reveals that he felt shamed by his sons for abandoning him during that night, and in a moment of self-pity, paid Kelly for sex to \"hurt\" his son, but he now deeply regrets it. Shane demands that his father proves how sorry he is, and produces a syringe and a bag of heroin. As Paddy is about to inject himself, Shane stops him just in time. Satisfied with his father's remorse, he quietly leaves Paddy, who breaks down in tears. He is now married to Kelly. They had their impromptu civil ceremony at The Jockey.\n\nWhile giving a deposit to a sperm bank, Shane learned that he was sterile. Shane was upset at the thought of never having children. His father and brothers tried to help by offering to be sperm donors for Kelly, but she refused. [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) suggested Kelly and Shane raise Shane's niece Katie, but this plan was dashed when her father [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]) decided to take her. Shane was left to look on Liam as a son.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tv.com/shameless-uk/season-7--episode-10/episode/1336462/summary.html|title=No kids leaves Shane heartbroken|last=Abbott|first=Paul|date=30 March 2010|work=[[TV.com]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) were framed for murder by a local drug-dealer called Jimmy, the Maguires initially decide to remain aloof from the situation, as it was \"not their fight\". But Jimmy's increasing cockiness revealed in Shane a sense of justice, when he began to openly speak against Jimmy's aggressive antics before taking overt action. When Jimmy tried to set the Gallagher home on fire, Shane stepped in, as he knew Jimmy was afraid to cross the Maguires. The last straw for Shane was when Jimmy promised to harm the family, including Liam. When Paddy elected to remain uninvolved, Shane and Jamie decided to take the law into their own hands despite their father's wishes, and rounded up members of Jimmy's gang, and brutally interrogated them as to Jimmy's whereabouts. Paddy later showed his face, and endorsed his son's proactiveness. Shane and Kelly have also developed a parental bond with Liam to the point where Liam even calls them mum and dad (albeit in jest) as they put him to bed.\n\nIn Series 8 Shane attempts to take over the Maguire's business while Mimi is in hospital after suffering a heart attack. Jamie however feels that Shane is not up to the responsibility, and when he sees that Shane has been conned out of a drug deal, Jamie takes control by making Shane believe a gangster tried to have him killed. Jamie then encourages to shoot the gangster dead, not knowing that it was in fact Jamie who arranged for Shane to be left for dead until afterwards. A feud builds between the two throughout the first half of series 8.\n\n===Micky Maguire===\n{{main|Mickey Maguire (Shameless)}}\n*'''Played by:''' [[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]] (Series 4\u20139)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Micky Maguire\n| series         = [[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]\n| portrayer      = [[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

He is erratic and obsessively licks the side of his mouth, which could be a [[tic]] and/or hint of a behavioral disorder. Despite his aggressive, exaggerated personality, he is mentally weak and often runs away at the first sign of trouble. Although his father [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy Maguire]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) often shows him disrespect and is violent towards him, Paddy still loves his son. Micky is the most idealistic of his family, and the most loyal to his parents. In spite of Paddy's lack of faith in him, Micky was the one who tracked down Paddy after he was shot and left for dead. Micky appeared in 84 episodes in total.\n\nWhen Micky initiates a brief and casual affair with [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) and falls in love with him, Micky exhibits the fact that he is an eager suitor when he follows Ian around and is very emotionally demanding. Unlike Ian, none of Micky's family are aware of his homosexuality, despite several occasions when Micky has come close to [[coming out]] to them, or has daydreams about revealing his homosexuality to his family. In his early appearances, Micky has a dog, Nelson, whom he has been close to for years. Ian is disgusted to learn just how close they had become at one time, and declines to continue a relationship with Micky. By this time Micky is in love with him and wants everyone to know. When Micky is about to tell his family, Ian bursts into the room and tells them about what had happened with Micky and Nelson. Paddy immediately has Nelson put down, deeply upsetting Micky.\n\nThe early episodes of the sixth series show Micky attending college to study film. When he reveals to his parents that he wants to pursue further education, Paddy and [[#Mimi Maguire|Mimi]] ([[Tina Malone]]) ridicule him. Later on in the series, Mimi accepts the fact that Micky is going to college and supports her son in his educational endeavours. Unfortunately, Micky struggles with the course and is distracted by an erotic story his professor accidentally slips in with his coursework. Micky decides that his true talents are in [[erotic literature|erotic writing]] and gives up his place in the class for his mother, Mimi, who loves film and has always wanted to go to college.\n\nIn the Series 7, Micky continues to build a friendship with Ian, with whom he shares a house. This series has proved that Micky has a sensitive side, as explained through his dialogue with Ian when Ian became involved with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]). Micky tried to warn Ian that Maxine fancied him, not realising that Ian felt the same way about Maxine. Ian had sex with Micky to get Maxine off his mind, but this didn't help, and he and Maxine had sex, which Micky witnessed. Micky was devastated when Ian insisted he cared for Maxine and wanted to be with her. Micky told Ian that he'd felt like a freak before he'd had Ian to look up to, and now Ian had taken that away. Relations between Micky and the new couple remained strained, but eventually Micky decided to stop letting the relationship bother him. He told Maxine that all he wanted was that when she finally realises she cannot be happy with a gay man, that she let Ian down gently.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tv.com/shameless-uk/season-7--episode-14/episode/1340428/summary.html|title=Mickey feels very lonely without Ian|last=Abbott|first=Paul|date=27 April 2010|work=[[TV.com]]}}</ref> Mickey leaves the show during Series 9 after helping a young lady give birth to a baby.

Mandy is the daughter of [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) and [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]), the most feared of the local criminals. She is generally more law-abiding than the rest of her family, but is fiercely loyal to them and can often have a violent and abusive streak.

However her father Paddy continues to supply her with financial support. She begins an open, long-term relationship with Lip while he is away at university, but finishes with him in series 5 after Lip's secret university girlfriend shows her face, she spends the whole series being rejected by every man she's attracted to until she goes on a blind date with a young man named Dex whom she gives him an E and sleeps with him, until she realizes she might have killed him so she and [[Karen Maguire]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]) try to dispose of the body, and spend the episode horrified with their actions, until Mandy decides to turn herself in without telling them who supplied her the drugs and who assisted her to dispose the body, she then learns Dex wasn't really dead but just passed out from the drugs, Mandy decides to come clean to him only for him to reject her.\n\nIn Series 6, Mandy has recently fallen for [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), an accountant and the captain of a local football team. Mandy's brother, Jamie, even struck up a friendship with Joe, until he discovered that Mandy had been [[domestic violence|physically abused]] by him, which led to Jamie savagely assaulting Joe, and sending him into a temporary coma. Despite suffering at Joe's hands, Mandy still retains feelings for him, and resented Jamie's intervention, Danny (Ian's new roommate) gives her a word of advice after he tells her he loves her, which makes her reconsider and then [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]) brings up Katie eventually finding out which makes her decide to break it off with him only for Joe to blackmail her into staying with him, Joe's recovery, Mandy has decided to give him another chance, much to the chagrin of the rest of the Maguires, only for them to make supplemental threats to him, Jamie (cutting his head off), Paddy (shooting him), Shane and Micky (pissing on grapes), [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly]] ([[Sally Carman]]) (injecting him) and Karen (threatening to tell them that he abusing Mandy (when he isn't), if Joe threatens to tell Jamie of their affair).\n\nIn the final episode of Series 6, Mandy was kidnapped by Maureen, an emotionally unstable woman who lost her daughter to heroin and blames Paddy for her death.

As Maureen disappeared to put the kettle on, Mandy followed to see what she was doing, and to her horror, found a broken gas pipe which Maureen had sabotaged. Maureen then returned to the kitchen with matches. Mandy desperately began fighting to get the matches from Maureen just as Paddy and Mickey turned up outside to save her, however they could not gain access into the house. Inside the house, Mandy had fought her way into the hallway and ran towards the door. Just as Micky pressed the doorbell, creating a spark, Maureen lit a match. The gas then ignited, causing the house to explode, killing both Maureen and Mandy and throwing Micky across the street. The episode then cut to Kelly, reading a book to little Katie whilst trying to hold back the tears. Meanwhile, at The Jockey, Mandy's funeral reception was taking place. Micky, who survived the explosion, admitted that he felt responsible for Mandy's death, Karen also felt guilt as she kicked her out of her home, hours before her death and slept with Joe.

She is initially believed to be the daughter of Lip's half-brother [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), who is secretly gay and Mandy pretended to be his girlfriend while having a sexual relationship with Lip.\n\nKatie is born after a heavily pregnant Mandy is knocked over during a robbery at the local shop. Mandy's protective parents, [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) and [[Mimi Maguire|Mimi]] ([[Tina Malone]]), forbid the Gallaghers from having anything to do with Katie, with the Maguires intent on raising the baby. However, Mandy decides to begin a serious relationship with Lip in order for Katie to have both her parents in her life, so she moves in with the Gallaghers, to the disappointment of Paddy and Mimi. Mandy later reveals that she named Katie after Mimi, with her first name actually being Katherine. Lip eventually moves to Nottingham in order to go to university, leaving Mandy and Katie with the other Gallaghers. After Lip's father, [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]), leaves ecstasy pills lying around, Mandy is terrified that Katie has swallowed some, however this turns out to be a false alarm.\n\nIn Series 6, Mandy later begins a relationship with [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), who begins to [[Domestic violence|mentally abuse Mandy before starting to beat her]]. When this is revealed, Mandy's older brother [[Jamie Maguire]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]) brutally attacks Joe, with Mimi confessing to the attack in order for Jamie to remain out of prison. Frank and Jamie's wife, [[Karen Maguire|Karen]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), desperately try and make Mandy see that what Joe is doing is wrong, with Mandy agreeing to end the relationship for Katie's sake. Unbeknownst to Mandy, but Karen has begun an affair with Joe. After Paddy is kidnapped and forced to take heroin by a woman named Maureen, she is still intent on revenge for Paddy getting her daughter hooked on drugs which eventually led to her death. Maureen contacts Mandy to come over to her house, where Mandy realizes who Maureen is and a physical scuffle ensues. Maureen then causes an explosion just as Paddy and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Mickey Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) arrive, instantly killing Mandy and Maureen. Katie is seen attending Mandy's funeral in Paddy and Mimi's care.\n\nIn Series 7, Mimi decides to take Katie to Nottingham so that Lip can look after her and help her through the grief of losing Mandy at such a young age. \nKatie is not seen or mentioned again until the eleventh and final series, where Frank is seen pulling faces at a young girl on the bus. The girl then leaves the bus and straight into the arms of Lip, revealing that she was Katie. Katie, now 9 years old, is excited to see Frank, after being informed by Lip that he had been captured by the [[Taliban]]. She instantly gets on well with her aunt, [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella Gallagher]] (Nikita Brownlee), who is three years her junior. Due to lacking a mother figure in her life since Mandy's death, Katie dresses like a boy and always has her hair tied back, which confuses Mimi, who attempts to persuade Katie to wear dresses. Lip and Frank both tell Katie that she does not need to do anything that makes her feel uncomfortable, so she stops wearing dresses. Katie flees when Lip is beaten up in an alleyway, and shortly after this, Lip and Katie leave Chatsworth again to continue their lives as before.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Donny Maguire===\n*'''Played by:''' [[Warren Brown (actor)|Warren Brown]] (Series 1\u20132)/Steve Bell (Series 3)/Clyve Bonelle (Series 3)\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Donny Maguire\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = Warren Brown (Series 1\u20132)<br>Steve Bell (Series 3)<br>Clyve Bonelle (Series 3)\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

He is portrayed as being more thuggish than the rest of his brothers, quite often seen using violence against other people, including electrocution, attempted murder and hands on combat. He appeared in the show on a recurring basis throughout the first three series, whenever his family had problems to deal with on the Chatsworth Estate. He is first seen chasing [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) after being told that he has assaulted his sister [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]). Mandy later admits to lying, and Donny stops harassing Ian. He is next seen when he is ordered to collect Ian for his parents as he has \"impregnated\" Mandy. He attends their engagement party at The Jockey, where he gets into a fight with [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]), [[#Marty Fisher|Marty Fisher]] ([[Jack Deam]]) and other locals. In series 3, he assists Paddy in tracking down and torturing a deaf teenage boy suspected of robbing the shop, which led to Mandy getting hurt. He later kicks him off a multi-story car park when he uses a paint can to insult the Maguire boys. He is last seen hunting down [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) after Mimi and his brother [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]) think Carl has grassed them up to the police. When his family moved to Chatsworth, Donny was not present and has not been seen since, with no explanation to his whereabouts.

In his only appearance on the show, he bundles [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) into a car and attends Ian and his sister [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]]'s ([[Samantha Siddall]]) engagement party, where he is involved in a pub brawl.

Nigel and Delia are her half-brother and sister. She becomes estranged from both parents throughout the series. She is [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]]'s ([[Jody Latham]]) love interest in series 1, soon his father Frank Gallagher moves in with her & her mother, and at first she\u2019s appalled by him and the idea of living with him, to the point she seduces him into sleeping with her, in the hopes Shiela catches him and kicks him out under the assumption that Frank sexually assaulted her underage daughter, however after the fallout between Frank & Lip, and seeing Shiela show genuine concern for Frank can\u2019t bring herself to tell her mother the truth, She then leaves to stay with her grandmother. In Season 2 she returns to Chatsworth, drops out of school to work at the Jockey where she lies about her sexuality to guarantee herself a position and moves out entirely from Shiela\u2019s house to live at The Jockey. She is the only other character aside from Frank to appear in every series. Karen appeared in 129 episodes in total.\n\nKaren becomes considerably more mature in series 4, at the end of which she marries the recently freed [[Jamie Maguire]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]), with whom she co-runs the pub. Season 5 sees her becoming increasingly, albeit grudgingly, more integrated with the Maguire family and their somewhat violent way of life. Karen suffers a [[miscarriage]] early in season 6 and very soon after, her changing behavior and the loss of their child starts creating a large rift in their marriage. As she and Jamie argue over shared ownership of The Jockey and other problems, Karen finds herself drawn to her sister-in-law, [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]]'s ([[Samantha Siddall]]), abusive boyfriend [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), and has sex with him shortly after Jamie moves out. Joe becomes increasingly controlling, threatening to reveal their affair, and makes a failed attempt to buy out Jamie's portion of The Jockey. During this, the Maguires find out Joe has been [[Domestic violence|physically abusing]] Mandy, and Jamie is almost sent back to prison after brutally beating him. When Jamie moves back in with Karen, she is able to end her affair with Joe by threatening him that if she claims to the Maguires that he's once again been beating Mandy, they will murder him. The last episode of series 6 reveals Karen to be once again pregnant; however she is unsure whether the father is Jamie or Joe, who laughs and tells her \"You belong to me now.\"\n\nIn the first episode of series 7, Karen is two weeks overdue in her pregnancy, and can't wait to have the birth over and done with. When [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]) tells her that sex several times a day could make her waters break quicker, Karen tells that \"they've\" been \"at it\" all the time, and flashbacks show that she's been having sex with both Jamie and Joe, implying that her brief affair with Joe from series 6 has continued, despite Karen's often cold attitude towards him. In the same episode, Karen goes into labour after having a brief confrontation with Joe in the empty bar of The Jockey (Everybody else were celebrating at Frank's birthday party). After taunting her, Joe decided to help a scared Karen deliver what could be his son, who would be christened Connor Joseph Maguire. Despite playing happy families with \"proud dad\" Jamie, Joe tells that she's kidding herself into thinking that she wants Jamie, when she really only wants Joe, branding Jamie \"boring\". Karen would then engage in risky sex in the Maguires' living room with Joe, nearly being caught out by [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy Maguire]] ([[Sean Gilder]]). Afterwards, Joe would declare that he loves her and they should be a family. Along with Karen's out of control behavior with Joe, she starts to act strange and starts losing Connor on a regular basis. For example, she hides her baby in a dresser drawer. On the third episode of the 7th series Karen starts to act in a strange manner by becoming obsessed with exercising and thinking that she can start her own fitness business, bouncing on a trampoline outside, going out late at night to buy groceries and putting baby Connor in a wardrobe. Karen's erratic behaviour deteriorates further as she starts ripping wall paper off the walls and playing music at high volume, even attempting suicide by falling from a window at one point. She is saved from her suicide attempt by a quick-thinking Paddy, who shows his sensitive side when he expresses deep care and sympathy for her. Finally Karen has to be restrained by medics and is placed in a psychiatric unit. Karen is diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. When she returns home, she struggles to repair her marriage to Jamie, who is unable to have sex with her because the image of Karen during her breakdown is deeply ingrained in his mind. Jamie, unknown to Karen, begins having sex with other women for money, and to get away from her. Jamie does not derive any pleasure from having sex with other women and is motivated by the financial gain. Eventually he stops prostituting himself when Paddy discovers what Jamie has been up to and tries to be happy with Karen.\n\nAs much as Karen is repulsed by the sordid nature of her affair with Joe, she is also drawn to it, and is disappointed when Joe briefly stops seeing her. When he begins going to anger management meetings, Karen repeatedly tries to taunt him, throwing cereal around his shop and offering to resume their fling, but he refuses. Karen, pretending to be Joe's wife, drops into one of his meetings and listens to him as he talks about his attempts to control himself and how much he cares about her and their son.\n\nThe uneasy distance between Joe and Karen continues until Joe's father dies. Joe wants to start a new life with Karen and Connor and pushes Karen repeatedly to take Connor and leave Jamie. She also stops taking her medication, with her more erratic personality being closer to Joe than to Jamie. Joe eventually takes matters into his own hands, telling Jamie that he's sleeping with his wife, and he wants her and \"their\" son. Feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what she wants, she leaves with Joe, warning him that Jamie will kill them. In retaliation, Jamie digs up Joe's dead father, and confronts them outside the store, telling Karen it is her last chance to come home with him, and leaving the body at the side of the building. She stays with Joe, but soon begins to question her choice as she starts taking her bipolar meds again. After some close scrapes, Joe and Karen manage to sneak Connor away from Jamie, and Joe announces they're leaving the Chatsworth estate, although Karen is becoming increasingly unsettled at both the idea of a future with Joe and the feeling that Joe's decided what will happen without giving her a choice. She confides her worries to Ian Gallagher, who sneaks into the trunk of the car right before they leave the estate, worried for Karen and Connor. As Karen's doubts rattle Joe, she is subjected to verbal and finally physical abuse. When Karen attempts to call Jamie, telling Joe this was all a mistake and she had to go home and fix things, Joe begins strangling her. Ian gets out of the trunk, and repeatedly hits Joe in the back of the head while in an act of [[self defense]] until he releases her and falls to the ground. Telling Karen to take Connor back and do whatever it takes to make it work with Jamie, he drags Joe's body to the trunk and then drives the car away.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s18/casualty/news/a169160/ex-casualty-actress-joins-shameless.html|title=Change to Shameless Finale|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=14 May 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>\n\nIn Series 8 Karen returns to speak to Jamie, and they begin going to marital counseling, during which Karen admits that she made a mistake, and tells Jamie that Joe is dead, although not how he died. After several rough sessions in which he makes it clear that he finds it difficult to forgive her, Jamie tells her that he wants her and Connor back home, and that they will have to see if it can work out. At the beginning of her voiceover for episode four, he lets her out of the cab, and she walks through the Chatsworth estate, with jeers of \"slag\" and \"slapper\" being yelled by others, and egg thrown at her. She meets back up with Jamie at the Jockey, where he gives everyone 30 seconds for people to say whatever they like to her, before they accept that she's his wife and he won't allow it to continue. He then headbutts one man who passed the allotted time before walking out of the room, leaving Karen standing alone. Still feeling like an outcast and wanting badly to make her marriage work again, it's only after she runs into Frank at the hospital that she realizes she's tired of being judged for her past mistakes.\n\nJamie used his power of attorney while Karen was ill to put The Jockey solely in his name, and at first he is very cold towards her after her return, ignoring her suggestions and making it clear that the pub was no longer hers, but his and run with Mimi, leaving Karen feeling very left out. She explains to him that she knows she has to earn his trust back, and just wants him to give her a chance. After Jamie is overwhelmed by the chaos of trying to organize [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]]'s ([[Pauline McLynn]]) wedding party, he asks Karen to help them, finally acknowledging that he does need her, and does appreciate her. Later, he takes her back into their bed and things begin to return to normal for the couple.\n\nKaren briefly tries to run a clown business before several male customers attempt to assault her, during which she shoots one in the thigh with one of the Maguire's stolen guns. In a later episode, we see her standing in front of The Jockey, scowling up at the \"Jamie Maguire, proprietor\" sign. After winning a card game from Jamie, she demands that he return the pub to her. The couple is then later seen standing in front of the pub looking at two signs, one of which says \"under new management,\" and the other saying \"Jamie and Karen Maguire, proprietors.\"\n\nIn series 9 Karen has returned to her former, stable self. She invites half the estate to stay with her when they're evicted, and also gets into a fight with [[#Gloria Meak|Gloria Meak]] ([[Angeline Ball]]), which is quickly settled. Karen is unaware for some time that Jamie has begun an affair with Gloria, a fact that is hidden from her even when Jamie is trapped with others underground, although Gloria's brother [[#Dominic Meak|Dominic]] ([[Stephen Lord]]) does find out at this time. Karen later realizes Jamie is possibly having an affair, and asks for the help of Gloria and others to find out who it is, worried that perhaps it is her condition causing paranoia. At the end of the episode, she sees Jamie and Gloria together, and realizes who he was having an affair with all along.\n\nSeveral episodes later Karen and Connor's lives appear to be in danger, with Jamie receiving threatening phone calls and pictures of his family. Karen is attacked in the park while walking Connor. He attempts to go after enemies while trying to protect his wife and child, and later agrees to a ransom of 200,000 after Karen is kidnapped. After several car changes, he finds Karen as she walks out into the warehouse, revealing to him that she planned the whole thing, and that she knows about his affair. She explains that now she knows he does love her and she loves him, but that the secrets are going to stop. She's keeping the 200,000, and will now control the finances of his business, keeping Jamie in check. At the end of the episode, she tells him that if something happens to her, there is an unknown friend who knows everything about Jamie.\n\n===Kelly Maguire===\n\n*'''Played by:''' [[Sally Carman]] (Series 2, 3, 4, 5\u201311)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Kelly Maguire\n| series         = Shameless\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

Paddy wanted to hurt Shane since he felt Shane had not been there for him. Paddy and Kelly kept their encounter a secret, but during a mass wedding scam, Shane proposed to Kelly. Kelly turned him down several times, even ending their relationship, because she could not marry him while living a lie. Shane told her he would forgive her sleeping with anyone, at which point she and a guilty Paddy made eye contact. Shane was devastated to learn the truth, but forgave Kelly, and they married in a civil ceremony at the Jockey.\n\nShane was deeply upset when he learned he was sterile. Jamie, Paddy and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) offered to be Kelly's sperm donors, but she refused, saying she'd already had Paddy in her once and wasn't going to do that ever again. As they would be unable to adopt a child, [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) convinced them to try to be parents to Shane's niece Katie. This plan was dashed when Katie's father Lip decided to take a more active role in her life. Kelly and Shane decided to give up on their plans and just be honorary parental figures for Liam, whom she has grown quite fond of.\n\nKelly was revealed in the thirteenth episode of series 7 to have a fifteen-year-old half-sister named Tonya, whose care she was briefly responsible for. Kelly and Tonya were both fathered by a man named Homer. It was implied that he abused them both sexually. Tonya had a baby-boy named Enrico, who was in foster-care. Micky, who pretended to be Shane during a visit from a social worker during his brother's absence, found out from Tonya that Enrico was actually born out of incest with her father, who raped her. She begged him not to tell Kelly. After finding out that Homer abused them both, Micky injected tranquilizer into Homer's bloodstream in The Jockey toilets, and dragged him with Shane's help to a slaughter-house to dispose of him, doing his sister-in-law a tremendous favour in the process.\n\nIn Series 8 Kelly falls out of love with Shane and begins seeing [[#Marty Fisher|Marty Fisher]] ([[Jack Deam]]), who later she becomes with pregnant with. Kelly and Shane break up and her and Marty start their lives together. In Series 9 Kelly loses the baby in an accident, leading to a breakdown of constant drinking and drug abuse.

He was a guest character in the first series of ''Shameless'', became a main character in the second series, and left along with Veronica and [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]) in the first episode of the fourth series. Marty was originally something of a burden to the other characters, setting things alight when he got angry, particularly whenever he found Carol with much younger men. At one point he burns Carol's house down when he finds her having sex in the shower with his best friend, as well as burning down the toilets of The Jockey when Veronica attempts to have him sent back to prison after he escaped to attend her wedding; incidents like this have landed him in prison several times. His tourette's syndrome often creates uncomfortable situations for him, causing him to reveal otherwise secret information or offend those who are not used to him by insulting/swearing. However, later in the series [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]) teaches Marty to use other words such as buttermilk and spongecake instead of swearing, and his pyromania seems to calm down when he starts a relationship with Sue Garland ([[Gillian Kearney]]). The two live relatively happily in the Gallagher household for a time, until Marty accompanies Kev and Veronica in a scheme to buy a Romanian baby from an orphanage. Marty escapes back to the Chatsworth with the stolen orphan and suggests to Sue that they raise it as their own. Initially Sue is reluctant but later saves the baby from being sent back by the police. Sue reveals that she is pregnant with Marty's child and the two leave the estate (how they find the money to do this is unclear).\n\nHe returns in Series 8, Episode 17. Marty reveals that him and Sue lived happily for years in Spain with their kids, only for Sue to cheat on him with a rich local and kick him out of the house. Not knowing where else to go, Marty flees back to the Chatsworth and begins squatting in a flat once occupied by heroin addicts, and on the run from the CSA for not paying child maintenance. Presumably, he found his mother Carol (who left to go to Maguluf), as he returns with her urn. Shortly after returning Marty causes tension between [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]) and [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Maguire]] ([[Sally Carman]]) by telling Kelly that he loves her.\n\nIn series 9, him and Kelly hit a rough patch when she loses the baby, she leaves him, but returns on discovering he truly loves her.

However, Chesney was using the campaign funds to help an elderly Pakistani woman to take her British Citizenship Test, thus earning Debbie's respect (despite thinking his reasoning for doing so was silly but still admires that he helped someone and didn't ask for anything in return).

Kash then attends the shop in order to speak with his son. In a moment of rage, Chesney knocks his father out cold, and seemed to be prepared to bludgeon him with a baseball bat when the fireworks that were stacked up in the shop's stockroom were ignited, due to the spreading flames of Chesney's insufficiently stamped out cigarette. Chesney flees the store, leaving his unconscious father to die for real from smoke inhalation, a crime for which Chesney should have been arrested and sent to prison.

The act was filmed and spread via photographs over a mobile phone. Chesney and [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) were witnesses to the assault.

Maxine has also become a good friend of [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]]'s ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), while simultaneously having a minor fling with Carl. She works as an auxiliary nurse, and frequently accompanies Debbie on nights out and shopping trips, or more accurately, they steal clothes, and often come up with creative tactics of eluding the centre's security staff. Later in the series, she becomes ever more infatuated with Carl. Maxine and Carl become a couple.\n\nIn series 7, Maxine, increasingly disillusioned by Carl's immaturity, secretly aborts her and Carl's unborn baby, but she would later tell Carl, which infuriates him enough to make him end their relationship. She moves in with [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) after her breakup with Carl. She later takes Ian to a party at her parents house under the pretence that Ian is her doctor boyfriend. She tells Ian that her family sees her as a \"fuck-up.\" After witnessing the disparaging remarks from Maxine's father about his daughter, Ian defends her. This leads to an unexpected romance between Ian and Maxine, which in turn leads to a fight and a strained relationship between Ian and Carl as well as Maxine and Carl, Maxine and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]).\n\nA local tough named Jimmy kills a boy who took advantage of his sister, and he frames Carl and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) for the crime, forcing them to flee Chatsworth. Maxine is one of the few people who is concerned about Carl's disappearance. Ian tries to convince her not to get involved, but she persists, and when she confronts Jimmy, his sister hits her in the back of the head with a pool cue. Ian feels ashamed that he did nothing to help her, and he confronts Jimmy in an attempt to tape a confession. Jimmy savagely beats him. Ian's sense of worthlessness leads him to withdraw from everyone and makes him unable to perform with Maxine. As she continues to help clear Carl's name, Ian bitterly accuses her of caring more about Carl than she does him. Maxine helps convince Jimmy's sister to go to the police, but there is little time for celebration as Ian continues to give her as well as Carl the cold shoulder. Maxine tells him that she's leaving him, but not because of Carl. Carl finds Maxine at hospital and admits to her that she was right to abort their child. When she tries to tell him she's steering clear of the Gallagher brothers because of the damage she's done to their relationship, Carl tries to get her to reconsider, telling her he's her mate, but Ian is her soulmate. Ian arrives and he and Maxine share sheepish grins, resuming their relationship.\n\nMaxine's brother [[#Bruce Donnelly|Bruce]] ([[Philip Hill-Pearson]]) shows up in Chatsworth, sporting a black eye and saying their mother has left and that their father, [[#Cameron Donnelly|Cameron]] ([[Joe Duttine]]), hit him and threw him out of the house for being gay. Maxine agrees to let him move in, and goes to confront their father. He tells her that he threw Bruce out for spending all his time smoking dope, and he's stunned to learn Bruce is gay. When Cameron visits Maxine soon afterwards he rubs makeup off Bruce's eye to prove he never hit him. Bruce admits he lied but says Maxine did the same, revealing that Ian was never a doctor, as Maxine had told everyone in the family. Maxine throws Bruce out. In an attempt to try to get closer to her father, she cooks him some dinner and cleans up his home. She tells him that she's always felt like he undermined her and that she'd always been told she had no confidence\u2014even today she had lost a job as head cleaner at the hospital because of lack of confidence. When he shows her little sympathy, she leaves.\n\nMaxine's insecurities about Ian's feelings for men bubble up when he begins going to gay clubs with Bruce and playing against gay football leagues. Maxine begins posing nude for an art class, and recognises the professor as a teacher she had a crush on when she was a teenager. He confesses he also had feelings for her. At first, she appears to be uncomfortable with the realisation that this man found her attractive when she was sixteen years old. She eventually invites him to her home and they get drunk and take cocaine. As they are undressing, Maxine backs out. Unfortunately, the professor has a heart attack and she has to call an ambulance. Maxine desperately tries to explain to Ian. The relationship begins to fall apart, accelerated when Ian holds hostage a man who tried to rob and rape Maxine. When Ian attempts to kill this man with the gun he used to threaten Maxine, she tries to stop him from taking matters further. Maxine notices Ian's attraction to his hostage when the hostage states: You would rather fuck me than kill me.' Maxine catches Ian admitting to the man that he finds him attractive, and she tells Ian that she will never be able to get over his being attracted to other men. Ian leaves Chatsworth.\n\nMaxine did not return for Series 8, with no mention given to her whereabouts. Since the end of Series 7, neither her or her brother Bruce have been seen or mentioned since.

Joe would use this incident to blackmail Karen, who was the first to suspect that Mandy was being [[domestic violence|repeatedly assaulted]] by him, revealing him as a sadistic [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]]. Eventually, Jamie found out about the bruises on Mandy's body, and confronted Joe at The Jockey, and beat him within an inch of his life. Sending Joe into a temporary coma.

In spite of Joe seeing his father as a selfish failure, his death is a system shock, and Joe begins trying to reclaim Karen and Connor, whom he continues to see as their son. Joe and Karen resume their affair, but Karen is afraid to tell Jamie the truth. After his father's funeral, Joe finally tells Jamie the entire truth. Joe and Karen hide out at his shop. Joe sees Jamie waiting outside, and expects a fight, only to be devastated when Jamie shows him his father's corpse, dug up and dumped outside Joe's shop. On seeing the corpse, Joe vomits and Karen screams and falls over. Joe buries his father again, and becomes more determined to take Connor from the Maguires. Joe later implies that he had Paddy killed after Karen expressed concerns over Paddy taking revenge on them. After running away with Karen with baby Connor, and Ian hiding in the boot unknowingly to Joe, Karen tells Joe that she doesn't love him. He goes into a rage, and strangles Karen while demanding her to tell him that she loves him. She is struggling for breath, and [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) can hear the action outside.

Since the series started, the [[#Gallagher family|Gallagher family]] has split hugely, with many of the Gallagher children departing the show, due to the actors' moving onto other projects.\n\n==Credited cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Key'''\n|-\n| style=\"background: #dfd\"| Series regular || style=\"background: #fdd\" | Series guest || style=\"background: #ececec\" | No appearances\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:15px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000;\" colspan=\"12\"|\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 1 (2004)|1]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 2 (2005)|2]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 3 (2006)|3]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 4 (2007)|4]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 5 (2008)|5]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 6 (2009)|6]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 7 (2010)|7]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 8 (2011)|8]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 9 (2012)|9]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 10 (2012)|10]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[List of Shameless (British TV series) episodes#Series 11 (2013)|11]]\n|-\n!

He appeared in 136 episodes in total.\n\nFrank's hallmarks are drunken rants on a wide variety of literary, historical and philosophical subjects, usually returning to how decent, hard-working people, among whom he erroneously seems to count himself, are discriminated against. Frank frequently quotes [[Shakespeare]], the [[Bible]], references international current events and uses poetry and soliloquy to express his feelings or view, as he does at the start of each episode. Thus, in spite of his drunken ramblings, sometimes he does come across as being well-educated owing to the issues he raises during his interactions with others.\n\nFrank is an unemployed alcoholic, and the son of [[#Neville Gallagher|Neville]] ([[John Woodvine]]) and Sarah Elizabeth Gallagher (1935\u20131972). He was married to [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]), with whom he has six children: [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee), and one, [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), to whom he is [[de jure]] father. He also has two children with [[#Sheila Gallagher|Sheila Jackson]] ([[Maggie O'Neill]]), Nigel and Delia, and is the father of Monica's half-sister, whom he fathered with Monica's mother at Monica's birthday party. He has two grandchildren, Lip's daughter, Katie Maguire, and an unnamed child of Fiona's. During one of Frank's drunken rants, it is implied that he got many girls pregnant in school. Although this is never elaborated upon, it is unclear precisely how many children Frank has actually fathered.\n\nFrank was apparently convicted and sentenced to imprisonment several times in his youth. He claimed to have been incarcerated in [[Strangeways]] Prison. It has not been mentioned what exactly were the reasons for his string of past convictions.\n\nFrank's alcoholism intensified after his first wife Monica left him for [[#Norma Starkey|Norma Starkey]] ([[Dystin Johnson]]). He then left the younger children in the care of Fiona, and moved in with agoraphobic Sheila. Often known to make a fool out of himself and shirk all responsibility, Frank nonetheless shows signs of loving his children. He can offer good advice, for example saving Liam from being taken into care when a parent was needed. When he is rendered completely sober by a new drug, Frank appears reflective and even quite intelligent, wondering why Sheila would add to her problems by marrying a mess like him. We also understand his character a bit better when Frank's father pays a visit and treats his son in a condescending and abrasive manner. Frank's father shows extreme sympathy towards Sheila and even takes care of the twins. It is also stated that his father did not always treat Frank kindly when Frank was growing up.\n\nIn early series Frank comes across as a drunken bully, even headbutting his son Ian on one occasion. Most of his children initially hate Frank for his drunken bullying ways. Lip and Ian are never scared to show their feelings towards him, and even physically attack him on a few occasions. However, his middle daughter Debbie shows sympathy throughout the series when her father is either in serious trouble or presumed dead, something which has happened three times to date. The family have generally warmed towards him more as the series has progressed, mostly because he isn't bothering them hugely on a daily basis. However, Debbie finally grew sick of taking care of the family, and cleaning up after Frank in particular, and left to join the army after series 6. Frank and Liam came into serious conflict in series 7, when Liam was forced by circumstances to take over Debbie's former burden as the de facto head of the family. At one point, Frank headbutted Liam, and a furious Carl had to be restrained from beating Frank to a pulp. Frank finally softened towards Liam when Liam threatened to commit suicide.\n\nIn series 7, Frank falls for a librarian named [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]). Libby believes Frank is a man of the arts and he encourages her to rise up against her library closing, which leads to a violent protest and her imprisonment. When Libby is released from prison, she tries to find him, but her upscale appearance causes various characters to warn Frank that the [[Department of Social Security|DSS]] is after him. Finally, they meet again, and although Libby is initially put off by his poor character and the frosty reception from Liam, she and her mother move into the Gallagher home. Frank and her mother soon set up a mutual loathing society, with Frank painting her bedroom a bright yellow just to keep her awake. However, he must also endure the endless put-downs from Libby's wheelchair-bound mother, [[#Patty Croker|Patty]] ([[Valerie Lilley]]). In Series 8 Frank is kept hostage in a psychiatric hospital by former wife Monica's girlfriend, part of Monica's plan to snatch her family back from Libby and prevent the pair from getting married. On Frank's escape, the pair stay unmarried and he eventually loses Libby in Episode 13 after cheating on her with [[#Letitia Powell|Letitia Powell]]'s (Kira Martin) headmistress ([[Annie Wallace]]).\n\nIn series 8, Frank is ready to get married to Libby and he goes missing on his stag night. Libby starts putting up posters because of his disappearance. Carl and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) find a video on the internet; it is Frank having sex in public. Libby walks in and sees the video. In the feature length 100th episode Frank is accused of beating an old lady who is well known on the estate for her scratch-card winnings. Frank suffers a blackout and throughout the episode has flashbacks of that evening. Not knowing if he actually carried out the attack he hands himself into the police. Carl is convinced Frank is innocent. He digs into the events of that night and finds that a local gangster's brother had actually carried out the attack. Frank, along with Kev devise a plan to work with the police and cut a deal with the gangster that sees Frank set free.\n\nFrom Series 9, Frank is the only original member of the Gallagher family left after Carl leaves to join the police. He now wears a darker version of his fond parka and occasionally slips on a pair of glasses when reading.\n\nBy Series 11, he and his daughter Stella who is now 6 years old, live at the Gallagher House along with Aidan who both are left to contend with Frank's outrageous behaviour. He is still neglectful to his sole child who shows great maturity for her age, and is shown to be thoughtful and caring to him still calling him \"Dad\". While out Frank finds his son [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), and invites him along with his granddaughter, [[#Katie Maguire|Katie]] (Bethany Thompson). He reaches an understanding with his son who treats him much better. Frank has begun a three-way relationship with prostitutes Sherilee (Sarah Totty) and Derilee (Sue Vincent), Derilee's husband Baxter arrives at the Gallagher household and holds Frank, Stella and Derilee hostage at gunpoint. While negotiating with Baxter their freedom, Monica returns to Chatsworth to take Stella's place in the hostage situation. However, Stella ends up running back inside, with Monica also being held captive. While Derilee and Baxter solve their differences, Frank and Monica have sex, resulting in Monica falling pregnant with twins. Frank was arrested and visited by her and tells her to have an abortion, however one of the twins survives, and she gives birth to [[#Ben Gallagher|Ben Gallagher]] in The Jockey. Frank shows a lack of interest in the child and leaves care to Stella. Meanwhile, Monica feigns bereavement over the baby she \"miscarried\". Frank's oldest daughter, [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona McBride]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), returns to Chatsworth with Carl and Lip. Frank learns he has a grandson from Fiona who attempts to make Frank and Monica see that their disastrous parenting is only going to damage Stella and Ben. When Fiona decides to take Stella and Ben back to Amsterdam with her, leaving her in the care of her old friend, [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]), however he loses them. Frank has an argument with Monica and decides to leave Chatsworth since he believes he is better off without his family. However, Stella follows Frank to the bus stop with Ben in her arms, as Frank rages at an upset Stella that she was a mistake and that she ruined his life, leading to her sadly walk away alone. A guilty Frank later finds Stella and Ben at a local park, he apologizes for his harsh behavior and confirms that he does love her, much to her joy. He lets Stella play while he finally takes an active role in caring for Ben. Frank soon takes them back to the Gallagher household, walking into Fiona and Monica fighting over the upbringing of the two children. He refuses to let Fiona to take his youngest children. Even though Lip and Carl try to convince Fiona otherwise, Fiona refuses to believe they will change and offer Frank money to leave as he intended. However, he refused to take it as she sees that he couldn't live without his family and is pleased to see this side. In the end, Fiona sees Stella and Ben will be fine in Frank and Monica's care, and they remain in Chatsworth.

She is [[bisexual]] and left Frank for a lorry driver named [[#Norma Starkey|Norma Starkey]] ([[Dystin Johnson]]). She came home at the end of series 1 but had left by the start of series 2, she then returned for good at the beginning of series 4 and resumed co-habiting with Frank. Although her intentions for this were unknown at first, a visit from her mother in series 5 explained her backstory and a possible reason of why she returned to be with her children. Monica announced at the beginning of series 5 that she was pregnant again, giving birth to Stella at the end of the series. She has two known grandchildren, an unnamed child from Fiona when she left in Series 2, and Lip's daughter, Katie Maguire. Monica appeared in 40 episodes overall.\n\nWhen she returned home in series 1 and series 3, her children, apart from Carl, treated her with nothing but suspicion and hostility for leaving them with Frank. Fiona (in series 1) and Debbie (in series 4\u20136) were especially hostile since they were the ones who were forced to take on the household duties. Even when Monica returned for an extended stay, Debbie was still the one to look after Liam and to an extent, her older brothers. Although Monica wanted to be a good mother, and was shown doing some household chores, laziness and selfishness prevented her from being any real help.\n\nIn series 6, feeling unloved by her children and Frank, Monica left once again. However, Monica returned in series 8,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/tv/previews/v/10241-shameless-recommissioned-for-series-8-in-2011.html|title=CultBox \u2013 British TV drama and comedy \u2013 News, reviews and interviews...|work=CultBox}}</ref> after the family receives news that her daughter, Debbie, has been killed. She acted the same way with Frank's new partner, [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]), as she earlier did with Sheila. It soon became apparent that the death was a hoax set up by Monica and her [[civil partner]], a psychiatric nurse called Mildred, who dresses up as an army officer and tells Libby that Debbie was killed in Afghanistan. Monica looked set to claim back her family, even going as far as to demand custody of her youngest children and, when Frank and Libby were reunited, Monica admitted that the reason she returned was truly for Frank as he was the one and she would \"always come back\". However, Frank knew that she would leave again, the same as she did before to him and to Norma and wouldn't let her ruin another of his relationships, so chose to stay with Libby. It was then revealed that Liam (who started warming up to her before leaving in series 6) had decided to live with Monica permanently so he could help her to see love inside herself. She returns in the show's penultimate episode when she sees on the news Frank and Stella are held hostage and tries to negotiate a deal where she would take Stella's place, but ends up locked with her daughter and ex-husband. Soon, Monica and Frank admit to still having feelings and they have sex. In the final episode, she gives birth to her eighth child, [[#Ben Gallagher|Ben]], but feels guilty about aborting his twin brother and drowns in her own guilt and neglects Ben, and the returning Fiona is disgusted to know that Monica is still the same person that abandoned her, though this time she\u2019s remorseful for letting her children down constantly.

She has a fixation with performing anal sexual acts upon Frank. She named her twins after two famous chefs, [[Delia Smith]] and [[Nigel Slater]] (although it is possible that the latter was named after [[Nigella Lawson]]). Sheila left with the twins to go on a cruise after discovering Frank had not divorced his former wife [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]), who had suddenly reappeared with her lesbian girlfriend.\n\nIn the last episode of series 5, Frank goes into a coma and dreams of his unusual family, where Monica still has her physical body, but the mental state of Sheila, In which Frank refers to her as Sheila-Monica. This is shown in the way that she dressed and the sound of her voice while holding up a sign of Sheila's face.

During the early episodes, Fiona had a part-time job as a teaching assistant at a local nursery. Fiona appeared in 19 episodes in total.\n\nDuring her childhood, she used to be referred to by the other kids at school as \"Pov Gallagher\" due to her family's low income and her parents' perpetual unemployment. Fiona also once claimed to be proud that she was the only girl in her year-group during secondary school not to fall pregnant before taking her GCSEs.\n\nAfter her boyfriend [[#Steve McBride|Steve McBride]] ([[James McAvoy]]) got caught up in a botched drug bust, he had to leave the Chatsworth Estate. Fiona was reluctant to leave with him, as she did not want to abandon her siblings and friends. During his absence, she briefly hooked up with [[#Craig Garland|Craig Garland]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and became pregnant with his child. But she still retained feelings for Steve, and when he returned briefly, he told Fiona that her siblings were more than capable of looking after themselves without her, and that she deserved a better life outside of Chatsworth. With the support of her family and friends, Fiona left with Steve at the end of series 2 and now resides in [[Amsterdam]]. In series 8, [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]) mentioned that Fiona was married.\n\nIn the final episode of the show, Fiona is called back to Chatsworth by her mother Monica after hearing she has lost a baby.

She is disgusted to find Monica and Frank are neglecting Ben and choosing to let Fiona's six-year-old sister [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] to take care of him. Reminded of her own past as sole parental guidance for her other siblings, as well as overhearing [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]) talk about the mistreatment her younger siblings will receive once Monica gets over the aborted child, Fiona plots to snatch Stella and Ben to free them of the lifestyle she and her younger siblings went through. She leaves the kids with [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]) so that she can contact Steve. However, Stella runs away and takes her brother. When they are found by Frank, he stops Fiona's plans and she still isn't convinced to leave the kids with her parents after Lip and [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) plead with her not go through with it. Fiona learns from Stella that Frank tried to leave though didn't because he had no money and offers her father money but he doesn't take it and she is convinced of his change.

His half-brothers are [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]), Sean Bennett and 3 unnamed sons of Gary Bennett, while his half-sisters are [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona Gallagher]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella Gallagher]] (Nikita Brownlee). He has one niece, Katie Maguire and through Fiona a nephew. He used to work at The Jockey as a barman but in more recent series his employment, if he has any, has not been shown. Ian appeared in 80 episodes overall.\n\nIn the early series, Ian is depicted as closest to his brother Lip, with whom he shares a room, and is initially the only member of his family to know that he was gay. The brothers often have to look out for each other more than any of the other characters, due to being party to each other's secrets. In later series, all the family, except [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]), are aware of his sexuality. However, it was often implied Frank knew all along but didn't care and accepted Ian for who he was.\n\nIan often identifies as [[Homosexual|gay]], having various relationships with older men throughout the first four or five series. [[#Kash Karib|Kash Karib]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) was his only long-term boyfriend, though he has a brief relationship with Sean Bennett, and an ongoing friendship, sometimes sexual, with [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]). Because he is unaware of his parentage at the time, Ian also unknowingly sleeps with his half-brother. Ian sees Sean Bennett at their biological father's funeral and later tells the truth to Sean, who wants to keep seeing Ian, but eventually agrees that they can not ignore their familial relationship. Beginning in the fourth series, Ian has a number of relationships with women. He repeatedly has sex with a girl he is briefly hiding in his home for her protection, but when she asks him to leave with her, he declines, knowing a relationship would not work. He has a relationship of convenience with [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]), to protect his secret, which nearly turns sexual when they're both at a low point, but they fumble about until Ian decides it's a bad idea. In the seventh series, Ian begins a serious relationship with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]). When Maxine's brother, [[#Bruce Donnelly|Bruce]] ([[Philip Hill-Pearson]]) asks if their being in a relationship means Ian is now \"bisexual\", Ian pauses, before saying he just believes he has found the right person.\n\nDue to Gerard Kearns break to work on a film,<ref>Paul English.

He returns in the seventh episode; this features the debut of Danny, a deaf teenager whom Ian unwittingly transports back to the UK in the boot of his car. Ian now lives in the house of Danny's deceased grandfather, which was leased to him by Danny's Aunt Pegg, in gratitude for looking after him. Danny and Pegg later move to Spain he later lets Mickey move in with him.\n\nIn Series 7, it appears Ian has remained at Danny's old address and has accepted Micky as a tenant. Ian supports Carl's girlfriend Maxine when she decides to have an abortion and break up with Carl. Maxine moves in with Micky and Ian. The situation becomes complicated when Maxine asks Ian to pose as her boyfriend to impress her parents. Ian and Maxine begin to develop feelings for each other and have sex. Micky sees them and tries to convince Ian he shouldn't be with a woman, but Ian says the labels don't matter, he wants to be with Maxine. This leads to a major falling out with Micky, who feels betrayed. Micky tells Carl, who then beats up Ian in the toilets at The Jockey before Frank breaks it up. In spite of the remaining tensions, Ian and Maxine become a couple.\n\nEven with the lingering animosity from Carl and Micky, Ian and Maxine are happy but they are thrown into turmoil when Carl, along with [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]), runs away after being accused of murder. Ian is initially not bothered with Carl's absence, and is more concerned at just how concerned Maxine is over Carl. When Ian and Maxine are in The Jockey, Maxine confronts Jimmy, whom everyone knows is the killer. As Ian looks on, Jimmy's sister hits Maxine in the head with a pool cue. Ian feels ashamed that he let Maxine fight the battle on her own and in spite of her reassurances, he begins to believe that she would have been better off with Carl. To try to prove his worth, Ian attempts to tape a confession from Jimmy, but Jimmy sees through his plan and savagely beats him. Ian begins to further withdraw and is unable to have sex with Maxine; during the time they do spend together, he becomes more paranoid about her feelings every time she mentions Carl. Carl's name is soon cleared and he attempts to make amends with Ian, but Ian isn't interested. He again accuses Maxine of wanting to be with Carl, to which she tells Ian she just doesn't want to be with him. In spite of this conflict, Ian and Maxine still have strong feelings for each other, and Carl convinces Maxine that she and Ian belong together. Ian shows up at hospital soon after Carl and Maxine talk, and he and Maxine smile at each other, and they reconcile.\n\nIn the finale of series 7, Ian and Maxine were returning home after a night out, when they are accosted by a ruffian who attempts to mug them. But they fight back and overpower the thug, and drag him back unconscious to their house. The thug turns out to be a hireling of Roscoe, a Moss Side-based crime lord. After hours of deciding what to do with him, Maxine overhears a conversation where Ian admits that he would \"rather fuck him than kill him\". This seems to be the end of the relationship, as Ian's sexuality may might turn out to be the source of future infidelities. When Ian prepares himself to kill the thug, Maxine and he find that he escaped from his bonds while they were conversing. Ian is seen later with a backpack, apparently leaving Chatsworth. It is not stated whether it is because he is leaving Maxine or if it is to avoid retribution by Roscoe's gang. He happens upon [[Karen Maguire]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), as she and [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]) are about to leave Chatsworth themselves. After witnessing Joe's abusive treatment of Karen, Ian stows away in the boot of Joe's car. After Joe tries to beat and abuse Karen, Ian kills him and makes his exit from the show to dispose of the body.\n\nIn a later episode in series 8, Carl is shown to get a \"Happy Birthday\" text from Ian. In the final episode of the show, Lip mentions that Ian is engaged to a transsexual.\n\n===Debbie Gallagher===\n\n*'''Played by:''' [[Rebecca Ryan]] (Series 1\u20136)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Debbie Gallagher\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = [[Rebecca Ryan]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

She is [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) and [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica Gallagher]]'s ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) second eldest daughter. [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) and [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) are her brothers. Her sisters are [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee); her half-brothers are [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) and Nigel; and her half-sister is Delia. Although Debbie is only 16 (at the time of her last appearance on the show in 2009), she is old beyond her years because she grew up without a mother and undertook the majority of the domestic tasks, At the start of the series Debbie tended to use her childlike innocence to get out of any mess she or family get themselves into. Since Fiona went to [[Amsterdam]], Debbie is often tasked with saving the family from ruin. For example, she steps in when Liam denounces God and the school he attends makes a move to expel him. Although the results are disastrous, she shows herself to be a diligent individual upon whom her family can depend. Originally Debbie was presented as a slightly unusual and awkward child, she retains her high intelligence and resourcefulness throughout the show. This allows Debbie to be successful when she becomes head of the household and takes care of the domestic duties such as cooking, ironing, cleaning and taking Liam to school. She also provides her family members with a high level of emotional support. As a consequence, Debbie missed out on socialising and has become mature beyond her years. When Fiona left Chatsworth at the end of series 2, Debbie seemed, at first, to relish the responsibility of running Gallagher household. Debbie appeared in 65 episodes in total.\n\nIn series one, Debbie abducts a three-year-old boy because she \"wanted a girl, but none of the girls on the estate would take the chocolate\". So she dressed him up in girls clothes. The child's disappearance caused the majority of the estate to go up in arms in search for young \"Jody\". When Debbie finally admits her actions to her family, a furious and bewildered Fiona, [[#Steve McBride|Steve McBride]] ([[James McAvoy]]), Lip, and Ian, formulate a plan to return the youngster back to his family without incriminating Debbie. After circulating false rumours of sightings around the Chatsworth Estate for much of the day, Debbie emerges as the hero of the hour when she returns the boy to his distressed family.\n\nDebbie's closest familial relationship is with her father, Frank. Unlike Fiona, Lip, Ian and Carl, Debbie admires him and often shows her love for him, often seen to be the most affected when he is in danger or trouble. For example, she screams in terror when she believes that Frank's body has been found in a nearby canal. Throughout the series, Frank often lets Debbie down and seems to be unappreciative of her efforts to keep the family together. For example, during some of his drunken rants, he presents himself as being lumbered with children whom he has the sole responsibility of caring for them and seems to forget occasionally what an asset Debbie is to the family. Debbie's feelings of closeness to Frank often leave her the most vulnerable to being let down by him. Debbie's loyalty to her father is occasionally rewarded, and it is strongly suggested that Frank appreciates \"Little Debbie\" more than anyone else in the world, though that changes when he tells her crush Luke that she sleeps around the estate in hopes she doesn't sacrifice money for charity, and even when Frank tries to do good and give her money for a trip she still refuses to forgive him. Debbie also detests her mother more than the rest of the family, refusing to forgive her for abandoning them years ago or for her continued laziness and self-absorption. She did respond sympathetically when more details became clear regarding Monica's abusive childhood at her mother's hands. In contrast, Debbie was close to Frank's ex-wife, [[#Sheila Jackson|Sheila]] ([[Maggie O'Neill]]).\n\nDebbie's relationship with the rest of her family is generally good. She views her siblings as her dependants and generally supports them through their various misadventures. The rest of her family generally recognises all she does for them. She's particularly protective of and very close to her younger brother Liam. Her relationship with him seems to border between surrogate-parent and partner-in-crime, as she has frequently enlisted Liam's help with some of her past schemes. These include faking Liam's kidnapping when Frank wouldn't admit that he hadn't won the lottery, and she once entered him in a modelling competition, which she wanted to keep a secret from Monica. She can also be seen to forge strong relationships with other characters, notably [[#Marty Fisher|Marty Fisher]] ([[Jack Deam]]) and [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]), she also tends to come up with numerous money-making schemes to provide income.\n\nIt is revealed in Series 5 that Debbie has been in a secret relationship with police officer [[#Tom O'Leary|Tom O'Leary]] ([[Michael Legge (actor)|Michael Legge]]), despite the fact that she is only 15 years old. Debbie and Tom break up at the beginning of series 6 during her 16th birthday party when she realises that Tom is too old for her and that he wants much more from the relationship. Tom begins to stalk her, although he tells workmate Carrie that Debbie has been stalking him.\n\nDebbie is now seemingly in a relationship with a man called Mark, whom she met on a night out with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]) and when she got drunk, he took her back to his student residence to sleep, but nothing more. Debbie left the students room the next morning, thinking that she'd never see him again. However, at a funeral the family had been invited to, they met again, and she discovered it was his Grandmothers funeral.\n\nAt first, Debbie was a little objective to a relationship with him after he made comments about Frank (who had decided to go to the toilet behind a tree at the funeral and then punched Mark) however she told Maxine of her feelings for him. He later appeared outside Debbie's home and when she refused to see him, he sat on a chair in the middle of the road until she did. He later used the chair when a hired gunman was going to kill both [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) and [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]), but Mark knocked the hit-man out with the chair.\n\nAfter this, Debbie and Mark have sex in on the kitchen floor, reminiscent to the scene in the first episode where Steve and Fiona also have sex in the kitchen, in the same place as Debbie does. Debbie does not return in 2010 for series 7. We find out from Frank's grandmother, who comes to visit, that Debbie has joined the army. At seventeen, Debbie perhaps had no wish to allow her role as the driving force of the Gallagher household hold her back from her potential. Liam, who had been virtually brought up by Debbie since the age of four, has taken on her former role in the Gallagher household or maybe after Child Services incident she realized she was unfit to being a parent figure to her dysfunctional family and joined the Army to find her place.\n\nIn episode 11 of series 7, Debbie sends the family a letter telling them she's being sent to [[Afghanistan]]. In Episode 1 of Series 8 an army SNCO visits the Gallagher household and reveals that Debbie has been killed in action. This subsequently turned out to be a malicious joke by Frank's ex-wife Monica.\n\n===Carl Gallagher===\n{{main|Carl Gallagher}}\n*'''Played by:''' [[Elliott Tittensor]] (Series 1\u20139, 11)<br>[[Luke Tittensor]] (Series 1)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Carl Gallagher\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = [[Elliott Tittensor]] (2004\u201313)<br>[[Luke Tittensor]] (2004)\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

The son of [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) and [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica Gallagher]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]), his brothers are [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]) and [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]); his sisters are [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]) and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee); his half-brothers are [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) and Nigel; and his half-sister is Delia. Initially he played only a minor role in the show, but since series two has been featured just as much as the other Gallagher children. Carl appeared in 117 episodes in total.\n\nIn the first series, Carl was jointly played by Tittensor's twin brother [[Luke Tittensor]], but since the second series he has played the role alone.\n\nIn series 3, Carl briefly worked for the Maguires by growing marijuana for them in his loft, until the police found out about the production. Carl was briefly taken into custody, and gave a statement that the marijuana was grown for the household's own personal use. But after a tip was given to the police about [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]) selling weed, her mother [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]) suspected that Carl betrayed them and sent her sons, [[#Donny Maguire|Donny]] (Clyve Bonelle) and [[Shane Maguire]] ([[Nicky Evans]]), after him. Later, Carl's siblings Lip, Ian and Debbie, figured out that the only person with the motive for informing the police about Mandy's dealings was in fact her brother Shane, who was angry that his mother chose his sister over him to oversee that area of the family business. After Lip confronted Shane over the matter, Shane agreed to call off the family hunt for Carl.\n\nCarl develops a long tally of sexual conquests in the later series, one notable example being the mother of one girl whom he was dating during his last year of secondary school.\n\nIn series 6, Carl realizes [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) is gay; he is one of the few people on the estate, along with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]), his brother Liam and his half-brother Ian, who is aware of this. Mickey makes several unsuccessful passes at Carl.\n\nThrough series 6 and early series 7, Carl pursues and begins a relationship with auxiliary nurse Maxine. Carl breaks up with Maxine after she admits to having aborted his child and feeling he is too immature to be a father. Carl soon decides he wants another chance with Maxine, and is encouraged when she has sex with him in the Jockey toilets. However, he does not know that Maxine only had sex with him to get her mind off Ian, whom she is beginning to have feelings for. Carl proposes to Maxine, but she turns him down. Carl continues to hope until Micky, out of hurt and jealousy, tells Carl about Maxine and Ian. A heartbroken and enraged Carl meets Ian in The Jockey toilets before savagely beating him. He smashes the engagement ring to pieces and cuts all ties to Maxine and Ian.\n\nCarl begins working for Michelle, the head of a male escort agency that [[Jamie Maguire]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]) briefly worked for; when Jamie no longer wants to have sex with her, an eager Carl is more than capable of taking over the job. Unfortunately this proves to be the one bright spot for Carl around this time. He and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) go to a party and afterwards are in the street with a boy named Bonehead, who shows them a video he took of a girl he'd taken advantage of. Her brother, Jimmy, a local tough, viciously attacks Bonehead in front of them, and threatens them into staying silent. When Bonehead dies, Jimmy makes sure they are seen as the prime suspects, and threatens them into fleeing town. Carl and Chesney end up on a farm in Wales, but when Carl is able to get reception for his mobile phone, the messages of support from Maxine and his family move him and he and Chesney decide to return home. They hide in Chesney's shop but when Jimmy again threatens Carl's family, Carl attacks him. Carl even gets a gun to use on Jimmy, but [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]) convinces him this would be a mistake. Ultimately, Joe makes Jimmy disappear, Jimmy's sister clears Carl and Chesney, and the Maguires convince Jimmy's gang to leave the Gallaghers and Chesney alone.\n\nCarl and Ian still have bad blood, with blood literally spilled for Ian as his attempt to tape a confession from Jimmy had ended in a beating. Ian did not accept Carl's apologies for what had happened over Maxine and he drives Maxine away by accusing her of still wanting to be with Carl. Carl visits Maxine at hospital and tells her he knows she was right to have the abortion. He convinces her to give Ian another chance, as he says that he can be her mate, but Ian is her soulmate. Ian and Maxine reconcile, and so do Carl and Ian.\n\nAs of series 8, Carl is the only original Gallagher child left, after Liam decided to stay with his mum, and Carl seems to have feelings for best mate Chesney's cousin, [[#Sita Desai|Sita Desai]] (Aysha Kala). He also had sexual relations with her. He proposes to Sita, but she turns him down. He isn't good enough for her. Carl also seems to fancy soon-to-be stepmother [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]), when he starts to get visibly aroused when he looks at her backside and legs.\n\nIn series 9, Carl becomes a police officer and leaves Chatsworth to move in with his girlfriend, Clem, thus leaving none of the original Gallagher children (besides Stella) on the estate.\n\nHe returns in the series finale, along with Fiona and Lip where they arrive for the birth of their new brother Ben. He tries to plead with Lip on not letting Fiona go with her choice of taking the kids Stella and Ben, since he was closest to Frank. At the end, Carl gets through to his brother and watched Lip plead to Fiona because turned out fine with or without their parents. He watches Fiona hand Frank money to leave however, the latter refused to take it as Carl sees that he couldn't live without his family and is pleased to see this side. In the end, he makes amends with his family and partakes in their activities.\n\n===Liam Gallagher===\n\n*'''Played by:''' Joseph Furnace (Series 1\u20132)/[[Johnny Bennett]] (Series 3\u20138)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Liam Gallagher\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = Joseph Furnace (Series 1\u20132)<br>[[Johnny Bennett]] (Series 3\u20138)\n| years          = 2004\u20132011\n| first          = 13 January 2004<br>Series 1 Episode 1<br>\"Meet the Gallaghers\"\n| last           = 12 January 2011<br>Series 8 Episode 2<br>\"Missing\"\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

He is named after [[Liam Gallagher|the singer of the same name]]. He apparently suffered from epileptic fits when he was smaller, although this has never been seen. It was also implied that he used to wet the bed, though he claims that it was only to help put out the fires, which he had a fondness for starting, as seen during his pyromania phase in series 4\u20135 \u2013 matchboxes and lighter-fluid were routinely found under his mattress by his brothers [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) and [[Ian Gallagher|Ian]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]). Throughout the series, Liam is practically raised by his older sisters, [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]) and [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), as his father [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) is lazy and mother [[#Monica Gallagher|Monica]] ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) inept- when she is around. In later episodes, Liam shows considerable intelligence and resourcefulness like sister Debbie and is also an outspoken atheist. In series 5, signs of genius in Liam became obvious when he was shown to be an adept car thief, much like [[#Steve McBride|Steve McBride]] ([[James McAvoy]]), and was seen later to use a defibrillator on a comatose Frank when it was thought that his heart had stopped. In series 6, it is revealed that Liam is a talented musician, and also fluent in [[British Sign Language|Sign Language]]. Given his academic performance, the school determines Liam to be an exceptionally gifted pupil, which leads to him being awarded a special scholarship. During an interview at a local university, he initially fails to make a good impression due to nervousness. But that changed when his father Frank attempts to steal the \"Joy of Sex\" manual from the university library; Liam plucks up the courage to tell the panel of education directors why he deserves the scholarship in an impassioned speech. Liam appeared in 78 episodes in total.\n\nLiam was also persuaded by his brother Carl to create false identities on the internet for him, [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]), [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]), and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]), so they would be admitted into an exclusive nightclub.\n\nIn series 3, the then five-year-old Liam was almost expelled from his RC primary school when he openly denounced religion during a Christmas nativity play that was held by the school. Debbie learned of this development on New Year's Day 2006 when meeting with Liam's headteacher and a local parish priest. Debbie tried to warn Frank of the situation and the expected visit from the school, but to no avail. On the day of the school visit, and when it was apparent that Frank was not going to help, Debbie had to take matters into her own hands. She shaved Liam's head, and told the school administrators that her little brother had cancer. Unfortunately, the rumour got out of hand, and spread out across the Chatsworth community, until a fundraiser for \"Liam Day\" was set up by [[#Jez|Jez]] (Lindsey Dawson), the landlady of \"The Jockey\", ultimately ending it with Liam outing himself at not having cancer.\n\nWhile apparently an atheist, it was hinted in series 6 that Liam may have had change of perception on the matter, even when he expertly refuted the arguments of two Jehovah's Witnesses, whom Monica tricked into babysitting Liam and [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella]] (Nikita Brownlee), he stated that \"they may not know it, but they're right and I'm wrong\". He also tried to get rid of the clothes Debbie and Maxine stole, thinking that they brought \"bad Karma\". In series 7, Liam quoted from passages in the Old and New Testaments that condoned prostitution when [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Maguire]] ([[Sally Carman]]) thought that her occupation would disqualify her as godmother of [[Karen Maguire|Karen]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]) and [[Jamie Maguire]]'s ([[Aaron McCusker]]) son, Connor. And was seen later with a copy of the Torah when counselling a Jewish convert with a penchant for pork-scratchings. Although knowledgeable about religion, Liam does not appear to endorse nor practice any of them.\n\nLiam is now one of the few people in Chatsworth who is aware of Micky homosexuality. He sarcastically tells Micky that he figured it out through his \"amazing powers of deduction\", despite Micky's stereotypically gay mannerisms and aesthetic preferences.\n\nIn series 7, Debbie has left Chatsworth to join the army, and perhaps due to this, Liam seems to have taken on more responsibility within the household, even getting a job delivering newspapers to support the family. His relationship with Frank has soured to the point that Liam has grown openly contemptuous of his father as he starts to develop more of Debbie's traits, (such as shouting at and attacking Frank and Carl for their antics). Liam now attends a prestigious senior school.\n\nHe soon falls for a girl called Holly, whom he meets during his music lessons. Holly takes Liam home to meet her parents, when he tells them his father is a deceased heart specialist. But an accident at school exposes the lie. Despite this, Holly wanted to continue the relationship, but her comments against Frank hurt Liam's feelings, and cause him to leave with Frank.\n\nAfter the Gallagher household falls behind on their HP payments, Liam gambles at [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]]'s ([[Ben Batt]]) shop to raise cash. Despite showing great aptitude early on, Liam ends up losing to Joe's bluff during a game of poker, owing him \u00a3100. Unable to come up with the money, Liam desperately asks his drunk father for help. Frank accidentally headbutts him, causing Liam to run out of The Jockey. Later on in the episode, Liam contacts Joe, asking \"if I die, would it clear my debt?\" Joe hurriedly seeks out Frank, Carl and Ian, who find Liam on top of a building threatening to jump. When a scuffle ensures between his brothers and father, he moves to a different ledge, and throws his phone down. After a heartfelt pledge by Frank to be more supportive, and from Joe to write-off his debt to him, Liam seemingly jumps, but he simply lands onto the balcony 7 feet down, recovers his mobile phone, and holds both Joe and Frank to their promises.\n\nWhen Carl is framed for the death of a local boy, Liam is instrumental in helping to clear his name and convincing him to come home.\n\nLiam struggles to adjust to Frank's new girlfriend [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]) taking over the mother role in the household. Liam begins to act more hostile towards her than ever. Liam feels that Frank is taking advantage of Libby, as he did with [[#Sheila Jackson|Sheila Jackson]] ([[Maggie O'Neill]]). The family realise why when Carl finds a letter Liam has kept from Debbie which tells them she has been sent to Afghanistan. Liam does a school report on a [[World War II]] veteran, Reggie. Slowly they become friends and Liam tries to help Reggie as he has no one to take care of him since being widowed. Carl, Kelly, and Libby all feel suspicious of their friendship, especially when Libby sees Liam wearing a dress (Liam wore one of Debbie's dresses as it reminded him of her smell). Liam defends Reggie, but when Reggie, knowing that he was close to death, desperately hugs him and doesn't want to let go. Liam completely mis-interprets Reggie's reasons, and flees the house. However, Liam begins to realise he was wrong about Reggie and returns to apologise and sit with Reggie as he dies.\n\nLiam skillfully plays an acoustic guitar during The Jockey's talent night in episode 12. By then, he seems to have eventually warmed to Libby after she promised him that she would never leave no matter how much Frank might put her off. In various episodes, Liam is seen to adopt Debbie's mannerisms and views in respect of his feelings about religion, figures of authority and the ways in which his family cope with one another. Debbie was Liam's main care-giver and role model since Fiona's departure from Chatsworth in series 2, being the main nurturing influence in his life from the ages of four to ten. Debbie and Liam had such a strong bond with each other, that she would frequently use his help in various activities. It was to Liam whom she addressed the letter to when she was assigned to Afghanistan.\n\nBetween Series 7\u20138, Liam was the remaining Gallagher on the Chatsworth estate that possesses any sense of responsibility and maturity. In series 8, when the family received the news of Debbie's death in Afghanistan, Liam was willing to travel on his own to personally break the news to Fiona. But there was no need, as the news turned out to be a cruel hoax by the returning Monica. When Monica came back, Liam finally confronted his mother on her attitude toward her family. Monica replied that her relationship with his father was \"above right or wrong\". When Monica left after her deception was revealed, Liam followed her to the bus stop, where her latest Lesbian lover greeted her. Liam realized this was the same person whom earlier dressed as an army NCO to falsely inform them of Debbie's death. Liam attends Frank's stagnight to keep him out of trouble, but the other drunken revellers playfully tie Frank up and leave him in a cemetery, while taking Liam to a brothel and leaving him with a prostitute. Libby is furious when she finds out, but Liam assures her that he didn't have sex. He only paid the girl for her time with him, and won the money back in a game of Three Card Brag. When Frank goes missing after his stag night, Monica demands custody of Liam and Stella. When she came to collect them, Liam forced Monica to take him rather than Stella, otherwise he would make her life difficult. Liam left with Monica after saying he would come back as soon as Monica gets her new house from the council, which was the true reason she wanted Liam and Stella in the first place. In the fifth episode, just before Frank and Libby's wedding, Carl reads a best man's speech written by Liam, which turns out to be a personal message from him. Liam says that he's decided to stay with Monica, saying that she's had a hard life and that he wants to help her love herself, much to the sadness of everyone in attendance. Liam had left the Chatsworth Estate to live with Monica. Although, by Series 11, Monica came to live with Frank, without Liam, indicating that Liam left his mother sometime after the events in Series 8. In the final episode of ''Shameless'', Liam was stated by Lip to be a practicing [[Buddhist]].\n\n===Stella Gallagher===\n\n*'''Played by:''' Alana & Anabelle Crampton (Series 6\u201310) / Nikita Brownlee (Series 11)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name = Stella Gallagher\n| series = Shameless\n| portrayer = Alana & Anabelle Crampton (Series 6\u201310)<br>Nikita Brownlee (Series 11)\n| years = 2008\u20132013\n| first = 15 April 2008<br>Series 5 Episode 16<br>\"The Ninth Time Around\"\n| last = 28 May 2013<br>Series 11 Episode 14<br>\"End of the Line\"\n| creator = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer = [[George S.

Stella appeared in 15 episodes overall.\n\nStella is born to Frank and Monica in April 2008, with Monica giving birth next to Frank, who is in a coma during the birth. Like before, Stella's siblings, primarily [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) and [[Carl Gallagher|Carl]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), look after her, while Frank and Monica continue with their previous disastrous parenting. During Series 6, Monica walks out on the family again, leading to Social Services temporarily taking Liam and Stella into care, however neighbours [[#Yvonne Karib|Yvonne Karib]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]) and [[#Stan Waterman|Stan Waterman]] (Warren Donnelly) offer to foster them in order to keep them close to the Gallaghers. When Frank's new partner [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]), her mother [[#Patty Croker|Patty]] ([[Valerie Lilley]]) and their relative [[#Aidan Croker|Aidan]] (Robbie Conway) move in, all of them look after Stella alongside Liam and Carl, while Frank continues to neglect his children.\n\nBy Series 11, Stella is now 6 years old, and is shown to be thoughtful and caring. She and Aidan are the only ones left to contend with Frank's outrageous behavior. She shows great maturity for her age, as she covered for her father after he was in involved in a riot. Stella still loves her father, still calling him \"Dad\" and taking caring of him when needed. She meets her older brother, [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip]] ([[Jody Latham]]), and gets on well with his daughter, [[#Katie Maguire|Katie]] (Bethany Thompson). After Frank begins a threeway relationship with prostitutes Sherilee (Sarah Totty) and Derilee (Sue Vincent), Derilee's husband Baxter arrives at the Gallagher household and holds Frank, Stella and Derilee hostage at gunpoint. While negotiating with Baxter their freedom, Monica returns to Chatsworth to take Stella's place in the hostage situation, holding no resentment like her other siblings is happy to see her mother. However, Stella ends up running back inside, after her father protects her from a stray bullet with Monica also being held captive. While Derilee and Baxter solve their differences, Frank and Monica have sex, resulting in Monica falling pregnant with twins. She has an abortion, however one of the twins survives, and she gives birth to [[#Ben Gallagher|Ben Gallagher]] in The Jockey. As Monica feigns bereavement over the baby she \"miscarried\", and Frank neglecting his newborn son, Stella is forced to take on the role of looking after Ben. Stella's oldest sibling, [[#Fiona McBride|Fiona McBride]] ([[Anne-Marie Duff]]), returns to Chatsworth with Carl and Lip, and attempt to make Frank and Monica see that their disastrous parenting is only going to damage Stella and Ben. Fiona decides to take Stella and Ben back to Amsterdam with her, leaving her in the care of her old friend, [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]), however he loses them. Stella follows Frank to the bus stop with Ben in her arms, where she claims to her father that she wants to stay with him. However, Frank tells her she should go with Fiona and rages at an upset Stella that she (along with his other children) were a mistake and that she ruined his life, leading to her sadly walk away with her brother. A guilty Frank later finds Stella and Ben at a local park, he tries to apologize for his harsh behavior and after a series of events, he confirms that he does love her, much to her joy. Frank then takes the burden of Stella caring for Ben off her shoulders, while taking an active role himself.\n\nFrank takes them back to the Gallagher household, walking into Fiona and Monica fighting over the upbringing of the two children. Even though Lip and Carl try to convince Fiona otherwise, Fiona refuses to believe they will change and Stella stands up for their father by voicing his stopping himself from leaving the family. Stella watches as Fiona offer Frank money to leave as he intended. However, he refused to take it as she sees that he couldn't live without his family and is pleased to see this side.

She is somewhat resentful of Frank, calling him a \"selfish little shit\". She is close to all of his children, especially her great-grandson [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]). She is the carer for her husband Bunty, who does nothing but eat. Out of desperation, she shoots Bunty dead in front of Frank and willingly goes to prison for it. She is last seen when she is visited by her grandsons Liam and [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), and she appears to be loving prison life.

His cherished wife is [[Mimi Maguire|Mimi]] ([[Tina Malone]]), and he has an identical twin brother called Noel ([[Sean Gilder]]), who is gay. It was shown in Series 6 that he is a supporter of [[Celtic F.C.]] and in the background at the Maguire residence there is a statue of a Celtic player, who looks similar to the old Celtic captain, Bobby Lennox. Paddy appeared in 52 episodes in total.\n\nPaddy is extremely aggressive and violent and his presence puts fear into most people on the Chatsworth Estate. For example, when he and his family enter the local pub, The Jockey, the customers sitting at the table beside the entrance clear the seat for them. He and his family are also drug dealers on the Chatsworth estate. He has a particular dislike for the Gallagher family, particularly [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank]] ([[David Threlfall]]) and [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), which he has demonstrated on several occasions, both physically and verbally. However, in more recent series, Paddy has begun to show a more compassionate side, and since series four, he has also become much more accepting of Lip, as well as [[Karen Maguire|Karen Jackson]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), the wife of his oldest son [[Jamie Maguire|Jamie]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]). Paddy's identical twin brother Noel was credited as being played by Neil Grades, an anagram of actor Sean Gilder. Paddy also has a strong sense of family and is loyal toward them. For example, when his daughter-in-law Karen becomes severely depressed he becomes the rock upon which she can lean.\n\nDespite his initial dislike of Frank, this mindset was then turned after Paddy choked on a cashew nut in The Jockey and Frank performed the Heimlich manoeuvre, thus saving Paddy's life. Frank also saved Paddy's life again, stopping him from injecting himself with what would have been a lethal dose of [[heroin]]. Paddy now has some grudging respect for the Gallaghers.\n\nDespite showing open contempt for higher education, Paddy has occasionally shown knowledge of certain literary subjects.\n\nIn Series 6, Paddy was briefly abducted by the mother of a teenager who died after using his drugs, who in revenge repeatedly injected Paddy with heroin, causing him to become addicted to the substance. His attempts to conceal his new habit and deal with its effect on his life were a recurring theme of Series 6, with him finally going cold turkey later in the series, during which he had visions of his father Padraig. In addition to the visions of his father, Paddy fantasizes about sleeping with Karen and [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Maguire]] ([[Sally Carman]]), who are both his daughters-in-law.\n\nIn series 7, Paddy's marriage to Mimi is near enough over, due to the fact that his affair with Maureen results in the tragic circumstances of the series 6 finale, in which daughter [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]) is murdered in an explosion. Separated, living in separate houses and each given the freedom to see other people, Paddy takes a night out with sons Jamie, [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]) and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) as an opportunity to restart his love life with a meaningless one-night stand with a female clubber. When he can't \"pull\", he returns home, alone and defeated, and is greeted by Kelly. After a short conversation, Paddy hands Kelly an amount of money, in exchange for sex. Kelly accepts this money, and they have sex in the living room, while Kelly's boyfriend and Paddy's son Shane look all over the nightclub for him. Later on in the episode, an awkward Paddy and Kelly exchange moments, in which Paddy offers Shane and Kelly the master bedroom of the Maguire house, out of guilt. Some time later, Kelly rejected Shane's marriage proposal, as she could not marry him after lying to him. Shane insisted he would forgive her anything, no matter whom she had slept with, but the guilty looks between Paddy and Kelly made him realise what had happened between them. Paddy was so ashamed of his actions that he was willing to inject himself with heroin at Shane's request, but Shane stopped him at the last minute. Paddy then attended Shane's and Kelly's wedding.\n\nPaddy starts a relationship with a dance enthusiast named D'reen ([[Cathy Murphy]]), and makes plans to emigrate to [[Cuba]] with her. When he realises that he cannot leave his family and business, Paddy puts a stop{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} to his plans, and shares one last dance with D'reen before she leaves.\n\nPaddy begins applying heavy pressure on Jock, the owner of the boxing club, who had borrowed heavily from the Maguires. Meanwhile, he relentlessly belittles Micky when he wants to join the fire brigade. Micky's self-confidence falls through the floor and he berates Paddy for always putting him down. Paddy's belligerence towards Jock leads Jock to set himself and the club on fire. Micky risks his life to save Jock. When Jock is in hospital, Paddy reveals that he had been a young boxer at the club; he had real potential to use his skills to get a better life, but Jock essentially sold him to a crime family. Micky reveals to Paddy that he lied about passing his fire test. Paddy tells Micky it doesn't matter, Micky is still more of a man than he will ever be.\n\nOn 6 March 2010, it was announced that Sean Gilder had quit ''Shameless'' after five years with the show because of his rumoured dislike of [[Tina Malone]] who portrays Mimi.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He departed ''Shameless'' at the end of Series 7, Episode 14.\n\nAfter Paddy's departure, Mimi gives birth to her eighth child, Cilla. It is unclear whether or not Paddy has died. Frank utters the words, at one point in the show: \"I never thought I would say this, but bring back Paddy Maguire!\" Although, in the same episode, [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]) implied to Karen that Paddy was killed after returning to Ireland. In episode 14 of series 8 a coffin is carried through the estate, supposedly with Paddy inside, but it turns out this was Paddy's way of smuggling guns to the rest of the Maguires. Jamie tells Kelly that Paddy's plan was to make the police think he was dead, so he could start again, and that he is now living in Thailand.\n\n===Mimi Tutton===\n*'''Played by:''' [[Tina Malone]] (Series 2\u201311)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Mimi Tutton\n| series         = [[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]\n| portrayer      = [[Tina Malone]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

She is the wife of [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy Maguire]] ([[Sean Gilder]]), mother of [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy Maguire]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]) and Cilla Tutton and the Maguire boys, [[Jamie Maguire|Jamie]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]), [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]), [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]), the late Fergal and the little seen [[#Joey Maguire|Joey]] (Will Willoughby) and [[#Donny Maguire|Donny]] (Clyve Bonelle), and the daughter of \"Nana\" Murphy. Her ex-boyfriend is also named Paddy. She is also a drug dealer on the Chatsworth Estate and is frequently seen doing so on the show. She is extremely violent, easily angered and arguably more intimidating than her husband, Paddy; though as the series progresses she becomes less hotheaded. She has headbutted several characters on the show including [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), Sue Garland ([[Gillian Kearney]]), Cassie Western ([[Moya Brady]]) and even her own son Shane and strike fear into the likes of [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]), Lip, [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), [[#Carol Fisher|Carol Fisher]] ([[Marjorie Yates]]), [[Karen Maguire]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), her own children and even Paddy. Mimi is as hard as nails, and she can hold her own with men and women. At one point during Series 3 a whole riot squad is needed to restrain her after she attempts to free her daughter Mandy from incarceration at the police station. Mimi appeared in 111 episodes overall.\n\nIn series 5 a more sensitive side to Mimi is shown after her ex-boyfriend, Paddy, makes a crass comment about her weight. She describes herself as a \"bulimic who can't stand vomit\". In the same series, she is shown attending [[anger management]] classes. In Series 6, Mimi experiences some regret over her lack of education when son Micky takes film classes. Mimi does most of his coursework for him, and when he decides the class isn't for him, he allows Mimi to take his place.\n\nMimi is presented as a character who behaves in ways which are polar opposites. For example, she has no qualms about selling drugs to children and behaving in a violent manner. However, she also has strong maternal instincts and shows compassion for others. For example, when [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) reacts badly after consuming drugs, she and Paddy care for Chesney by feeding him and ensuring that he sobers up safely. Later, when [[#Yvonne Karib|Yvonne Karib]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]) accuses Mimi of being an intolerant racist, Mimi retorts by describing the racism that Paddy faced when he arrived in England from Ireland. Yvonne and Mimi realize that they share love for their own children and would do anything to ensure their happiness. Also, Mimi is someone upon whom [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]) can depend when she seeks advice or assistance.\n\nThe Maguire family's drug dealing business comes back to haunt them when Mimi's beloved Paddy is abducted and forcibly addicted to heroin by the bereaved mother of one of their deceased customers. To make matters worse, she is arrested for an assault that her son Jamie carried out. However, she freely states that she wants to take the blame for the attack, claiming \"A mam's gotta do what a mam's gotta do\". This is because she does not want to see her ex-con son go to jail again. At the end of series 6, her beloved daughter Mandy is killed by the woman who got Paddy addicted to heroin. The strain of this loss causes Paddy and Mimi to split up.\n\nIn series 7 Mimi lives in The Jockey as landlord and has an affair with a friend of her son Micky named [[#Billy Tutton|Billy Tutton]] (Michael Taylor), until she finds out that he is only fourteen years old, although he looks just as old as Micky. After the boy starts to blackmail Mimi into a secret relationship, Mimi tries to threaten him to keep him away from her, finally giving him a gun filled with blanks and daring him to shoot her. When he pulls the trigger, she pretends to be dead, and he flees Chatsworth, believing he has killed her.\n\nMimi attempts to join a local women's group to find companionship and feel better about herself, but they rebuff her attempts to appear in their risque charity calendar, making her feel fat, unattractive, and worthless. To add insult to injury, they ask Mimi to supply them with some party drugs to help loosen them up before the photo shoot. In revenge, Mimi gives them such potent 'treats' that they begin cavorting around in their underwear, groping each other. Mimi films them and sets up a website to display the shots.\n\nMimi gives birth to a newborn daughter, later named Cilla, at the end of Series 7 after complaining of stomach pains and nausea which scared her into believing she had started menopause. The baby was presumably fathered by estranged husband Paddy. According to the ''Shameless'' website, Mimi will return to living in the Maguire house, with baby daughter Cilla, in Series 8. It is implied that she is unsure who fathered Cilla because of her fling with underage Billy. It is later revealed that Cilla's father is in fact Billy, who returns to Chatsworth to be part of the child's life. At the end of Series 8 the couple marry, despite ongoing controversy and disapproval of much of the family. In Series 9, Mimi forces Billy to have an open relationship because she is worried she is to old for him.

Much to his parents' disgust, he appeared to be reformed, rejected his family, got a job as a barman at \"The Jockey\", began training as a [[probation officer]], and became engaged to his Jockey co-worker, [[Karen Maguire|Karen Jackson]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]). Jamie has a tendency to sleepwalk on occasion. He appeared in 108 episodes in total.\n\nIn the last episode of Series 4, Jamie revealed that he had admitted his guilt in order to get parole so that he could hunt down his father's three former cellmates, who were planning to muscle in on Paddy's territory and dispose of him. His new reformed life was a sham to cover his murders of these three men. Karen assumed that his courtship of her was part of this pretence, but Jamie claimed that he really loved her and they were married at the end of the episode.\n\nDuring Series 5, Jamie does his best to avoid joining the family business. He and Karen take over The Jockey, and things go smoothly until Karen miscarries early in Series 6. She distances herself from him, questioning if she would want to have a child that would grow up in the Maguire family. Eventually, the two separate after Karen refuses put a \"Maguire\" on the pub's license with her. It is during this time that Karen begins sleeping with [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), able to break it off with her increasingly controlling lover only after she threatens to lie to the Maguires and tell them he continued to [[domestic violence|physically abuse]] [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]), Jamie's sister. Jamie moves home with Karen, and she soon finds out she's pregnant again, not sure if the father was Jamie or Joe.\n\nDespite being portrayed as one of the warmer of the Maguire family, Jamie has become somewhat of a dark and aggressive character, possibly due to him taking on the family business while his father was going [[cold turkey]] when recovering from drug addiction. Jamie is shown to go to extreme lengths to get revenge, sending one such message to Joe, after finding out about Karen's affair with him, by digging up his recently deceased father and leaving him slumped outside of the local shop. He also proves that unlike his two brothers, he is a very effective debt collector and head of the family business, having no qualms about threatening or injuring if it brings results.\n\nJamie becomes a father in Series 7, but afterward witnesses the gradual mental breakdown of his wife Karen, unaware that the overwhelming guilt and self-loathing she carries is eating away at her inside. After Karen's release from hospital, they fall behind on household bills, and Jamie is finding it difficult to cope with his wife's mental illness. He meets a woman named Michelle while on a night out, and has sex with her in the ladies toilets. Michelle runs a male escort agency, and leaves her card in Jamie's pocket, along with some money. They meet later when Michelle offers Jamie a job. Despite his obvious disgust at the thought of working as a \"man-whore\", Jamie agrees to the offer. He services Michelle and other women, needing the money as well as some time away from Karen. When Karen begins to suspect an affair, Michelle confesses her love for him, and Paddy uncovers what he's doing and tries to tell him to stop, Jamie finally has enough. Initially Michelle is reluctant to let him go, but when he introduces her to the virile young [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]), she changes her mind.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s18/casualty/news/a169160/ex-casualty-actress-joins-shameless.html|title=Casualty actress and Maguire son|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=4 August 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Karen has continued her destructive affair with Joe, who seemed to have no concerns about her illness or her erratic behavior. Eventually, Joe announces to Jamie that he's having an affair with his wife, and claims that he is baby Connor's father. As his marriage implodes, Jamie is also trying to deal with a threat to both the family and their business, since his father has left Chatsworth for Ireland.\n\nAs series 8 begins, Jamie is in counseling with Karen who has returned with their son. He beats up a cab driver, erroneously believing the man is Joe, and Karen finally admits Joe is dead, although she does not tell him he was murdered while attempting to kill her. She and Connor move back with Jamie into The Jockey as they attempt to make their marriage work. In the meantime, Jamie tricks his brother, [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]), into willingly giving up his attempt to run the family business. When Shane finally realizes Jamie manipulated him into giving up leading the family business and killing a loan shark, he tells his wife, [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly]] ([[Sally Carman]]), that Jamie was born for this, \"Scammin', schemin' and killin'.\" Then Jamie finally accepts Karen back into their marital bed, telling her that he \"could tape his stiffy to his belly\" after watching her all day. In series 8, Jamie is shown to be scared of clowns since he saw one of them choke to death when he was young. This led to his discomfort with Karen's new business as a party clown, which lasted only until a customer attempted to molest her. Luckily, one of the guns Jamie was selling ended up in her bag, and she was able to shoot the customer and get away, leading to Jamie taking the gun back and soothing her in a hot shower.\n\nAfter losing to Karen in a card game, he agrees to put the pub back in her name, and the couple are seen looking up at the new sign, showing \"Jamie and Karen Maguire\" as the proprietors of the Jockey.\n\nIn Series 9, Jamie acts a spokesman for the estate when the majority of the people who live there are evicted. He later cheats on Karen with [[#Gloria Meak|Gloria Meak]] ([[Angeline Ball]]). He and a few others become trapped underground after a family job goes wrong; they are eventually saved and it is unclear if his and Gloria's affair will continue.\n\n===Shane Maguire===\n{{main|Shane Maguire}}\n*'''Played by:''' [[Nicky Evans]] (Series 3, 4\u201311)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Shane Maguire\n| series         = [[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]\n| portrayer      = [[Nicky Evans]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

Shane, overall, appeared in 114 episodes.\n\nShane is known for his short and unpredictable temper and limited intelligence, although he was once shown to possess great instincts for shopper's habits during Series 5 when he briefly worked in [[#Yvonne Karib|Yvonne Karib]]'s ([[Kelli Hollis]]) off-licence shop. Judging by certain scenes from the fourth to sixth series, the other Maguire boys, except for Jamie, seemed to be taking direction from Shane, in the absence of Paddy and Mimi, which might imply that Shane is the second oldest of the Maguire children. In Series 6 Shane suffers a [[head injury]] whilst running a hotel scam with his lover, [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Ball]] ([[Sally Carman]]). After coming out of a [[coma]], Shane is left partially paralysed and bed-ridden. Conflict arises between Kelly and Shane's overpowering mother, Mimi, over who will oversee his convalescence. However, with physiotherapy and speech therapy, his condition begins to improve.\n\nAfter a running a series of wedding scams together, Shane asks Kelly to marry him, but she was hesitant to do so. After they fall out during a party at The Jockey, he tries to make amends. But discovers that weeks earlier, Kelly had sex with his father, Paddy. A heartbroken Shane later asks his father why he betrayed him. Paddy reveals that he felt shamed by his sons for abandoning him during that night, and in a moment of self-pity, paid Kelly for sex to \"hurt\" his son, but he now deeply regrets it. Shane demands that his father proves how sorry he is, and produces a syringe and a bag of heroin. As Paddy is about to inject himself, Shane stops him just in time. Satisfied with his father's remorse, he quietly leaves Paddy, who breaks down in tears. He is now married to Kelly. They had their impromptu civil ceremony at The Jockey.\n\nWhile giving a deposit to a sperm bank, Shane learned that he was sterile. Shane was upset at the thought of never having children. His father and brothers tried to help by offering to be sperm donors for Kelly, but she refused. [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) suggested Kelly and Shane raise Shane's niece Katie, but this plan was dashed when her father [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]) decided to take her. Shane was left to look on Liam as a son.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tv.com/shameless-uk/season-7--episode-10/episode/1336462/summary.html|title=No kids leaves Shane heartbroken|last=Abbott|first=Paul|date=30 March 2010|work=[[TV.com]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) were framed for murder by a local drug-dealer called Jimmy, the Maguires initially decide to remain aloof from the situation, as it was \"not their fight\". But Jimmy's increasing cockiness revealed in Shane a sense of justice, when he began to openly speak against Jimmy's aggressive antics before taking overt action. When Jimmy tried to set the Gallagher home on fire, Shane stepped in, as he knew Jimmy was afraid to cross the Maguires. The last straw for Shane was when Jimmy promised to harm the family, including Liam. When Paddy elected to remain uninvolved, Shane and Jamie decided to take the law into their own hands despite their father's wishes, and rounded up members of Jimmy's gang, and brutally interrogated them as to Jimmy's whereabouts. Paddy later showed his face, and endorsed his son's proactiveness. Shane and Kelly have also developed a parental bond with Liam to the point where Liam even calls them mum and dad (albeit in jest) as they put him to bed.\n\nIn Series 8 Shane attempts to take over the Maguire's business while Mimi is in hospital after suffering a heart attack. Jamie however feels that Shane is not up to the responsibility, and when he sees that Shane has been conned out of a drug deal, Jamie takes control by making Shane believe a gangster tried to have him killed. Jamie then encourages to shoot the gangster dead, not knowing that it was in fact Jamie who arranged for Shane to be left for dead until afterwards. A feud builds between the two throughout the first half of series 8.\n\n===Micky Maguire===\n{{main|Mickey Maguire (Shameless)}}\n*'''Played by:''' [[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]] (Series 4\u20139)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Micky Maguire\n| series         = [[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]\n| portrayer      = [[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

He is erratic and obsessively licks the side of his mouth, which could be a [[tic]] and/or hint of a behavioral disorder. Despite his aggressive, exaggerated personality, he is mentally weak and often runs away at the first sign of trouble. Although his father [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy Maguire]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) often shows him disrespect and is violent towards him, Paddy still loves his son. Micky is the most idealistic of his family, and the most loyal to his parents. In spite of Paddy's lack of faith in him, Micky was the one who tracked down Paddy after he was shot and left for dead. Micky appeared in 84 episodes in total.\n\nWhen Micky initiates a brief and casual affair with [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) and falls in love with him, Micky exhibits the fact that he is an eager suitor when he follows Ian around and is very emotionally demanding. Unlike Ian, none of Micky's family are aware of his homosexuality, despite several occasions when Micky has come close to [[coming out]] to them, or has daydreams about revealing his homosexuality to his family. In his early appearances, Micky has a dog, Nelson, whom he has been close to for years. Ian is disgusted to learn just how close they had become at one time, and declines to continue a relationship with Micky. By this time Micky is in love with him and wants everyone to know. When Micky is about to tell his family, Ian bursts into the room and tells them about what had happened with Micky and Nelson. Paddy immediately has Nelson put down, deeply upsetting Micky.\n\nThe early episodes of the sixth series show Micky attending college to study film. When he reveals to his parents that he wants to pursue further education, Paddy and [[#Mimi Maguire|Mimi]] ([[Tina Malone]]) ridicule him. Later on in the series, Mimi accepts the fact that Micky is going to college and supports her son in his educational endeavours. Unfortunately, Micky struggles with the course and is distracted by an erotic story his professor accidentally slips in with his coursework. Micky decides that his true talents are in [[erotic literature|erotic writing]] and gives up his place in the class for his mother, Mimi, who loves film and has always wanted to go to college.\n\nIn the Series 7, Micky continues to build a friendship with Ian, with whom he shares a house. This series has proved that Micky has a sensitive side, as explained through his dialogue with Ian when Ian became involved with [[#Maxine Donnelly|Maxine Donnelly]] ([[Joanna Higson]]). Micky tried to warn Ian that Maxine fancied him, not realising that Ian felt the same way about Maxine. Ian had sex with Micky to get Maxine off his mind, but this didn't help, and he and Maxine had sex, which Micky witnessed. Micky was devastated when Ian insisted he cared for Maxine and wanted to be with her. Micky told Ian that he'd felt like a freak before he'd had Ian to look up to, and now Ian had taken that away. Relations between Micky and the new couple remained strained, but eventually Micky decided to stop letting the relationship bother him. He told Maxine that all he wanted was that when she finally realises she cannot be happy with a gay man, that she let Ian down gently.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tv.com/shameless-uk/season-7--episode-14/episode/1340428/summary.html|title=Mickey feels very lonely without Ian|last=Abbott|first=Paul|date=27 April 2010|work=[[TV.com]]}}</ref> Mickey leaves the show during Series 9 after helping a young lady give birth to a baby.

Mandy is the daughter of [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) and [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]), the most feared of the local criminals. She is generally more law-abiding than the rest of her family, but is fiercely loyal to them and can often have a violent and abusive streak.

However her father Paddy continues to supply her with financial support. She begins an open, long-term relationship with Lip while he is away at university, but finishes with him in series 5 after Lip's secret university girlfriend shows her face, she spends the whole series being rejected by every man she's attracted to until she goes on a blind date with a young man named Dex whom she gives him an E and sleeps with him, until she realizes she might have killed him so she and [[Karen Maguire]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]) try to dispose of the body, and spend the episode horrified with their actions, until Mandy decides to turn herself in without telling them who supplied her the drugs and who assisted her to dispose the body, she then learns Dex wasn't really dead but just passed out from the drugs, Mandy decides to come clean to him only for him to reject her.\n\nIn Series 6, Mandy has recently fallen for [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), an accountant and the captain of a local football team. Mandy's brother, Jamie, even struck up a friendship with Joe, until he discovered that Mandy had been [[domestic violence|physically abused]] by him, which led to Jamie savagely assaulting Joe, and sending him into a temporary coma. Despite suffering at Joe's hands, Mandy still retains feelings for him, and resented Jamie's intervention, Danny (Ian's new roommate) gives her a word of advice after he tells her he loves her, which makes her reconsider and then [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]) brings up Katie eventually finding out which makes her decide to break it off with him only for Joe to blackmail her into staying with him, Joe's recovery, Mandy has decided to give him another chance, much to the chagrin of the rest of the Maguires, only for them to make supplemental threats to him, Jamie (cutting his head off), Paddy (shooting him), Shane and Micky (pissing on grapes), [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly]] ([[Sally Carman]]) (injecting him) and Karen (threatening to tell them that he abusing Mandy (when he isn't), if Joe threatens to tell Jamie of their affair).\n\nIn the final episode of Series 6, Mandy was kidnapped by Maureen, an emotionally unstable woman who lost her daughter to heroin and blames Paddy for her death.

As Maureen disappeared to put the kettle on, Mandy followed to see what she was doing, and to her horror, found a broken gas pipe which Maureen had sabotaged. Maureen then returned to the kitchen with matches. Mandy desperately began fighting to get the matches from Maureen just as Paddy and Mickey turned up outside to save her, however they could not gain access into the house. Inside the house, Mandy had fought her way into the hallway and ran towards the door. Just as Micky pressed the doorbell, creating a spark, Maureen lit a match. The gas then ignited, causing the house to explode, killing both Maureen and Mandy and throwing Micky across the street. The episode then cut to Kelly, reading a book to little Katie whilst trying to hold back the tears. Meanwhile, at The Jockey, Mandy's funeral reception was taking place. Micky, who survived the explosion, admitted that he felt responsible for Mandy's death, Karen also felt guilt as she kicked her out of her home, hours before her death and slept with Joe.

She is initially believed to be the daughter of Lip's half-brother [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]), who is secretly gay and Mandy pretended to be his girlfriend while having a sexual relationship with Lip.\n\nKatie is born after a heavily pregnant Mandy is knocked over during a robbery at the local shop. Mandy's protective parents, [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy]] ([[Sean Gilder]]) and [[Mimi Maguire|Mimi]] ([[Tina Malone]]), forbid the Gallaghers from having anything to do with Katie, with the Maguires intent on raising the baby. However, Mandy decides to begin a serious relationship with Lip in order for Katie to have both her parents in her life, so she moves in with the Gallaghers, to the disappointment of Paddy and Mimi. Mandy later reveals that she named Katie after Mimi, with her first name actually being Katherine. Lip eventually moves to Nottingham in order to go to university, leaving Mandy and Katie with the other Gallaghers. After Lip's father, [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]] ([[David Threlfall]]), leaves ecstasy pills lying around, Mandy is terrified that Katie has swallowed some, however this turns out to be a false alarm.\n\nIn Series 6, Mandy later begins a relationship with [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), who begins to [[Domestic violence|mentally abuse Mandy before starting to beat her]]. When this is revealed, Mandy's older brother [[Jamie Maguire]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]) brutally attacks Joe, with Mimi confessing to the attack in order for Jamie to remain out of prison. Frank and Jamie's wife, [[Karen Maguire|Karen]] ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]), desperately try and make Mandy see that what Joe is doing is wrong, with Mandy agreeing to end the relationship for Katie's sake. Unbeknownst to Mandy, but Karen has begun an affair with Joe. After Paddy is kidnapped and forced to take heroin by a woman named Maureen, she is still intent on revenge for Paddy getting her daughter hooked on drugs which eventually led to her death. Maureen contacts Mandy to come over to her house, where Mandy realizes who Maureen is and a physical scuffle ensues. Maureen then causes an explosion just as Paddy and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Mickey Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) arrive, instantly killing Mandy and Maureen. Katie is seen attending Mandy's funeral in Paddy and Mimi's care.\n\nIn Series 7, Mimi decides to take Katie to Nottingham so that Lip can look after her and help her through the grief of losing Mandy at such a young age. \nKatie is not seen or mentioned again until the eleventh and final series, where Frank is seen pulling faces at a young girl on the bus. The girl then leaves the bus and straight into the arms of Lip, revealing that she was Katie. Katie, now 9 years old, is excited to see Frank, after being informed by Lip that he had been captured by the [[Taliban]]. She instantly gets on well with her aunt, [[#Stella Gallagher|Stella Gallagher]] (Nikita Brownlee), who is three years her junior. Due to lacking a mother figure in her life since Mandy's death, Katie dresses like a boy and always has her hair tied back, which confuses Mimi, who attempts to persuade Katie to wear dresses. Lip and Frank both tell Katie that she does not need to do anything that makes her feel uncomfortable, so she stops wearing dresses. Katie flees when Lip is beaten up in an alleyway, and shortly after this, Lip and Katie leave Chatsworth again to continue their lives as before.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Donny Maguire===\n*'''Played by:''' [[Warren Brown (actor)|Warren Brown]] (Series 1\u20132)/Steve Bell (Series 3)/Clyve Bonelle (Series 3)\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Donny Maguire\n| series         = Shameless\n| portrayer      = Warren Brown (Series 1\u20132)<br>Steve Bell (Series 3)<br>Clyve Bonelle (Series 3)\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

He is portrayed as being more thuggish than the rest of his brothers, quite often seen using violence against other people, including electrocution, attempted murder and hands on combat. He appeared in the show on a recurring basis throughout the first three series, whenever his family had problems to deal with on the Chatsworth Estate. He is first seen chasing [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) after being told that he has assaulted his sister [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]] ([[Samantha Siddall]]). Mandy later admits to lying, and Donny stops harassing Ian. He is next seen when he is ordered to collect Ian for his parents as he has \"impregnated\" Mandy. He attends their engagement party at The Jockey, where he gets into a fight with [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]] ([[Jody Latham]]), [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]), [[#Marty Fisher|Marty Fisher]] ([[Jack Deam]]) and other locals. In series 3, he assists Paddy in tracking down and torturing a deaf teenage boy suspected of robbing the shop, which led to Mandy getting hurt. He later kicks him off a multi-story car park when he uses a paint can to insult the Maguire boys. He is last seen hunting down [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) after Mimi and his brother [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]) think Carl has grassed them up to the police. When his family moved to Chatsworth, Donny was not present and has not been seen since, with no explanation to his whereabouts.

In his only appearance on the show, he bundles [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) into a car and attends Ian and his sister [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]]'s ([[Samantha Siddall]]) engagement party, where he is involved in a pub brawl.

Nigel and Delia are her half-brother and sister. She becomes estranged from both parents throughout the series. She is [[#Lip Gallagher|Lip Gallagher]]'s ([[Jody Latham]]) love interest in series 1, soon his father Frank Gallagher moves in with her & her mother, and at first she\u2019s appalled by him and the idea of living with him, to the point she seduces him into sleeping with her, in the hopes Shiela catches him and kicks him out under the assumption that Frank sexually assaulted her underage daughter, however after the fallout between Frank & Lip, and seeing Shiela show genuine concern for Frank can\u2019t bring herself to tell her mother the truth, She then leaves to stay with her grandmother. In Season 2 she returns to Chatsworth, drops out of school to work at the Jockey where she lies about her sexuality to guarantee herself a position and moves out entirely from Shiela\u2019s house to live at The Jockey. She is the only other character aside from Frank to appear in every series. Karen appeared in 129 episodes in total.\n\nKaren becomes considerably more mature in series 4, at the end of which she marries the recently freed [[Jamie Maguire]] ([[Aaron McCusker]]), with whom she co-runs the pub. Season 5 sees her becoming increasingly, albeit grudgingly, more integrated with the Maguire family and their somewhat violent way of life. Karen suffers a [[miscarriage]] early in season 6 and very soon after, her changing behavior and the loss of their child starts creating a large rift in their marriage. As she and Jamie argue over shared ownership of The Jockey and other problems, Karen finds herself drawn to her sister-in-law, [[#Mandy Maguire|Mandy]]'s ([[Samantha Siddall]]), abusive boyfriend [[#Joe Pritchard|Joe Pritchard]] ([[Ben Batt]]), and has sex with him shortly after Jamie moves out. Joe becomes increasingly controlling, threatening to reveal their affair, and makes a failed attempt to buy out Jamie's portion of The Jockey. During this, the Maguires find out Joe has been [[Domestic violence|physically abusing]] Mandy, and Jamie is almost sent back to prison after brutally beating him. When Jamie moves back in with Karen, she is able to end her affair with Joe by threatening him that if she claims to the Maguires that he's once again been beating Mandy, they will murder him. The last episode of series 6 reveals Karen to be once again pregnant; however she is unsure whether the father is Jamie or Joe, who laughs and tells her \"You belong to me now.\"\n\nIn the first episode of series 7, Karen is two weeks overdue in her pregnancy, and can't wait to have the birth over and done with. When [[Mimi Maguire]] ([[Tina Malone]]) tells her that sex several times a day could make her waters break quicker, Karen tells that \"they've\" been \"at it\" all the time, and flashbacks show that she's been having sex with both Jamie and Joe, implying that her brief affair with Joe from series 6 has continued, despite Karen's often cold attitude towards him. In the same episode, Karen goes into labour after having a brief confrontation with Joe in the empty bar of The Jockey (Everybody else were celebrating at Frank's birthday party). After taunting her, Joe decided to help a scared Karen deliver what could be his son, who would be christened Connor Joseph Maguire. Despite playing happy families with \"proud dad\" Jamie, Joe tells that she's kidding herself into thinking that she wants Jamie, when she really only wants Joe, branding Jamie \"boring\". Karen would then engage in risky sex in the Maguires' living room with Joe, nearly being caught out by [[#Paddy Maguire|Paddy Maguire]] ([[Sean Gilder]]). Afterwards, Joe would declare that he loves her and they should be a family. Along with Karen's out of control behavior with Joe, she starts to act strange and starts losing Connor on a regular basis. For example, she hides her baby in a dresser drawer. On the third episode of the 7th series Karen starts to act in a strange manner by becoming obsessed with exercising and thinking that she can start her own fitness business, bouncing on a trampoline outside, going out late at night to buy groceries and putting baby Connor in a wardrobe. Karen's erratic behaviour deteriorates further as she starts ripping wall paper off the walls and playing music at high volume, even attempting suicide by falling from a window at one point. She is saved from her suicide attempt by a quick-thinking Paddy, who shows his sensitive side when he expresses deep care and sympathy for her. Finally Karen has to be restrained by medics and is placed in a psychiatric unit. Karen is diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. When she returns home, she struggles to repair her marriage to Jamie, who is unable to have sex with her because the image of Karen during her breakdown is deeply ingrained in his mind. Jamie, unknown to Karen, begins having sex with other women for money, and to get away from her. Jamie does not derive any pleasure from having sex with other women and is motivated by the financial gain. Eventually he stops prostituting himself when Paddy discovers what Jamie has been up to and tries to be happy with Karen.\n\nAs much as Karen is repulsed by the sordid nature of her affair with Joe, she is also drawn to it, and is disappointed when Joe briefly stops seeing her. When he begins going to anger management meetings, Karen repeatedly tries to taunt him, throwing cereal around his shop and offering to resume their fling, but he refuses. Karen, pretending to be Joe's wife, drops into one of his meetings and listens to him as he talks about his attempts to control himself and how much he cares about her and their son.\n\nThe uneasy distance between Joe and Karen continues until Joe's father dies. Joe wants to start a new life with Karen and Connor and pushes Karen repeatedly to take Connor and leave Jamie. She also stops taking her medication, with her more erratic personality being closer to Joe than to Jamie. Joe eventually takes matters into his own hands, telling Jamie that he's sleeping with his wife, and he wants her and \"their\" son. Feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what she wants, she leaves with Joe, warning him that Jamie will kill them. In retaliation, Jamie digs up Joe's dead father, and confronts them outside the store, telling Karen it is her last chance to come home with him, and leaving the body at the side of the building. She stays with Joe, but soon begins to question her choice as she starts taking her bipolar meds again. After some close scrapes, Joe and Karen manage to sneak Connor away from Jamie, and Joe announces they're leaving the Chatsworth estate, although Karen is becoming increasingly unsettled at both the idea of a future with Joe and the feeling that Joe's decided what will happen without giving her a choice. She confides her worries to Ian Gallagher, who sneaks into the trunk of the car right before they leave the estate, worried for Karen and Connor. As Karen's doubts rattle Joe, she is subjected to verbal and finally physical abuse. When Karen attempts to call Jamie, telling Joe this was all a mistake and she had to go home and fix things, Joe begins strangling her. Ian gets out of the trunk, and repeatedly hits Joe in the back of the head while in an act of [[self defense]] until he releases her and falls to the ground. Telling Karen to take Connor back and do whatever it takes to make it work with Jamie, he drags Joe's body to the trunk and then drives the car away.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s18/casualty/news/a169160/ex-casualty-actress-joins-shameless.html|title=Change to Shameless Finale|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=14 May 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>\n\nIn Series 8 Karen returns to speak to Jamie, and they begin going to marital counseling, during which Karen admits that she made a mistake, and tells Jamie that Joe is dead, although not how he died. After several rough sessions in which he makes it clear that he finds it difficult to forgive her, Jamie tells her that he wants her and Connor back home, and that they will have to see if it can work out. At the beginning of her voiceover for episode four, he lets her out of the cab, and she walks through the Chatsworth estate, with jeers of \"slag\" and \"slapper\" being yelled by others, and egg thrown at her. She meets back up with Jamie at the Jockey, where he gives everyone 30 seconds for people to say whatever they like to her, before they accept that she's his wife and he won't allow it to continue. He then headbutts one man who passed the allotted time before walking out of the room, leaving Karen standing alone. Still feeling like an outcast and wanting badly to make her marriage work again, it's only after she runs into Frank at the hospital that she realizes she's tired of being judged for her past mistakes.\n\nJamie used his power of attorney while Karen was ill to put The Jockey solely in his name, and at first he is very cold towards her after her return, ignoring her suggestions and making it clear that the pub was no longer hers, but his and run with Mimi, leaving Karen feeling very left out. She explains to him that she knows she has to earn his trust back, and just wants him to give her a chance. After Jamie is overwhelmed by the chaos of trying to organize [[#Libby Croker|Libby Croker]]'s ([[Pauline McLynn]]) wedding party, he asks Karen to help them, finally acknowledging that he does need her, and does appreciate her. Later, he takes her back into their bed and things begin to return to normal for the couple.\n\nKaren briefly tries to run a clown business before several male customers attempt to assault her, during which she shoots one in the thigh with one of the Maguire's stolen guns. In a later episode, we see her standing in front of The Jockey, scowling up at the \"Jamie Maguire, proprietor\" sign. After winning a card game from Jamie, she demands that he return the pub to her. The couple is then later seen standing in front of the pub looking at two signs, one of which says \"under new management,\" and the other saying \"Jamie and Karen Maguire, proprietors.\"\n\nIn series 9 Karen has returned to her former, stable self. She invites half the estate to stay with her when they're evicted, and also gets into a fight with [[#Gloria Meak|Gloria Meak]] ([[Angeline Ball]]), which is quickly settled. Karen is unaware for some time that Jamie has begun an affair with Gloria, a fact that is hidden from her even when Jamie is trapped with others underground, although Gloria's brother [[#Dominic Meak|Dominic]] ([[Stephen Lord]]) does find out at this time. Karen later realizes Jamie is possibly having an affair, and asks for the help of Gloria and others to find out who it is, worried that perhaps it is her condition causing paranoia. At the end of the episode, she sees Jamie and Gloria together, and realizes who he was having an affair with all along.\n\nSeveral episodes later Karen and Connor's lives appear to be in danger, with Jamie receiving threatening phone calls and pictures of his family. Karen is attacked in the park while walking Connor. He attempts to go after enemies while trying to protect his wife and child, and later agrees to a ransom of 200,000 after Karen is kidnapped. After several car changes, he finds Karen as she walks out into the warehouse, revealing to him that she planned the whole thing, and that she knows about his affair. She explains that now she knows he does love her and she loves him, but that the secrets are going to stop. She's keeping the 200,000, and will now control the finances of his business, keeping Jamie in check. At the end of the episode, she tells him that if something happens to her, there is an unknown friend who knows everything about Jamie.\n\n===Kelly Maguire===\n\n*'''Played by:''' [[Sally Carman]] (Series 2, 3, 4, 5\u201311)\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Kelly Maguire\n| series         = Shameless\n| creator        = [[Paul Abbott]]\n| introducer     = [[George S.

Paddy wanted to hurt Shane since he felt Shane had not been there for him. Paddy and Kelly kept their encounter a secret, but during a mass wedding scam, Shane proposed to Kelly. Kelly turned him down several times, even ending their relationship, because she could not marry him while living a lie. Shane told her he would forgive her sleeping with anyone, at which point she and a guilty Paddy made eye contact. Shane was devastated to learn the truth, but forgave Kelly, and they married in a civil ceremony at the Jockey.\n\nShane was deeply upset when he learned he was sterile. Jamie, Paddy and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]) offered to be Kelly's sperm donors, but she refused, saying she'd already had Paddy in her once and wasn't going to do that ever again. As they would be unable to adopt a child, [[#Liam Gallagher|Liam Gallagher]] ([[Johnny Bennett]]) convinced them to try to be parents to Shane's niece Katie. This plan was dashed when Katie's father Lip decided to take a more active role in her life. Kelly and Shane decided to give up on their plans and just be honorary parental figures for Liam, whom she has grown quite fond of.\n\nKelly was revealed in the thirteenth episode of series 7 to have a fifteen-year-old half-sister named Tonya, whose care she was briefly responsible for. Kelly and Tonya were both fathered by a man named Homer. It was implied that he abused them both sexually. Tonya had a baby-boy named Enrico, who was in foster-care. Micky, who pretended to be Shane during a visit from a social worker during his brother's absence, found out from Tonya that Enrico was actually born out of incest with her father, who raped her. She begged him not to tell Kelly. After finding out that Homer abused them both, Micky injected tranquilizer into Homer's bloodstream in The Jockey toilets, and dragged him with Shane's help to a slaughter-house to dispose of him, doing his sister-in-law a tremendous favour in the process.\n\nIn Series 8 Kelly falls out of love with Shane and begins seeing [[#Marty Fisher|Marty Fisher]] ([[Jack Deam]]), who later she becomes with pregnant with. Kelly and Shane break up and her and Marty start their lives together. In Series 9 Kelly loses the baby in an accident, leading to a breakdown of constant drinking and drug abuse.

He was a guest character in the first series of ''Shameless'', became a main character in the second series, and left along with Veronica and [[#Kev Ball|Kev Ball]] ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]) in the first episode of the fourth series. Marty was originally something of a burden to the other characters, setting things alight when he got angry, particularly whenever he found Carol with much younger men. At one point he burns Carol's house down when he finds her having sex in the shower with his best friend, as well as burning down the toilets of The Jockey when Veronica attempts to have him sent back to prison after he escaped to attend her wedding; incidents like this have landed him in prison several times. His tourette's syndrome often creates uncomfortable situations for him, causing him to reveal otherwise secret information or offend those who are not used to him by insulting/swearing. However, later in the series [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]] ([[Rebecca Ryan]]) teaches Marty to use other words such as buttermilk and spongecake instead of swearing, and his pyromania seems to calm down when he starts a relationship with Sue Garland ([[Gillian Kearney]]). The two live relatively happily in the Gallagher household for a time, until Marty accompanies Kev and Veronica in a scheme to buy a Romanian baby from an orphanage. Marty escapes back to the Chatsworth with the stolen orphan and suggests to Sue that they raise it as their own. Initially Sue is reluctant but later saves the baby from being sent back by the police. Sue reveals that she is pregnant with Marty's child and the two leave the estate (how they find the money to do this is unclear).\n\nHe returns in Series 8, Episode 17. Marty reveals that him and Sue lived happily for years in Spain with their kids, only for Sue to cheat on him with a rich local and kick him out of the house. Not knowing where else to go, Marty flees back to the Chatsworth and begins squatting in a flat once occupied by heroin addicts, and on the run from the CSA for not paying child maintenance. Presumably, he found his mother Carol (who left to go to Maguluf), as he returns with her urn. Shortly after returning Marty causes tension between [[Shane Maguire|Shane]] ([[Nicky Evans]]) and [[#Kelly Maguire|Kelly Maguire]] ([[Sally Carman]]) by telling Kelly that he loves her.\n\nIn series 9, him and Kelly hit a rough patch when she loses the baby, she leaves him, but returns on discovering he truly loves her.

However, Chesney was using the campaign funds to help an elderly Pakistani woman to take her British Citizenship Test, thus earning Debbie's respect (despite thinking his reasoning for doing so was silly but still admires that he helped someone and didn't ask for anything in return).

Kash then attends the shop in order to speak with his son. In a moment of rage, Chesney knocks his father out cold, and seemed to be prepared to bludgeon him with a baseball bat when the fireworks that were stacked up in the shop's stockroom were ignited, due to the spreading flames of Chesney's insufficiently stamped out cigarette. Chesney flees the store, leaving his unconscious father to die for real from smoke inhalation, a crime for which Chesney should have been arrested and sent to prison.

The act was filmed and spread via photographs over a mobile phone. Chesney and [[Carl Gallagher]] ([[Elliott Tittensor]]) were witnesses to the assault.

Maxine has also become a good friend of [[#Debbie Gallagher|Debbie Gallagher]]'s ([[Rebecca Ryan]]), while simultaneously having a minor fling with Carl. She works as an auxiliary nurse, and frequently accompanies Debbie on nights out and shopping trips, or more accurately, they steal clothes, and often come up with creative tactics of eluding the centre's security staff. Later in the series, she becomes ever more infatuated with Carl. Maxine and Carl become a couple.\n\nIn series 7, Maxine, increasingly disillusioned by Carl's immaturity, secretly aborts her and Carl's unborn baby, but she would later tell Carl, which infuriates him enough to make him end their relationship. She moves in with [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) after her breakup with Carl. She later takes Ian to a party at her parents house under the pretence that Ian is her doctor boyfriend. She tells Ian that her family sees her as a \"fuck-up.\" After witnessing the disparaging remarks from Maxine's father about his daughter, Ian defends her. This leads to an unexpected romance between Ian and Maxine, which in turn leads to a fight and a strained relationship between Ian and Carl as well as Maxine and Carl, Maxine and [[Mickey Maguire (Shameless)|Micky Maguire]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]).\n\nA local tough named Jimmy kills a boy who took advantage of his sister, and he frames Carl and [[#Chesney Karib|Chesney Karib]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]) for the crime, forcing them to flee Chatsworth. Maxine is one of the few people who is concerned about Carl's disappearance. Ian tries to convince her not to get involved, but she persists, and when she confronts Jimmy, his sister hits her in the back of the head with a pool cue. Ian feels ashamed that he did nothing to help her, and he confronts Jimmy in an attempt to tape a confession. Jimmy savagely beats him. Ian's sense of worthlessness leads him to withdraw from everyone and makes him unable to perform with Maxine. As she continues to help clear Carl's name, Ian bitterly accuses her of caring more about Carl than she does him. Maxine helps convince Jimmy's sister to go to the police, but there is little time for celebration as Ian continues to give her as well as Carl the cold shoulder. Maxine tells him that she's leaving him, but not because of Carl. Carl finds Maxine at hospital and admits to her that she was right to abort their child. When she tries to tell him she's steering clear of the Gallagher brothers because of the damage she's done to their relationship, Carl tries to get her to reconsider, telling her he's her mate, but Ian is her soulmate. Ian arrives and he and Maxine share sheepish grins, resuming their relationship.\n\nMaxine's brother [[#Bruce Donnelly|Bruce]] ([[Philip Hill-Pearson]]) shows up in Chatsworth, sporting a black eye and saying their mother has left and that their father, [[#Cameron Donnelly|Cameron]] ([[Joe Duttine]]), hit him and threw him out of the house for being gay. Maxine agrees to let him move in, and goes to confront their father. He tells her that he threw Bruce out for spending all his time smoking dope, and he's stunned to learn Bruce is gay. When Cameron visits Maxine soon afterwards he rubs makeup off Bruce's eye to prove he never hit him. Bruce admits he lied but says Maxine did the same, revealing that Ian was never a doctor, as Maxine had told everyone in the family. Maxine throws Bruce out. In an attempt to try to get closer to her father, she cooks him some dinner and cleans up his home. She tells him that she's always felt like he undermined her and that she'd always been told she had no confidence\u2014even today she had lost a job as head cleaner at the hospital because of lack of confidence. When he shows her little sympathy, she leaves.\n\nMaxine's insecurities about Ian's feelings for men bubble up when he begins going to gay clubs with Bruce and playing against gay football leagues. Maxine begins posing nude for an art class, and recognises the professor as a teacher she had a crush on when she was a teenager. He confesses he also had feelings for her. At first, she appears to be uncomfortable with the realisation that this man found her attractive when she was sixteen years old. She eventually invites him to her home and they get drunk and take cocaine. As they are undressing, Maxine backs out. Unfortunately, the professor has a heart attack and she has to call an ambulance. Maxine desperately tries to explain to Ian. The relationship begins to fall apart, accelerated when Ian holds hostage a man who tried to rob and rape Maxine. When Ian attempts to kill this man with the gun he used to threaten Maxine, she tries to stop him from taking matters further. Maxine notices Ian's attraction to his hostage when the hostage states: You would rather fuck me than kill me.' Maxine catches Ian admitting to the man that he finds him attractive, and she tells Ian that she will never be able to get over his being attracted to other men. Ian leaves Chatsworth.\n\nMaxine did not return for Series 8, with no mention given to her whereabouts. Since the end of Series 7, neither her or her brother Bruce have been seen or mentioned since.

Joe would use this incident to blackmail Karen, who was the first to suspect that Mandy was being [[domestic violence|repeatedly assaulted]] by him, revealing him as a sadistic [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]]. Eventually, Jamie found out about the bruises on Mandy's body, and confronted Joe at The Jockey, and beat him within an inch of his life. Sending Joe into a temporary coma. Mandy and Jamie's mother, [[Mimi Maguire|Mimi]] ([[Tina Malone]]), claimed to be responsible for attacking Joe, and was sentenced to two months imprisonment.

Joe also bought [[#Yvonne Karib|Yvonne Karib]]'s ([[Kelli Hollis]]) \"Kash and Carry\" store after learning that she borrowed money off Paddy, as she was already in enough debt. One of the reasons for Yvonne's quick departure with [[#Stan Waterman|Stan Waterman]] (Warren Donnelly) was that Stan was beaten up by a masked assailant.

Shane declares Jimmy a marked man. The next morning, Chesney is still hiding in the shop when Joe assures him that things are going to turn out okay. Then a flashback is shown that during Shane's interrogation of rival gang-members for Jimmy's whereabouts, Joe had attacked and presumably murdered Jimmy.\n\nJoe's temper flares up as he drives [[#Lillian Tyler|Lillian Tyler]] ([[Alice Barry]]), from his shop. He gets into an argument with Karen over their sex lives since their breakup, but when Karen tries to taunt him into another tryst, he refuses. He decides to go to anger management to rebuild his life. Karen continues to try to make him boil over, but finally she attends one of his meetings and is impressed by the effort he's making to move on.\n\nWhen Joe is having a birthday party in The Jockey, he learns his father has died. In spite of Joe seeing his father as a selfish failure, his death is a system shock, and Joe begins trying to reclaim Karen and Connor, whom he continues to see as their son. Joe and Karen resume their affair, but Karen is afraid to tell Jamie the truth. After his father's funeral, Joe finally tells Jamie the entire truth. Joe and Karen hide out at his shop. Joe sees Jamie waiting outside, and expects a fight, only to be devastated when Jamie shows him his father's corpse, dug up and dumped outside Joe's shop. On seeing the corpse, Joe vomits and Karen screams and falls over. Joe buries his father again, and becomes more determined to take Connor from the Maguires. Joe later implies that he had Paddy killed after Karen expressed concerns over Paddy taking revenge on them. After running away with Karen with baby Connor, and Ian hiding in the boot unknowingly to Joe, Karen tells Joe that she doesn't love him. He goes into a rage, and strangles Karen while demanding her to tell him that she loves him. She is struggling for breath, and [[Ian Gallagher]] ([[Gerard Kearns]]) can hear the action outside. He jumps out of the boot and seemingly kills Joe by hitting him twice in the back of the head with a pipe wrench.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Shameless}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shameless Characters, List Of}}\n[[Category:Lists of British television series characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2004]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shameless_(British_TV_series)_characters"}

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://frightfind.com/stranger-things-netflix-homage/ |title=Stranger Things is an Homage to the Greats |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |website=FrightFind |date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> crafting it in the realm of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/stranger-things-and-the-get-down-reviews |title=On Television: \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down\" |first=Emily |last=Nassbaum |date=August 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: [[Stephen King]] novels; films produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven]],<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/duffer-brothers-talk-stranger-things-916180 |title=The Duffer Brothers Talk 'Stranger Things' Influences, 'It' Dreams and Netflix Phase 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"screenertv\">{{cite web |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/stranger-things-stephen-king-steven-spielberg-cinematic-influences/ |title=The cinematic influences behind Netflix's 'Stranger Things' |date=July 18, 2016 |work=ScreenerTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/13/how-netflixs-stranger-things-channels-steven-spielberg-john-carpenter-and-stephen-king/ |title=How Netflix's ''Stranger Things'' Channels Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King |first=Sarene |last=Leeds |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Guillermo del Toro]];<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"screenertv\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/stranger-things-all-the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-references-in-p/stand-by-me/ |title=Stranger Things: all the hidden (and not-so-hidden) movie, TV and book references |website=The Telegraph |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Japanese [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> and several [[video game]]s including ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, Stranger Things' Upside Down was totally inspired by Silent Hill |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-stranger-things-upside-down-was-totally-inspired-by-silent-hill/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=How Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us Influenced Stranger Things |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/how-silent-hill-dark-souls-and-the-last-of-us-influenced-stranger-things |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including ''[[Beyond the Black Rainbow]]'' and ''[[D.A.R.Y.L.]]'', discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.<ref name=\"hwr montauk\" /> Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-21-80s-relics-weve-spotted-so-far-photos/ |title=''Stranger Things'': 21 '80s Relics We've Spotted So Far |first=Meriah |last=Doty |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html |title=A ''Stranger Things'' Glossary: Every Major Film Reference in the Show, From A\u2013Z |last=Tobias |first=Scott |website=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomhowdy.com/filmtv/stranger-things-influences/ |title=Strange Influences: Our Favorite Movie References From ''Stranger Things'' |first=Tyree |last=Kimber |website=Boomhowdy.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18481-netflix-stranger-things-80s-pop-culture-references-spielberg |title=Every '80s Pop Culture References in ''Stranger Things'' |first=Sean |last=Hutchinson |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach.

Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization.<ref name=\"nytimes interview\" /> Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot lines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough unresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.<ref name=\"variety maybes2\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-season-two-netflix-1201824880/ |title='Stranger Things' EPs on Season 2: 'We Could Explore It If Netflix Wanted To' |first=Debra |last=Brinbaum |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nRegarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb.<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> Joyce was fashioned after [[Richard Dreyfuss]]' character Roy Neary in ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', as she appears \"absolutely bonkers\" to everyone else as she tries to find Will.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:David Harbour by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Duffer Brothers cast [[David Harbour]] as Chief Hopper believing this was his opportunity to portray a lead character.]]\nIn June 2015, it was announced that [[Winona Ryder]] and [[David Harbour]] had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.<ref name=\"June2015TVL\" /> The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\".

violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s [[Amblin Entertainment]] films drove the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Addition of PG-13 rating|PG-13 movie rating]]. It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season.<ref name=\"empire\" /> The brothers had wanted to avoid any [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with [[practical effect]]s, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g13305063/stranger-things-trivia/?slide=24 |title=50 Things You Didn't Know About 'Stranger Things' |date=November 6, 2017 |work=Harper's BAZAAR |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/tv/2016/07/20/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-6/ |title='Stranger Things': How the Duffer Brothers created their monster |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref> However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys.

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.
