Driving his wife and friends, Jacob unintentionally runs a red light, causing a collision; his best friend Tom is killed. It is later revealed that Jacob blew a .10 [[Blood alcohol content|BAC]] after the accident. Advised to take a [[plea deal]], Jacob is sentenced to 16 months at the [[California Institution for Men]] in [[Chino, California|Chino]].\n\nShocked by the brutality of prison life, Jacob heeds his lawyer's advice to stand his ground. He attacks an African-American inmate when provoked, drawing the attention of Bottles (Jeffrey Donovan), the \u201cshot caller\u201d for a violent [[white supremacist]] gang. In return for protection and entry into the gang, Jacob is forced to smuggle [[heroin]] and kill a \"snitch\" within the gang.\n\nNicknamed \u201cMoney\u201d, Harlon rises in rank and acquires gang-related tattoos. His personality and appearance change dramatically, hardened by prison. During a riot, Harlon stabs another inmate to save the life of Herman G\u00f3mez, head of the [[Sure\u00f1os]], but is caught on camera. Sentenced to nine more years, Harlon ceases all contact with his wife and son; Katherine eventually files for divorce.\n\nHarlon is transferred to [[California State Prison, Corcoran|Corcoran State Prison]] under maximum-security. Like other \"heavy-hitters\", he is only allowed one hour outdoors per day, spent in a steel cage. Harlon is introduced to Jerry \"the Beast\" Manning (Holt McCallany), who manages the gang\u2019s activity from inside prison. Impressed with Harlon's dedication, Beast promotes him to his second-in-command.\n\nSet to be released after serving over seven years, Harlon is ordered by Beast to orchestrate a weapons deal with the Sure\u00f1os; when Harlon hesitates, knowing he will be on parole, Beast informs him that membership in the gang does not end when leaving prison, it lasts for life. When Harlon hesitates again Beast threatens his family, causing Harlon to agree to obey the order. Harlon sends a letter to his son, and is released from prison. He is greeted by Frank \"Shotgun\" (Jon Bernthal) and other gang members, including Howie (Emory Cohen), a young war veteran with no criminal record. Escaping an attempt on his life, Harlon orders Howie to answer to no one but him.\n\nHarlon\u2019s [[probation officer]] Ed Kutcher, part of a task force investigating the gang, is tipped off about the weapons deal and places Harlon under surveillance. As Harlon prepares to sell a cache of weapons discovered by Howie while serving in [[Afghanistan]], Howie reveals that he does not want to become a gang member. Harlon takes this into consideration, remembering how he joined the gang. Harlon also discovers Shotgun is Kutcher\u2019s [[informant]]. Harlon reaches out to Katherine, transferring his finances to her. Against Harlon\u2019s wishes, Katherine brings Joshua to meet him. Harlon, realizing he has missed several years of his son's life, is devastated but holds his emotions. Joshua, demanding answers, is unable to understand his father's gang life. Harlon then closes the door between them.\n\nOn the day of the deal, Harlon escapes his surveillance and goes to Shotgun's house where he stabs him multiple times, killing him. Kutcher finds Shotgun's body and retrieves his cellphone. After loading up the weapons and driving to meet the Sure\u00f1os, Harlon texts their coordinates to Shotgun's cellphone. Deducing that Shotgun hid more of the weapons to sell himself, Harlon warns Howie to leave the criminal life and forces him out of the vehicle. As the deal closes, the police, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], and [[SWAT]] \u2013 alerted by Harlon's text \u2013 surround the gangs; only Howie escapes.\n\nFully [[Validation (gang membership)|validated]] as a gang member, Harlon is sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole (due in part to California\u2019s three strikes law<ref>{{cite web|website=courts.ca.gov|title=20142|url=https://www.courts.ca.gov/20142.htm}}</ref>). He turns down Kutcher's offer to testify against Beast in exchange for a full pardon. Harlon is returned to Corcoran, where Roberts, a corrupt guard, brings him to Beast. Realizing Harlon was responsible for the raid, Beast orders him back to his cell, to live out his sentence with the guilt that his family will be killed for his actions. Having smuggled in a handcuff key and a razor blade, Harlon frees himself and overpowers Roberts. Beast realizes that Harlon tipped off the cops, knowing he would be sent back to Corcoran, and giving him the chance to get at Beast. Beast complements Harlon saying \"well played\", as they prepare to fight. Harlon unlocks Beast's cage, and a brutal fight ensues leaving Beast mortally wounded. Harlon glares down at him   whispering the words \"Nobody's touching my family\". \n\nA blood-soaked Harlon orders Roberts to claim that he acted in self-defense, and assumes Beast's place atop the gang hierarchy. With his family\u2019s safety secured, Harlon accepts his life sentence, and notifies Kutcher about the remaining weapons. He receives a letter from Joshua, explaining that he and Katherine are moving on, and he has forgiven his father. Touched, Harlon realizes that sacrificing his own freedom to kill Beast was the only way he could truly protect his family.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Jacob

The film stars [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]], [[Omari Hardwick]], [[Lake Bell]], [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Emory Cohen]], [[Jeffrey Donovan]], and [[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones,]] with [[Benjamin Bratt]], and [[Holt McCallany]].\n\nIt premiered at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] on June 16, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shootonline.com/news/la-film-fests-closing-night-film-matt-spicers-ingrid-goes-west|title=LA Film Fest's Closing Night Film: Matt Spicer's 'Ingrid Goes West'|website=SHOOTonline.com |access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> The film was released on July 20, 2017, through [[DirecTV Cinema]] and theatrically on August 18, 2017, by [[Saban Capital Group|Saban Films]].<ref>{{cite web|title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Game of Thrones' Star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Transforms For New Movie 'Shot Caller'|website=etonline.com|url=http://www.etonline.com/media/video/exclusive_game_of_thrones_star_nikolaj_coster_waldau_transforms_for_new_movie_shot_caller-217130/ |accessdate=2017-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJacob Harlon (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is a successful [[stockbroker]] living with his wife Katherine (Lake Bell) and son Joshua in [[California]]. Driving his wife and friends, Jacob unintentionally runs a red light, causing a collision; his best friend Tom is killed. It is later revealed that Jacob blew a .10 [[Blood alcohol content|BAC]] after the accident. Advised to take a [[plea deal]], Jacob is sentenced to 16 months at the [[California Institution for Men]] in [[Chino, California|Chino]].\n\nShocked by the brutality of prison life, Jacob heeds his lawyer's advice to stand his ground. He attacks an African-American inmate when provoked, drawing the attention of Bottles (Jeffrey Donovan), the \u201cshot caller\u201d for a violent [[white supremacist]] gang. In return for protection and entry into the gang, Jacob is forced to smuggle [[heroin]] and kill a \"snitch\" within the gang.\n\nNicknamed \u201cMoney\u201d, Harlon rises in rank and acquires gang-related tattoos. His personality and appearance change dramatically, hardened by prison. During a riot, Harlon stabs another inmate to save the life of Herman G\u00f3mez, head of the [[Sure\u00f1os]], but is caught on camera. Sentenced to nine more years, Harlon ceases all contact with his wife and son; Katherine eventually files for divorce.\n\nHarlon is transferred to [[California State Prison, Corcoran|Corcoran State Prison]] under maximum-security. Like other \"heavy-hitters\", he is only allowed one hour outdoors per day, spent in a steel cage. Harlon is introduced to Jerry \"the Beast\" Manning (Holt McCallany), who manages the gang\u2019s activity from inside prison. Impressed with Harlon's dedication, Beast promotes him to his second-in-command.\n\nSet to be released after serving over seven years, Harlon is ordered by Beast to orchestrate a weapons deal with the Sure\u00f1os; when Harlon hesitates, knowing he will be on parole, Beast informs him that membership in the gang does not end when leaving prison, it lasts for life. When Harlon hesitates again Beast threatens his family, causing Harlon to agree to obey the order. Harlon sends a letter to his son, and is released from prison. He is greeted by Frank \"Shotgun\" (Jon Bernthal) and other gang members, including Howie (Emory Cohen), a young war veteran with no criminal record. Escaping an attempt on his life, Harlon orders Howie to answer to no one but him.\n\nHarlon\u2019s [[probation officer]] Ed Kutcher, part of a task force investigating the gang, is tipped off about the weapons deal and places Harlon under surveillance. As Harlon prepares to sell a cache of weapons discovered by Howie while serving in [[Afghanistan]], Howie reveals that he does not want to become a gang member. Harlon takes this into consideration, remembering how he joined the gang. Harlon also discovers Shotgun is Kutcher\u2019s [[informant]]. Harlon reaches out to Katherine, transferring his finances to her. Against Harlon\u2019s wishes, Katherine brings Joshua to meet him. Harlon, realizing he has missed several years of his son's life, is devastated but holds his emotions. Joshua, demanding answers, is unable to understand his father's gang life. Harlon then closes the door between them.\n\nOn the day of the deal, Harlon escapes his surveillance and goes to Shotgun's house where he stabs him multiple times, killing him. Kutcher finds Shotgun's body and retrieves his cellphone. After loading up the weapons and driving to meet the Sure\u00f1os, Harlon texts their coordinates to Shotgun's cellphone. Deducing that Shotgun hid more of the weapons to sell himself, Harlon warns Howie to leave the criminal life and forces him out of the vehicle. As the deal closes, the police, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], and [[SWAT]] \u2013 alerted by Harlon's text \u2013 surround the gangs; only Howie escapes.\n\nFully [[Validation (gang membership)|validated]] as a gang member, Harlon is sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole (due in part to California\u2019s three strikes law<ref>{{cite web|website=courts.ca.gov|title=20142|url=https://www.courts.ca.gov/20142.htm}}</ref>). He turns down Kutcher's offer to testify against Beast in exchange for a full pardon. Harlon is returned to Corcoran, where Roberts, a corrupt guard, brings him to Beast. Realizing Harlon was responsible for the raid, Beast orders him back to his cell, to live out his sentence with the guilt that his family will be killed for his actions. Having smuggled in a handcuff key and a razor blade, Harlon frees himself and overpowers Roberts. Beast realizes that Harlon tipped off the cops, knowing he would be sent back to Corcoran, and giving him the chance to get at Beast. Beast complements Harlon saying \"well played\", as they prepare to fight. Harlon unlocks Beast's cage, and a brutal fight ensues leaving Beast mortally wounded. Harlon glares down at him   whispering the words \"Nobody's touching my family\". \n\nA blood-soaked Harlon orders Roberts to claim that he acted in self-defense, and assumes Beast's place atop the gang hierarchy. With his family\u2019s safety secured, Harlon accepts his life sentence, and notifies Kutcher about the remaining weapons. He receives a letter from Joshua, explaining that he and Katherine are moving on, and he has forgiven his father. Touched, Harlon realizes that sacrificing his own freedom to kill Beast was the only way he could truly protect his family.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Jacob

This brings the Line Islands into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours. Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres.\n\nKiribati gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], becoming  a [[sovereign state]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted in 1979 at independence. It is the [[Gilbertese]] rendition of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the English pronunciation of the name of the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named in 1820 by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] as \u00ab \u00eeles Gilbert \u00bb, in English the [[Gilbert Islands]], after the British [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He and captain [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer)|John Marshall]] sighted some of the islands in 1788, while crossing the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yeu4MnVVss0C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=outer+passage+route+port+jackson+canton#v=onepage|title=Cinderellas of the Empire: Towards a History of Kiribati and Tuvalu|first=Barrie|last=Macdonald|date=6 December 2001|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820203358|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate = 2009-10-14 |author-link = Samuel Eliot Morison }}</ref>\n\nThe main archipelago was named ''\u00eeles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English) in about 1820 by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

However, the name Kiribati was chosen as the name of the new independent nation by local consensus, on such grounds that it was modern,<ref name=cind/> and to acknowledge the inclusion of islands (e.g. [[Phoenix Islands|the Phoenix Group]] and [[Line Islands]]), which were never considered part of the Tungaru (or Gilberts) chain.<ref>Sabatier, Ernest.

Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.<ref name=brit/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091014051525/http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm Background Note: Kiribati]. mfep.gov.ki</ref> Local oral historians in the form of chiefly lore keepers suggest that the area was first inhabited by a group of seafaring people from [[Melanesia]], who were described as being dark skinned, frizzy haired and short in stature. These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including Palmyra Island were not favored due to the lack of adequate landing sites.\n\n[[File:165th Infantry assault wave attacking Butaritari, Yellow Beach Two, find it slow going in the coral bottom waters.... - NARA - 531172.tif|thumb|165th Infantry assault wave attacking Butaritari, Yellow Beach Two, [[Makin Atoll]], 20 November 1943]] \nThe United States eventually incorporated the Northern Line into its territories, and did the same with the Phoenix Islands, which lie between Kiribati and the Line Islands, including Howland, Jarvis, and Baker islands, thus causing a territorial dispute. That was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati under the [[Treaty of Tarawa]]. That was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely-inhabited Phoenix Islands, and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.\n\n[[File:Tarawa.jpg|thumb|American Marines assault a Japanese bunker during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], November 1943.]]\n[[Tarawa Atoll]], and others of the Gilbert group, were occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1943, during [[World War II]].

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji. The first three of these provide the majority of the country's foreign aid.

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries.\nEstablished in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2012 |title=Climate Change in Kiribati, Tarawa Climate Change Conference Issues Ambo Declaration |publisher=Office of the President of Kiribati |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to [[COP16]] held in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], from 29 November to 10 December 2010.\n\nIn 2013, President Tong has spoken of climate-change induced sea level rise as \"inevitable\". \"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate.

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].

Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours. Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres.\n\nKiribati gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], becoming  a [[sovereign state]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted in 1979 at independence. It is the [[Gilbertese]] rendition of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the English pronunciation of the name of the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named in 1820 by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] as \u00ab \u00eeles Gilbert \u00bb, in English the [[Gilbert Islands]], after the British [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He and captain [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer)|John Marshall]] sighted some of the islands in 1788, while crossing the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yeu4MnVVss0C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=outer+passage+route+port+jackson+canton#v=onepage|title=Cinderellas of the Empire: Towards a History of Kiribati and Tuvalu|first=Barrie|last=Macdonald|date=6 December 2001|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820203358|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate = 2009-10-14 |author-link = Samuel Eliot Morison }}</ref>\n\nThe main archipelago was named ''\u00eeles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English) in about 1820 by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji.

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries.\nEstablished in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC.

Commercially viable [[phosphate]] deposits on [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] were exhausted at the time of independence. [[Copra]] and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati is considered one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] in the world.\n\nIn one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker [[remittance]]s, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production ability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for financing.\n\nThe economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs. The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the [[European Union]] (A$9 million), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (A$3.7 million), UNICEF, and the [[World Health Organization]] (A$100,000).<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\"/> The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia (A$11 million), Japan (A$2 million), [[New Zealand]] (A$6.6 million), [[Taiwan]] (A$10.6 million), and other donors providing A$16.2 million, including technical assistance grants from the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\">{{cite web |title = Kiribati: Statistical Appendix |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24872.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/114 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title = Kiribati: 2011 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report, Informational Annexes, Debt Sustainability Analysis, Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion, and Statement by the Executive Director for Kiribati |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24871.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/113 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe major donors in 2010/2011 were Australia (A$15 million), Taiwan (A$11 million); New Zealand (A$6 million), the [[World Bank]] (A$4 million) and the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=mfat>{{cite web |url = http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Kiribati.php |title = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Kiribati established a [[sovereign wealth fund]] to act as a store of wealth for the country's earnings from [[phosphate]] mining.\nIn 2008, the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] was valued at US$400 million.<ref>[http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund/kiribati.php Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute].

It is estimated to have grown by 1.75% for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base.\nDespite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled.

Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation has raised the population of South Tarawa to 50,182.<ref name=\"IMF 2011\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Landscape, Kiribati, 2011.

Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe people of Kiribati speak an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] called [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. Although English is also an [[official language]], it is not used very often outside the island capital of [[Tarawa]]. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language. Several words in Gilbertese have been adopted from European settlers, for instance, ''kamea'' is the Gilbertese word for dog,<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/kir/glossary.htm Te taetae ni Kiribati \u2013 Kiribati Language Lessons \u2013 Glossary].

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].

Though the robberies are well-planned, Tanner's wild nature leads him to take unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby. Back on the family ranch, they bury their getaway car in a pit with an [[excavator]]. The brothers' mother has died after a long illness, leaving their ranch in debt because of a [[reverse mortgage]] provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be [[foreclosure|foreclosed]]. Oil has been discovered on their land, and Toby is determined to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of [[frontier justice]].\n\nTwo [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], Marcus Hamilton ([[Jeff Bridges]]) and Alberto Parker ([[Gil Birmingham]]), are on the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, investigates the robberies and quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner, conversing with a waitress. They take the stolen money to an [[Native American gaming|Indian casino]] in [[Oklahoma]] to be [[money laundering|laundered]]. Toby has the casino convert their gambling winnings into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.\n\nHamilton stakes out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, to no avail. During that time, Hamilton playfully makes fun of his partner\u2019s half-[[Mexicans|Mexican]] and half-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] heritage. Alberto responds with jokes about Hamilton's old age. Hamilton figures a pattern to the bank robberies and determines the next target. Hamilton and Parker are en route to the bank when the final robbery occurs. Pressed for time, the brothers proceed with the heist though the bank is crowded. A shoot-out ensues when a security guard and an armed civilian fire at the brothers and Tanner kills both. Toby is shot in the abdomen as they are ambushed by a waiting posse of armed townspeople outside the bank.\n\nThe brothers race out of town with the local posse in pursuit. After gaining some distance, Tanner stops and fires an automatic rifle, forcing the posse to retreat. The brothers split; Toby takes the money using another vehicle, while Tanner creates a diversion. He draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge where he takes potshots at the police with a hunting rifle, killing Parker. Hamilton uses a local resident and posse member's knowledge of the area to circle behind Tanner and kill him.\n\nDuring the standoff, Toby conceals his wound, passes through a police checkpoint without incident, and launders the stolen cash at the casino, where he sees the news report of his brother's death. He takes the casino's check to the bank just in time to avoid the ranch's foreclosure and deeds the ranch into a [[family trust]].\n\nAfter retirement, Hamilton visits his former office to learn that the Rangers have cleared Toby as a suspect, as his record is clean and he has no motive to steal since the new oil wells earn more in a month than the total stolen in all of the robberies together. The money from the ranch's oil wells is deposited at the Texas Midlands Bank, which refuses to co-operate with the investigation for fear of losing management of the family's trust fund.\n\nHamilton visits Toby's ranch. Although they stay civil, Hamilton states that he knows Toby masterminded and took part in the robberies, but wishes to know the reason. Toby says he has resolved not to let poverty affect his sons like it affected him and Tanner. Hamilton tells Toby he holds him responsible for the death of his partner, and just as a [[Mexican standoff]] starts to occur, they are interrupted when Toby's ex-wife and children arrive. The ranch belongs to the trust and thus to them; Toby is only there to visit and fix up the house. As Hamilton departs, Toby suggests they meet again soon to \"finish the conversation\" and \"bring you some peace\". Hamilton leaves, without giving Toby any absolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/oscars/2017/02/16/hell-or-high-water-screenplay-breakdown |title=Hell or High Water writer explains the film's ambiguous ending |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin P.  |date=16 February 2017 |website=EW |publisher= |access-date=19 February 2019 |quote=I just thought that for either one of them to die was letting them off easy.

Though the robberies are well-planned, Tanner's wild nature leads him to take unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby. Back on the family ranch, they bury their getaway car in a pit with an [[excavator]]. The brothers' mother has died after a long illness, leaving their ranch in debt because of a [[reverse mortgage]] provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be [[foreclosure|foreclosed]]. Oil has been discovered on their land, and Toby is determined to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of [[frontier justice]].\n\nTwo [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], Marcus Hamilton ([[Jeff Bridges]]) and Alberto Parker ([[Gil Birmingham]]), are on the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, investigates the robberies and quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner, conversing with a waitress. They take the stolen money to an [[Native American gaming|Indian casino]] in [[Oklahoma]] to be [[money laundering|laundered]]. Toby has the casino convert their gambling winnings into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.\n\nHamilton stakes out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, to no avail. During that time, Hamilton playfully makes fun of his partner\u2019s half-[[Mexicans|Mexican]] and half-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] heritage. Alberto responds with jokes about Hamilton's old age. Hamilton figures a pattern to the bank robberies and determines the next target. Hamilton and Parker are en route to the bank when the final robbery occurs. Pressed for time, the brothers proceed with the heist though the bank is crowded. A shoot-out ensues when a security guard and an armed civilian fire at the brothers and Tanner kills both. Toby is shot in the abdomen as they are ambushed by a waiting posse of armed townspeople outside the bank.\n\nThe brothers race out of town with the local posse in pursuit. After gaining some distance, Tanner stops and fires an automatic rifle, forcing the posse to retreat. The brothers split; Toby takes the money using another vehicle, while Tanner creates a diversion. He draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge where he takes potshots at the police with a hunting rifle, killing Parker. Hamilton uses a local resident and posse member's knowledge of the area to circle behind Tanner and kill him.\n\nDuring the standoff, Toby conceals his wound, passes through a police checkpoint without incident, and launders the stolen cash at the casino, where he sees the news report of his brother's death. He takes the casino's check to the bank just in time to avoid the ranch's foreclosure and deeds the ranch into a [[family trust]].\n\nAfter retirement, Hamilton visits his former office to learn that the Rangers have cleared Toby as a suspect, as his record is clean and he has no motive to steal since the new oil wells earn more in a month than the total stolen in all of the robberies together. The money from the ranch's oil wells is deposited at the Texas Midlands Bank, which refuses to co-operate with the investigation for fear of losing management of the family's trust fund.\n\nHamilton visits Toby's ranch. Although they stay civil, Hamilton states that he knows Toby masterminded and took part in the robberies, but wishes to know the reason. Toby says he has resolved not to let poverty affect his sons like it affected him and Tanner. Hamilton tells Toby he holds him responsible for the death of his partner, and just as a [[Mexican standoff]] starts to occur, they are interrupted when Toby's ex-wife and children arrive. The ranch belongs to the trust and thus to them; Toby is only there to visit and fix up the house. As Hamilton departs, Toby suggests they meet again soon to \"finish the conversation\" and \"bring you some peace\". Hamilton leaves, without giving Toby any absolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/oscars/2017/02/16/hell-or-high-water-screenplay-breakdown |title=Hell or High Water writer explains the film's ambiguous ending |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin P.  |date=16 February 2017 |website=EW |publisher= |access-date=19 February 2019 |quote=I just thought that for either one of them to die was letting them off easy.

But seven years after his father dies, the business and Kenny are nearly broke after having lost the office, so Kenny and his colleagues now work out of his girlfriend's bar.\n\nKenny, now living with his girlfriend, Kay, has a dream that leads him to Indonesia where he meets up with geologist Michael Acosta. Both are struggling financially, but Kenny manages to convince Mike to go into business to acquire a gold prospect. Kenny then flies back to America and raises the promised money to finance their venture.\n\nUnfortunately, the exploration program struggles and fails to show any gold, so the workers soon leave until Mike persuades them to come back with the promise of fresh water. Kenny contracts malaria and is bed-ridden for the next few weeks. When he finally wakes up, Mike reveals that they have had a strike and now have a huge gold deposit.\n\nAfter celebrating, Kenny goes back to America where he sets up a new office for Washoe and is approached by a major Wall Street bank. Mike accompanies Kenny to their meeting and, after a disagreement, decides to bring some of the bank associates to Indonesia in order to show them the mine. This wins the bank over and it invests $20 million in Washoe, leading the venture to become a public company. Washoe proves to be a huge success and increases 70 points in its first day on the stock market.\n\nKenny's life becomes celebratory as he goes from one party to the next, but Kay, fearing that he will be tricked and cut out, argues with him and then leaves after seeing him flirting with another woman, Rachael Hill. He is interrupted by Mark Hancock, a high-profile executive of a major mining company, who approaches him regarding buying the company. Kenny meets with him the next day and is offered $300 million for a portion of the mine, but his company's name would be removed. Offended by this, Kenny declines the offer and storms out. The next day on his way into the office Mike phones to tell Kenny that the Indonesian Government has closed the mine; it is also revealed that a previous US President sits on the board in Hancock's company and that he is a friend of the Indonesian president Suharto.\n\nKenny is disconsolate and seems to be defeated, but Mike flies to the US and offers a plan to win their mine back. They manage to convince the president's son to join them in business, after Kenny proves himself by stroking a tiger. The mine is reopened with Washoe receiving 15% of what now is a $30 billion business.\n\nKenny thinks of going back to Kay but, seeing her flirting with another man at her new job, decides against it. Kenny is then told that he has been honored with a golden pickaxe, the greatest prize for a prospector. The evening of the presentation comes, and he goes with Mike, who walks out during Kenny's speech.\n\nThe next day something has gone wrong as Kenny drives to his office and has to push his way through an angry crowd of people. It is then announced that Mike had faked the whole mine as he planted gold in the samples using a method called '[[Salting (confidence trick)|salting]]'. The gold that he planted was in fact 'river gold' that had been seen earlier in the film. Mike had traded fresh water for the people's river gold so that he could fake the gold mine. Mike is reported to have fled.\n\nKenny is then questioned by the FBI. He retells his story from a chair in his hotel room that he now cannot afford. The FBI agents seem to believe him and state that Mike was later captured by the Indonesian authorities while on the run and then possibly forced to jump out of a helicopter, some 1000 feet above the jungle. The corpse had its hands and face chewed clean off by wild animals, so Acosta's death is never proven. The agents also say that both the Indonesian minister and Mike dumped their stocks before the scandal broke and that Mike possessed 164 million US Dollars when he fled.\n\nKenny returns to Kay's house where he apologizes and later looks through his mail received since they have been apart. He opens one envelope and finds the napkin Mike and he signed as a contract, reading \"50\u201350\". Beneath the napkin is a deposit slip for $82 million to First Bank of Gibraltar, Queens Lane Branch, United Kingdom.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Kenny Wells, based on [[Bre-X]] CEO [[David Walsh (mining)|David Walsh]].<ref name=\"SimonsCast\" /><ref name=\"McConaugheyCast\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/12/30/bre-x-tale-rich-with-hollywood-drama-jennifer-wells.html|title=Bre-X tale rich with Hollywood drama: Jennifer Wells - The Star|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Michael Acosta,<ref name=\"RamirezCast\" /> a geologist based on Michael de Guzman.\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Kay,<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> Wells' longtime girlfriend.\n* [[Joshua Harto]] as Lloyd Stanton,<ref name=\"HartoCast\" /> the businessman's bank account manager.\n* [[Timothy Simons]] as Jeff Jackson,<ref name=\"SimonsCast\" /> a Wall Street banker who is coaxed by the duo to inspect the potential value of the company in the jungles of Borneo.\n* [[Michael Landes]] as Glen Binkert<ref name=\"LandesCast\" />\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Brian Woolf,<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> a New York investment banker.\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Paul Jennings,<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> an FBI agent.\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]]<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> as Mark Hancock, boss of a major competitor.\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Clive Coleman<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" />\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Hollis Dresher\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as Rachel Hill, an aggressively flirtatious finance hotshot.\n* [[Macon Blair]] as Connie Wright\n* [[Bhavesh Patel (actor)|Bhavesh Patel]] as Bobby Owens\n* Patrick Duggan<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duggan|first1=Patrick|title=New Trailer For Gold starring Matthew McConaughey, Edgar Ramirez and Bryce Dallas Howard|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/10/new-trailer-for-gold-starring-matthew-mcconaughey-edgar-ramirez-and-bryce-dallas-howard/|website=flickeringmyth.com|publisher=Aime Cranswick|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> as Waldorf-Astoria Doorman\n* [[Craig T.

But seven years after his father dies, the business and Kenny are nearly broke after having lost the office, so Kenny and his colleagues now work out of his girlfriend's bar.\n\nKenny, now living with his girlfriend, Kay, has a dream that leads him to Indonesia where he meets up with geologist Michael Acosta. Both are struggling financially, but Kenny manages to convince Mike to go into business to acquire a gold prospect. Kenny then flies back to America and raises the promised money to finance their venture.\n\nUnfortunately, the exploration program struggles and fails to show any gold, so the workers soon leave until Mike persuades them to come back with the promise of fresh water. Kenny contracts malaria and is bed-ridden for the next few weeks. When he finally wakes up, Mike reveals that they have had a strike and now have a huge gold deposit.\n\nAfter celebrating, Kenny goes back to America where he sets up a new office for Washoe and is approached by a major Wall Street bank. Mike accompanies Kenny to their meeting and, after a disagreement, decides to bring some of the bank associates to Indonesia in order to show them the mine. This wins the bank over and it invests $20 million in Washoe, leading the venture to become a public company. Washoe proves to be a huge success and increases 70 points in its first day on the stock market.\n\nKenny's life becomes celebratory as he goes from one party to the next, but Kay, fearing that he will be tricked and cut out, argues with him and then leaves after seeing him flirting with another woman, Rachael Hill. He is interrupted by Mark Hancock, a high-profile executive of a major mining company, who approaches him regarding buying the company. Kenny meets with him the next day and is offered $300 million for a portion of the mine, but his company's name would be removed. Offended by this, Kenny declines the offer and storms out. The next day on his way into the office Mike phones to tell Kenny that the Indonesian Government has closed the mine; it is also revealed that a previous US President sits on the board in Hancock's company and that he is a friend of the Indonesian president Suharto.\n\nKenny is disconsolate and seems to be defeated, but Mike flies to the US and offers a plan to win their mine back. They manage to convince the president's son to join them in business, after Kenny proves himself by stroking a tiger. The mine is reopened with Washoe receiving 15% of what now is a $30 billion business.\n\nKenny thinks of going back to Kay but, seeing her flirting with another man at her new job, decides against it. Kenny is then told that he has been honored with a golden pickaxe, the greatest prize for a prospector. The evening of the presentation comes, and he goes with Mike, who walks out during Kenny's speech.\n\nThe next day something has gone wrong as Kenny drives to his office and has to push his way through an angry crowd of people. It is then announced that Mike had faked the whole mine as he planted gold in the samples using a method called '[[Salting (confidence trick)|salting]]'. The gold that he planted was in fact 'river gold' that had been seen earlier in the film. Mike had traded fresh water for the people's river gold so that he could fake the gold mine. Mike is reported to have fled.\n\nKenny is then questioned by the FBI. He retells his story from a chair in his hotel room that he now cannot afford. The FBI agents seem to believe him and state that Mike was later captured by the Indonesian authorities while on the run and then possibly forced to jump out of a helicopter, some 1000 feet above the jungle. The corpse had its hands and face chewed clean off by wild animals, so Acosta's death is never proven. The agents also say that both the Indonesian minister and Mike dumped their stocks before the scandal broke and that Mike possessed 164 million US Dollars when he fled.\n\nKenny returns to Kay's house where he apologizes and later looks through his mail received since they have been apart. He opens one envelope and finds the napkin Mike and he signed as a contract, reading \"50\u201350\". Beneath the napkin is a deposit slip for $82 million to First Bank of Gibraltar, Queens Lane Branch, United Kingdom.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Kenny Wells, based on [[Bre-X]] CEO [[David Walsh (mining)|David Walsh]].<ref name=\"SimonsCast\" /><ref name=\"McConaugheyCast\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/12/30/bre-x-tale-rich-with-hollywood-drama-jennifer-wells.html|title=Bre-X tale rich with Hollywood drama: Jennifer Wells - The Star|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Michael Acosta,<ref name=\"RamirezCast\" /> a geologist based on Michael de Guzman.\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Kay,<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> Wells' longtime girlfriend.\n* [[Joshua Harto]] as Lloyd Stanton,<ref name=\"HartoCast\" /> the businessman's bank account manager.\n* [[Timothy Simons]] as Jeff Jackson,<ref name=\"SimonsCast\" /> a Wall Street banker who is coaxed by the duo to inspect the potential value of the company in the jungles of Borneo.\n* [[Michael Landes]] as Glen Binkert<ref name=\"LandesCast\" />\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Brian Woolf,<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> a New York investment banker.\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Paul Jennings,<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> an FBI agent.\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]]<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" /> as Mark Hancock, boss of a major competitor.\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Clive Coleman<ref name=\"Aug2015Deadline\" />\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Hollis Dresher\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as Rachel Hill, an aggressively flirtatious finance hotshot.\n* [[Macon Blair]] as Connie Wright\n* [[Bhavesh Patel (actor)|Bhavesh Patel]] as Bobby Owens\n* Patrick Duggan<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duggan|first1=Patrick|title=New Trailer For Gold starring Matthew McConaughey, Edgar Ramirez and Bryce Dallas Howard|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/10/new-trailer-for-gold-starring-matthew-mcconaughey-edgar-ramirez-and-bryce-dallas-howard/|website=flickeringmyth.com|publisher=Aime Cranswick|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> as Waldorf-Astoria Doorman\n* [[Craig T.

Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction.

Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant and suffers an assault. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/longmire-season-6-cancelled-bloodline-happened-season-5-final-episode-watch/285699 |title= What Happened In Season 5 Final Episode? |last=Muppala |first=Savitha |date=September 26, 2016  |website=Movie News Guide |publisher=Tune Media |access-date=January 6, 2017 |quote=The finale sees Walt and Vic recognizing and acknowledging and their feelings for each other.}}</ref> As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him.

He was suspended from the force at the end of season three. \n* [[Cassidy Freeman]] as Cady Longmire is Walt's daughter, an attorney who initially works for a local law firm.

He continues to feel overlooked, even when he is promoted to a more senior deputy status. In the early seasons, he has an unrequited crush on Cady.

Known informally as \"Fritz\",<ref name=\"MacDonogh-17\">MacDonogh, p. 17.</ref> he was the only son of [[Emperor Wilhelm I]] and was raised in his family's tradition of military service. Although celebrated as a young man for his leadership and successes during the [[Second Schleswig War|Second Schleswig]], [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian]] and [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian]] wars,<ref name=\"Kollander-79\">Kollander, p. 79.</ref><ref name=\"LondonNews\">''[[The Illustrated London News]]''</ref> he nevertheless professed a hatred of warfare and was praised by friends and enemies alike for his humane conduct. Following the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871 his father, then King of Prussia, became the German Emperor. Upon Wilhelm's death at the age of ninety on 9 March 1888, the thrones passed to Frederick, who had by then been German Crown Prince for seventeen years and Crown Prince of Prussia for twenty-seven years. Frederick was suffering from [[cancer of the larynx]] when he died, aged fifty-six, following unsuccessful medical treatments for his condition.\n\nFrederick married [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], eldest daughter of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]]. The couple were well-matched; their shared [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] ideology led them to seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, in spite of his [[conservative]] militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies as a result of his ties with Britain and his studies at the [[University of Bonn]]. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative [[German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick would move to liberalize the German Empire.\n\nFrederick and Victoria were great admirers of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], Queen Victoria's husband. They planned to rule as consorts, like Albert and Queen Victoria, and to reform what they saw as flaws in the executive branch that Bismarck had created for himself. The office of Chancellor, responsible to the Emperor, would be replaced with a British-style cabinet, with ministers responsible to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]. Government policy would be based on the consensus of the cabinet. Frederick \"described the Imperial Constitution as ''ingeniously contrived chaos.''\"<ref>Balfour, p. 69.</ref> According to [[Michael Balfour (historian)|Michael Balfour]]:\n\n{{quote|The Crown Prince and Princess shared the outlook of the [[German Progress Party|Progressive Party]], and Bismarck was haunted by the fear that should the old Emperor die\u2014and he was now in his seventies\u2014they would call on one of the Progressive leaders to become Chancellor. He sought to guard against such a turn by keeping the Crown Prince from a position of any influence and by using foul means as well as fair to make him unpopular.<ref>Balfour, p. 70.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Frederick's illness prevented him from effectively establishing policies and measures to achieve this, and such moves as he was able to make were later abandoned by his son and successor, [[Wilhelm II]]. The timing of Frederick's death and the length of his reign are important topics among historians. His premature demise is considered a potential turning point in German history;<ref name=\"Tipton-175\">Tipton, p. 175.</ref> and whether or not he would have made the Empire more liberal if he had lived longer is still discussed.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl von Preu\u00dfen, ca 1841.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick William, ca. 1841]]\nFrederick William was born in the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace]] at [[Potsdam]] in Prussia on 18 October 1831. He was a scion of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], rulers of Prussia, then the most powerful of the German states. Frederick's father, [[William I, German Emperor|Prince William]], was a younger brother of [[King Frederick William IV]] and, having been raised in the military traditions of the Hohenzollerns, developed into a strict disciplinarian. William fell in love with his cousin [[Elisa Radziwill]], a princess of the [[Polish nobility]], but the court felt Elisa's rank was not suitable for the bride of a Prussian prince and forced a more suitable match.<ref name=\"VdK-10\">Van der Kiste, p. 10.</ref> The woman selected to be his wife, Princess [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar]], had been raised in the more intellectual and artistic atmosphere of [[Weimar]], which gave its citizens greater participation in politics and limited the powers of its rulers through a [[constitution]];<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\">Dorpalen, p. 2.</ref><ref name=\"Kollander-1\">Kollander, p. 1.</ref> Augusta was well known across Europe for her liberal views.<ref name=\"VdK-11\">Van der Kiste, p. 11.</ref> Because of their differences, the couple did not have a happy marriage and,<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\" /><ref name=\"Kollander-1\" /> as a result, Frederick grew up in a troubled household, which left him with memories of a lonely childhood.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\" /><ref name=\"VdK-12\">Van der Kiste, p. 12.</ref> He had one sister, [[Princess Louise of Prussia|Louise]] (later Grand Duchess of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]]), who was eight years his junior and very close to him. Frederick also had a very good relationship with his uncle, King Frederick William IV, who has been called \"the romantic on the throne\".<ref name=\"Fred\">Oster, pp. 60\u201365.</ref>\n[[File:Oskar Begas Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm von Preu\u00dfen 1867.jpg|thumb|right|Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia, 1867, by [[Oskar Begas]]]]\nFrederick grew up during a tumultuous political period as the concept of [[liberalism in Germany]], which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support.<ref name=\"Palmowski-43\">Palmowski, p. 43.</ref> The liberals sought a unified Germany and were [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchists]] who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights.<ref name=\"Sperber-64\">Sperber, p. 64.</ref> Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation.<ref name=\"Kollander-1\" /> When Frederick was 17, these emergent [[nationalism|nationalistic]] and liberal sentiments sparked a [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|series of political uprisings]] across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of the press]], and to create a German [[parliament]] and constitution.<ref name=\"Palmowski-43\" /><ref name=\"Sperber-128-129\">Sperber, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-554\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 554.</ref>\n\nDespite the value placed by the Hohenzollern family on a traditional military education, Augusta insisted that her son also receive a classical education.<ref name=\"VdK-12\" /> Accordingly, Frederick was thoroughly tutored in both military traditions and the [[liberal arts]]. His private tutor was [[Ernst Curtius]], a famous archaeologist.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Frederick was a talented student, particularly good at foreign languages, becoming fluent in English and French, and studying Latin. He also studied history, geography, physics, music and religion, and excelled at gymnastics; as required of a Prussian prince, he became a very good rider.<ref name=\"M-B-44\">Mueller-Bohn, p. 44.</ref> Hohenzollern princes were made familiar with the military traditions of their dynasty at an early age; Frederick was ten when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the First Infantry Regiment of Guards. As he grew older, he was expected to maintain an active involvement in military affairs.<ref name=\"M-B-14\">Mueller-Bohn, p. 14.</ref> However, at the age of 18, he broke with family tradition and entered the [[University of Bonn]] where he studied history, law and governance, and public policy. During his time at Bonn (1850\u20131852), his teachers included [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] and [[Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann]].<ref name=\"Fred\"/> His time spent at the university, coupled with the influence of less conservative family members, were instrumental in his embrace of liberal beliefs.<ref name=\"Nichols-7\">Nichols, p. 7.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, Frederick was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] by his father, then [[William I, German Emperor|Prince William of Prussia]], and would later become Master of the Order of the [[Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany]].<ref name=\"speth\">Speth, George William.

As early as 1851, [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] and her German-born husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], were making plans to marry their eldest daughter, [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], to Frederick. The royal dynasty in Britain was predominantly German; there was little British blood in Queen Victoria, and none in her husband.<ref name=\"VdK-15\">Van der Kiste, p. 15.</ref> The monarchs desired to maintain their family's blood ties to Germany, and Prince Albert further hoped that the marriage would lead to the liberalization and modernization of Prussia. King [[Leopold I of Belgium]], uncle of the British monarch and consort, also favoured this pairing; he had long treasured [[Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]]'s idea of a marriage alliance between Britain and Prussia.<ref name=\"VdK-16\">Van der Kiste, p. 16.</ref> Frederick's father, Prince William, had no interest in the arrangement, hoping instead for a [[List of Grand Duchesses of Russia|Russian Grand Duchess]] as his daughter-in-law.<ref name=\"VdK-15\" /> However, Princess Augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with Britain.<ref name=\"MacDonogh-17\" /> In 1851, his mother sent Frederick to England, ostensibly to visit the [[Great Exhibition]] but in truth, she hoped that the cradle of liberalism and home of the industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son. Prince Albert took Frederick under his wing during his stay but it was Albert's daughter, only eleven at the time, who guided the German prince around the Exhibition. Frederick only knew a few words of English, while Victoria could converse fluently in German. He was impressed by her mix of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity, and their meeting proved to be a success. A regular exchange of letters between Victoria and Frederick followed.<ref name=\"Fred\"/>\n\nFrederick proposed to Victoria in 1855, when she was 14 years old. The betrothal of the young couple was announced on May 19, 1857, at Buckingham Palace and the Prussian Court,<ref name=\"VdK-31\">Van der Kiste, p. 31.</ref> and their marriage took place on 25 January 1858 in the Chapel Royal of [[St. James's Palace]], London. To mark the occasion, Frederick was promoted to Major-General in the Prussian army. Although it was an arranged marriage, the newlyweds were compatible from the start and their marriage was a loving one;<ref name=\"MacDonogh-17-18\">MacDonogh, pp. 17\u201318.</ref><ref name=\"VdK-43\">Van der Kiste, p. 43.</ref> Victoria too had received a liberal education and shared her husband's views. Of the two, Victoria was the dominant one in the relationship.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> The couple often resided at the [[Kronprinzenpalais|Crown Prince's Palace]] and had eight children: [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] in 1859, [[Charlotte, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen|Charlotte]] in 1860, [[Albert Wilhelm Heinrich of Prussia|Henry]] in 1862, [[Prince Sigismund of Prussia (1864-1866)|Sigismund]] in 1864, [[Princess Viktoria of Prussia|Victoria]] in 1866, [[Prince Waldemar of Prussia (1868-1879)|Waldemar]] in 1868, [[Sophia of Prussia|Sophia]] in 1870 and [[Princess Margaret of Prussia|Margaret]] in 1872. Sigismund died at the age of 2 and Waldemar at age 11,<ref name=\"Kollander-21\">Kollander, p. 21.</ref> and their eldest son, Wilhelm, suffered from a withered arm\u2014probably due to his difficult and dangerous [[breech birth]], although it could have also resulted from a mild case of [[cerebral palsy]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-12\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 12.</ref><ref name=\"MacDonogh-22\">MacDonogh, p. 22.</ref> Wilhelm, who became emperor after Frederick's death, shared none of his parents' liberal ideas; his mother viewed him as a \"complete Prussian\".<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-101\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 101.</ref> This difference in ideology created a rift between Wilhelm and his parents (which was exacerbated by Bismarck's interference), and relations between them were strained throughout their lives.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-101\" /><ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-xiii\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. xiii.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nEmperor Frederick III was a [[Lutheran]] member of the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces]]. It was a [[United Protestant]] denomination, bringing together [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] believers.\n\n==Crown Prince of Prussia==\n[[Image:Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm auf dem Hofball 1878.jpg|thumb|upright|William allowed Frederick few official duties, such as attending balls and socializing with dignitaries (painting by [[Anton von Werner]]).]]\nWhen his father succeeded to the Prussian throne as King William I on 2 January 1861, Frederick became the Crown Prince. Already twenty-nine years old, he would be Crown Prince for a further twenty-seven years. The new king was initially considered politically neutral; Frederick and Prussia's liberal elements hoped that he would usher in a new era of liberal policies. The liberals managed to greatly increase their majority in the Prussian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] (''Landtag''), but William soon showed that he preferred the conservative ways. On the other hand, Frederick declared himself in complete agreement with the \"essential liberal policy for internal and foreign affairs\".<ref name=\"VdK-68\">Van der Kiste, p. 68.</ref>\n\nBecause William was a dogmatic soldier and unlikely to change his ideas at the age of sixty-four,<ref name=\"VdK-61\">Van der Kiste, p. 61.</ref> he regularly clashed with the Diet over policies. In September 1862, one such disagreement almost led to Frederick being crowned and replacing his father as king; William threatened to abdicate when the Diet refused to fund his plans for the army's reorganization. Frederick was appalled by this action, and said that an abdication would \"constitute a threat to the dynasty, country and Crown\".<ref name=\"Pakula-168\">Pakula, p. 168.</ref> William reconsidered, and instead on the advice of Minister of War [[Albrecht von Roon]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]], who had offered to push through the military reform even against the majority of the Diet, as [[Prime Minister of Prussia|Minister-President]]. The appointment of Bismarck, an authoritarian who would often ignore or overrule the Diet, set Frederick on a collision course with his father and led to his exclusion from affairs of state for the rest of William's reign. Frederick insisted on bloodless \"moral conquests\", unifying Germany by liberal and peaceful means, but it was Bismarck's policy of [[blood and iron]] that prevailed.<ref name=\"Nichols-7\" /> His protests against William's rule peaked at [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] on 4 June 1863, where at an official reception in the city he loudly denounced Bismarck's restrictions on freedom of the press.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-11\">Dorpalen, p. 11.</ref><ref>Kollander, pp. 38\u201345</ref><ref>Oster, pp. 63\u201364</ref> He thereby made Bismarck his enemy and his father extremely angry.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Consequently, Frederick was excluded from positions of political power throughout his father's reign. Retaining his military portfolio, he continued to represent Germany and its Emperor at ceremonies, weddings, and celebrations such as Queen Victoria's [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]] in 1887.<ref name=\"VdK-130+\">Van der Kiste, pp. 130\u201331.</ref> Frederick would spend a large portion of time in Britain, where Queen Victoria frequently allowed him to represent her at ceremonies and social functions.<ref name=\"Pakula-69\">Pakula, p. 69.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia - Illustrated London News August 20, 1870.PNG| 20 August 1870, ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' celebrates the Crown Prince's [[Franco-Prussian War]] achievements|thumb|upright|left]]\nFrederick fought in the wars against Denmark, Austria and France. Although he had opposed military action in each case, once war had started he supported the Prussian military wholeheartedly and took positions of command. Since he had no political influence at all, these were opportunities to prove himself.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Frederick experienced his first combat in the [[Second Schleswig War]]. Appointed to supervise the supreme [[German Confederation]] commander [[Friedrich Graf von Wrangel|Field Marshal Wrangel]] and his staff, the Crown Prince tactfully managed disputes between Wrangel and the other officers. The Prussians and their [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] allies defeated the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danes]] and conquered the southern part of [[Jutland]], but after the war, they spent two years politicking to assume leadership of the German states. This culminated in the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. Frederick \"was the only member of the Prussian Crown Council to uphold the rights of the [[Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein|Duke of Augustenberg]] and oppose the idea of a war with Austria which he described as ''fratricide''.\" Although he supported unification and the restoration of the medieval empire, \"Fritz could not accept that war was the right way to unite Germany.\".<ref>Balfour, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> However, when war with Austria broke out, he accepted command of one of Prussia's three armies, with General [[Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal]] as his chief of staff. The timely arrival of his II Army was crucial to the Prussian victory in 1866 at the decisive [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]], which won the war for Prussia.<ref name=\"Lord-125\">Lord, p. 125.</ref> Nevertheless, the bloodshed caused him great dismay.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> A few days before K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, Frederick had written to his wife, expressing his hope that this would be the last war he would have to fight. On the third day of the battle he wrote to her again: \"Who knows whether we may not have to wage a third war in order to keep what we have now won?\"<ref name=\"Pakula-98\">Pakula, p. 98.</ref>\n\nFour years later Frederick was in action again, this time during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, in which he was once more paired with Blumenthal and commanded the III Army, consisting of troops from the southern German states.<ref name=\"Howard-60\">Howard, p. 60.</ref><ref name=\"Kollander-92\">Kollander, p. 92.</ref> He was praised for his leadership after defeating the French at the battles of [[Battle of Wissembourg (1870)|Wissembourg]] and [[Battle of W\u00f6rth (1870)|W\u00f6rth]],<ref name=\"Kollander-92\" /> and met with further successes at the [[Battle of Sedan]] and during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]]. Frederick's humane treatment of his country's foes earned him their respect and the plaudits of neutral observers.<ref name=\"Kollander-109\">Kollander, p. 109.</ref> After the Battle of W\u00f6rth, a London journalist witnessed the Crown Prince's many visits to wounded Prussian soldiers and lauded his deeds, extolling the love and respect the soldiers held for Frederick. Following his victory, Frederick had remarked to two Paris journalists, \"I do not like war gentlemen. If I should reign I would never make it.\"<ref name=\"LondonNews\" /> One French journalist remarked that \"the Crown Prince has left countless traits of kindness and humanity in the land that he fought against.\"<ref name=\"Kollander-109\" /> For his behaviour and accomplishments, ''[[The Times]]'' wrote a tribute to Frederick in July 1871, stating that \"the Prince has won as much honour for his gentleness as for his prowess in the war\".<ref name=\"Kollander-109\" />\n\n==Crown Prince of the German Empire==\n[[File:Friedrich III as Kronprinz - in GdK uniform by Heinrich von Angeli 1874.jpg|Frederick as crown prince, 1874, by [[Heinrich von Angeli]]|thumb|upright|right]]\nIn 1871, following Prussia's victories, the German states were united into the [[German Empire]], with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent to the new [[German monarchy]]. Although William thought the day when he became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Bismarck, now [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]], disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess.

G. R\u00f6hl]] come to the \"...conviction that the Crown Prince and his liberal English wife were an alien, un-German force that must not be allowed to accede to the throne\".<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/>\n\n==Illness and decline==\n[[File:Morell_Mackenzie_2.jpg|Morell Mackenzie, whose treatment of Frederick caused controversy|thumb|upright|right]]\nFrederick had been a heavy smoker for many years.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 645\u2013646.</ref> At a ball held by William on 31 January 1887, a guest reported the Crown Prince \"was so hoarse that he could hardly say a word.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> His hoarseness continued through February, and was diagnosed as a thickening of the mucous membrane over the vocal cords, caused by \"a chronic laryngeal catarrh.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> On 7 February, Frederick consulted a doctor, Karl Gerhardt, who scraped a wire across the membrane for 10 days in an attempt to remove thickened tissue. After the procedure proved unsuccessful, Gerhardt cauterised the left vocal cord with an electric wire on 15 March in an attempt to remove what was then thought to be a [[vocal fold nodule]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> Due to Frederick's highly inflamed throat, Gerhardt was unable to remove the entire growth. After several cauterisations, and with no signs of improvement, Frederick and his wife went to the spa of [[Bad Ems]], where he drank the mineral waters and underwent a regimen of gargles and inhaling fresh air, with no effect.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/>\n\nOn 17 May, Gerhardt and other doctors, including [[Ernst von Bergmann]], diagnosed the growth as [[laryngeal cancer]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> Bergmann recommended consulting a leading British cancer specialist, [[Morell Mackenzie]]; he also recommended a [[thyrotomy]] to gain better access to the inside of the larynx, followed by the complete removal of the larynx \u2013 a total [[laryngectomy]] \u2013 if the situation proved serious. While Victoria was informed of the need for an immediate operation, Frederick was not told.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 647-48\"/> Despite the tentative diagnosis of cancer, the doctors hoped the growth would prove to be a benign [[epithelioma]]. A room on the top floor of the Crown Prince's palace was then equipped as an operating theatre, but Bergmann elected to put the operation on hold until Mackenzie could provide his assessment.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 647-48\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 647\u2013648.</ref> Mackenzie arrived in Berlin on 20 May, but after examining Frederick recommended a [[biopsy]] of the growth to determine whether or not it was malignant. He conducted the biopsy the following morning, after which he sent tissue samples to the distinguished pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] for microscopic examination. When Virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses, Mackenzie declared his opposition to a laryngectomy being performed, as he felt it would be invariably fatal, and said he would assume charge of the case. He gave his assurance that Frederick would fully recover \"in a few months.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 649-50\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 649\u2013650.</ref> While Gerhardt and Physician-General August Wegner concurred with Mackenzie, Bergmann and his colleague Adalbert Tobold held to their original diagnosis of cancer. In addition to Mackenzie's opinion, Bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on Frederick's throat, and pressed the Kaiser to veto it.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 649-50\"/> On 9 June, Mackenzie again biopsied the growth and sent the samples to Virchow, who reported the following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 649-50\"/>\n\nOn 13 June, the Crown Prince left Potsdam for London to attend his mother-in-law's Golden Jubilee and to consult Mackenzie. He never saw his father alive again. He was accompanied by Victoria and their three younger daughters, along with Gerhardt; on 29 June, Mackenzie reported that he had successfully operated at his Harley Street clinic, and had removed \"''nearly'' the entire growth.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 654\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 654.</ref> Frederick spent July with his family at [[Norris Castle]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. However, when Frederick visited Mackenzie's office on 2 August for a follow-up examination, the growth had reappeared, necessitating its cauterisation the same day, and again on 8 August \u2013 an ominous indication that it was indeed malignant. Felix Semon, a distinguished German throat specialist with a practice in England, and who had been closely following Frederick's case, submitted a report to the German Foreign Secretary in which he strongly criticised Mackenzie's cauterisations, and gave his opinion that the growth, if not malignant, was suspect, and should continue to be biopsied and examined.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 656-57\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 656\u2013657.</ref> On 9 August, Frederick travelled to [[Braemar]] in the Scottish Highlands with Dr. Mark Hovell, a senior surgeon at the Throat Hospital in London. Although a further examination by Mackenzie on 20 August revealed no sign of a recurrent growth, Frederick said he had the \"constant feeling\" of something \"not right inside\";  nonetheless, he requested Queen Victoria to knight Mackenzie, who duly received a knighthood in September.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 658-59\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 658\u2013659.</ref>\n\nDespite the operations on his throat and having taken the sea air at [[Cowes]], Frederick remained hoarse and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the [[Italian Riviera]]. In August, following reports that his father was gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to [[Toblach]] in [[South Tyrol]] with his family, where Victoria had rented a house.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 659-62\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 659\u2013662.</ref> He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 659-62\"/> Concerned by Frederick's lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, [[Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg]], consulted the distinguished [[laryngologist]] [[Max Joseph Oertel]], who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick's throat, and said he suspected a benign tumour which could soon become malignant.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 662-63\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 662\u2013663.</ref> By this time, Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the hoarseness to a \"momentary chill.\" However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for [[Venice]], to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick's throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 664-66\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 664\u2013666.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ernst_von_Bergmann_1.jpg|thumb|right|Professor Ernst von Bergmann, who attended to Frederick throughout his illness]]\nUpon arriving in Venice, Frederick again caught cold; privately, Mackenzie was growing seriously concerned, having observed a continued tendency for Frederick's throat and larynx to swell. He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting that if the Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he could give him no more than three months to live.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 664-66\"/> At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that \"Fritz's throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety & he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 671\u2013673.</ref> On 6 October, Frederick, his family and Mackenzie left for a villa at [[Baveno]] on the shore of [[Lake Maggiore]], with Mackenzie leaving Baveno on 8 October, after predicting Frederick's recovery \"in 3 or 4 months,\" wrote Victoria.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/> Their elder son Wilhelm joined them at Baveno on 17 October for Frederick's 56th birthday the following day.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/> At the end of October, Frederick's condition abruptly worsened, with Victoria writing to her mother on 2 November that Frederick's throat was again inflamed, but not due to any cold, and that he was \"very hoarse again\" and easily became depressed about his health. General [[Alfred von Waldersee]] observed that Frederick's health had grave implications as if William died soon and his son succeeded, \"a new Kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility, quite apart from the fact that we desperately need a highly energetic one.\" His son Wilhelm reported to King [[Albert of Saxony]] that his father was frequently short-tempered and melancholic, though his voice appeared to have slightly improved, and that Frederick's throat was being treated by \"blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe the larynx.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/>\n\nOn 3 November, Frederick and his entourage departed for [[Sanremo|San Remo]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/> At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 690-91\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 690\u2013691.</ref> Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while there was no immediate danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had \"unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn,\" and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology [[Leopold von Schr\u00f6tter|Leopold Schr\u00f6tter]] and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 690-91\"/> On 9 November, Schr\u00f6tter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 690-91\"/> All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared on the right side of the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 694-97\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 694\u2013697.</ref> Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, \"To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?\"<ref name=\"Pakula-448\">Pakula, p. 448.</ref><ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 694-97\"/> Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a [[tracheotomy]] if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 694-97\"/> The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering \"foreigner\" who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father \"whether he is ill or not, [and] whether the K[aiser] is then unable permanently to perform his duties,\" would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 702-05\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 702\u2013705.</ref> Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 699-701\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 699\u2013701.</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 1887, Frederick wrote that his \"chronic catarrh\" appeared to be taking \"a turn for the better and that \"a further bond has been forged between our people and myself; may God preserve it by giving me, when I resume my duties, the capacity to prove myself worthy of the great trust that has been shown me!\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 699-701\"/> A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his hoarseness and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected right side of his throat becoming inflamed.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 773-77\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 773\u2013777.</ref> He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured. The doctors diagnosed [[perichondritis]], an infection of the throat membrane.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 773-77\"/> Frederick again became unable to speak, and suffered violent headaches and insomnia.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 773-77\"/> On 29 January, Mackenzie returned to San Remo from a trip to Spain, and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy.<ref name=Mackenzie1888/><ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 778-782\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 778\u2013782.</ref>  The operation was conducted at 4 p.m. on 8 February, by which time Frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and \"embarrassing bouts of suffocation.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 778-782\"/> A [[Trach tube|cannula]] was fitted to allow Frederick to breathe;<ref name=\"Sinc-204\">Sinclair, p. 204.</ref> for the remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-27\">Dorpalen, p. 27.</ref> During the operation, Dr. Bergmann almost killed him by missing the incision in the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and forcing the cannula into the wrong place.<ref name=Mackenzie1888>Mackenzie, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref> Frederick started to cough and bleed, and Bergmann placed his forefinger into the wound to enlarge it. The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann's actions resulted in an [[abscess]] in Frederick's neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life.<ref name=\"Sinc-204\" /> Later, Frederick would ask \"Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?\"<ref name=\"Sinc-204\" /> and complain that \"Bergmann ill-treated [me]\".<ref name=\"Sinc-204\" />\n\nEven after the tracheotomy, Frederick continued to run high fevers and suffered from headaches and insomnia. His violent coughing continued, bringing up bloody [[sputum]]. Apart from Mackenzie, the other doctors, led by Bergmann, now held the firm opinion that the Crown Prince's disease was cancer and that it had possibly spread to his lungs. The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer was conclusively confirmed on 6 March, when the [[anatomist]] Professor [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Wilhelm Waldeyer]], who had come to San Remo, examined Frederick's sputum under a microscope and confirmed the presence of \"so-called cancroid bodies...from a cancerous new growth\" that was in the larynx. He further said that there were no signs of any growths in the lungs.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 778-782\"/> Though it finally settled the question, Waldeyer's diagnosis threw all of Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick into doubt.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 778-782\"/> The diagnosis and treatment of Frederick's fatal illness caused some medical controversy well into the next century.<ref>Westman, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n<!-- Removed: the following would be better as a footnote appended to the end of \"such an operation had never been successfully performed without the death of the patient.\" or in Bergmann's article\nYears later, Bergmann tried to prove to his medical students that he could have saved Frederick III by removing his larynx.

Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, \"...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 788-89\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 788\u2013789.</ref> Germany's progressive elements hoped that William's death, and thus Frederick's succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-1\" /><ref name=\"Sheehan-217\">Sheehan, p. 217.</ref> Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either '''Frederick I''' (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or '''Frederick IV''' (if it was considered a continuation of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]], which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 788-89\"/> The new Kaiser reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his \"pitiful\" appearance.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 790-91\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 790\u2013791.</ref> The question now was how much longer the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if anything, he could hope to achieve.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 788-89\"/> In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as Emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle from his jacket and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as Empress.<ref name=\"VdK-193\">Van der Kiste, p. 193.</ref> Too ill to march in his father's funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the [[Charlottenburg Palace]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 790-91\"/>\n\nAs the German Emperor, he officially received Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (his mother-in-law) and [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway]], and attended the wedding of his son Prince Henry to his niece [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Irene]]. However, Frederick reigned for only 99&nbsp;days,<ref name=\"Kitchen-214\">Kitchen, p. 214.</ref> and was unable to bring about much lasting change.<ref name=\"Cecil-110\">Cecil, p. 110.</ref> The majority of the German ruling elite viewed Frederick's reign as merely a brief interim period before the accession of his son Wilhelm to the throne.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 792\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 792.</ref>  An edict he penned before he ascended to the throne that would limit the powers of the chancellor and monarch under the constitution was never put into effect,<ref name=\"Kollander-147\">Kollander, p. 147.</ref> although he did force [[Robert von Puttkamer]] to resign as Prussian [[Minister of the Interior]] on 8 June, when evidence indicated that Puttkamer had interfered in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] elections.

Sheehan]] states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization.<ref name=\"Sheehan-216\">Sheehan, p. 216.</ref> Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany,<ref name=\"Dorpalen-30\">Dorpalen, p. 30.</ref> and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-31\">Dorpalen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nFrederick's children\u2014Wilhelm in particular\u2014held various political positions and greatly influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced the horrors of war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family's military heritage, coming under Bismarck's tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick's and Victoria's liberal ways, felt bound to increase the tensions between Wilhelm and his parents.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger-243\">Feuchtwanger, p. 243.</ref> Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government; shortly after his father's death he proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I, and made no reference to Frederick III.<ref name=\"Kollander-178\">Kollander, p. 178.</ref> Wilhelm II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\" /><ref name=\"Dorpalen-31\" />\n\nBismarck's plan of undermining Frederick and Victoria, and of using Wilhelm II as a tool for retaining his own power, led to his own downfall. As it turned out, Wilhelm did share his father's conviction that the position of the chancellor was too strong and should be modified in favour of a more powerful Emperor.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> When Bismarck realized that Wilhelm II was about to dismiss him:\n\n:All Bismarck's resources were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria to use her influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on people who did not respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.<ref>Balfour, p. 132.</ref>\n\nChurches honouring Frederick include the [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche]] in Berlin and the former [[Kalthof Church]] in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]].

({{lang-de|Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl}}; 18 October 1831&nbsp;\u2013 15 June 1888) was [[German Emperor]] and [[King of Prussia]] for ninety-nine days in 1888, the [[Year of the Three Emperors]]. Known informally as \"Fritz\",<ref name=\"MacDonogh-17\">MacDonogh, p. 17.</ref> he was the only son of [[Emperor Wilhelm I]] and was raised in his family's tradition of military service. Although celebrated as a young man for his leadership and successes during the [[Second Schleswig War|Second Schleswig]], [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian]] and [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian]] wars,<ref name=\"Kollander-79\">Kollander, p. 79.</ref><ref name=\"LondonNews\">''[[The Illustrated London News]]''</ref> he nevertheless professed a hatred of warfare and was praised by friends and enemies alike for his humane conduct. Following the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871 his father, then King of Prussia, became the German Emperor. Upon Wilhelm's death at the age of ninety on 9 March 1888, the thrones passed to Frederick, who had by then been German Crown Prince for seventeen years and Crown Prince of Prussia for twenty-seven years. Frederick was suffering from [[cancer of the larynx]] when he died, aged fifty-six, following unsuccessful medical treatments for his condition.\n\nFrederick married [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], eldest daughter of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]]. The couple were well-matched; their shared [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] ideology led them to seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, in spite of his [[conservative]] militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies as a result of his ties with Britain and his studies at the [[University of Bonn]]. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative [[German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick would move to liberalize the German Empire.\n\nFrederick and Victoria were great admirers of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], Queen Victoria's husband. They planned to rule as consorts, like Albert and Queen Victoria, and to reform what they saw as flaws in the executive branch that Bismarck had created for himself. The office of Chancellor, responsible to the Emperor, would be replaced with a British-style cabinet, with ministers responsible to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]. Government policy would be based on the consensus of the cabinet. Frederick \"described the Imperial Constitution as ''ingeniously contrived chaos.''\"<ref>Balfour, p. 69.</ref> According to [[Michael Balfour (historian)|Michael Balfour]]:\n\n{{quote|The Crown Prince and Princess shared the outlook of the [[German Progress Party|Progressive Party]], and Bismarck was haunted by the fear that should the old Emperor die\u2014and he was now in his seventies\u2014they would call on one of the Progressive leaders to become Chancellor. He sought to guard against such a turn by keeping the Crown Prince from a position of any influence and by using foul means as well as fair to make him unpopular.<ref>Balfour, p. 70.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Frederick's illness prevented him from effectively establishing policies and measures to achieve this, and such moves as he was able to make were later abandoned by his son and successor, [[Wilhelm II]]. The timing of Frederick's death and the length of his reign are important topics among historians. His premature demise is considered a potential turning point in German history;<ref name=\"Tipton-175\">Tipton, p. 175.</ref> and whether or not he would have made the Empire more liberal if he had lived longer is still discussed.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl von Preu\u00dfen, ca 1841.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick William, ca. 1841]]\nFrederick William was born in the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace]] at [[Potsdam]] in Prussia on 18 October 1831. He was a scion of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], rulers of Prussia, then the most powerful of the German states. Frederick's father, [[William I, German Emperor|Prince William]], was a younger brother of [[King Frederick William IV]] and, having been raised in the military traditions of the Hohenzollerns, developed into a strict disciplinarian. William fell in love with his cousin [[Elisa Radziwill]], a princess of the [[Polish nobility]], but the court felt Elisa's rank was not suitable for the bride of a Prussian prince and forced a more suitable match.<ref name=\"VdK-10\">Van der Kiste, p. 10.</ref> The woman selected to be his wife, Princess [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar]], had been raised in the more intellectual and artistic atmosphere of [[Weimar]], which gave its citizens greater participation in politics and limited the powers of its rulers through a [[constitution]];<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\">Dorpalen, p. 2.</ref><ref name=\"Kollander-1\">Kollander, p. 1.</ref> Augusta was well known across Europe for her liberal views.<ref name=\"VdK-11\">Van der Kiste, p. 11.</ref> Because of their differences, the couple did not have a happy marriage and,<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\" /><ref name=\"Kollander-1\" /> as a result, Frederick grew up in a troubled household, which left him with memories of a lonely childhood.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\" /><ref name=\"VdK-12\">Van der Kiste, p. 12.</ref> He had one sister, [[Princess Louise of Prussia|Louise]] (later Grand Duchess of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]]), who was eight years his junior and very close to him. Frederick also had a very good relationship with his uncle, King Frederick William IV, who has been called \"the romantic on the throne\".<ref name=\"Fred\">Oster, pp. 60\u201365.</ref>\n[[File:Oskar Begas Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm von Preu\u00dfen 1867.jpg|thumb|right|Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia, 1867, by [[Oskar Begas]]]]\nFrederick grew up during a tumultuous political period as the concept of [[liberalism in Germany]], which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support.<ref name=\"Palmowski-43\">Palmowski, p. 43.</ref> The liberals sought a unified Germany and were [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchists]] who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights.<ref name=\"Sperber-64\">Sperber, p. 64.</ref> Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation.<ref name=\"Kollander-1\" /> When Frederick was 17, these emergent [[nationalism|nationalistic]] and liberal sentiments sparked a [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|series of political uprisings]] across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of the press]], and to create a German [[parliament]] and constitution.<ref name=\"Palmowski-43\" /><ref name=\"Sperber-128-129\">Sperber, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-554\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 554.</ref>\n\nDespite the value placed by the Hohenzollern family on a traditional military education, Augusta insisted that her son also receive a classical education.<ref name=\"VdK-12\" /> Accordingly, Frederick was thoroughly tutored in both military traditions and the [[liberal arts]]. His private tutor was [[Ernst Curtius]], a famous archaeologist.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Frederick was a talented student, particularly good at foreign languages, becoming fluent in English and French, and studying Latin. He also studied history, geography, physics, music and religion, and excelled at gymnastics; as required of a Prussian prince, he became a very good rider.<ref name=\"M-B-44\">Mueller-Bohn, p. 44.</ref> Hohenzollern princes were made familiar with the military traditions of their dynasty at an early age; Frederick was ten when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the First Infantry Regiment of Guards. As he grew older, he was expected to maintain an active involvement in military affairs.<ref name=\"M-B-14\">Mueller-Bohn, p. 14.</ref> However, at the age of 18, he broke with family tradition and entered the [[University of Bonn]] where he studied history, law and governance, and public policy. During his time at Bonn (1850\u20131852), his teachers included [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] and [[Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann]].<ref name=\"Fred\"/> His time spent at the university, coupled with the influence of less conservative family members, were instrumental in his embrace of liberal beliefs.<ref name=\"Nichols-7\">Nichols, p. 7.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, Frederick was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] by his father, then [[William I, German Emperor|Prince William of Prussia]], and would later become Master of the Order of the [[Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany]].<ref name=\"speth\">Speth, George William.

The royal dynasty in Britain was predominantly German; there was little British blood in Queen Victoria, and none in her husband.<ref name=\"VdK-15\">Van der Kiste, p. 15.</ref> The monarchs desired to maintain their family's blood ties to Germany, and Prince Albert further hoped that the marriage would lead to the liberalization and modernization of Prussia. King [[Leopold I of Belgium]], uncle of the British monarch and consort, also favoured this pairing; he had long treasured [[Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]]'s idea of a marriage alliance between Britain and Prussia.<ref name=\"VdK-16\">Van der Kiste, p. 16.</ref> Frederick's father, Prince William, had no interest in the arrangement, hoping instead for a [[List of Grand Duchesses of Russia|Russian Grand Duchess]] as his daughter-in-law.<ref name=\"VdK-15\" /> However, Princess Augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with Britain.<ref name=\"MacDonogh-17\" /> In 1851, his mother sent Frederick to England, ostensibly to visit the [[Great Exhibition]] but in truth, she hoped that the cradle of liberalism and home of the industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son. Prince Albert took Frederick under his wing during his stay but it was Albert's daughter, only eleven at the time, who guided the German prince around the Exhibition. Frederick only knew a few words of English, while Victoria could converse fluently in German. He was impressed by her mix of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity, and their meeting proved to be a success. A regular exchange of letters between Victoria and Frederick followed.<ref name=\"Fred\"/>\n\nFrederick proposed to Victoria in 1855, when she was 14 years old. The betrothal of the young couple was announced on May 19, 1857, at Buckingham Palace and the Prussian Court,<ref name=\"VdK-31\">Van der Kiste, p. 31.</ref> and their marriage took place on 25 January 1858 in the Chapel Royal of [[St. James's Palace]], London. To mark the occasion, Frederick was promoted to Major-General in the Prussian army. Although it was an arranged marriage, the newlyweds were compatible from the start and their marriage was a loving one;<ref name=\"MacDonogh-17-18\">MacDonogh, pp. 17\u201318.</ref><ref name=\"VdK-43\">Van der Kiste, p. 43.</ref> Victoria too had received a liberal education and shared her husband's views. Of the two, Victoria was the dominant one in the relationship.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> The couple often resided at the [[Kronprinzenpalais|Crown Prince's Palace]] and had eight children: [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] in 1859, [[Charlotte, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen|Charlotte]] in 1860, [[Albert Wilhelm Heinrich of Prussia|Henry]] in 1862, [[Prince Sigismund of Prussia (1864-1866)|Sigismund]] in 1864, [[Princess Viktoria of Prussia|Victoria]] in 1866, [[Prince Waldemar of Prussia (1868-1879)|Waldemar]] in 1868, [[Sophia of Prussia|Sophia]] in 1870 and [[Princess Margaret of Prussia|Margaret]] in 1872. Sigismund died at the age of 2 and Waldemar at age 11,<ref name=\"Kollander-21\">Kollander, p. 21.</ref> and their eldest son, Wilhelm, suffered from a withered arm\u2014probably due to his difficult and dangerous [[breech birth]], although it could have also resulted from a mild case of [[cerebral palsy]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-12\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 12.</ref><ref name=\"MacDonogh-22\">MacDonogh, p. 22.</ref> Wilhelm, who became emperor after Frederick's death, shared none of his parents' liberal ideas; his mother viewed him as a \"complete Prussian\".<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-101\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 101.</ref> This difference in ideology created a rift between Wilhelm and his parents (which was exacerbated by Bismarck's interference), and relations between them were strained throughout their lives.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-101\" /><ref name=\"R\u00f6hl-xiii\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. xiii.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nEmperor Frederick III was a [[Lutheran]] member of the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces]].

Already twenty-nine years old, he would be Crown Prince for a further twenty-seven years. The new king was initially considered politically neutral; Frederick and Prussia's liberal elements hoped that he would usher in a new era of liberal policies. The liberals managed to greatly increase their majority in the Prussian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] (''Landtag''), but William soon showed that he preferred the conservative ways. On the other hand, Frederick declared himself in complete agreement with the \"essential liberal policy for internal and foreign affairs\".<ref name=\"VdK-68\">Van der Kiste, p. 68.</ref>\n\nBecause William was a dogmatic soldier and unlikely to change his ideas at the age of sixty-four,<ref name=\"VdK-61\">Van der Kiste, p. 61.</ref> he regularly clashed with the Diet over policies. In September 1862, one such disagreement almost led to Frederick being crowned and replacing his father as king; William threatened to abdicate when the Diet refused to fund his plans for the army's reorganization. Frederick was appalled by this action, and said that an abdication would \"constitute a threat to the dynasty, country and Crown\".<ref name=\"Pakula-168\">Pakula, p. 168.</ref> William reconsidered, and instead on the advice of Minister of War [[Albrecht von Roon]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]], who had offered to push through the military reform even against the majority of the Diet, as [[Prime Minister of Prussia|Minister-President]]. The appointment of Bismarck, an authoritarian who would often ignore or overrule the Diet, set Frederick on a collision course with his father and led to his exclusion from affairs of state for the rest of William's reign. Frederick insisted on bloodless \"moral conquests\", unifying Germany by liberal and peaceful means, but it was Bismarck's policy of [[blood and iron]] that prevailed.<ref name=\"Nichols-7\" /> His protests against William's rule peaked at [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] on 4 June 1863, where at an official reception in the city he loudly denounced Bismarck's restrictions on freedom of the press.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-11\">Dorpalen, p. 11.</ref><ref>Kollander, pp. 38\u201345</ref><ref>Oster, pp. 63\u201364</ref> He thereby made Bismarck his enemy and his father extremely angry.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Consequently, Frederick was excluded from positions of political power throughout his father's reign. Retaining his military portfolio, he continued to represent Germany and its Emperor at ceremonies, weddings, and celebrations such as Queen Victoria's [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]] in 1887.<ref name=\"VdK-130+\">Van der Kiste, pp. 130\u201331.</ref> Frederick would spend a large portion of time in Britain, where Queen Victoria frequently allowed him to represent her at ceremonies and social functions.<ref name=\"Pakula-69\">Pakula, p. 69.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia - Illustrated London News August 20, 1870.PNG| 20 August 1870, ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' celebrates the Crown Prince's [[Franco-Prussian War]] achievements|thumb|upright|left]]\nFrederick fought in the wars against Denmark, Austria and France. Although he had opposed military action in each case, once war had started he supported the Prussian military wholeheartedly and took positions of command. Since he had no political influence at all, these were opportunities to prove himself.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Frederick experienced his first combat in the [[Second Schleswig War]]. Appointed to supervise the supreme [[German Confederation]] commander [[Friedrich Graf von Wrangel|Field Marshal Wrangel]] and his staff, the Crown Prince tactfully managed disputes between Wrangel and the other officers. The Prussians and their [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] allies defeated the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danes]] and conquered the southern part of [[Jutland]], but after the war, they spent two years politicking to assume leadership of the German states. This culminated in the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. Frederick \"was the only member of the Prussian Crown Council to uphold the rights of the [[Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein|Duke of Augustenberg]] and oppose the idea of a war with Austria which he described as ''fratricide''.\" Although he supported unification and the restoration of the medieval empire, \"Fritz could not accept that war was the right way to unite Germany.\".<ref>Balfour, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> However, when war with Austria broke out, he accepted command of one of Prussia's three armies, with General [[Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal]] as his chief of staff. The timely arrival of his II Army was crucial to the Prussian victory in 1866 at the decisive [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]], which won the war for Prussia.<ref name=\"Lord-125\">Lord, p. 125.</ref> Nevertheless, the bloodshed caused him great dismay.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> A few days before K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, Frederick had written to his wife, expressing his hope that this would be the last war he would have to fight. On the third day of the battle he wrote to her again: \"Who knows whether we may not have to wage a third war in order to keep what we have now won?\"<ref name=\"Pakula-98\">Pakula, p. 98.</ref>\n\nFour years later Frederick was in action again, this time during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, in which he was once more paired with Blumenthal and commanded the III Army, consisting of troops from the southern German states.<ref name=\"Howard-60\">Howard, p. 60.</ref><ref name=\"Kollander-92\">Kollander, p. 92.</ref> He was praised for his leadership after defeating the French at the battles of [[Battle of Wissembourg (1870)|Wissembourg]] and [[Battle of W\u00f6rth (1870)|W\u00f6rth]],<ref name=\"Kollander-92\" /> and met with further successes at the [[Battle of Sedan]] and during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]]. Frederick's humane treatment of his country's foes earned him their respect and the plaudits of neutral observers.<ref name=\"Kollander-109\">Kollander, p. 109.</ref> After the Battle of W\u00f6rth, a London journalist witnessed the Crown Prince's many visits to wounded Prussian soldiers and lauded his deeds, extolling the love and respect the soldiers held for Frederick. Following his victory, Frederick had remarked to two Paris journalists, \"I do not like war gentlemen. If I should reign I would never make it.\"<ref name=\"LondonNews\" /> One French journalist remarked that \"the Crown Prince has left countless traits of kindness and humanity in the land that he fought against.\"<ref name=\"Kollander-109\" /> For his behaviour and accomplishments, ''[[The Times]]'' wrote a tribute to Frederick in July 1871, stating that \"the Prince has won as much honour for his gentleness as for his prowess in the war\".<ref name=\"Kollander-109\" />\n\n==Crown Prince of the German Empire==\n[[File:Friedrich III as Kronprinz - in GdK uniform by Heinrich von Angeli 1874.jpg|Frederick as crown prince, 1874, by [[Heinrich von Angeli]]|thumb|upright|right]]\nIn 1871, following Prussia's victories, the German states were united into the [[German Empire]], with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent to the new [[German monarchy]]. Although William thought the day when he became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> Bismarck, now [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]], disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals<ref name=\"Dorpalen-6\">Dorpalen, p. 6.</ref> in their opposition to the expansion of the empire's army.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-1\">Dorpalen, p. 1.</ref> The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of [[Bornstedt (Potsdam)|Bornstedt]] near Potsdam.<ref name=\"M-B-420\">Mueller-Bohn, p. 420.</ref><ref name=\"VdK-89\">Van der Kiste, p. 89.</ref> To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new [[Bode Museum|Kaiser Friedrich Museum]] (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death.<ref name=\"VdK-128\">Van der Kiste, p. 128.</ref> In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again.

Frederick is standing behind his father, while his brother-in-law, the Grand Duke of Baden leads the cheering.]]\n\nDuring an effort led, between 1879 and 1881, by the ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement|v\u00f6lkisch]]'' historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] and the court chaplain, [[Adolf Stoecker]], to dis-emancipate German Jews,<ref>R\u00f6hl 1994, pp. 198\u2013199.</ref> the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were in opposition, Victoria writing that she saw \"Treitschke and his supporters as lunatics of the most dangerous sort\", and opining that Pastor Stoecker properly belonged in an insane asylum.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\">R\u00f6hl 1994, p. 198.</ref> She went on to write that she felt ashamed of her adopted country because people like Treitschke and Stoecker \"behave so ''hatefully'' towards people of a different faith and another race who become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!\".<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/> Clad in the uniform of a Prussian [[field marshal]] Frederick, together with Victoria, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for tolerance in contrast to what Victoria called Treitschke's \"disgraceful attacks\".<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/> Shortly afterward, Frederick gave a speech denouncing the [[History of the Jews in Germany#1815\u20131918|anti-Semitic movement]] in Germany as \"a shameful blot on our time\", adding that \"We are ashamed of the ''Judenhetze'' [persecution of Jews] which has broken all bounds of decency in Berlin, but which seems to flourish under the protection of the Court clerics.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/> In 1881, Frederick and Victoria again attended a synagogue service, this time in [[Wiesbaden]] \"to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are\".<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/> Frederick followed this up by giving a speech in which he spoke out for \"poor, ill-treated Jews\" of Europe.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/> Frederick's mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, wrote to thank him for his speech, saying she was proud that her daughter had married someone like him, but within ''[[Junker]]'' circles, Frederick was widely criticised for his actions in support of the Jews.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/> Prominent among the Crown Prince's critics was his eldest son, Prince Wilhelm, who called his father a weak, cowardly man controlled by Wilhelm's British mother and the Jews.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/> Beyond Wilhelm, many of the \"reactionary and 'chauvinistic' circles in Germany\" had, in the words of the British historian [[John C. G. R\u00f6hl]] come to the \"...conviction that the Crown Prince and his liberal English wife were an alien, un-German force that must not be allowed to accede to the throne\".<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl\"/>\n\n==Illness and decline==\n[[File:Morell_Mackenzie_2.jpg|Morell Mackenzie, whose treatment of Frederick caused controversy|thumb|upright|right]]\nFrederick had been a heavy smoker for many years.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 645\u2013646.</ref> At a ball held by William on 31 January 1887, a guest reported the Crown Prince \"was so hoarse that he could hardly say a word.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> His hoarseness continued through February, and was diagnosed as a thickening of the mucous membrane over the vocal cords, caused by \"a chronic laryngeal catarrh.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> On 7 February, Frederick consulted a doctor, Karl Gerhardt, who scraped a wire across the membrane for 10 days in an attempt to remove thickened tissue. After the procedure proved unsuccessful, Gerhardt cauterised the left vocal cord with an electric wire on 15 March in an attempt to remove what was then thought to be a [[vocal fold nodule]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> Due to Frederick's highly inflamed throat, Gerhardt was unable to remove the entire growth. After several cauterisations, and with no signs of improvement, Frederick and his wife went to the spa of [[Bad Ems]], where he drank the mineral waters and underwent a regimen of gargles and inhaling fresh air, with no effect.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/>\n\nOn 17 May, Gerhardt and other doctors, including [[Ernst von Bergmann]], diagnosed the growth as [[laryngeal cancer]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm-645,646\"/> Bergmann recommended consulting a leading British cancer specialist, [[Morell Mackenzie]]; he also recommended a [[thyrotomy]] to gain better access to the inside of the larynx, followed by the complete removal of the larynx \u2013 a total [[laryngectomy]] \u2013 if the situation proved serious. While Victoria was informed of the need for an immediate operation, Frederick was not told.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 647-48\"/> Despite the tentative diagnosis of cancer, the doctors hoped the growth would prove to be a benign [[epithelioma]]. A room on the top floor of the Crown Prince's palace was then equipped as an operating theatre, but Bergmann elected to put the operation on hold until Mackenzie could provide his assessment.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 647-48\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 647\u2013648.</ref> Mackenzie arrived in Berlin on 20 May, but after examining Frederick recommended a [[biopsy]] of the growth to determine whether or not it was malignant. He conducted the biopsy the following morning, after which he sent tissue samples to the distinguished pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] for microscopic examination. When Virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses, Mackenzie declared his opposition to a laryngectomy being performed, as he felt it would be invariably fatal, and said he would assume charge of the case. He gave his assurance that Frederick would fully recover \"in a few months.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 649-50\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 649\u2013650.</ref> While Gerhardt and Physician-General August Wegner concurred with Mackenzie, Bergmann and his colleague Adalbert Tobold held to their original diagnosis of cancer. In addition to Mackenzie's opinion, Bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on Frederick's throat, and pressed the Kaiser to veto it.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 649-50\"/> On 9 June, Mackenzie again biopsied the growth and sent the samples to Virchow, who reported the following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 649-50\"/>\n\nOn 13 June, the Crown Prince left Potsdam for London to attend his mother-in-law's Golden Jubilee and to consult Mackenzie. He never saw his father alive again. He was accompanied by Victoria and their three younger daughters, along with Gerhardt; on 29 June, Mackenzie reported that he had successfully operated at his Harley Street clinic, and had removed \"''nearly'' the entire growth.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 654\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 654.</ref> Frederick spent July with his family at [[Norris Castle]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. However, when Frederick visited Mackenzie's office on 2 August for a follow-up examination, the growth had reappeared, necessitating its cauterisation the same day, and again on 8 August \u2013 an ominous indication that it was indeed malignant. Felix Semon, a distinguished German throat specialist with a practice in England, and who had been closely following Frederick's case, submitted a report to the German Foreign Secretary in which he strongly criticised Mackenzie's cauterisations, and gave his opinion that the growth, if not malignant, was suspect, and should continue to be biopsied and examined.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 656-57\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 656\u2013657.</ref> On 9 August, Frederick travelled to [[Braemar]] in the Scottish Highlands with Dr. Mark Hovell, a senior surgeon at the Throat Hospital in London. Although a further examination by Mackenzie on 20 August revealed no sign of a recurrent growth, Frederick said he had the \"constant feeling\" of something \"not right inside\";  nonetheless, he requested Queen Victoria to knight Mackenzie, who duly received a knighthood in September.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 658-59\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 658\u2013659.</ref>\n\nDespite the operations on his throat and having taken the sea air at [[Cowes]], Frederick remained hoarse and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the [[Italian Riviera]]. In August, following reports that his father was gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to [[Toblach]] in [[South Tyrol]] with his family, where Victoria had rented a house.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 659-62\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 659\u2013662.</ref> He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 659-62\"/> Concerned by Frederick's lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, [[Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg]], consulted the distinguished [[laryngologist]] [[Max Joseph Oertel]], who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick's throat, and said he suspected a benign tumour which could soon become malignant.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 662-63\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 662\u2013663.</ref> By this time, Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the hoarseness to a \"momentary chill.\" However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for [[Venice]], to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick's throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 664-66\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 664\u2013666.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ernst_von_Bergmann_1.jpg|thumb|right|Professor Ernst von Bergmann, who attended to Frederick throughout his illness]]\nUpon arriving in Venice, Frederick again caught cold; privately, Mackenzie was growing seriously concerned, having observed a continued tendency for Frederick's throat and larynx to swell. He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting that if the Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he could give him no more than three months to live.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 664-66\"/> At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that \"Fritz's throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety & he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 671\u2013673.</ref> On 6 October, Frederick, his family and Mackenzie left for a villa at [[Baveno]] on the shore of [[Lake Maggiore]], with Mackenzie leaving Baveno on 8 October, after predicting Frederick's recovery \"in 3 or 4 months,\" wrote Victoria.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/> Their elder son Wilhelm joined them at Baveno on 17 October for Frederick's 56th birthday the following day.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/> At the end of October, Frederick's condition abruptly worsened, with Victoria writing to her mother on 2 November that Frederick's throat was again inflamed, but not due to any cold, and that he was \"very hoarse again\" and easily became depressed about his health. General [[Alfred von Waldersee]] observed that Frederick's health had grave implications as if William died soon and his son succeeded, \"a new Kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility, quite apart from the fact that we desperately need a highly energetic one.\" His son Wilhelm reported to King [[Albert of Saxony]] that his father was frequently short-tempered and melancholic, though his voice appeared to have slightly improved, and that Frederick's throat was being treated by \"blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe the larynx.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/>\n\nOn 3 November, Frederick and his entourage departed for [[Sanremo|San Remo]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 671-73\"/> At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 690-91\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 690\u2013691.</ref> Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while there was no immediate danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had \"unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn,\" and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology [[Leopold von Schr\u00f6tter|Leopold Schr\u00f6tter]] and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 690-91\"/> On 9 November, Schr\u00f6tter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 690-91\"/> All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared on the right side of the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 694-97\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 694\u2013697.</ref> Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, \"To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?\"<ref name=\"Pakula-448\">Pakula, p. 448.</ref><ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 694-97\"/> Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a [[tracheotomy]] if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 694-97\"/> The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering \"foreigner\" who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father \"whether he is ill or not, [and] whether the K[aiser] is then unable permanently to perform his duties,\" would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 702-05\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 702\u2013705.</ref> Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 699-701\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 699\u2013701.</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 1887, Frederick wrote that his \"chronic catarrh\" appeared to be taking \"a turn for the better and that \"a further bond has been forged between our people and myself; may God preserve it by giving me, when I resume my duties, the capacity to prove myself worthy of the great trust that has been shown me!\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 699-701\"/> A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his hoarseness and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected right side of his throat becoming inflamed.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 773-77\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 773\u2013777.</ref> He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured.

The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann's actions resulted in an [[abscess]] in Frederick's neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life.<ref name=\"Sinc-204\" /> Later, Frederick would ask \"Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?\"<ref name=\"Sinc-204\" /> and complain that \"Bergmann ill-treated [me]\".<ref name=\"Sinc-204\" />\n\nEven after the tracheotomy, Frederick continued to run high fevers and suffered from headaches and insomnia. His violent coughing continued, bringing up bloody [[sputum]]. Apart from Mackenzie, the other doctors, led by Bergmann, now held the firm opinion that the Crown Prince's disease was cancer and that it had possibly spread to his lungs. The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer was conclusively confirmed on 6 March, when the [[anatomist]] Professor [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Wilhelm Waldeyer]], who had come to San Remo, examined Frederick's sputum under a microscope and confirmed the presence of \"so-called cancroid bodies...from a cancerous new growth\" that was in the larynx. He further said that there were no signs of any growths in the lungs.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 778-782\"/> Though it finally settled the question, Waldeyer's diagnosis threw all of Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick into doubt.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 778-782\"/> The diagnosis and treatment of Frederick's fatal illness caused some medical controversy well into the next century.<ref>Westman, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n<!-- Removed: the following would be better as a footnote appended to the end of \"such an operation had never been successfully performed without the death of the patient.\" or in Bergmann's article\nYears later, Bergmann tried to prove to his medical students that he could have saved Frederick III by removing his larynx.

Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, \"...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense.\"<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 788-89\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 788\u2013789.</ref> Germany's progressive elements hoped that William's death, and thus Frederick's succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-1\" /><ref name=\"Sheehan-217\">Sheehan, p. 217.</ref> Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either '''Frederick I''' (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or '''Frederick IV''' (if it was considered a continuation of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]], which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 788-89\"/> The new Kaiser reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his \"pitiful\" appearance.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 790-91\">R\u00f6hl 1998, pp. 790\u2013791.</ref> The question now was how much longer the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if anything, he could hope to achieve.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 788-89\"/> In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as Emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle from his jacket and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as Empress.<ref name=\"VdK-193\">Van der Kiste, p. 193.</ref> Too ill to march in his father's funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the [[Charlottenburg Palace]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 790-91\"/>\n\nAs the German Emperor, he officially received Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (his mother-in-law) and [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway]], and attended the wedding of his son Prince Henry to his niece [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Irene]]. However, Frederick reigned for only 99&nbsp;days,<ref name=\"Kitchen-214\">Kitchen, p. 214.</ref> and was unable to bring about much lasting change.<ref name=\"Cecil-110\">Cecil, p. 110.</ref> The majority of the German ruling elite viewed Frederick's reign as merely a brief interim period before the accession of his son Wilhelm to the throne.<ref name=\"R\u00f6hl_Young_Wilhelm 792\">R\u00f6hl 1998, p. 792.</ref>  An edict he penned before he ascended to the throne that would limit the powers of the chancellor and monarch under the constitution was never put into effect,<ref name=\"Kollander-147\">Kollander, p. 147.</ref> although he did force [[Robert von Puttkamer]] to resign as Prussian [[Minister of the Interior]] on 8 June, when evidence indicated that Puttkamer had interfered in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] elections.

Sheehan]] states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization.<ref name=\"Sheehan-216\">Sheehan, p. 216.</ref> Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany,<ref name=\"Dorpalen-30\">Dorpalen, p. 30.</ref> and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-31\">Dorpalen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nFrederick's children\u2014Wilhelm in particular\u2014held various political positions and greatly influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced the horrors of war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family's military heritage, coming under Bismarck's tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick's and Victoria's liberal ways, felt bound to increase the tensions between Wilhelm and his parents.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger-243\">Feuchtwanger, p. 243.</ref> Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government; shortly after his father's death he proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I, and made no reference to Frederick III.<ref name=\"Kollander-178\">Kollander, p. 178.</ref> Wilhelm II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.<ref name=\"Dorpalen-2\" /><ref name=\"Dorpalen-31\" />\n\nBismarck's plan of undermining Frederick and Victoria, and of using Wilhelm II as a tool for retaining his own power, led to his own downfall. As it turned out, Wilhelm did share his father's conviction that the position of the chancellor was too strong and should be modified in favour of a more powerful Emperor.<ref name=\"Fred\"/> When Bismarck realized that Wilhelm II was about to dismiss him:\n\n:All Bismarck's resources were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria to use her influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on people who did not respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.<ref>Balfour, p. 132.</ref>\n\nChurches honouring Frederick include the [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche]] in Berlin and the former [[Kalthof Church]] in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]].

Blainey next turned to the rhythms of global history in the industrial period.... Because of his authority as a historian, he was increasingly in demand as a commentator on Australian public affairs.<ref>[[Geoffrey  Bolton|Bolton, Geoffrey]]. \"Geoffrey Blainey\" in Kelly Boyd, ed.

While at university he resided at [[Queen's College (University of Melbourne)|Queen's College]], and was editor of ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'', the newspaper of the [[University of Melbourne Student Union]].\n\nAfter graduating, Blainey took a freelance writing assignment and travelled to the Mount Lyell mining field in Tasmania to research and write the history of the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]], at [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]].

He then became inaugural chairman of the Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts (Later called Australia Council), set up by the [[Whitlam government]]. He served on the Council from 1977\u20131981.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> Following Whitlam's election promise to introduce a Public Lending Right Scheme for authors, Blainey was appointed chairman of the committee representing authors, publishers and librarians that, in 1973, recommended the scheme adopted by the government a year later. Australia's scheme differed from the pioneering scheme adopted in Denmark in 1946. Blainey represented writers on the small group instructed to find the new national anthem that Whitlam had promised. From that initiative came a public poll supporting the long-standing Australian patriotic song, \"[[Advance Australia Fair]]\".<ref>Australian Council for the Arts: First Annual Report, Jan.-Dec. 1973, and linked press releases</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, Blainey was an Australian delegate to the first [[UNESCO]] conference held in Asia, in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]]; it recommended cultural policies for Asia.\n\nBlainey was deputy chairman in 1974 and 1975 of the Whitlam government's Inquiry into Museums and National Collections, whose report ultimately led to the completion in Canberra, in 2001, of the [[National Museum of Australia]] with its emphasis on indigenous history.<ref>Who's Who in Australia, various editions since 1965</ref> Most of the Inquiry's report had been drafted by Blainey and his colleague, Professor JD Mulvaney.\n \nIn 1976, he became an inaugural commissioner on the Australian Heritage Commission, set up by the Fraser government to decide on conservation and environmental matters.

From 1994 to 1998, he was the Foundation Chancellor of the [[University of Ballarat]].<ref name=\"UBH\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Blainey presented the [[Boyer Lectures]] on the theme ''This Land is all Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions''.<ref name=\"Boyer\">{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyerlectures/stories/2001/1715576.htm | title = This Land is all Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions| work = Boyer Lectures | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 11 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Howard government]], he served as a member of the council of the [[Australian War Memorial]] in Canberra from 1997 to 2004, an appointment initially criticised in parliament by [[Laurie Brereton]] of the Labor opposition but approved  in other circles. There was no opposition when his first three-year term was renewed. \n \nAt the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1998 convention|Constitutional Convention]], held in Canberra for 10 days in February 1998 to debate and vote on whether Australia should become a republic (and if so what kind of a republic), he was a non-elected delegate. He argued that Australia was already a \"de facto republic\" and that any further change should be made only if the case was very powerful. With his ally, [[George Mye]] from the [[Torres Strait Islands]], he was the leading critic of the adopted proposal that any citizen whose name was on the general electoral roll, even a migrant of only two years' standing, should automatically be eligible to be president of the proposed republic of Australia.<ref>Report of the Constitutional Convention, Canberra, 1998, vol. 3, pp. 221\u20133)</ref> After the decisive failure in 1999 of the referendum to make Australia a republic, Blainey and the constitutional lawyer, Professor Colin Howard, were singled out by the Australian republicans' leader, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], as deserving a special share of the blame. He alleged that the pair had unduly shaped the official information posted to all electors. In their defence, it was contended that their influence was fair, for they operated in an official committee chaired by the neutral Sir [[Ninian Stephen]], lawyer and former governor general.<ref>Malcolm Turnbull, Fighting for the Republic, Hardie Grant, 1999)</ref>\n\nBlainey served on the National Council for the Centenary of Federation from 1997 to 2002 (chairman from May 2001, succeeding Archbishop [[Peter Hollingworth]]), and chairman of the Council of the [[Centenary Medal]] from 2001\u201303. Later appointments included membership of the History Summit in Canberra in 2006 and the federal committee set up in 2007 to recommend a national curriculum for teaching Australian history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} \n \nHe sat, from 1997 to 2004, on the Council of the [[Royal Humane Society of Australasia]] which recommended awards for acts of civilian bravery. \n \nIn the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, he was a weekly or fortnightly columnist for ''[[The Australian]]'', the ''[[Melbourne Herald]]'', or the ''[[Melbourne Age]]''; he also wrote often for the ''[[Sydney Bulletin]]'', the ''[[Australian Business Monthly]]'' and other national journals. Booklets listing these articles and other works have been published by the library of [[Monash University]]. The latest booklet was last updated in about 2001. As a book reviewer, he has written for many Australian, UK and US publications. His ten-part series on Australian history, \"The Blainey View\", appeared on ABC television in 1982\u201383, the ABC's most ambitious venture so far on Australian history. [[Graham Kennedy]], the television star, narrated the continuity script.<ref>Graeme Blundell, King: The Life and Comedy of Graham Kennedy, Pan Macmillan, 2003, pp. 124, 356\u201370</ref>\n\nBlainey is well known for speeches, often without notes, on historical and contemporary topics. In most anthologies of notable Australian speeches, present and past, one of his addresses is reprinted.<ref>\"Great Australian Speeches\", edited by Pamela Robson, Murdoch Books, 2009, pp. 180\u201390</ref> On television and stage in later years, [[Max Gillies]] the comedian cleverly mimicked some speeches.\n\nHe currently serves on the boards of philanthropic bodies, including the [[Ian Potter Foundation]] since 1991 and the [[Deafness Foundation Trust]] since 1993, and is patron of others.\n\nBlainey has, at times, been a controversial figure too. In the 1980s, he queried the level of Asian immigration to Australia and the policy of [[multiculturalism]] in speeches, articles and a book ''[[All for Australia]]''. He was said by leftist critics to be closely aligned{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} with the former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] Coalition government of [[John Howard]] in Australia, with Howard shadowing Blainey's conservative views on some issues, especially the view that Australian history has been hijacked by social liberals. As a result of these stances, Blainey is sometimes associated with right-wing politics.<ref name=\"titleAustralian Parliamentary Library - Research Paper 5 1997-98\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |work= Research Papers 1997\u201398 |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library |accessdate=19 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm |archivedate=4 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> Blainey himself is a member of no political party.\n\n==Views on Asian immigration==\nOn 17 March 1984, Blainey addressed a major Rotary conference in the Victorian city of [[Warrnambool]]. He regretted that the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor Government]] in \"a time of large unemployment\" was bringing many new migrants to the areas of high unemployment, thus fostering tension. He blamed the government, not the migrants themselves. Criticising what he viewed as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration, then running at 40 per cent of the annual intake, he added: \"Rarely in the history of the modern world has a nation given such preference to a tiny ethnic minority of its population as the Australian Government has done in the past few years, making that minority the favoured majority in its immigration policy\".<ref>The Age, and Warrnambool Standard, 19 March 1984</ref>\n\nThree days later, in response to the prediction of the \"increasing Asianisation\" of Australia made by Labor's Immigration Minister [[Stewart West]], Blainey argued: \"I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better\".<ref>Source: The Age, 20 March 1984</ref>\n\nBlainey's speech, along with subsequent articles and a book on the subject, ignited nationwide controversy, especially in the Australian federal parliament which had not debated the principles of the immigration policy for many years. Most critics argued that Blainey's views were moderate and not racist. \"All peoples of the world are worthy and deserve respect\": that was the prime principle set out in the book, ''[[All for Australia]]'', which he wrote on the topic; however, in ''All for Australia'' he criticised the belief that \"immigration policy should primarily reflect the truth that all 'races' are equal.<ref>Blainey, Geoffrey. ''All for Australia'', Sydney, 1984, p.164</ref> On the contrary, an immigration policy should not, any more than a trade or tariff policy, be designed primarily to reflect that fact\". According to Blainey, the Australian government's immigration policy was increasingly being influenced by multicultural ideology to the detriment of the national interest and the majority of Australians. He argued: \"We are surrendering much of our own independence to a phantom opinion that floats vaguely in the air and rarely exists on this earth. We should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world\". Blainey also warned that the \"crimson thread of kinship\" invoked by [[Sir Henry Parkes]] was being undermined, stating: \"The cult of the immigrant, the emphasis on separateness for ethnic groups, the wooing of Asia and the shunning of Britain are part of this thread-cutting.\"\n\nHis views were to receive the support of a majority of Australian voters, both Labor and non-Labor voters, as a national Gallup poll confirmed in August.<ref>Melbourne Herald, 27 August 1984 citing an Australian Public Opinion Polls survey of 2182 voters</ref> Victorians especially disapproved of the University's conduct in this matter.\n\nIn contrast, while Blainey was briefly in Europe in May, a professor and 23 other history teachers from the University of Melbourne distributed a public letter distancing themselves from what they called his \"racialist\" views.<ref>Letter to the Age of 19 May 1984 signed by 24 historians</ref><ref>Morgan, Hugh (2006). \"Can Australia Survive the 21st Century?\". The Wilfred Brookes Memorial Lecture. Deakin University</ref> Other historians, including lecturers in Asian history, refused the request to sign the letter.\n\nAfter a crowd of left-wing students and marchers, mostly from outside the University of Melbourne, broke into the heavily guarded building where Blainey was conducting a tutorial in historical research, he was advised by the university on security grounds that it must cancel all his future addresses within the University for the rest of 1984.<ref>Melbourne Sun News Pictorial</ref><ref>ABC TV, 19 June 1984</ref> In Brisbane on 5 July, when he gave a memorial address in honour of a deceased Queensland businessman in the [[Mayne Hall]] at the [[University of Queensland]] and chaired by the chancellor Sir James Foots, noisy protesters tried to dislocate the meeting.<ref>Courier Mail 6 July 1984</ref> These and similar protests were major items in the national television news. Blainey continued to express his views periodically on television, radio and his own newspaper columns but not in his own university. He retained his main position as Dean of the Faculty of Arts.\n\nBlainey and his family were subject to threats of violence, prompting him at the police's request to remove his name and address from the public telephone book and organise security for his home. According to fellow historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]: \"The immediate consequence of all this was that Blainey, easily Australia's best and most prolific living historian, was effectively silenced from speaking at his own university.... This violation of academic freedom, clearly the worst in Australian history, provoked no protest at all from the university's academic staff association, nor from the university council, let alone his own departmental colleagues.\"<ref name=\"quadrant.org.au\">Windschuttle, Keith.

The citation observed that \"few graduates of this University have exerted greater influence on national life\".\n\n==Blainey and the \"History Wars\" ==\nBlainey has been an important contributor to the debate over Australian history, often referred to as the [[History Wars]].\n\nIn his 1993 ''Sir John Latham Memorial Lecture'', Blainey coined the phrases \"[[History wars#Black armband debate|Black armband view of history]]\" versus the contrasting \"three cheers\" view (see [[History wars]]). The phrase \"Black armband view of history\" began to be used, [[pejorative]]ly or otherwise, by some Australian commentators and intellectuals about historians and journalists, judges and clergymen, whom they viewed as having presented an unfairly critical portrayal of [[history of Australia|Australian history]] since European settlement.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nBlainey coined the term the \"Black armband view of history\" to refer to those historians and academics, usually leftist, who denigrated Australia's past to an unusual degree and even accused European Australians of genocide against Aborigines. Former Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] described the Australian history wars as a branch of the \"[[culture wars]]\" and attributed Blainey with having initiated the wider wars in his immigration speeches of 1984.<ref>Malcolm Fraser and Margaret Symons, Fraser: the Political Memoirs, Melbourne University Publishing, 2011, see index and pp. 616\u20137</ref>\n\nReflecting on the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988, Blainey accused some academics and journalists of depicting Australian history since British settlement as essentially a \"story of violence, exploitation, repression, racism, sexism, capitalism, colonialism, and a few other 'isms'.\" Blainey also accused multiculturalists of having \"little respect for the history of Australia between 1788 and 1950,\" claiming that in their eyes \"Australia was a desert between 1788 and 1950 because it was populated largely by people from the British Isles and because it seemed to have a cultural unity, a homogeneity which is the very antithesis of multiculturalism.\"<ref>Blainey, Geoffrey.

This patriotic view of our past had a long run. It saw Australian history as largely a success. While the convict era was a source of shame or unease, nearly everything that came after was believed to be pretty good. There is a rival view, which I call the Black Armband view of history. In recent years it has assailed the optimistic view of history. The black armbands were quietly worn in official circles in 1988. The multicultural folk busily preached their message that until they arrived much of Australian history was a disgrace. The past treatment of Aborigines, of Chinese, of Kanakas, of non-British migrants, of women, the very old, the very young, and the poor was singled out, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not....

Blainey next turned to the rhythms of global history in the industrial period.... Because of his authority as a historian, he was increasingly in demand as a commentator on Australian public affairs.<ref>[[Geoffrey  Bolton|Bolton, Geoffrey]]. \"Geoffrey Blainey\" in Kelly Boyd, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 1'' (1999) pp 93-95</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBlainey was born in [[Melbourne]] and raised in a succession of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n country towns before attending [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] and the [[University of Melbourne]]. While at university he resided at [[Queen's College (University of Melbourne)|Queen's College]], and was editor of ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'', the newspaper of the [[University of Melbourne Student Union]].\n\nAfter graduating, Blainey took a freelance writing assignment and travelled to the Mount Lyell mining field in Tasmania to research and write the history of the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]], at [[Queenstown, Tasmania]]. In the 1950s, many older residents could remember the beginnings of the community. The resultant book, ''[[The Peaks of Lyell]]'' (1954), achieved six editions.<ref>St. David\u2019s Park Publishing in Hobart acquired the rights from Melbourne University Press in 1993 and produced two more editions, the last of which sold out in 2011. See 1993 edition for full details.</ref>  He then wrote a history of his university: ''The University of Melbourne: A Centenary Portrait'' (1956).<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n\nBlainey has published over 35 books,<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/gadfly-geoffrey-blainey-comes-to-praise-christianity-not-to-bury-it/story-e6frg8n6-1226179886632 ''Gadfly Geoffrey Blainey comes to praise Christianity, not to bury it '']; [[The Australian]]; 29 October 2011</ref> including his highly acclaimed ''[[A Short History of the World (Geoffrey Blainey)|A Short History of the World]]''. His works have ranged from sports and local histories to interpreting the motives behind the British settlement of Australia in ''[[The Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History|The Tyranny of Distance]]''; covering over two centuries of human conflict in ''The Causes of War'' (1973); examining the optimism and pessimism in Western society since 1750 in ''The Great See-Saw''; Aboriginal Australia in ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975) and ''A Land Half Won'' (1980); and his exploration of the history of Christianity in ''A Short History of Christianity'' (2011). He has also written general histories of the world and the \"tempestuous\" 20th century.\n\nThroughout the course of his career, Blainey has also written for newspapers and television.

He then became inaugural chairman of the Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts (Later called Australia Council), set up by the [[Whitlam government]]. He served on the Council from 1977\u20131981.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> Following Whitlam's election promise to introduce a Public Lending Right Scheme for authors, Blainey was appointed chairman of the committee representing authors, publishers and librarians that, in 1973, recommended the scheme adopted by the government a year later. Australia's scheme differed from the pioneering scheme adopted in Denmark in 1946. Blainey represented writers on the small group instructed to find the new national anthem that Whitlam had promised. From that initiative came a public poll supporting the long-standing Australian patriotic song, \"[[Advance Australia Fair]]\".<ref>Australian Council for the Arts: First Annual Report, Jan.-Dec. 1973, and linked press releases</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, Blainey was an Australian delegate to the first [[UNESCO]] conference held in Asia, in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]]; it recommended cultural policies for Asia.\n\nBlainey was deputy chairman in 1974 and 1975 of the Whitlam government's Inquiry into Museums and National Collections, whose report ultimately led to the completion in Canberra, in 2001, of the [[National Museum of Australia]] with its emphasis on indigenous history.<ref>Who's Who in Australia, various editions since 1965</ref> Most of the Inquiry's report had been drafted by Blainey and his colleague, Professor JD Mulvaney.\n \nIn 1976, he became an inaugural commissioner on the Australian Heritage Commission, set up by the Fraser government to decide on conservation and environmental matters. On the first council of the National Museum set up by the [[Hawke Government]] in 1984 he was a short-term member.\n\nHe was chairman of the [[Australia Council]] for four years and Chairman of the [[Australia-China Council]] from its inception in 1979 until June 1984. In 2001, he was the Chairman of the National Council for the Centenary of Federation. From 1994 to 1998, he was the Foundation Chancellor of the [[University of Ballarat]].<ref name=\"UBH\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Blainey presented the [[Boyer Lectures]] on the theme ''This Land is all Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions''.<ref name=\"Boyer\">{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyerlectures/stories/2001/1715576.htm | title = This Land is all Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions| work = Boyer Lectures | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 11 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Howard government]], he served as a member of the council of the [[Australian War Memorial]] in Canberra from 1997 to 2004, an appointment initially criticised in parliament by [[Laurie Brereton]] of the Labor opposition but approved  in other circles. There was no opposition when his first three-year term was renewed. \n \nAt the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1998 convention|Constitutional Convention]], held in Canberra for 10 days in February 1998 to debate and vote on whether Australia should become a republic (and if so what kind of a republic), he was a non-elected delegate. He argued that Australia was already a \"de facto republic\" and that any further change should be made only if the case was very powerful. With his ally, [[George Mye]] from the [[Torres Strait Islands]], he was the leading critic of the adopted proposal that any citizen whose name was on the general electoral roll, even a migrant of only two years' standing, should automatically be eligible to be president of the proposed republic of Australia.<ref>Report of the Constitutional Convention, Canberra, 1998, vol. 3, pp. 221\u20133)</ref> After the decisive failure in 1999 of the referendum to make Australia a republic, Blainey and the constitutional lawyer, Professor Colin Howard, were singled out by the Australian republicans' leader, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], as deserving a special share of the blame. He alleged that the pair had unduly shaped the official information posted to all electors. In their defence, it was contended that their influence was fair, for they operated in an official committee chaired by the neutral Sir [[Ninian Stephen]], lawyer and former governor general.<ref>Malcolm Turnbull, Fighting for the Republic, Hardie Grant, 1999)</ref>\n\nBlainey served on the National Council for the Centenary of Federation from 1997 to 2002 (chairman from May 2001, succeeding Archbishop [[Peter Hollingworth]]), and chairman of the Council of the [[Centenary Medal]] from 2001\u201303. Later appointments included membership of the History Summit in Canberra in 2006 and the federal committee set up in 2007 to recommend a national curriculum for teaching Australian history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} \n \nHe sat, from 1997 to 2004, on the Council of the [[Royal Humane Society of Australasia]] which recommended awards for acts of civilian bravery. \n \nIn the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, he was a weekly or fortnightly columnist for ''[[The Australian]]'', the ''[[Melbourne Herald]]'', or the ''[[Melbourne Age]]''; he also wrote often for the ''[[Sydney Bulletin]]'', the ''[[Australian Business Monthly]]'' and other national journals. Booklets listing these articles and other works have been published by the library of [[Monash University]]. The latest booklet was last updated in about 2001. As a book reviewer, he has written for many Australian, UK and US publications. His ten-part series on Australian history, \"The Blainey View\", appeared on ABC television in 1982\u201383, the ABC's most ambitious venture so far on Australian history. [[Graham Kennedy]], the television star, narrated the continuity script.<ref>Graeme Blundell, King: The Life and Comedy of Graham Kennedy, Pan Macmillan, 2003, pp. 124, 356\u201370</ref>\n\nBlainey is well known for speeches, often without notes, on historical and contemporary topics. In most anthologies of notable Australian speeches, present and past, one of his addresses is reprinted.<ref>\"Great Australian Speeches\", edited by Pamela Robson, Murdoch Books, 2009, pp. 180\u201390</ref> On television and stage in later years, [[Max Gillies]] the comedian cleverly mimicked some speeches.\n\nHe currently serves on the boards of philanthropic bodies, including the [[Ian Potter Foundation]] since 1991 and the [[Deafness Foundation Trust]] since 1993, and is patron of others.\n\nBlainey has, at times, been a controversial figure too. In the 1980s, he queried the level of Asian immigration to Australia and the policy of [[multiculturalism]] in speeches, articles and a book ''[[All for Australia]]''. He was said by leftist critics to be closely aligned{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} with the former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] Coalition government of [[John Howard]] in Australia, with Howard shadowing Blainey's conservative views on some issues, especially the view that Australian history has been hijacked by social liberals. As a result of these stances, Blainey is sometimes associated with right-wing politics.<ref name=\"titleAustralian Parliamentary Library - Research Paper 5 1997-98\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |work= Research Papers 1997\u201398 |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library |accessdate=19 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm |archivedate=4 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> Blainey himself is a member of no political party.\n\n==Views on Asian immigration==\nOn 17 March 1984, Blainey addressed a major Rotary conference in the Victorian city of [[Warrnambool]]. He regretted that the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor Government]] in \"a time of large unemployment\" was bringing many new migrants to the areas of high unemployment, thus fostering tension. He blamed the government, not the migrants themselves. Criticising what he viewed as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration, then running at 40 per cent of the annual intake, he added: \"Rarely in the history of the modern world has a nation given such preference to a tiny ethnic minority of its population as the Australian Government has done in the past few years, making that minority the favoured majority in its immigration policy\".<ref>The Age, and Warrnambool Standard, 19 March 1984</ref>\n\nThree days later, in response to the prediction of the \"increasing Asianisation\" of Australia made by Labor's Immigration Minister [[Stewart West]], Blainey argued: \"I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better\".<ref>Source: The Age, 20 March 1984</ref>\n\nBlainey's speech, along with subsequent articles and a book on the subject, ignited nationwide controversy, especially in the Australian federal parliament which had not debated the principles of the immigration policy for many years. Most critics argued that Blainey's views were moderate and not racist. \"All peoples of the world are worthy and deserve respect\": that was the prime principle set out in the book, ''[[All for Australia]]'', which he wrote on the topic; however, in ''All for Australia'' he criticised the belief that \"immigration policy should primarily reflect the truth that all 'races' are equal.<ref>Blainey, Geoffrey. ''All for Australia'', Sydney, 1984, p.164</ref> On the contrary, an immigration policy should not, any more than a trade or tariff policy, be designed primarily to reflect that fact\". According to Blainey, the Australian government's immigration policy was increasingly being influenced by multicultural ideology to the detriment of the national interest and the majority of Australians. He argued: \"We are surrendering much of our own independence to a phantom opinion that floats vaguely in the air and rarely exists on this earth. We should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world\". Blainey also warned that the \"crimson thread of kinship\" invoked by [[Sir Henry Parkes]] was being undermined, stating: \"The cult of the immigrant, the emphasis on separateness for ethnic groups, the wooing of Asia and the shunning of Britain are part of this thread-cutting.\"\n\nHis views were to receive the support of a majority of Australian voters, both Labor and non-Labor voters, as a national Gallup poll confirmed in August.<ref>Melbourne Herald, 27 August 1984 citing an Australian Public Opinion Polls survey of 2182 voters</ref> Victorians especially disapproved of the University's conduct in this matter.\n\nIn contrast, while Blainey was briefly in Europe in May, a professor and 23 other history teachers from the University of Melbourne distributed a public letter distancing themselves from what they called his \"racialist\" views.<ref>Letter to the Age of 19 May 1984 signed by 24 historians</ref><ref>Morgan, Hugh (2006). \"Can Australia Survive the 21st Century?\". The Wilfred Brookes Memorial Lecture. Deakin University</ref> Other historians, including lecturers in Asian history, refused the request to sign the letter.\n\nAfter a crowd of left-wing students and marchers, mostly from outside the University of Melbourne, broke into the heavily guarded building where Blainey was conducting a tutorial in historical research, he was advised by the university on security grounds that it must cancel all his future addresses within the University for the rest of 1984.<ref>Melbourne Sun News Pictorial</ref><ref>ABC TV, 19 June 1984</ref> In Brisbane on 5 July, when he gave a memorial address in honour of a deceased Queensland businessman in the [[Mayne Hall]] at the [[University of Queensland]] and chaired by the chancellor Sir James Foots, noisy protesters tried to dislocate the meeting.<ref>Courier Mail 6 July 1984</ref> These and similar protests were major items in the national television news. Blainey continued to express his views periodically on television, radio and his own newspaper columns but not in his own university. He retained his main position as Dean of the Faculty of Arts.\n\nBlainey and his family were subject to threats of violence, prompting him at the police's request to remove his name and address from the public telephone book and organise security for his home. According to fellow historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]: \"The immediate consequence of all this was that Blainey, easily Australia's best and most prolific living historian, was effectively silenced from speaking at his own university.... This violation of academic freedom, clearly the worst in Australian history, provoked no protest at all from the university's academic staff association, nor from the university council, let alone his own departmental colleagues.\"<ref name=\"quadrant.org.au\">Windschuttle, Keith.

The citation observed that \"few graduates of this University have exerted greater influence on national life\".\n\n==Blainey and the \"History Wars\" ==\nBlainey has been an important contributor to the debate over Australian history, often referred to as the [[History Wars]].\n\nIn his 1993 ''Sir John Latham Memorial Lecture'', Blainey coined the phrases \"[[History wars#Black armband debate|Black armband view of history]]\" versus the contrasting \"three cheers\" view (see [[History wars]]). The phrase \"Black armband view of history\" began to be used, [[pejorative]]ly or otherwise, by some Australian commentators and intellectuals about historians and journalists, judges and clergymen, whom they viewed as having presented an unfairly critical portrayal of [[history of Australia|Australian history]] since European settlement.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nBlainey coined the term the \"Black armband view of history\" to refer to those historians and academics, usually leftist, who denigrated Australia's past to an unusual degree and even accused European Australians of genocide against Aborigines. Former Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] described the Australian history wars as a branch of the \"[[culture wars]]\" and attributed Blainey with having initiated the wider wars in his immigration speeches of 1984.<ref>Malcolm Fraser and Margaret Symons, Fraser: the Political Memoirs, Melbourne University Publishing, 2011, see index and pp. 616\u20137</ref>\n\nReflecting on the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988, Blainey accused some academics and journalists of depicting Australian history since British settlement as essentially a \"story of violence, exploitation, repression, racism, sexism, capitalism, colonialism, and a few other 'isms'.\" Blainey also accused multiculturalists of having \"little respect for the history of Australia between 1788 and 1950,\" claiming that in their eyes \"Australia was a desert between 1788 and 1950 because it was populated largely by people from the British Isles and because it seemed to have a cultural unity, a homogeneity which is the very antithesis of multiculturalism.\"<ref>Blainey, Geoffrey. ''Eye on Australia : Speeches and Essays of Geoffrey Blainey'', Schwartz Books, Melbourne, Vic., 1991, 272 pp.</ref>\n\nBlainey referred to the contrasting positive histories as the \"three cheers\" school.<ref>{{cite news | first= Michael | last= Gordon | url= http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/05/1062549019737.html?from=storyrhs | title= Going down in history | work= | publisher= The Age | date= 6 September 2003 | accessdate= 11 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|To some extent my generation was reared on the Three Cheers view of history. This patriotic view of our past had a long run. It saw Australian history as largely a success. While the convict era was a source of shame or unease, nearly everything that came after was believed to be pretty good. There is a rival view, which I call the Black Armband view of history. In recent years it has assailed the optimistic view of history. The black armbands were quietly worn in official circles in 1988. The multicultural folk busily preached their message that until they arrived much of Australian history was a disgrace. The past treatment of Aborigines, of Chinese, of Kanakas, of non-British migrants, of women, the very old, the very young, and the poor was singled out, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not....

The patriotic monarchy was replaced by an [[Islamic Republic]] based on the principle of rule by Islamic jurists, (or \"''[[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Velayat-e faqih]]''\"), where clerics serve as [[head of state]] and in many powerful governmental roles.  A pro-[[Western culture|Western]], pro-[[United States|American]] foreign policy was exchanged for one of \"neither east nor west\", said to rest on the three \"pillars\" of mandatory veil (''[[hijab]]'') for women, and opposition to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].<ref>[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf Reading Khamenei by Karmin Sadjadpour ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027090356/https://carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf |date=2019-10-27 }} p.14</ref> A rapidly modernizing capitalist economy<ref>[\"Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution\", p.133, 227</ref><ref>''Iran : The Illusion of Power'' by Robert Graham, p.18, 19, 20, 83</ref> was replaced by a [[populism|populist]] and [[Islam]]ic economy and culture.\n\nThe leader of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], was Iran's [[supreme leader]] until his death in 1989.<ref name = \"Britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215140348/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981 |date=2007-12-15 }}.</ref> He was followed by [[Ali Khamenei]].\n\n==General trends==\nDuring the era of the Islamic Republic, Iran has grown from 39 million (1980) to 81.16 million (2017) people.\n\nSome things remain much as they were under the monarchy. Iran has retained its status as a major regional power\u2014it is far larger than any of its gulf neighbors, and possesses large reserves of gas and oil.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\">Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.194</ref> Its national cohesion brought by a long history as a nation, strong central state government and its oil export revenues have brought it \"respectable\" levels of income, literacy, college enrollment, infant mortality, and infrastructure.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\" /> Modern trends found under the monarchy, such as urbanization, growing enrollment in higher education<ref>which went from 155,000 in 1977 to 135,700 in 1982 (when universities reopened after cultural revolution) to a peak of 1,048,000 in 1995. from UNESCO Division of Statistics, quoted in Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.188</ref> and literacy, continued.\n\n===Politics and government===\n{{Main|Politics and Government of Iran}}\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is an Islamic [[theocracy]] headed by a [[Supreme Leader]]. Its  [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] was approved in 1979 and amended in 1989. [[Twelvers|Jaafari]] ([[Usuli]]) school of thought is the official religion.  It has an elected president and elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial and local levels for which all males and females from the age of 18 on up may vote, which are supervised by theocratic bodies, particularly the [[Council of Guardians]] which had veto power over who can run for parliament (or [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]]) and whether its bills can become law. Nonetheless the elected organs have more power than equivalent ones in the Shah's government.\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Main|Iran's foreign policy}}\nFollowing the 1979 [[Iranian revolution|revolution]] in Iran, the Islamic revolutionary regime of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] dramatically reversed the pro-Western foreign policy of the regime it overthrew. Since then, Iran has oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour (promoting the Islamic revolution and struggling against non-Muslim tendencies abroad) and moves towards pragmatism (economic development and normalization of foreign relations). Khomeini's 1989 [[fatwa]] calling for the killing of British citizen [[Salman Rushdie]] for his allegedly blasphemous book, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|The Satanic Verses]], demonstrated the willingness of the Islamic revolutionaries to sacrifice trade and other ties with western countries to threaten an individual citizen of a foreign country living thousands of miles away. On the other hand, Khomeini's death in 1989 led more pragmatic policies, with Presidents [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]] leading the charge for more stable relations with the west as well as its surrounding, non-Revolutionary-Islamic neighbors\u2014i.e., [[Saudi Arabia]]. Following the 2005 election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]], Iran has returned to more a more hardline stance, frequently antagonizing the west and its neighbors while battling for control over the region.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the Islamic Republic [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|went to war]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] after the latter launched a military offensive in the 1980s. With most foreign aid going to Iraq, Iran was forced to accept a ceasefire by 1988. Tensions with Iraq remained long after the war; it was not until the death of Saddam himself that Iran and Iraq have started improving their relations.\n\nThe Islamic Republic founded and sponsored the Lebanese group known as [[Hezbollah]]; its leaders were followers of Khomeini. The creation of Hezbollah, and its funding from Iran, was in response to the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. Since then, Hezbollah has served as both an ally and a surrogate for Iran during its conflict with America and Israel. Author [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the Islamic Republic's as having \"lost most of its allure among non-Iranian Shia's,\" giving as examples the 1995 house arrest in Qom of the two sons of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, spiritual leader of the Bahraini Shia; and the close cooperation between the Afghan Shia party Wahdat and the U.S. Army after November 2001.<ref>Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p.67\u201368</ref>\n\nThe Islamic Republic strongly supports the [[Palestinian state|Palestinian]] cause. Government aid goes to everything from Palestinian hospitals to arms supplies. There is vigorous media publicity, an official \"Quds (Jerusalem) Day\", and squares and streets named after Palestine crisscross Iranian cities. Some question whether the issue has domestic grassroots support, arguing that Iranians \"lack emotional and cultural ties to Palestinians,\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.59</ref> or has been too costly in terms of [[opportunity cost]] compared to peaceful coexistence.<ref>One study estimates that conflict in the Middle East has cost the Iranian population a substantial fraction of per capita income in opportunity cost of foregone economic growth.

Finally, the hostages were released 20 January 1981, by agreement of the Carter Administration, see [[Algiers Accords]] Jan. 19, 1981.

According to Asghar Schirazi, the moderates lacked ambition and were not well organized, while the radicals (such [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] or PMOI) were \"unrealistic\" about the conservatism of the Iranian masses and unprepared to work with moderates to fight against theocracy.

Around 70 high-ranking officials, including Chief Justice [[Mohammad Beheshti]] (who was the second most powerful figure in the revolution after Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] at the time), cabinet members, and members of parliament, were killed. The PMOI never publicly confirmed or denied any  responsibility for the deed, but only stated the attack was `a natural and necessary reaction to the regime's atrocities.` Khomeini did accuse them of responsibility and, according to BBC journalist [[Baqer Moin]], the PMOI were \"generally perceived as the culprits\" for it in Iran.<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.241</ref>  Two months later on August 30, another bomb was detonated killing President [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai|Rajai]] and Premier [[Mohammad Javad Bahonar]].

It helped to strengthen the revolution although it cost Iran much in lives and treasure.\n\nShortly after the success of the revolution, revolutionary leader  [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] began calling for Islamic revolutions across the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]], including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq,<ref>1980 April 8 \u2013 Broadcast call by Khomeini for the pious of Iraq to overthrow Saddam and his regime.

The leadership in Tehran believed that they would launch a massive Shiite uprising across the Middle East and after Iraq's defeat, march on Israel and destroy it.\n\nThe war began with [[Iraq]]'s invasion of Iran, in an attempt by Iraq's dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] to take advantage of the perceived post-revolutionary military weakness in Iran and the Revolution's unpopularity with Western governments. Much of the top leadership of Iran's once-strong Iranian military had been executed. Saddam sought to expand Iraq's access to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the oil reserves in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] (which also only has a substantial [[Arab]] population), and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country. Iranians also believe Saddam invaded with the encouragement of [[the United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and other countries.\n\nA combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, declaring \"the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by the Islamic Republic.\"<ref>Wright, ''In the Name of God,'' (1989), p.126</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |access-date=2008-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160926/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |archive-date=2008-05-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe war continued for another six years under the slogans `War, War until Victory,` and `The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala,`<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran,'' (2008), p.175</ref> but other countries, particularly the Soviet Union gave crucial aid to Iraq. The Iraqis also used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. As the costs mounted and Iranian morale waned, Khomeini finally accepted a truce called for by [[Wikisource: United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]]. By 1988, Iran was nearly bankrupted by the ruinous costs of the war and its manpower pool also exhausted. The Iranian Army in desperation began resorting to using boys as young as 14 in human wave attacks against Iraqi machine gun emplacements.

In January 1988, he issued an edict declaring that the Islamic \"Government is among the most important divine injunctions and has priority over all peripheral divine orders ... even prayers, fasting and the Hajj.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.135</ref> In April of the next year he decreed a task force to revise the country's constitution to separate the post of [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] from that of Shia [[Marja'|marja]], (the `highest source of religious emulation`), since he found none of Marja to be suitable successors as none had given strong support for his policies.<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.146</ref>  The amendments were drafted and approved by the public about one month after Khomeini's death (1989 July 9).

It was fairly clear by then that the [[Shia]] revolution would not be sweeping the region.\"<ref>Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, (p.109)</ref>\n\n[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] was elected president shortly after Khomeini's death, and has been described as less revolutionary and \"isolationist\" than his rivals \u2014 \"economically liberal, politically authoritarian, and philosophically traditional.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.153</ref> (He served from August 17, 1989, to August 1997.)   While Leader Khamenei and the [[Council of Guardians]] generally supported these policies, in the parliament radical deputies initially had control, outnumbered Rafsanjani's \"pragmatic-conservative camp\" 90 to 160.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.155</ref>\n\nThe two groups differed strongly over economic and foreign policy, with radicals tending to support mass political participation and state control of the economy, and oppose normalization of relations with the West.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.162</ref>  Conservatives used the power to disqualification candidates from running for office to deal with this problem. \"The Council of Guardians disqualified nearly all radical candidates from the fall 1990 Assembly of Experts elections because they had failed to pass written and oral tests in Islamic jurisprudence.\"<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.173</ref> In the winter and spring of 1992 nearly one-third of the 3150 candidates for the 1992 election for the parliament were rejected, including 39 incumbents.

By 1994 \"hundreds of intellectuals and supposed dissidents were in prison and some had been executed.\"  These purges cleared the regime of opponents but are thought to have set the stage for the [[Iranian reform movement|reform movement]], as exiled radicals warmed to the \"liberal\" values of freedom of speech, assembly, due process, etc.<ref name=\"Brumberg, p.175\"/>\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\nIraq invaded and overran [[Kuwait]] on August 2, 1990, causing a multinational coalition of UN forces to be assembled in response. Although Iran criticized the invasion and supported sanctions against its neighbor, it refused any active participation in the war, not surprising given the country's anti-Western attitudes and state of exhaustion from the recent conflict with its neighbor. As a result of the war and its aftermath, more than one million [[Kurds]] crossed the Iraqi border into Iran as [[refugees]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[File: Debt service-Iran.png|thumb|right|Iran's total [[Debt service ratio|debt service]] as percent of [[Balance of payments|exports of goods services and income]] increased sixfold between 1990 and 1997.]]\nDespite the \"economy first\" focus, Iran suffered serious economic problems during the Rafsanjani era. According to economist Bijan Khajehpour, economic growth in Iran between 1989 and 1994 was \"mainly financed through the accumulation of some $30 billion in foreign debt. In 1993, the ratio of Iran's foreign debt to the country's GDP reached 38%, which was alarming.\"<ref>\"Iran\u2019s Economy: 20 years after the Islamic Revolution\" by Bijan Khajehpour,\nfrom: ''Iran at the Crossroads'',  edited by John Esposito and R.K. Ramazani, New York : Palgrave, 2001, p.98</ref> A lack of foreign investment along with a fall in oil prices from $20 to $12 per barrel added to this external debt, and triggered an economic recession. The [[Iranian rial]] plummeted from 1749 to 6400 to the dollar in 1995. Unemployment reached 30%. The price of sugar, rice, and butter rose threefold, and that of bread sixfold.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\nIn part this economic downturn came from [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|American economic sanctions leveled in 1995]], when America suspended all trade with Iran, accusing Iran of supporting terrorist groups and attempting to develop [[nuclear weapons]]. The sanctions, in turn, may be traceable to the earlier [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]] and the enmity of the US government which continued to see Iran as a major regional threat both to America and Israel.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\n===Birth control===\n{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}\nA new policy regarded as a success of the new government was its promotion of birth control. In 1989, the government, \"having previously encouraged population growth, reversed gears and declared that Islam favored families with only two children\". Birth control clinics were opened \u2013 especially for women. Condoms and pills were distributed. Subsidies to large families were cut.

[[Iran student protests, July 1999|Prodemocracy student demonstrations]] erupted at [[Tehran University]] and other urban campuses. These were followed by a wave of counter-demonstrations by [[Social conservatism|conservative]] factions.\n\n[[Reform]]ers won a substantial victory in Feb. 2000, [[parliamentary]] elections, capturing about two-thirds of the seats, but [[Social conservatism|conservative]] elements in the government forced the closure of the reformist press. Attempts by parliament to repeal restrictive press laws were forbidden by Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]]. Despite these conditions, President Khatami was overwhelming re-elected in June 2001. Tensions between reformers in parliament and conservatives in the [[judiciary]] and the [[Guardian Council]], over both [[social]] and [[economic]] changes, increased after Khatami's reelection.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Military expenditures-Iran.png|thumb|right|Military expenditures (% GDP)]]\nKhatami worked to improve relations with other countries visiting many other countries and holding a dialogue between civilizations and encouraged foreigners to invest in Iran. He announced Iran would accept a two-state solution for Palestine if Palestinians agreed to one, relaxed restrictions on the [[Persecution of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds|Bahais]], and assured Britain Iran would not implement the fatwa against [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Salman Rushdie]].<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.189</ref> Several [[European Union]] countries began renewing economic ties with Iran in the late 1990s, and trade and investment increased. In 1998, Britain re-established diplomatic relations with Iran, broken since the 1979 revolution.  The United States loosened its economic embargo, but it continued to block more normalized relations, arguing that the country had been implicated in international terrorism and was developing a [[nuclear weapons]] capacity. In his [[State of the Union Address]], United States President [[George W. Bush]] labeled Iran, along with [[Iraq]] and [[North Korea]], as an \"[[Axis of evil]].\"\n\nTensions with the United States increased after the [[Anglo-America]]n invasion of Iraq in March 2003, as U.S. officials increasingly denounced Iran for pursuing the alleged development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe reform era ended with the conservatives defeat of Iranian reformists in the elections of 2003, 2004 and 2005 \u2013 the local, parliamentary, and presidential elections. According to at least one observer, the reformists were defeated not so much by a growth of support for conservative Islamist policies as by division within the reformist movement and the banning of many reform candidates which discouraged pro-reform voters from voting.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\"/>\n\n==Ahmadinejad's administration==\n{{Main|Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005\u20132013)}}\n{{Update|date=December 2009}}\n\n[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was elected to the presidency twice, in [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005]] and [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009]].

The [[IAEA]] said that there was no [[evidence]] that Iran was seeking to develop such arms. However, the IAEA also called for Iran to abandon its plans to produce [[enriched uranium]].

The patriotic monarchy was replaced by an [[Islamic Republic]] based on the principle of rule by Islamic jurists, (or \"''[[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Velayat-e faqih]]''\"), where clerics serve as [[head of state]] and in many powerful governmental roles.  A pro-[[Western culture|Western]], pro-[[United States|American]] foreign policy was exchanged for one of \"neither east nor west\", said to rest on the three \"pillars\" of mandatory veil (''[[hijab]]'') for women, and opposition to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].<ref>[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf Reading Khamenei by Karmin Sadjadpour ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027090356/https://carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf |date=2019-10-27 }} p.14</ref> A rapidly modernizing capitalist economy<ref>[\"Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution\", p.133, 227</ref><ref>''Iran : The Illusion of Power'' by Robert Graham, p.18, 19, 20, 83</ref> was replaced by a [[populism|populist]] and [[Islam]]ic economy and culture.\n\nThe leader of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], was Iran's [[supreme leader]] until his death in 1989.<ref name = \"Britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215140348/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981 |date=2007-12-15 }}.</ref> He was followed by [[Ali Khamenei]].\n\n==General trends==\nDuring the era of the Islamic Republic, Iran has grown from 39 million (1980) to 81.16 million (2017) people.\n\nSome things remain much as they were under the monarchy. Iran has retained its status as a major regional power\u2014it is far larger than any of its gulf neighbors, and possesses large reserves of gas and oil.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\">Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.194</ref> Its national cohesion brought by a long history as a nation, strong central state government and its oil export revenues have brought it \"respectable\" levels of income, literacy, college enrollment, infant mortality, and infrastructure.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\" /> Modern trends found under the monarchy, such as urbanization, growing enrollment in higher education<ref>which went from 155,000 in 1977 to 135,700 in 1982 (when universities reopened after cultural revolution) to a peak of 1,048,000 in 1995. from UNESCO Division of Statistics, quoted in Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.188</ref> and literacy, continued.\n\n===Politics and government===\n{{Main|Politics and Government of Iran}}\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is an Islamic [[theocracy]] headed by a [[Supreme Leader]]. Its  [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] was approved in 1979 and amended in 1989. [[Twelvers|Jaafari]] ([[Usuli]]) school of thought is the official religion.  It has an elected president and elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial and local levels for which all males and females from the age of 18 on up may vote, which are supervised by theocratic bodies, particularly the [[Council of Guardians]] which had veto power over who can run for parliament (or [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]]) and whether its bills can become law. Nonetheless the elected organs have more power than equivalent ones in the Shah's government.\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Main|Iran's foreign policy}}\nFollowing the 1979 [[Iranian revolution|revolution]] in Iran, the Islamic revolutionary regime of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] dramatically reversed the pro-Western foreign policy of the regime it overthrew. Since then, Iran has oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour (promoting the Islamic revolution and struggling against non-Muslim tendencies abroad) and moves towards pragmatism (economic development and normalization of foreign relations). Khomeini's 1989 [[fatwa]] calling for the killing of British citizen [[Salman Rushdie]] for his allegedly blasphemous book, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|The Satanic Verses]], demonstrated the willingness of the Islamic revolutionaries to sacrifice trade and other ties with western countries to threaten an individual citizen of a foreign country living thousands of miles away. On the other hand, Khomeini's death in 1989 led more pragmatic policies, with Presidents [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]] leading the charge for more stable relations with the west as well as its surrounding, non-Revolutionary-Islamic neighbors\u2014i.e., [[Saudi Arabia]]. Following the 2005 election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]], Iran has returned to more a more hardline stance, frequently antagonizing the west and its neighbors while battling for control over the region.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the Islamic Republic [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|went to war]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] after the latter launched a military offensive in the 1980s. With most foreign aid going to Iraq, Iran was forced to accept a ceasefire by 1988. Tensions with Iraq remained long after the war; it was not until the death of Saddam himself that Iran and Iraq have started improving their relations.\n\nThe Islamic Republic founded and sponsored the Lebanese group known as [[Hezbollah]]; its leaders were followers of Khomeini. The creation of Hezbollah, and its funding from Iran, was in response to the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. Since then, Hezbollah has served as both an ally and a surrogate for Iran during its conflict with America and Israel. Author [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the Islamic Republic's as having \"lost most of its allure among non-Iranian Shia's,\" giving as examples the 1995 house arrest in Qom of the two sons of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, spiritual leader of the Bahraini Shia; and the close cooperation between the Afghan Shia party Wahdat and the U.S. Army after November 2001.<ref>Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p.67\u201368</ref>\n\nThe Islamic Republic strongly supports the [[Palestinian state|Palestinian]] cause. Government aid goes to everything from Palestinian hospitals to arms supplies. There is vigorous media publicity, an official \"Quds (Jerusalem) Day\", and squares and streets named after Palestine crisscross Iranian cities. Some question whether the issue has domestic grassroots support, arguing that Iranians \"lack emotional and cultural ties to Palestinians,\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.59</ref> or has been too costly in terms of [[opportunity cost]] compared to peaceful coexistence.<ref>One study estimates that conflict in the Middle East has cost the Iranian population a substantial fraction of per capita income in opportunity cost of foregone economic growth.

Iran\u2019s share of the opportunity cost came to over $2.1 trillion. In other words had there been peace since 1991, the average Iranian citizen would have an estimated income of $7700 rather the $4100 that he or she will earn in 2010.</ref>\n\n===Human development===\n{{See also|Education in Iran|Health care in Iran|Bonyad}}\n[[File:Net Migration Iran.png|thumb|right|[[Net migration|Net Iranian migration]] (1979\u20132008).

On November 4, 1979, Iranian students seized the [[United States|U.S.]] embassy in [[Tehran]] holding 52 embassy employees hostage for 444 days.  The [[Carter administration]] severed diplomatic relations and imposed [[economic sanctions]] on April 7, 1980, and later that month unsuccessfully attempted a rescue that further enhanced Khomeini's prestige in Iran.  On May 24 the [[International Court of Justice]] called for the [[hostage]]s to be released.  Finally, the hostages were released 20 January 1981, by agreement of the Carter Administration, see [[Algiers Accords]] Jan. 19, 1981.  The crisis also marked the beginning of American legal action, or sanctions, that economically separated Iran from America. Sanctions blocked all property within US jurisdiction owned by the Central Bank and Government of Iran.<ref>[http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm History Of US Sanctions Against Iran] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010024317/http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm |date=2017-10-10 }} Middle East Economic Survey, 26-August-2002</ref>\n\n====Suppression of opposition====\nRevolutionary factions disagreed on the shape of the new Iran. Those who thought the Shah would be replaced by a democratic government soon found Khomeini disagreed. In early March 1979, he  announced, \"do not use this term, \u2018democratic.\u2019 That is the Western style.\"<ref>Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', p. 73.</ref>\n\nIn succession the [[National Democratic Front (Iran)|National Democratic Front]] was banned in August 1979, the [[The Interim Government of Iran|provisional government]] was disempowered in November, the [[Muslim People's Republican Party]] banned in January 1980, the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] guerrillas came under attack in February 1980, a purge of universities was begun in March 1980, and leftist President [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] was impeached in June 1981.\n\nExplanations for why Khomeini supporters were successful in crushing the opposition include lack of unity in the opposition. According to Asghar Schirazi, the moderates lacked ambition and were not well organized, while the radicals (such [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] or PMOI) were \"unrealistic\" about the conservatism of the Iranian masses and unprepared to work with moderates to fight against theocracy. Moderate Islamists, such as Banisadr, were \"credulous and submissive\" towards Khomeini.<ref>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran: politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'', London; New York: I.B. Tauris, 1997, p.293-4</ref>\n\n====Terrorist attacks====\nThe ouster of President Banisadr did not put an immediate end to the opposition but moved it to terror.  Hundreds of PMOI supporters and members were killed from 1979 to 1981, and some 3,000 were arrested,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 |title=The address you were looking for doesn't exist |publisher=Tkb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115114802/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 |archive-date=2008-01-15 |url-status=live }}</ref> but unlike other opposition is driven underground by the regime, the PMOI was able to retaliate.\n\nOn 28 June 1981, bombs were detonated at the headquarters of the since-dissolved [[Islamic Republic Party]]. Around 70 high-ranking officials, including Chief Justice [[Mohammad Beheshti]] (who was the second most powerful figure in the revolution after Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] at the time), cabinet members, and members of parliament, were killed. The PMOI never publicly confirmed or denied any  responsibility for the deed, but only stated the attack was `a natural and necessary reaction to the regime's atrocities.` Khomeini did accuse them of responsibility and, according to BBC journalist [[Baqer Moin]], the PMOI were \"generally perceived as the culprits\" for it in Iran.<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.241</ref>  Two months later on August 30, another bomb was detonated killing President [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai|Rajai]] and Premier [[Mohammad Javad Bahonar]].  A member of the PMOI, Mas'ud Kashmiri, was announced as the perpetrator, and according to regime reports came close to killing the entire government including Khomeini.<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.242-3</ref>  The reaction following both bombings was intense with thousands of arrests and hundreds of executions of PMOI and other leftist groups,<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p. 241\u20132.</ref> but \"assassinations of leading officials and active supporters of the regime by the PMOI were to continue for the next year or two.\"<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.243</ref>\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n{{Main|Iran\u2013Iraq War}}\n\nThe eight-year-long [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (September 1980 \u2013 August 1988) was the most important international event for the first decade of the Islamic Republic and possibly for its history so far. It helped to strengthen the revolution although it cost Iran much in lives and treasure.\n\nShortly after the success of the revolution, revolutionary leader  [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] began calling for Islamic revolutions across the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]], including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq,<ref>1980 April 8 \u2013 Broadcast call by Khomeini for the pious of Iraq to overthrow Saddam and his regime. Al-Dawa al-Islamiya party in Iraqi is the hoped-for catalyst to start the rebellion.

The leadership in Tehran believed that they would launch a massive Shiite uprising across the Middle East and after Iraq's defeat, march on Israel and destroy it.\n\nThe war began with [[Iraq]]'s invasion of Iran, in an attempt by Iraq's dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] to take advantage of the perceived post-revolutionary military weakness in Iran and the Revolution's unpopularity with Western governments. Much of the top leadership of Iran's once-strong Iranian military had been executed. Saddam sought to expand Iraq's access to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the oil reserves in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] (which also only has a substantial [[Arab]] population), and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country. Iranians also believe Saddam invaded with the encouragement of [[the United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and other countries.\n\nA combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, declaring \"the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by the Islamic Republic.\"<ref>Wright, ''In the Name of God,'' (1989), p.126</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |access-date=2008-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160926/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |archive-date=2008-05-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe war continued for another six years under the slogans `War, War until Victory,` and `The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala,`<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran,'' (2008), p.175</ref> but other countries, particularly the Soviet Union gave crucial aid to Iraq. The Iraqis also used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. As the costs mounted and Iranian morale waned, Khomeini finally accepted a truce called for by [[Wikisource: United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]]. By 1988, Iran was nearly bankrupted by the ruinous costs of the war and its manpower pool also exhausted. The Iranian Army in desperation began resorting to using boys as young as 14 in human wave attacks against Iraqi machine gun emplacements.

It purged women from the judiciary and secular teachers from the educational system. It removed [[Baha'i]]s from government positions, closed down Baha'i Centers, and arrested and even executed their leaders.  A strict \"Islamic code of public appearance\" was enforced\u2014men were discouraged from wearing ties, women were obliged to wear either scarf and long coats or preferably the full chador.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.177</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nIran's economy suffered during the first decade following the revolution.

In January 1988, he issued an edict declaring that the Islamic \"Government is among the most important divine injunctions and has priority over all peripheral divine orders ... even prayers, fasting and the Hajj.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.135</ref> In April of the next year he decreed a task force to revise the country's constitution to separate the post of [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] from that of Shia [[Marja'|marja]], (the `highest source of religious emulation`), since he found none of Marja to be suitable successors as none had given strong support for his policies.<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.146</ref>  The amendments were drafted and approved by the public about one month after Khomeini's death (1989 July 9).

While Leader Khamenei and the [[Council of Guardians]] generally supported these policies, in the parliament radical deputies initially had control, outnumbered Rafsanjani's \"pragmatic-conservative camp\" 90 to 160.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.155</ref>\n\nThe two groups differed strongly over economic and foreign policy, with radicals tending to support mass political participation and state control of the economy, and oppose normalization of relations with the West.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.162</ref>  Conservatives used the power to disqualification candidates from running for office to deal with this problem. \"The Council of Guardians disqualified nearly all radical candidates from the fall 1990 Assembly of Experts elections because they had failed to pass written and oral tests in Islamic jurisprudence.\"<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.173</ref> In the winter and spring of 1992 nearly one-third of the 3150 candidates for the 1992 election for the parliament were rejected, including 39 incumbents.

Although Iran criticized the invasion and supported sanctions against its neighbor, it refused any active participation in the war, not surprising given the country's anti-Western attitudes and state of exhaustion from the recent conflict with its neighbor. As a result of the war and its aftermath, more than one million [[Kurds]] crossed the Iraqi border into Iran as [[refugees]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[File: Debt service-Iran.png|thumb|right|Iran's total [[Debt service ratio|debt service]] as percent of [[Balance of payments|exports of goods services and income]] increased sixfold between 1990 and 1997.]]\nDespite the \"economy first\" focus, Iran suffered serious economic problems during the Rafsanjani era. According to economist Bijan Khajehpour, economic growth in Iran between 1989 and 1994 was \"mainly financed through the accumulation of some $30 billion in foreign debt. In 1993, the ratio of Iran's foreign debt to the country's GDP reached 38%, which was alarming.\"<ref>\"Iran\u2019s Economy: 20 years after the Islamic Revolution\" by Bijan Khajehpour,\nfrom: ''Iran at the Crossroads'',  edited by John Esposito and R.K.

The [[Iranian rial]] plummeted from 1749 to 6400 to the dollar in 1995. Unemployment reached 30%. The price of sugar, rice, and butter rose threefold, and that of bread sixfold.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\nIn part this economic downturn came from [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|American economic sanctions leveled in 1995]], when America suspended all trade with Iran, accusing Iran of supporting terrorist groups and attempting to develop [[nuclear weapons]]. The sanctions, in turn, may be traceable to the earlier [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]] and the enmity of the US government which continued to see Iran as a major regional threat both to America and Israel.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\n===Birth control===\n{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}\nA new policy regarded as a success of the new government was its promotion of birth control.

In mid-2004 Iran began resuming the processing of [[nuclear fuel]] as part of its plan to achieve self-sufficiency in civilian nuclear power production, stating that the negotiations with [[European Union]] nations had failed to bring access to the advanced [[nuclear technology]] that was promised. The action was denounced by the United States as one which would give Iran the capability to develop nuclear weapons. The [[IAEA]] said that there was no [[evidence]] that Iran was seeking to develop such arms. However, the IAEA also called for Iran to abandon its plans to produce [[enriched uranium]]. In November 2004, Iran agreed to suspend [[uranium enrichment]] but subsequently indicated that it would not be held to the suspension if the negotiations the [[European Union|EU]] nations failed.\n\nDuring an October 2013 meeting, however, Iran agreed, in negotiations with several Western European nations, to toughen international inspections of its nuclear installations.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf \"Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program: Tehran\u2019s Compliance with International Obligations\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507202756/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf |date=2017-05-07 }} Congressional Research Service, 4 April 2017.</ref> Nonetheless, the international community continued to express concerns over Iran's nuclear program.

It was first broadcast in the UK on [[BBC One]] on 26 March 2005. \"Rose\" was the first ''Doctor Who'' episode to air since the [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]] in 1996.\n\nIn the episode, the London department store worker [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) gets caught in the middle of the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]'s ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) plot to prevent an invasion of the [[Earth]] by the [[Nestene Consciousness]] (voiced by [[Nicholas Briggs]]) and the [[Auton]]s after the Doctor destroys Rose's workplace.\n\nThe episode marked Eccleston's first appearance as the Doctor, succeeding several other actors who played the role, and Piper's debut as the Doctor's travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Rose. Being the first episode of the revived series, several recurring characters were introduced: [[Camille Coduri]] as [[Jackie Tyler]], and [[Noel Clarke]] as [[Mickey Smith]]. Viewers did not see the Doctor character regenerate from a previous incarnation, [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] being a plot device in which the character of the Doctor changes appearance. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating.\n\nLocation filming principally took place in Cardiff, the headquarters of [[BBC Wales]], in July and August 2004, with some location scenes shot in London in July. Studio work principally took place at the Unit Q2 warehouse in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] in August and September. Model work was recorded at the [[BBC]]'s Model Unit in London in September, and some additional filming was recorded in Cardiff in October and November. \"Rose\" was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, the most viewed ''Doctor Who'' episode since ''[[The Creature from the Pit]]'' in 1979,<ref name=\"cultbox\">{{cite web|url=https://cultbox.co.uk/features/trivia/top-10-most-watched-doctor-who-episodes-since-2005|title=Top 10 most-watched 'Doctor Who' episodes since 2005|website=Cultbox|last=Martin|first=William|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Dr. Who Exhibition at the Kelvingrove (4006575428).jpg|thumb|left|The Autons, shown here at the Doctor Who Experience]]\n[[Rose Tyler]], a teenage shop assistant, is chased by mannequins in the basement of Henrik's, the department store where she works. She is rescued by the [[Ninth Doctor]], who destroys the building with an explosion. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home, where he is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive, who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose that the Doctor is dangerous and that if he's there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend [[Mickey Smith]] is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic [[doppelg\u00e4nger]].\n\nThe fake Mickey takes Rose to lunch and attempts to question her about the Doctor, but the Doctor shows up and beheads the doppelg\u00e4nger. The Doctor takes Rose and the plastic head to the [[TARDIS]] and attempts to use the head to locate the controlling signal. With the head connected, the TARDIS takes them to the [[London Eye]]. The Doctor explains to Rose that the fake Mickey was an [[Auton]], controlled by a signal from the Nestene Consciousness. He has a vial of anti-plastic that can be used to destroy the Nestene Consciousness if necessary. Realising that the transmitter is the London Eye itself, Rose and the Doctor descend underneath it to stop the Nestene Consciousness. They find Mickey, tied up but alive, and the Doctor speaks to the Nestene Consciousness. He tries to negotiate with it, but the Consciousness blames the Doctor for the destruction of its planet. The Nestene Consciousness activates all the Autons at a shopping arcade, where several shoppers are shot and killed, including Clive. The Doctor is also held down by a pair of Autons, but Rose rescues him and the anti-plastic drops into the vat where the Nestene Consciousness resides, killing it. With the Nestene Consciousness dead, the Autons all collapse. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to take Mickey and Rose home, then persuades Rose to join him as his new companion in the TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\nBoth the Autons and the Nestene Consciousness first appeared in the serial ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' (1970), then reappeared on-screen in ''[[Terror of the Autons]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"4thdimension\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007vvcq/features/rose-the-fourth-dimension|title=The Fourth Dimension|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Russelltdaviescrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Russell T Davies]], episode writer.]]\n{{see also|History of Doctor Who#The new series|l1=History of Doctor Who|Doctor Who (series_1)#Production|label 2=Doctor Who series 1 production}}\n\n=== Background and casting ===\n''Doctor Who'' originally ran from 1963 to 1989, when it was cancelled after its [[Doctor Who (season 26)|twenty-sixth season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3140786.stm|title=Doctor Who returns to TV|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=26 September 2003|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> Television producer [[Russell T Davies]] had been lobbying the BBC in an attempt to revive the show from the late 1990s, and reached the discussion phase in 2002.<ref name=\"revival\">Aldridge and Murray pp.182\u2013183</ref> It was announced in September 2003 that Doctor Who was returning and would be produced by [[BBC Wales]] via a BBC press release.<ref name=\"Press release\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/09_september/26/dr_who.shtml | title=Doctor Who returns to BBC ONE | work=BBC | date=26 September 2013 | accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> The format of the programme was changed to 45-minute episodes, lightening the pace.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Cavan|last=Scott|title=The Way Back Part One: Bring Me to Life|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent]]|issue=463|page=21|date=25 July 2013}}</ref> Davies was inspired by American series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Smallville]]'', in particular by using ''Buffy''{{'s}} structure of season-long [[story arcs]] around a \"[[Big Bad]]\" villain.<ref>Aldridge and Murray, p. 208</ref>\n\nIt was announced in March 2004 that [[Christopher Eccleston]] would be playing the Doctor.<ref name=\"March 2004\"/> [[Jane Tranter]], BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated that casting an actor of Eccleston's reputation signaled \"our intention to take ''Doctor Who'' into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values \u2014 to be surprising, edgy and eccentric.\"<ref name=\"March 2004\">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3552087.stm | title=Eccleston is new Doctor Who | work=BBC | date=22 March 2004 | accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Eccleston is the [[Ninth Doctor|ninth actor]] to play the Doctor since the programme started in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFFpJEToGnMC&pg=PT152&dq|title=A Brief Guide to Doctor Who|author=Mark Campbell|publisher=Constable & Robinson Ltd|date= 24 Mar 2011|isbn=9781849018869}}</ref>  New actors are able to take over the role through a plot device of [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]], introduced in 1966, in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8616413.stm|title=Doctor Who regeneration was 'modelled on LSD trips'|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> Russell T Davies decided to begin the revived series with a new Doctor rather than show the regeneration, as he believed it was \"madness\" to start with someone and then change him before the audience could build a relationship with him.

The episode was directed by [[Keith Boak]] and written by [[Russell T Davies]] who was also one of the three executive producers. It was first broadcast in the UK on [[BBC One]] on 26 March 2005. \"Rose\" was the first ''Doctor Who'' episode to air since the [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]] in 1996.\n\nIn the episode, the London department store worker [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) gets caught in the middle of the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]'s ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) plot to prevent an invasion of the [[Earth]] by the [[Nestene Consciousness]] (voiced by [[Nicholas Briggs]]) and the [[Auton]]s after the Doctor destroys Rose's workplace.\n\nThe episode marked Eccleston's first appearance as the Doctor, succeeding several other actors who played the role, and Piper's debut as the Doctor's travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Rose. Being the first episode of the revived series, several recurring characters were introduced: [[Camille Coduri]] as [[Jackie Tyler]], and [[Noel Clarke]] as [[Mickey Smith]]. Viewers did not see the Doctor character regenerate from a previous incarnation, [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] being a plot device in which the character of the Doctor changes appearance. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating.\n\nLocation filming principally took place in Cardiff, the headquarters of [[BBC Wales]], in July and August 2004, with some location scenes shot in London in July. Studio work principally took place at the Unit Q2 warehouse in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] in August and September. Model work was recorded at the [[BBC]]'s Model Unit in London in September, and some additional filming was recorded in Cardiff in October and November. \"Rose\" was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, the most viewed ''Doctor Who'' episode since ''[[The Creature from the Pit]]'' in 1979,<ref name=\"cultbox\">{{cite web|url=https://cultbox.co.uk/features/trivia/top-10-most-watched-doctor-who-episodes-since-2005|title=Top 10 most-watched 'Doctor Who' episodes since 2005|website=Cultbox|last=Martin|first=William|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Dr. Who Exhibition at the Kelvingrove (4006575428).jpg|thumb|left|The Autons, shown here at the Doctor Who Experience]]\n[[Rose Tyler]], a teenage shop assistant, is chased by mannequins in the basement of Henrik's, the department store where she works. She is rescued by the [[Ninth Doctor]], who destroys the building with an explosion. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home, where he is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive, who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose that the Doctor is dangerous and that if he's there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend [[Mickey Smith]] is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic [[doppelg\u00e4nger]].\n\nThe fake Mickey takes Rose to lunch and attempts to question her about the Doctor, but the Doctor shows up and beheads the doppelg\u00e4nger. The Doctor takes Rose and the plastic head to the [[TARDIS]] and attempts to use the head to locate the controlling signal. With the head connected, the TARDIS takes them to the [[London Eye]]. The Doctor explains to Rose that the fake Mickey was an [[Auton]], controlled by a signal from the Nestene Consciousness. He has a vial of anti-plastic that can be used to destroy the Nestene Consciousness if necessary. Realising that the transmitter is the London Eye itself, Rose and the Doctor descend underneath it to stop the Nestene Consciousness. They find Mickey, tied up but alive, and the Doctor speaks to the Nestene Consciousness. He tries to negotiate with it, but the Consciousness blames the Doctor for the destruction of its planet. The Nestene Consciousness activates all the Autons at a shopping arcade, where several shoppers are shot and killed, including Clive.

However, he felt that Eccleston was \"the show's biggest disappointment\" as he seemed unsuited to a fantasy role.<ref name=\"stage\">{{cite web|first=Harry|last=Venning|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/7193/tv-review|title=TV review|work=[[The Stage]]|date=4 March 2005|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> [[Digital Spy]]'s Dek Hogan stated that production values had increased from the classic series, and praised the acting and characters of Eccleston, Piper, and Clarke. However, he felt that some of the humour&nbsp;\u2014 such as the wheelie bin burping after it consumes Mickey&nbsp;\u2014 was not as enjoyable as an adult.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dek|last=Hogan|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/dekstvdiary/a20244/living-in-a-box.html|title=Living in a box|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=26 March 2005|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewer Robin Oliver praised Davies for \"[taking] an adult approach to one of television's most famous characters\" and \"[overriding] the cash-strapped production values of the past to make his new doctor competitive in a high-tech market\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Robin|last=Oliver|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Review/Doctor-Who/2005/05/20/1116533531775.html|title=Show of the Week|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=21 May 2005|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> Kay McFadden of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' described the revival as \"superb\" and \"intelligent and well-done\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Kay|last=McFadden|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2002870002_kay17.html|title=This is the doctor who is always on time|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=17 March 2006|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> ''[[Daily Mail]]'' writer Michael Hanlon said that \"As a fan I really hope this new series succeeds.

Patrick Mulkern of ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave \"Rose\" four out of five stars in 2013, particularly praising Rose's fleshed-out life and how it welcomed in new viewers. While he noted \"minor gripes\" and felt the Autons' destruction was toned-down, he praised the direction and the performances and called it \"a blinding success\".<ref name=\"Radio Times\">{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Mulkern|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2013-02-05/rose|title=Rose|date=5 February 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203121737/http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2013-02-05/rose|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of a B, also noting how important it was that Rose's world was shown first. He felt that some effects already seemed dated in 2013 and Jackie and Mickey were one-dimensional, but the episode succeeded above all else, especially in developing Rose and the Doctor's relationship and pointing out that ''Doctor Who'' is dangerous.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alasdair|last=Wilkins|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/rose-105710|title=Doctor Who: \"Rose\"|work=[[The A.V.
