Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.\n\nThis led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, [[Iran]], and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]].<ref>The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States Congress</ref><ref>The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum \u2013 Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian</ref><ref>Not Even My Name: A True Story \u2013 Page 131 by Thea Halo</ref><ref>The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani</ref>\n\nIn reaction to the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lured by [[United Kingdom|British]] and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by [[Agha Petros]] and [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyari]] tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an [[Assyrian war of independence]]. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in Syria.]]\nThe majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the \"[[Assyrian triangle]]\" in northern Iraq. During the [[French mandate]] period, some Assyrians, fleeing [[ethnic cleansing]]s in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Simele massacre]], established numerous villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] during the 1930s.\n\nThe [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,<ref>Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''</ref> and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.\n\nHowever, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"peshitta1\">{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:SyriacChurch-Mosul.jpg|thumb|left|Celebration at a Syriac Orthodox monastery in [[Mosul]], [[Ottoman Syria]], early 20th century.]]\n\nThe period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians.

The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Iraqi/Syrian Christians''. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).<ref name=\"UNHCR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |title=Refworld \u2013 Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |work=Refworld |accessdate=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019062353/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=\u0632\u0648\u0639\u0627|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s.

In Iraq, Chaldean Catholics inhabit the western [[Nineveh Plains]] villages of [[Alqosh]], [[Batnaya]], [[Tel Keppe]] and [[Tesqopa]], as well as the [[Nahla valley]] and [[Aqra]].

A small minority of Assyrians accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]] thus are [[Reformed Orthodoxy (Eastern Christianity)|Reform Orthodox]] in the 20th century, possibly due to British influences, and is now organized in the [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]], the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and other Protestant/Reform Orthodox Assyrian groups. While Assyrians are predominantly Christian, an echoing minority, particularly those raised in the [[western world|west]], tend to be [[irreligious]] or [[atheist]]ic in nature.\n\nMany members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]].\nThe group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:\n* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Nestorians''\n* adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] following the East Syrian Rite also known as ''Chaldeans''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Jacobites''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite\n\nBaptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Brit Milah]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.\n\nDuring the \"Seyfo\" genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who converted to Islam. They reside in Turkey, and practice Islam but still retain their identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seyfocenter.com/english/muslim-assyrians-who-are-they/|title=Muslim Assyrians?

Instruments traditionally used by Assyrians include the [[zurna]] and [[davul]]a, but has expanded to include guitars, pianos, violins, synthesizers (keyboards and [[electronic drum]]s), and other instruments.\n\nSome well known Assyrian singers in modern times are [[Ashur Bet Sargis]], [[Sargon Gabriel]], [[Evin Agassi]], [[Janan Sawa]], [[Juliana Jendo]], and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]. Assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include [[Melechesh]], [[Timz]] and [[Aril Brikha]]. Assyrian-Australian band [[Azadoota]] performs its songs in the Assyrian language whilst using a western style of instrumentation.\n\nThe first international [[Aramaic Music Festival]] was held in Lebanon in August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally.\n\n=== Dance ===\n{{Main|Assyrian folk dance}}\nAssyrians have numerous traditional dances which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both \u2013 The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is [[khigga]], which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.\n[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Folk dance]] in an Assyrian party in [[Chicago]]]]\n\n=== Festivals ===\nAssyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter]. Article from [[United States Naval Observatory]] (March 27, 2007).</ref> However, members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar (March 22 and April 25 on the [[Julian calendar]]). During [[Lent]], Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based.\n\nAssyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones:\n* [[Kha b-Nisan]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u071a\u0715 \u0712\u0722\u071d\u0723\u0722}}'', the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119121049/http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|url-status=dead|title=AUA Release March 26, 2006.|archivedate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Sauma d-Ba'utha]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u0712\u0725\u0718\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0722\u071d\u0722\u0718\u071d\u0710}}'', the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer.<ref name=SycOrth>{{cite web|title=Three Day Fast of Nineveh |url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |publisher=syrianorthodoxchurch.org |accessdate=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123007/http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n* Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes\n* Kalu d'Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane\n* Nusardyl, commemorating the baptism of the Assyrians of Urmia by St. Thomas.<ref name=\"FestivalsAssyrianIranica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = FESTIVALS ix.

It is commemorated annually on August 7.\n\nAssyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2\u20133 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1\u20132 days.\n\n=== Traditional clothing ===\n{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}\nAssyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}\nAssyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes. Typically, rice is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. Tea is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. Alcoholic drinks such as wine and [[wheat beer]] are organically produced and drunk.\n\n== Genetics ==\n{{Further|Genetic history of the Near East}}\nLate 20th century DNA analysis conducted by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]], Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, \"shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population.\"<ref name=\"assyrianfoundation.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816235456/http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|url-status=dead|title=Dr. Joel J.

Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Assyrian refugees on a wagon moving to a newly constructed village on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in Syria.]]\nThe majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of [[Iraq]] and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] asked the [[League of Nations]] to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the \"[[Assyrian triangle]]\" in northern Iraq. During the [[French mandate]] period, some Assyrians, fleeing [[ethnic cleansing]]s in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Simele massacre]], established numerous villages along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] during the 1930s.\n\nThe [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and [[Tartan (Assyrian)|Tartan]], being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,<ref>Len Dieghton, ''Blood Sweat and Tears''</ref> and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During [[World War II]], eleven Assyrian companies saw action in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and another four served in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the [[Royal Marine Commando]] and were involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-[[Nazi]] Iraqi forces at the battle of [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] in 1941.\n\nHowever, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Iraq]]. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the [[Iraqi Army]] in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] the Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zubaida|first=S|title=Contested nations: Iraq and the Assyrians|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=July 2000|volume=6|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.1354-5078.2000.00363.x|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/contestednations.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"peshitta1\">{{cite web|title=Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|url=http://www.peshitta.org/initial/mareshai.html|work=Committee of the 50th Anniversary of the Patriarchate of Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII|publisher=peshitta.org|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:SyriacChurch-Mosul.jpg|thumb|left|Celebration at a Syriac Orthodox monastery in [[Mosul]], [[Ottoman Syria]], early 20th century.]]\n\nThe period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians.

The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as ''Iraqi/Syrian Christians''. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).<ref name=\"UNHCR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |title=Refworld \u2013 Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |work=Refworld |accessdate=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019062353/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zowaa.org/|title=\u0632\u0648\u0639\u0627|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s.

It is one of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[abjad]]s directly descending from the [[Aramaic alphabet]] and shares similarities with the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and the [[Arabic alphabet]]s.<ref>Pennacchietti, Fabrizio A. (1997). \"On the etymology of the Neo-Aramaic particle qam/kim; in Hebrew\", M. Bar-Aher (ed.): Gideon Goldenberg Festschrift, Massorot, Stud</ref> It has 22 letters representing consonants, three of which can be [[Mater lectionis|also]] used to indicate vowels. The vowel sounds are supplied either by the reader's memory or by optional [[diacritic]] marks. Syriac is a [[cursive]] script where some, but not all, letters connect within a word. It was used to write the [[Syriac language]] from the 1st century AD.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578972/Syriac-alphabet | title=Syriac alphabet | encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest and classical form of the alphabet is the ''{{transl|sem|\u02beEs\u1e6drang\u0113l\u0101}}'' script.<ref>[[William Hatch|Hatch, William]] (1946). ''An album of dated Syriac manuscripts''.

The East Syriac dialect is usually written in the ''{{transl|sem|Ma\u1e0fn\u1e25\u0101y\u0101}}'' form of the alphabet, which is often translated as \"contemporary\", reflecting its use in writing modern Neo-Aramaic. The West Syriac dialect is usually written in the ''{{transl|sem|Ser\u1e6d\u0101}}'' form of the alphabet. Most of the letters are clearly derived from \u02beEs\u1e6drang\u0113l\u0101, but are simplified, flowing lines.<ref>[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888).

Martin Bailey, Betty Jane Bailey, Who Are the Christians in the Middle East? p. 163: \"more than two thirds\" out of \"nearly a million\" Christians in Iraq.</ref> and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] ''(\u02bfIdto Suryoyto Tri\u1e63a\u1e6f \u0160u\u1e07\u1e25o)'', which has between 1,000,000 and 4,000,000 members around the world (only some of whom are Assyrians),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_622.html|title=Adherents.com|website=www.adherents.com}}</ref> the [[Ancient Church of the East]] with some 100,000 members. A small minority of Assyrians accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]] thus are [[Reformed Orthodoxy (Eastern Christianity)|Reform Orthodox]] in the 20th century, possibly due to British influences, and is now organized in the [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]], the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and other Protestant/Reform Orthodox Assyrian groups. While Assyrians are predominantly Christian, an echoing minority, particularly those raised in the [[western world|west]], tend to be [[irreligious]] or [[atheist]]ic in nature.\n\nMany members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]].\nThe group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:\n* adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]] following the [[East Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Nestorians''\n* adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] following the East Syrian Rite also known as ''Chaldeans''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] following the [[West Syrian Rite]] also known as ''Jacobites''\n* adherents of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] following the West Syrian Rite\n\nBaptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a [[Brit Milah]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of [[Jesus]]; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.\n\nDuring the \"Seyfo\" genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who converted to Islam. They reside in Turkey, and practice Islam but still retain their identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seyfocenter.com/english/muslim-assyrians-who-are-they/|title=Muslim Assyrians?

Instruments traditionally used by Assyrians include the [[zurna]] and [[davul]]a, but has expanded to include guitars, pianos, violins, synthesizers (keyboards and [[electronic drum]]s), and other instruments.\n\nSome well known Assyrian singers in modern times are [[Ashur Bet Sargis]], [[Sargon Gabriel]], [[Evin Agassi]], [[Janan Sawa]], [[Juliana Jendo]], and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]. Assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include [[Melechesh]], [[Timz]] and [[Aril Brikha]]. Assyrian-Australian band [[Azadoota]] performs its songs in the Assyrian language whilst using a western style of instrumentation.\n\nThe first international [[Aramaic Music Festival]] was held in Lebanon in August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally.\n\n=== Dance ===\n{{Main|Assyrian folk dance}}\nAssyrians have numerous traditional dances which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both \u2013 The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is [[khigga]], which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.\n[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Folk dance]] in an Assyrian party in [[Chicago]]]]\n\n=== Festivals ===\nAssyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which [[Easter]] is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the [[Gregorian calendar]] and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter]. Article from [[United States Naval Observatory]] (March 27, 2007).</ref> However, members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar (March 22 and April 25 on the [[Julian calendar]]). During [[Lent]], Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based.\n\nAssyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones:\n* [[Kha b-Nisan]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u071a\u0715 \u0712\u0722\u071d\u0723\u0722}}'', the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119121049/http://aua.net/News/releases/2006/NewYear2006.pdf|url-status=dead|title=AUA Release March 26, 2006.|archivedate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Sauma d-Ba'utha]] ''{{Script/Mdnh|\u0712\u0725\u0718\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0722\u071d\u0722\u0718\u071d\u0710}}'', the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer.<ref name=SycOrth>{{cite web|title=Three Day Fast of Nineveh |url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |publisher=syrianorthodoxchurch.org |accessdate=1 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123007/http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/ |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n* Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes\n* Kalu d'Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane\n* Nusardyl, commemorating the baptism of the Assyrians of Urmia by St. Thomas.<ref name=\"FestivalsAssyrianIranica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = FESTIVALS ix.

It is commemorated annually on August 7.\n\nAssyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2\u20133 days; in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] they last 1\u20132 days.\n\n=== Traditional clothing ===\n{{Main|Assyrian clothing}}\nAssyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Assyrian cuisine}}\nAssyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes. Typically, rice is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. Tea is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. Alcoholic drinks such as wine and [[wheat beer]] are organically produced and drunk.\n\n== Genetics ==\n{{Further|Genetic history of the Near East}}\nLate 20th century DNA analysis conducted by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]], Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, \"shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population.\"<ref name=\"assyrianfoundation.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816235456/http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm|url-status=dead|title=Dr. Joel J.

{"title_page": "Hegemonic masculinity", "text_new": "{{Technical|date=May 2017}}\n{{masculism sidebar}}\nIn [[gender studies]], '''hegemonic masculinity''' is part of [[Raewyn Connell|R.&nbsp;W. Connell]]'s [[Gender theory|gender order theory]], which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes [[Androcentrism|men's dominant]] position in society and justifies the subordination of the common male population and women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.<ref name=Con2005/> Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant [[social role]]s over women, and other [[gender identities]], which are perceived as \"[[feminine]]\" in a given society.\n\nAs a [[sociology|sociological]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by [[Marxist theorist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a [[social group]] claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of [[social organization]] that has been sociologically challenged and changed.\n\nThe conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, psychologically contradictory, and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.<ref name=Don1993>{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&ndash;657 | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv| url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=artspapers }}</ref> However, many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity.\n\nProponents of the concept of hegemonic masculinity argue that it is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the [[Men's health|health of men]] and [[Women's health|women]], and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].<ref name=ConMes2005/> Critics argue that it is [[heteronormative]], is not self-reproducing, ignores positive aspects of masculinity, relies on a flawed underlying concept of masculinity, or is too ambiguous to have practical application.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]\nTerry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the \"real man\" is defined. According to [R.&nbsp;W.] Connell, contemporary hegemonic masculinity is built on two legs, domination of women and a hierarchy of intermale dominance. It is also shaped to a significant extent by the stigmatization of homosexuality. Hegemonic masculinity is the stereotypic notion of masculinity that shapes the socialization and aspirations of young males. Today\u2019s hegemonic masculinity in the United States of America and Europe includes a high degree of ruthless competition, an inability to express emotions other than anger, an unwillingness to admit weakness or dependency, devaluation of women and all feminine attributes in men, homophobia, and so forth.{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}\n}}\n\n===History===\nConnell first proposed the concept of hegemonic masculinity in field reports from a study of [[social inequality]] in Australian high schools;<ref name=Kessler1982>{{cite book | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&nbsp;W. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Sandra J. | last3 = Ashenden | first3 = Dean | last4 = Dowsett | first4 = Gary | author-link1 = Raewyn Connell | title = Ockers & disco-maniacs: a discussion of sex, gender and secondary schooling | publisher = Inner City Education Centre | location = Stanmore, New South Wales | year = 1982 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780908274246 }}</ref> in a related conceptual discussion of the making of masculinities and the experiences of men's bodies;<ref name=Con1983>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Which way is up?

In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].<ref name=Don1993/> Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.<ref name=Con2005>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}</ref> Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up to them.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.\n\nComplicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\nThe interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.<ref name=ConMes2005/> It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.<ref name=Con2005/> This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAs the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\n===Underlying concept of masculinity===\nThe underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view. To Hearn,<ref name=Hearn>{{Cite journal | last = Hearn | first = Jeff | title = From hegemonic masculinity to the hegemony of men | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1177/1464700104040813 | date = April 2004 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination. To Petersen,<ref name=Petersen>{{Cite journal | last = Petersen | first = Alan | title = Research on men and masculinities: Some implications of recent theory for future work | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&ndash;69 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X02250843 | date = July 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is flawed because it reduces the character of men or imposes a false unity of a fluid and contradictory reality. The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body. Brod<ref name=Brod>{{cite book | last = Brod | first = Harry | author-link = Harry Brod | chapter = Some thoughts on some histories of some masculinities: Jews and other others | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXk5DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA82 | editor-last1 = Brod | editor-first1 = Harry | editor-last2 = Kaufman | editor-first2 = Michael | editor-link1 = Harry Brod | editor-link2 = Michael Kaufman (author) | title = Theorizing masculinities | pages = [https://archive.org/details/theorizingmascul00brod/page/82 82&ndash;96] | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780803949041 | url = https://archive.org/details/theorizingmascul00brod/page/82 }}</ref> observes that there is a tendency in [[men's studies]] field to proceed as if women were not a relevant part of the analysis and therefore to analyse masculinities by looking only at men and relations among men. Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.\n\n===Ambiguity and overlap===\nEarly criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Many men who hold great social power do not embody other aspects of ideal masculinity. Martin<ref name=Martin>{{Cite journal | last = Martin | first = Patricia Yancey | title = Why can't a man be more like a woman? Reflections on Connell's ''Masculinities'' | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 472&ndash;474 | doi = 10.1177/089124398012004008 | date = August 1998 | ref = harv}}</ref> criticizes the concept for leading to inconsistent applications sometimes referring to a fixed type and other times to whatever the dominant form is. Wetherell and Edley<ref name=Weth>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wetherell | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Edley | first2 = Nigel | title = Negotiating hegemonic masculinity: Imaginary positions and psycho-discursive practices | journal = [[Feminism & Psychology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 335&ndash;356 | doi = 10.1177/0959353599009003012 | date = August 1999 | ref = harv| url = http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/4025/1/186657_4318%20Edley%20PostPrint.pdf }}</ref> contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead<ref name=White>{{cite book | last = Whitehead | first = Stephen M. | title = Men and masculinities: key themes and new directions | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745624679 }}</ref> suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&ndash;304 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv}}</ref> has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.\n\n===The problem of realness===\nIt has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Holter<ref name=Holter>{{cite book | last = Holter | first = \u00d8ystein Gullv\u00e5g | title = Can men do it? Men and gender equality: the Nordic experience | publisher = Nordic Council of Ministers | location = Copenhagen | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789289308458 }}</ref> argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier<ref name=Collier>{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}</ref> remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional (see [[affect display]]), aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.\n\n===The masculine subject===\nSeveral authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.<ref name=Weth/> To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.<ref name=White/> A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified [[essentialism]], wherein the \"achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&ndash;30 | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]</ref>\n\n===The pattern of gender relations===\nThere is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.<ref name=Deme>{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&ndash;361 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.\n\n==Reformulation==\nIn one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.<ref name=ConMes2005/> They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.\n\n===Gender hierarchy===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nGender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences the other. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.<ref name=ConMes2005/> An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of \"protest masculinity\", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.\n\nThis new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.\n\n===Geography of masculinities===\nChange in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],<ref name=Hoop>{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}</ref> and Connell proposed a model of \"transnational business masculinity\" among jet-setting corporate executives.<ref name=Con2005/> Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.<ref name=ConMes2005/> The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.\n\n===Social embodiment===\nSocial embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. Marios Kostas writes in ''[[Gender and Education]]'' that \"hegemonic masculinity is also related to professional success in the labour market, which describes the social definition of tasks into as either 'men's work' or 'women\u2019s work' and the definition of some kinds of work as more masculine than others\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kostas |first=Marios |title=Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses |journal=Gender and Education |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=530\u2013548 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 |url=http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}</ref> The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.<ref name=Con2002>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | url = https://archive.org/details/gender0000conn | url-access = registration | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}</ref>\n\n===Dynamics of masculinities===\nNew theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.<ref name=ConMes2005/> One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the \"long hours culture\" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.<ref name=ConMes2005/> While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.<ref name=Deme/> This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.<ref name=Collier/> Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or \"philogynous\" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Philogynous masculinities: contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 91&ndash;111 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X11427021 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==Lifespan development==\n===Early childhood===\nChildren learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\">{{cite journal | last = Laemmle | first = Julie | title = Barbara Martin: ''Children at Play: Learning Gender in the Early Years'' (book review) | journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&ndash;307 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | date = February 2013 | ref = harv }}\n*''Review of'': {{cite book | last = Martin | first = Barbara | title = Children at play: learning gender in the early years | publisher = Trentham Books | location = Stoke-on-Trent Sterling, Virginia | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781858564845 }}</ref> This notion of \"doing\" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference.<ref name=\"Bhana, D. 2009\">{{cite journal | last = Bhana | first = Deevia | title = \"Boys will be boys\": what do early childhood teachers have to do with it? | journal = Educational Review | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&ndash;339 | doi = 10.1080/00131910903045963 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by [[dominant ideology]] and feeds into social norms of masculinity.

The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy.

[[Heteronormativity]] is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction. Male-generic pronouns are a special problem in early childhood settings.<ref name=\"Gelb, S. 1989\"/> A recommended method to help gender barriers disappear is specific training for teachers and more education on the topic for parents.

The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.\n\nWhen a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/> This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\"/> Another notion which further confuses youth is \"multiple masculinities\" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.<ref name=\"Spector-Mersel, G. 2006\"/> Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Adolescence===\nThe last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> [[Bullying]] is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less \"masculine\" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality.

Stratis-Andreas Efthymiou points to how certain discourses projected to the international community, portraying post-conflict Cyprus, as a feminized victim in need of protection and deliverance, such as one of the mothers of the missing persons, were internally addressed with the masculinist ideology of \u2018defence\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|date=2016-09-30|title=Militarism in post-war Cyprus: the development of the ideology of defence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14702436.2016.1229126|journal=Defence Studies|volume=16|issue=4|pages=408\u2013426|doi=10.1080/14702436.2016.1229126|issn=1470-2436}}</ref>. The masculinist militarist assertiveness of the Cypriot state and people over the \u2018occupation\u2019 forces, generated a range of militarized roles for men, which opposed the idea of effeminacy marked by retreat, submissiveness and acceptance that the territory \u2018occupied\u2019 by Turkey was lost forever and thus no longer \u2018occupied\u2019<ref>{{Citation|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|title=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity After the Construction of the Border|date=2019|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14702-0_2|work=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|pages=23\u201353|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-030-14701-3|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>.\n\nHooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both \"the production and maintenance of masculinities.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\" /> War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity.\n\nHooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity \"symbolically, institutionally\", and culturally through body shape.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their \"enduring 'natural aggression'.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional \"exclusion of women from combat\", while furthering the myth \"that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a \"rite of passage\" for young men.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As such, \"war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities\" are formed and enshrined.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/>\n\nMilitarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a \"dominating and organizationally competent\" branch.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.\n\nMale rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled \"'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'\",<ref name=\"Penn 2014\">{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref> nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, \"The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him.\"<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> which is consistent with its media portrayal.

Connell]]'s [[Gender theory|gender order theory]], which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes [[Androcentrism|men's dominant]] position in society and justifies the subordination of the common male population and women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.<ref name=Con2005/> Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant [[social role]]s over women, and other [[gender identities]], which are perceived as \"[[feminine]]\" in a given society.\n\nAs a [[sociology|sociological]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by [[Marxist theorist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a [[social group]] claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of [[social organization]] that has been sociologically challenged and changed.\n\nThe conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, psychologically contradictory, and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.<ref name=Don1993>{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&ndash;657 | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv| url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=artspapers }}</ref> However, many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity.\n\nProponents of the concept of hegemonic masculinity argue that it is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the [[Men's health|health of men]] and [[Women's health|women]], and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].<ref name=ConMes2005/> Critics argue that it is [[heteronormative]], is not self-reproducing, ignores positive aspects of masculinity, relies on a flawed underlying concept of masculinity, or is too ambiguous to have practical application.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]\nTerry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the \"real man\" is defined.

In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].<ref name=Don1993/> Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.<ref name=Con2005>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}</ref> Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up to them.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.\n\nComplicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\nThe interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.<ref name=ConMes2005/> It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.<ref name=Con2005/> This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAs the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\n===Underlying concept of masculinity===\nThe underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view. To Hearn,<ref name=Hearn>{{Cite journal | last = Hearn | first = Jeff | title = From hegemonic masculinity to the hegemony of men | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1177/1464700104040813 | date = April 2004 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination.

The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body.

Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.\n\n===Ambiguity and overlap===\nEarly criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Many men who hold great social power do not embody other aspects of ideal masculinity.

Similarly Whitehead<ref name=White>{{cite book | last = Whitehead | first = Stephen M. | title = Men and masculinities: key themes and new directions | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745624679 }}</ref> suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&ndash;304 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv}}</ref> has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.\n\n===The problem of realness===\nIt has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Holter<ref name=Holter>{{cite book | last = Holter | first = \u00d8ystein Gullv\u00e5g | title = Can men do it?

Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier<ref name=Collier>{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}</ref> remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional (see [[affect display]]), aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.\n\n===The masculine subject===\nSeveral authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.<ref name=Weth/> To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.<ref name=White/> A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified [[essentialism]], wherein the \"achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&ndash;30 | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]</ref>\n\n===The pattern of gender relations===\nThere is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.<ref name=Deme>{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&ndash;361 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.\n\n==Reformulation==\nIn one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.<ref name=ConMes2005/> They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.\n\n===Gender hierarchy===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nGender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences the other. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.<ref name=ConMes2005/> An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of \"protest masculinity\", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.\n\nThis new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.\n\n===Geography of masculinities===\nChange in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],<ref name=Hoop>{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}</ref> and Connell proposed a model of \"transnational business masculinity\" among jet-setting corporate executives.<ref name=Con2005/> Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.<ref name=ConMes2005/> The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.\n\n===Social embodiment===\nSocial embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. Marios Kostas writes in ''[[Gender and Education]]'' that \"hegemonic masculinity is also related to professional success in the labour market, which describes the social definition of tasks into as either 'men's work' or 'women\u2019s work' and the definition of some kinds of work as more masculine than others\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kostas |first=Marios |title=Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses |journal=Gender and Education |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=530\u2013548 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 |url=http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}</ref> The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.<ref name=Con2002>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | url = https://archive.org/details/gender0000conn | url-access = registration | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}</ref>\n\n===Dynamics of masculinities===\nNew theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.<ref name=ConMes2005/> One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the \"long hours culture\" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.<ref name=ConMes2005/> While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.<ref name=Deme/> This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.<ref name=Collier/> Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or \"philogynous\" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Philogynous masculinities: contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 91&ndash;111 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X11427021 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==Lifespan development==\n===Early childhood===\nChildren learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\">{{cite journal | last = Laemmle | first = Julie | title = Barbara Martin: ''Children at Play: Learning Gender in the Early Years'' (book review) | journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&ndash;307 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | date = February 2013 | ref = harv }}\n*''Review of'': {{cite book | last = Martin | first = Barbara | title = Children at play: learning gender in the early years | publisher = Trentham Books | location = Stoke-on-Trent Sterling, Virginia | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781858564845 }}</ref> This notion of \"doing\" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference.<ref name=\"Bhana, D. 2009\">{{cite journal | last = Bhana | first = Deevia | title = \"Boys will be boys\": what do early childhood teachers have to do with it? | journal = Educational Review | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&ndash;339 | doi = 10.1080/00131910903045963 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by [[dominant ideology]] and feeds into social norms of masculinity. Children learn and show development of gender identity as an ongoing process, based on social situations. Gendered toys can play a large role in demonstrating the preferred actions and behaviour of young boys in [[early childhood]]. The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community.<ref name=\"Levant 1996\">{{cite journal |last=Levant |first=Ronald F. |title=The new psychology of men |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |date=1996 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=259\u2013265 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.27.3.259 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232569489}}</ref><ref name=\"Weir\">{{cite journal |last=Weir |first=Kirsten |title=The men America left behind |journal=Monitor on Psychology |date=February 2017 |volume=48 |issue=2 |page=34 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/02/men-left-behind.aspx |language=en}}</ref> Media representations of masculinity on websites such as [[YouTube]] often promote similar stereotypical gender roles.{{refn|name=Weir}}\n\nAlthough gender socialization is well underway before children reach preschool, stereotypical differences between boys and girls are typically reinforced, rather than diminished, by their early educational childhood experiences.<ref name=\"Gelb, S. 1989\">{{cite journal | last = Gelb | first = Steven A. | title = Language and the problem of male salience in early childhood classroom environments | journal = [[Early Childhood Research Quarterly]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 205&ndash;215 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2006(89)80003-1 | date = June 1989 | ref = harv }}</ref> Teachers have a large role in reinforcing gender stereotypes by limiting children's choices at this young age, thus not allowing boys to explore their feelings or their understandings about gender freely.

[[Heteronormativity]] is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction. Male-generic pronouns are a special problem in early childhood settings.<ref name=\"Gelb, S. 1989\"/> A recommended method to help gender barriers disappear is specific training for teachers and more education on the topic for parents.

The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.\n\nWhen a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/> This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\"/> Another notion which further confuses youth is \"multiple masculinities\" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.<ref name=\"Spector-Mersel, G. 2006\"/> Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Adolescence===\nThe last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> [[Bullying]] is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less \"masculine\" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality. This can lead to gay bashing and other forms of discrimination if young men seem not to perform the appropriate masculinity.\n\nThe male gender role is not biologically fixed, yet it is a result of the internalization of culturally defined gender norms and ideologies.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Oransky | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Celia | title = The development and validation of the meaning of adolescent masculinity scale | journal = [[Psychology of Men and Masculinity]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 57&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1037/a0013612 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> In this stage this is an important point as developmental psychologists recognize change in relations with parents, peers, and even their own self-identity.

Hooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both \"the production and maintenance of masculinities.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity.\n\nHooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity \"symbolically, institutionally\", and culturally through body shape.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their \"enduring 'natural aggression'.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional \"exclusion of women from combat\", while furthering the myth \"that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a \"rite of passage\" for young men.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As such, \"war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities\" are formed and enshrined.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/>\n\nMilitarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a \"dominating and organizationally competent\" branch.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.\n\nMale rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled \"'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'\",<ref name=\"Penn 2014\">{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref> nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, \"The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him.\"<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.\n\n==Toxic masculinity==\n{{main|Toxic masculinity}}\nConnell argues that an important feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of \"toxic\" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies.{{refn|name=ConMes2005}} Other scholars have used the term ''[[toxic masculinity]]'' to refer to stereotypically masculine [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s that can be expressed (see [[affect display]]) by boys and men, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the \"[[alpha male]]\").<ref name=\"Liu 2016\">{{cite news|url=http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012083303/http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-date=12 October 2016|title=How Trump's 'Toxic Masculinity' Is Bad for Other Men|last=Liu|first=William Ming|date=14 April 2016|work=Motto (Time)|access-date=|url-status=live|location=New York}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2020}}\n\nAccording to Terry Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, \"such as [[misogyny]], homophobia, greed, and violent domination\".

The actual [[observation]] of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]  4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...]  b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]  6.

Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired.\"</ref> The term does not imply that useful or long term learning, or the acquisition of skills necessarily takes place as a consequence of the experience, though the two are often associated, and experience is often used as a proxy for competence. A large amount of learning of knowledge and skills is associated with experience, and experience is a necessary, though not always sufficient component of the learning of physical skills.  Terms in [[philosophy]] such as \"[[empirical knowledge]]\" or \"''a posteriori'' knowledge\" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]]. The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]: [[on-the-job training]] rather than book-learning.\n\nThe interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the [[philosophy of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]. The [[German language|German]] term ''[[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]]'', often translated into English as \"experience\", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of [[personal life|life]]'s experiences.\n\nCertain [[religious]] [[traditions]] (such as [[Buddhism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[mysticism]] and [[Pentecostalism]]) and educational [[paradigms]] with, for example, the [[physical exercise|conditioning]] of military [[recruit training|recruit-training]] (also known as \"boot camps\"), stress the experiential nature of human [[epistemology]]. This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of [[dogma]], [[logic]] or [[reason]]ing. Participants in activities such as [[tourism]], [[extreme sports]] and [[recreational drug use|recreational drug-use]] also tend to stress the importance of experience.\n\nThe history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]].\n\n== Types of experience ==\nThe word \"experience\" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, both to [[mind|mentally]] unprocessed immediately perceived events as well as to the purported [[wisdom]] gained in subsequent reflection on those events or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.\n\nSome wisdom-experience accumulates over a period of [[time]],<ref>\nNote for example {{cite journal\n| last        = Levitt\n| first       = Heidi M.\n| authorlink  =\n| year        = 1999\n| title       = The Development of Wisdom: An Analysis of Tibetan Buddhist Experience\n| journal     = Journal of Humanistic Psychology\n| volume      = 39\n| issue       = 2\n| pages       = 86\u2013105\n| doi         = 10.1177/0022167899392006\n| url         = http://jhp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/39/2/86\n| accessdate  = 2010-01-21\n| quote       = Instead of significant events, however, they spoke of gradual experiences, such as learning through teachings day by day.\n}}\n</ref>\nthough one can also experience (and gain general wisdom-experience from) a single specific momentary event.\n\nOne may also [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]] between (for example) [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] and [[virtual reality|virtual]] experience(s).\n\n=== Physical ===\n{{Main|Physical property}}\n\nPhysical experience occurs whenever an object or environment changes.<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite book\n|first1= Karl R.\n|last1= Popper\n|author1-link= Karl Popper\n|first2= John C.\n|last2= Eccles\n|author2-link= John Eccles (neurophysiologist)\n|title= The self and its brain\n|year= 1977\n|publisher= Springer International\n|location= Berlin\n|isbn= 3-540-08307-3\n|page= [https://archive.org/details/selfitsbrain0000popp/page/425 425]\n|quote= You would agree, I think, that in our experience of the world everything comes to us through the senses [...]\n|url= https://archive.org/details/selfitsbrain0000popp/page/425\n}}\n</ref> In other words, physical experiences relate to [[observable]]s.

[[Mathematical realism]], like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover and experience it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. This point of view regards only one sort of mathematics as discoverable; it sees triangles, right angles, and curves, for example, as real entities, not just the creations of the human mind. Some working mathematicians have espoused mathematical realism as they see themselves experiencing naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] and [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]. G\u00f6del believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (for example: for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but some conjectures, like the [[continuum hypothesis]], might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. G\u00f6del suggested that quasi-empirical methodology such as experience could provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture. With experience, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Emotional ===\n{{Main|Emotion}}\n\nHumans can rationalize [[falling in love|falling in (and out of) love]] as \"emotional experience\".

Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8.

A large amount of learning of knowledge and skills is associated with experience, and experience is a necessary, though not always sufficient component of the learning of physical skills.  Terms in [[philosophy]] such as \"[[empirical knowledge]]\" or \"''a posteriori'' knowledge\" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]]. The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]: [[on-the-job training]] rather than book-learning.\n\nThe interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the [[philosophy of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]. The [[German language|German]] term ''[[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]]'', often translated into English as \"experience\", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of [[personal life|life]]'s experiences.\n\nCertain [[religious]] [[traditions]] (such as [[Buddhism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[mysticism]] and [[Pentecostalism]]) and educational [[paradigms]] with, for example, the [[physical exercise|conditioning]] of military [[recruit training|recruit-training]] (also known as \"boot camps\"), stress the experiential nature of human [[epistemology]]. This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of [[dogma]], [[logic]] or [[reason]]ing. Participants in activities such as [[tourism]], [[extreme sports]] and [[recreational drug use|recreational drug-use]] also tend to stress the importance of experience.\n\nThe history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]].\n\n== Types of experience ==\nThe word \"experience\" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, both to [[mind|mentally]] unprocessed immediately perceived events as well as to the purported [[wisdom]] gained in subsequent reflection on those events or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.\n\nSome wisdom-experience accumulates over a period of [[time]],<ref>\nNote for example {{cite journal\n| last        = Levitt\n| first       = Heidi M.\n| authorlink  =\n| year        = 1999\n| title       = The Development of Wisdom: An Analysis of Tibetan Buddhist Experience\n| journal     = Journal of Humanistic Psychology\n| volume      = 39\n| issue       = 2\n| pages       = 86\u2013105\n| doi         = 10.1177/0022167899392006\n| url         = http://jhp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/39/2/86\n| accessdate  = 2010-01-21\n| quote       = Instead of significant events, however, they spoke of gradual experiences, such as learning through teachings day by day.\n}}\n</ref>\nthough one can also experience (and gain general wisdom-experience from) a single specific momentary event.\n\nOne may also [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]] between (for example) [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] and [[virtual reality|virtual]] experience(s).\n\n=== Physical ===\n{{Main|Physical property}}\n\nPhysical experience occurs whenever an object or environment changes.<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite book\n|first1= Karl R.\n|last1= Popper\n|author1-link= Karl Popper\n|first2= John C.\n|last2= Eccles\n|author2-link= John Eccles (neurophysiologist)\n|title= The self and its brain\n|year= 1977\n|publisher= Springer International\n|location= Berlin\n|isbn= 3-540-08307-3\n|page= [https://archive.org/details/selfitsbrain0000popp/page/425 425]\n|quote= You would agree, I think, that in our experience of the world everything comes to us through the senses [...]\n|url= https://archive.org/details/selfitsbrain0000popp/page/425\n}}\n</ref> In other words, physical experiences relate to [[observable]]s.

First hand experience of the \"you had to be there\" variety can seem especially valuable and privileged, but it often remains potentially subject to errors in [[sense]]-[[perception]] and in personal [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].\n\n[[Second hand|Second-hand]] experience can offer richer resources: recorded and/or summarised from first-hand observers or experiencers or from instruments, and potentially expressing multiple [[Perspective (cognitive)|points of view]].\n\nThird-hand experience, based on indirect and possibly unreliable [[rumour]] or [[hearsay]], can (even given reliable accounts) potentially stray perilously close to blind honouring of [[authority]].\n\n== Changes through history ==\n\nSome [[post-modernism|post-modernist]]s suggest that the nature of human experiencing (quite apart from the details of the experienced surrounds) has undergone qualitative change during transition from the pre-modern through the [[modernity|modern]] to the [[post-modernity|post-modern]].<ref>\nCompare:  {{cite book\n|first1= Helga\n|last1= Nowotny\n|author1-link= Helga Nowotny\n|first2= Neville\n|last2= Plaice\n|author2-link=\n|title= Time: The Modern and Postmodern Experience\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LtZKRkAdeqQC\n|accessdate= 2010-01-21\n|year= 1996\n|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell\n|location=\n|isbn= 978-0-7456-1837-1\n|pages= 192\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Alternatives to experience ===\n[[Immanuel Kant]] contrasted experience with [[reason]]:\n:\"Nothing, indeed, can be more harmful or more unworthy of the philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to so-called experience.

Labour served in the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]] of 1940\u20131945, after which [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] established the [[National Health Service]] and expanded the [[welfare state]] from 1945 to 1951.

The first [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib\u2013Lab]] candidate to stand was [[George Odger]] in the [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]], the intellectual and largely middle-class [[Fabian Society]], the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]]<ref>Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation</ref> and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888\u20131893)|Scottish Labour Party]].\n\nAt the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], the Independent Labour Party put up 28 candidates but won only 44,325 votes. [[Keir Hardie]], the leader of the party, believed that to obtain success in parliamentary elections, it would be necessary to join with other left-wing groups. Hardie's roots as a lay preacher contributed to an ethos in the party which led to the comment by 1950s General Secretary [[Morgan Phillips]] that \"Socialism in Britain owed more to Methodism than Marx\".<ref>p.131 The Foundations of the British Labour Party by Matthew Worley {{ISBN|9780754667315}}</ref>\n\n=== Labour Representation Committee (1900\u20131906) ===\n{{main|Labour Representation Committee (1900)}}\n[[File:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keir Hardie]], one of the Labour Party's founders and its first leader]]\nIn 1899, a [[Doncaster]] member of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], Thomas R.

He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|October 1900]] \"Khaki election\" came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to \u00a333.{{sfn|Wright|Carter|1997}} Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful: [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nSupport for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay \u00a323,000 damages for a strike. The judgement effectively made strikes illegal, since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in opposition to the Conservatives' landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\n[[File:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party Plaque from Caroone House, 14 Farringdon Street]]\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], the LRC won 29 seats\u2014helped by a [[Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nIn their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name \"The Labour Party\" formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party.

The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the trade unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest trade unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow unions to fund Labour MPs once more without seeking the express consent of their members.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Labour Party split between supporters and opponents of the conflict but opposition to the war grew within the party as time went on. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], a notable anti-war campaigner, resigned as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and [[Arthur Henderson]] became the main figure of authority within the party. He was soon accepted into [[H. H. Asquith|Prime Minister Asquith]]'s war cabinet, becoming the first Labour Party member to serve in government.\n\nDespite mainstream Labour Party's support for the coalition the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the [[Non-Conscription Fellowship]] while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes.<ref>John Foster,  \"Strike action and working-class politics on Clydeside 1914\u20131919.\" ''International Review of Social History'' 35#1 (1990): 33\u201370.</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Henderson]] resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. The growth in Labour's local activist base and organisation was reflected in the elections following the war, the [[co-operative]] movement now providing its own resources to the [[Co-operative Party]] after the armistice. The Co-operative Party later reached an electoral agreement with the Labour Party.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, the Government was attempting to provide support for the newly re-established [[Poland]] against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. Henderson sent telegrams to all local Labour Party organisations to ask them to organise demonstrations against supporting Poland, later forming the Council of Action, to further organise strikes and protests. Due to the number of demonstrations and the potential industrial impact across the country, Churchill and the Government was forced to end support for the Polish war effort.<ref>http://isj.org.uk/the-russian-revolution-and-the-british-working-class/</ref>\n\nHenderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency-based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party's policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]]. Entitled \"Labour and the New Social Order,\" it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.<ref>Bentley B. Gilbert, ''Britain since 1918'' (1980) p 49.</ref> It was in 1918 that [[Clause IV]], as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]], was adopted into Labour's constitution, committing the party to work towards \"the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.\"\n\nWith the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], almost all adult men (excepting only peers, criminals and lunatics) and most women over the age of thirty were given the right to vote, almost tripling the British electorate at a stroke, from 7.7 million in 1912 to 21.4 million in 1918. This set the scene for a surge in Labour representation in parliament.<ref name=\"Rosemary Rees 2003 p. 200\">Rosemary Rees, ''Britain, 1890\u20131939'' (2003), p. 200</ref>  The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was refused affiliation to the Labour Party between 1921 and 1923.<ref name=\"Glasgow Digital Library\">{{cite web |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |title=Red Clydeside: The Communist Party and the Labour government [booklet cover&#93; / Communist Party of Great Britain, 1924 |publisher=Glasgow Digital Library |accessdate=13 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105173202/http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |archive-date=5 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] declined rapidly, and the party also suffered a catastrophic split which allowed the Labour Party to gain much of the Liberals' support.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914\u20131935'' (1966) ch 14</ref>  With the Liberals thus in disarray, Labour won 142 seats in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], making it the second largest political group in the House of Commons and the [[Official Opposition (UK)|official opposition]] to the Conservative government.

Thus, with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924, forming the first Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons).\n\nThe most significant achievement of the first Labour government was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]], which began a building programme of 500,000 [[municipal housing|municipal houses]] for rental to low paid workers. Legislation on education, unemployment, social insurance and tenant protection was also passed. However, because the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals it was unable to implement many of its more contentious policies such as [[nationalisation]] of the coal industry, or a [[capital levy]]. Although no radical changes were introduced, Labour demonstrating that they were capable of governing.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nWhile there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, \"public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement.\"{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=213\u2013214}}\n\nThe government collapsed after only ten months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the forged [[Zinoviev letter]], in which Moscow talked about a Communist revolution in Britain. The letter had little impact on the Labour vote\u2014which held up. It was the collapse of the Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals. However, many Labourites blamed for years their defeat on foul play (the Zinoviev letter), thereby according to [[A. J. P.

However MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald went on to appoint Britain's first woman cabinet minister; [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].<ref>John Shepherd, The Second Labour Government: A reappraisal (2012).</ref>\n\nMacDonald's second government was in a stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 Labour was able to pass legislation to raise unemployment pay, improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike) and pass a housing act which focused on slum clearances.<ref>Morgan, Kevin.

By the end of 1930 unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\">Davies, A.J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus</ref>  The government had no effective answers to the deteriorating financial situation, and by 1931 there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was born out by the independent [[May Report]] which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The cabinet deadlocked over its response, with several influential members unwilling to support the budget cuts (in particular a cut in the rate of unemployment benefit) which were pressed by the civil service and opposition parties. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]] refused to consider [[deficit spending]] or tariffs as alternative solutions. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11\u20139 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[George Lansbury]], threatening to resign rather than agree to the cuts. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign. MacDonald was encouraged by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] to form an all-party [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] to deal with the immediate crisis.<ref>Neil Riddell, ''Labour in Crisis: The Second Labour Government 1929\u20131931'' (Manchester UP, 1999).</ref><ref>Chris Wrigley, \"The Fall of the Second MacDonald Government, 1931.\" in T.

The king played the central role in demanding a National government be formed. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed to form a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (who formed a  \"[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]]\" group) who stood with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin, Chamberlain) and two Liberals.  MacDonald's moves aroused great anger among a large majority of Labour Party activists who felt betrayed. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition. It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52 seats. The Conservative-dominated National Government, led by MacDonald won the largest landslide in British political history.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2639239|title = Arthur Henderson and the British Political Crisis of 1931|journal = The Historical Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 117\u2013139|last1 = Thorpe|first1 = Andrew|year = 1988|doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00012012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Labour campaigned on opposition to public spending cuts, but found it difficult to defend the record of the party's former government and the fact that most of the cuts had been agreed before it fell. Historian Andrew Thorpe argues that Labour lost credibility by 1931 as unemployment soared, especially in coal, textiles, shipbuilding,  and steel. The working class increasingly lost confidence in the ability of Labour to solve the most pressing problem.{{sfn|Thorpe|1996}}\n\nThe 2.5 million Irish Catholics in England and Scotland were a major factor in the Labour base in many industrial areas. The Catholic Church had previously tolerated the Labour Party, and denied that it represented true socialism. However, the bishops by 1930 had grown increasingly alarmed at Labour's policies toward Communist Russia, toward birth control and especially toward funding Catholic schools. They warned its members. The Catholic shift against Labour and in favour of the National government played a major role in Labour's losses.{{sfn|Riddell|1997}}\n\n=== Labour in opposition (1931\u20131940) ===\n[[Arthur Henderson]], elected in 1931 to succeed MacDonald, lost his seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The only former Labour cabinet member who had retained his seat, the pacifist [[George Lansbury]], accordingly became party leader.\n\nThe party experienced another split in 1932 when the [[Independent Labour Party]], which for some years had been increasingly at odds with the Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party and embarked on a long, drawn-out decline.\n\nLansbury resigned as leader in 1935 after public disagreements over foreign policy. He was promptly replaced as leader by his deputy, [[Clement Attlee]], who would lead the party for two decades. The party experienced a revival in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], winning 154 seats and 38% of the popular vote, the highest that Labour had achieved.<ref>John Bew,  ''Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain'' (2017).</ref>\n\nAs the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased, in the late 1930s the Labour Party gradually abandoned its pacifist stance and came to support re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\" />\n\n=== Wartime coalition (1940\u20131945) ===\n{{see also|Churchill war ministry}}\nThe party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]].

The Labour Party returned to government with a 4-seat majority under Wilson in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] but increased its majority to 96 in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]].\n\nWilson's government was responsible for a number of sweeping social and educational reforms under the leadership of [[Home Secretary]] [[Roy Jenkins]] such as the abolishment of the [[death penalty]] in 1964, the legalisation of [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] (initially only for men aged 21 or over, and only in [[England and Wales]]) in 1967 and the abolition of theatre censorship in 1968. Wilson's government also put heavy emphasis on expanding opportunities through education, and as such, [[comprehensive education]] was expanded and the [[Open University]] created.\n\nWilson's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of relatively low unemployment and economic prosperity, it was however hindered by significant problems with a large trade deficit which it had inherited from the previous government. The first three years of the government were spent in an ultimately doomed attempt to stave off devaluation of the pound. Labour went on to unexpectedly lose the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] to the Conservatives under [[Edward Heath]].\n\n=== Spell in opposition (1970\u20131974) ===\nAfter losing the 1970 general election, Labour returned to opposition, but retained Harold Wilson as Leader. Heath's government soon ran into trouble over [[Northern Ireland]] and a dispute with miners in 1973 which led to the \"[[three-day week]]\". The 1970s proved a difficult time to be in government for both the Conservatives and Labour due to the [[1973 oil crisis]] which caused high inflation and a global recession.\n\nThe Labour Party was returned to power again under Wilson a few weeks after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with the support of the [[Ulster Unionist]]s. The Conservatives were unable to form a government alone as they had fewer seats despite receiving more votes numerically. It was the first general election since 1924 in which both main parties had received less than 40% of the popular vote and the first of six successive general elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid to gain a majority, a second election was soon called for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, won a slim majority of three, gaining just 18 seats taking its total to 319.\n\n=== Majority to minority (1974\u20131979) ===\n{{main|Labour Government 1974\u201379}}\nFor much of its time in office the Labour government struggled with serious economic problems and a precarious majority in the Commons, while the party's internal dissent over Britain's membership of the [[European Economic Community]], which Britain had entered under Edward Heath in 1972, led in 1975 to a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|national referendum]] on the issue in which two thirds of the public supported continued membership.\n\nHarold Wilson's personal popularity remained reasonably high but he unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister in 1976 citing health reasons, and was replaced by [[James Callaghan]].

Deals were then forged with various small parties including the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and the Welsh nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], prolonging the life of the government.\n\nThe nationalist parties, in turn, demanded [[devolution]] to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government. When referendums for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979 the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh devolution referendum]] saw a large majority vote against, while the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish referendum]] returned a narrow majority in favour without reaching the required threshold of 40% support. When the Labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed Scottish Assembly, the SNP withdrew its support for the government: this finally brought the government down as the Conservatives triggered a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of confidence]] in Callaghan's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 March 1979, necessitating a general election.\n\nBy 1978, the economy had started to show signs of recovery, with inflation falling to single digits, unemployment falling, and living standards starting to rise during the year.<ref>A Short History of the Labour Party by Henry Pelling</ref> Labour's opinion poll ratings also improved, with most showing the party to be in the lead.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}} Callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 to take advantage of the improving situation. In the event, he decided to gamble that extending the wage restraint policy for another year would allow the economy to be in better shape for a 1979 election. However this proved unpopular with the trade unions, and during the winter of 1978\u201379 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\".\n\nThese industrial disputes sent the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] now led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] into the lead in the polls, which led to Labour's defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. The Labour vote held up in the election, with the party receiving nearly the same number of votes than in 1974.

Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories for more than a year before Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on her introduction of the unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. The change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 although Labour regained the lead more than once.\n\nThe \"yo-yo\" in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme \"It's Time for a Change\", urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a change of leader from Thatcher to Major, and replaced the Community Charge.  From the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 \"Poll of Polls\" was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much reduced majority of 21.<ref name=\"1992: Tories win again against odds\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm 1992: Tories win again against odds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908173422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm |date=8 September 2017 }} BBC News, 5 April 2005</ref> Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for supporters of the Labour party. For the first time in over 30 years there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government.\n\nKinnock then resigned as leader and was succeeded by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Once again the battle erupted between the old guard on the party's left and those identified as \"modernisers\".  The old guard argued that trends showed they were regaining strength under Smith's strong leadership.  Meanwhile, the breakaway SDP merged with the Liberal Party. The new [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] seemed to pose a major threat to the Labour base. [[Tony Blair]] (the Shadow Home Secretary) had a different vision to traditional Labour politics. Blair, the leader of the \"modernising\" faction, argued that the long-term trends had to be reversed, arguing that the party was too locked into a base that was shrinking, since it was based on the working-class, on trade unions, and on residents of subsidised council housing. Blair argued that the rapidly growing middle class was largely ignored, as well as more ambitious working-class families. Blair said that they aspired to become middle-class and accepted the Conservative argument that traditional Labour was holding ambitious people back to some extent with higher tax policies. To present a fresh face and new policies to the electorate, [[New Labour]] needed more than fresh leaders; it had to jettison outdated policies, argued the modernisers.<ref>David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh, ''The British general election of 1997'' (1997) pp 46\u201367.</ref> The first step was procedural, but essential.

Although the recession was declared over in April 1993 and a period of strong and sustained economic growth followed, coupled with a relatively swift fall in unemployment, the Labour lead in the opinion polls remained strong.

The Labour Party only gained a \"socialist\" commitment with the original party constitution of 1918, but that \"socialist\" element, the original [[Clause IV]], was seen by its strongest advocates as a straightforward commitment to the \"common ownership\", or [[nationalisation]], of the \"means of production, distribution and exchange\". Although about a third of British industry was taken into public ownership after the Second World War and remained so until the 1980s, the right of the party were questioning the validity of expanding on this objective by the late 1950s. Influenced by [[Anthony Crosland]]'s book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956), the circle around party leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] felt that the commitment was no longer necessary.

The winning entry, emblazoned with the word \"Liberty\" over a design incorporating a torch, shovel and quill symbol, was popularised through its sale, in badge form, for a shilling.

It overtook the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to become the main opposition to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the early 1920s, forming two minority governments under [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in the 1920s and early 1930s. Labour served in the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]] of 1940\u20131945, after which [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] established the [[National Health Service]] and expanded the [[welfare state]] from 1945 to 1951. Under [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]], Labour again governed from [[Labour government, 1964\u20131970|1964 to 1970]] and [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|1974 to 1979]]. In the 1990s, [[Tony Blair]] took Labour to the [[Centrism|centre]] as part of his \"[[New Labour]]\" project, which governed the UK under Blair and then [[Gordon Brown]] from 1997 to 2010.\n\nThe Labour Party currently forms the Official Opposition in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], having won the second-largest number of seats in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] and [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general elections]].

The party includes semi-autonomous [[Scottish Labour|Scottish]] and [[Welsh Labour|Welsh]] branches, and supports the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) in Northern Ireland, although it still [[Labour Party in Northern Ireland|organises]] there.

The first [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib\u2013Lab]] candidate to stand was [[George Odger]] in the [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]], the intellectual and largely middle-class [[Fabian Society]], the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]]<ref>Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation</ref> and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888\u20131893)|Scottish Labour Party]].\n\nAt the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], the Independent Labour Party put up 28 candidates but won only 44,325 votes. [[Keir Hardie]], the leader of the party, believed that to obtain success in parliamentary elections, it would be necessary to join with other left-wing groups. Hardie's roots as a lay preacher contributed to an ethos in the party which led to the comment by 1950s General Secretary [[Morgan Phillips]] that \"Socialism in Britain owed more to Methodism than Marx\".<ref>p.131 The Foundations of the British Labour Party by Matthew Worley {{ISBN|9780754667315}}</ref>\n\n=== Labour Representation Committee (1900\u20131906) ===\n{{main|Labour Representation Committee (1900)}}\n[[File:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keir Hardie]], one of the Labour Party's founders and its first leader]]\nIn 1899, a [[Doncaster]] member of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], Thomas R.

The motion was passed at all stages by the TUC, and the proposed conference was held at the [[Congregational Memorial Hall]] on Farringdon Street, London on 26 and 27 February 1900.

He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|October 1900]] \"Khaki election\" came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to \u00a333.{{sfn|Wright|Carter|1997}} Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful: [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nSupport for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay \u00a323,000 damages for a strike. The judgement effectively made strikes illegal, since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in opposition to the Conservatives' landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\n[[File:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party Plaque from Caroone House, 14 Farringdon Street]]\nIn the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], the LRC won 29 seats\u2014helped by a [[Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nIn their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name \"The Labour Party\" formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party. One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}\n\nThe [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]] holds the minutes of the first Labour Party meeting in 1906 and has them on display in the Main Galleries.<ref name=\"People's History Museum\">{{cite web |title=Collection Highlights, 1906 Labour Party minutes |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/ |accessdate=23 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074421/http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/ |archive-date=20 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also within the museum is the Labour History Archive and Study Centre, which holds the collection of the Labour Party, with material ranging from 1900 to the present day.<ref name=\"phm.org.uk\">{{citation |title=The Labour Party Archive Catalogue & Description |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/ |access-date=20 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113161101/http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/ |archive-date=13 January 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Early years (1906\u20131923) ===\nThe [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 election]] saw 42 Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons, a significant victory since, a year before the election, the House of Lords had passed the [[Osborne judgment]] ruling that trade union members would have to 'opt in' to sending contributions to Labour, rather than their consent being presumed. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the trade unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest trade unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow unions to fund Labour MPs once more without seeking the express consent of their members.\n\nDuring the First World War, the Labour Party split between supporters and opponents of the conflict but opposition to the war grew within the party as time went on. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], a notable anti-war campaigner, resigned as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and [[Arthur Henderson]] became the main figure of authority within the party. He was soon accepted into [[H. H. Asquith|Prime Minister Asquith]]'s war cabinet, becoming the first Labour Party member to serve in government.\n\nDespite mainstream Labour Party's support for the coalition the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the [[Non-Conscription Fellowship]] while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes.<ref>John Foster,  \"Strike action and working-class politics on Clydeside 1914\u20131919.\" ''International Review of Social History'' 35#1 (1990): 33\u201370.</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Henderson]] resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. The growth in Labour's local activist base and organisation was reflected in the elections following the war, the [[co-operative]] movement now providing its own resources to the [[Co-operative Party]] after the armistice. The Co-operative Party later reached an electoral agreement with the Labour Party.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, the Government was attempting to provide support for the newly re-established [[Poland]] against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. Henderson sent telegrams to all local Labour Party organisations to ask them to organise demonstrations against supporting Poland, later forming the Council of Action, to further organise strikes and protests. Due to the number of demonstrations and the potential industrial impact across the country, Churchill and the Government was forced to end support for the Polish war effort.<ref>http://isj.org.uk/the-russian-revolution-and-the-british-working-class/</ref>\n\nHenderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency-based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party's policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]]. Entitled \"Labour and the New Social Order,\" it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.<ref>Bentley B. Gilbert, ''Britain since 1918'' (1980) p 49.</ref> It was in 1918 that [[Clause IV]], as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]], was adopted into Labour's constitution, committing the party to work towards \"the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.\"\n\nWith the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], almost all adult men (excepting only peers, criminals and lunatics) and most women over the age of thirty were given the right to vote, almost tripling the British electorate at a stroke, from 7.7 million in 1912 to 21.4 million in 1918. This set the scene for a surge in Labour representation in parliament.<ref name=\"Rosemary Rees 2003 p. 200\">Rosemary Rees, ''Britain, 1890\u20131939'' (2003), p. 200</ref>  The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was refused affiliation to the Labour Party between 1921 and 1923.<ref name=\"Glasgow Digital Library\">{{cite web |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |title=Red Clydeside: The Communist Party and the Labour government [booklet cover&#93; / Communist Party of Great Britain, 1924 |publisher=Glasgow Digital Library |accessdate=13 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105173202/http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |archive-date=5 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] declined rapidly, and the party also suffered a catastrophic split which allowed the Labour Party to gain much of the Liberals' support.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914\u20131935'' (1966) ch 14</ref>  With the Liberals thus in disarray, Labour won 142 seats in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], making it the second largest political group in the House of Commons and the [[Official Opposition (UK)|official opposition]] to the Conservative government. After the election Ramsay MacDonald was voted the first official [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|leader of the Labour Party]].\n\n=== First Labour government and period in opposition (1923\u20131929) ===\n{{main|First MacDonald ministry}}\n[[File:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.29588.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]], first Labour Prime Minister (1924 and 1929\u20131931)]]\nThe [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] was fought on the Conservatives' [[protectionist]] proposals but, although they got the most votes and remained the largest party, they lost their majority in parliament, necessitating the formation of a government supporting [[free trade]]. Thus, with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924, forming the first Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons).\n\nThe most significant achievement of the first Labour government was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]], which began a building programme of 500,000 [[municipal housing|municipal houses]] for rental to low paid workers. Legislation on education, unemployment, social insurance and tenant protection was also passed. However, because the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals it was unable to implement many of its more contentious policies such as [[nationalisation]] of the coal industry, or a [[capital levy]]. Although no radical changes were introduced, Labour demonstrating that they were capable of governing.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nWhile there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, \"public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement.\"{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=213\u2013214}}\n\nThe government collapsed after only ten months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the forged [[Zinoviev letter]], in which Moscow talked about a Communist revolution in Britain. The letter had little impact on the Labour vote\u2014which held up. It was the collapse of the Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals. However, many Labourites blamed for years their defeat on foul play (the Zinoviev letter), thereby according to [[A. J. P.

However MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald went on to appoint Britain's first woman cabinet minister; [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].<ref>John Shepherd, The Second Labour Government: A reappraisal (2012).</ref>\n\nMacDonald's second government was in a stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 Labour was able to pass legislation to raise unemployment pay, improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike) and pass a housing act which focused on slum clearances.<ref>Morgan, Kevin. (2006) MacDonald (20 British Prime Ministers of the 20th Century), Haus Publishing, {{ISBN|1-904950-61-2}}</ref>\n\nThe government, however, soon found itself engulfed in crisis: the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and eventual [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] occurred soon after the government came to power, and the slump in global trade hit Britain hard. By the end of 1930 unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\">Davies, A.J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus</ref>  The government had no effective answers to the deteriorating financial situation, and by 1931 there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was born out by the independent [[May Report]] which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The cabinet deadlocked over its response, with several influential members unwilling to support the budget cuts (in particular a cut in the rate of unemployment benefit) which were pressed by the civil service and opposition parties. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]] refused to consider [[deficit spending]] or tariffs as alternative solutions. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11\u20139 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[George Lansbury]], threatening to resign rather than agree to the cuts. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign. MacDonald was encouraged by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] to form an all-party [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] to deal with the immediate crisis.<ref>Neil Riddell, ''Labour in Crisis: The Second Labour Government 1929\u20131931'' (Manchester UP, 1999).</ref><ref>Chris Wrigley, \"The Fall of the Second MacDonald Government, 1931.\" in T.

The king played the central role in demanding a National government be formed. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed to form a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (who formed a  \"[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]]\" group) who stood with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin, Chamberlain) and two Liberals.  MacDonald's moves aroused great anger among a large majority of Labour Party activists who felt betrayed. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition. It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52 seats. The Conservative-dominated National Government, led by MacDonald won the largest landslide in British political history.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2639239|title = Arthur Henderson and the British Political Crisis of 1931|journal = The Historical Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 117\u2013139|last1 = Thorpe|first1 = Andrew|year = 1988|doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00012012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Labour campaigned on opposition to public spending cuts, but found it difficult to defend the record of the party's former government and the fact that most of the cuts had been agreed before it fell. Historian Andrew Thorpe argues that Labour lost credibility by 1931 as unemployment soared, especially in coal, textiles, shipbuilding,  and steel. The working class increasingly lost confidence in the ability of Labour to solve the most pressing problem.{{sfn|Thorpe|1996}}\n\nThe 2.5 million Irish Catholics in England and Scotland were a major factor in the Labour base in many industrial areas. The Catholic Church had previously tolerated the Labour Party, and denied that it represented true socialism. However, the bishops by 1930 had grown increasingly alarmed at Labour's policies toward Communist Russia, toward birth control and especially toward funding Catholic schools. They warned its members. The Catholic shift against Labour and in favour of the National government played a major role in Labour's losses.{{sfn|Riddell|1997}}\n\n=== Labour in opposition (1931\u20131940) ===\n[[Arthur Henderson]], elected in 1931 to succeed MacDonald, lost his seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The only former Labour cabinet member who had retained his seat, the pacifist [[George Lansbury]], accordingly became party leader.\n\nThe party experienced another split in 1932 when the [[Independent Labour Party]], which for some years had been increasingly at odds with the Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party and embarked on a long, drawn-out decline.\n\nLansbury resigned as leader in 1935 after public disagreements over foreign policy. He was promptly replaced as leader by his deputy, [[Clement Attlee]], who would lead the party for two decades. The party experienced a revival in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], winning 154 seats and 38% of the popular vote, the highest that Labour had achieved.<ref>John Bew,  ''Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain'' (2017).</ref>\n\nAs the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased, in the late 1930s the Labour Party gradually abandoned its pacifist stance and came to support re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].<ref name=\"To Build A New Jerusalem\" />\n\n=== Wartime coalition (1940\u20131945) ===\n{{see also|Churchill war ministry}}\nThe party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]].

The Labour Party returned to government with a 4-seat majority under Wilson in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] but increased its majority to 96 in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]].\n\nWilson's government was responsible for a number of sweeping social and educational reforms under the leadership of [[Home Secretary]] [[Roy Jenkins]] such as the abolishment of the [[death penalty]] in 1964, the legalisation of [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] (initially only for men aged 21 or over, and only in [[England and Wales]]) in 1967 and the abolition of theatre censorship in 1968. Wilson's government also put heavy emphasis on expanding opportunities through education, and as such, [[comprehensive education]] was expanded and the [[Open University]] created.\n\nWilson's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of relatively low unemployment and economic prosperity, it was however hindered by significant problems with a large trade deficit which it had inherited from the previous government. The first three years of the government were spent in an ultimately doomed attempt to stave off devaluation of the pound. Labour went on to unexpectedly lose the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] to the Conservatives under [[Edward Heath]].\n\n=== Spell in opposition (1970\u20131974) ===\nAfter losing the 1970 general election, Labour returned to opposition, but retained Harold Wilson as Leader. Heath's government soon ran into trouble over [[Northern Ireland]] and a dispute with miners in 1973 which led to the \"[[three-day week]]\". The 1970s proved a difficult time to be in government for both the Conservatives and Labour due to the [[1973 oil crisis]] which caused high inflation and a global recession.\n\nThe Labour Party was returned to power again under Wilson a few weeks after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with the support of the [[Ulster Unionist]]s. The Conservatives were unable to form a government alone as they had fewer seats despite receiving more votes numerically. It was the first general election since 1924 in which both main parties had received less than 40% of the popular vote and the first of six successive general elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid to gain a majority, a second election was soon called for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, won a slim majority of three, gaining just 18 seats taking its total to 319.\n\n=== Majority to minority (1974\u20131979) ===\n{{main|Labour Government 1974\u201379}}\nFor much of its time in office the Labour government struggled with serious economic problems and a precarious majority in the Commons, while the party's internal dissent over Britain's membership of the [[European Economic Community]], which Britain had entered under Edward Heath in 1972, led in 1975 to a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|national referendum]] on the issue in which two thirds of the public supported continued membership.\n\nHarold Wilson's personal popularity remained reasonably high but he unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister in 1976 citing health reasons, and was replaced by [[James Callaghan]].

Deals were then forged with various small parties including the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and the Welsh nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], prolonging the life of the government.\n\nThe nationalist parties, in turn, demanded [[devolution]] to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government. When referendums for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979 the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh devolution referendum]] saw a large majority vote against, while the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish referendum]] returned a narrow majority in favour without reaching the required threshold of 40% support. When the Labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed Scottish Assembly, the SNP withdrew its support for the government: this finally brought the government down as the Conservatives triggered a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of confidence]] in Callaghan's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 March 1979, necessitating a general election.\n\nBy 1978, the economy had started to show signs of recovery, with inflation falling to single digits, unemployment falling, and living standards starting to rise during the year.<ref>A Short History of the Labour Party by Henry Pelling</ref> Labour's opinion poll ratings also improved, with most showing the party to be in the lead.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}} Callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 to take advantage of the improving situation. In the event, he decided to gamble that extending the wage restraint policy for another year would allow the economy to be in better shape for a 1979 election. However this proved unpopular with the trade unions, and during the winter of 1978\u201379 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the \"[[Winter of Discontent]]\".\n\nThese industrial disputes sent the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] now led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] into the lead in the polls, which led to Labour's defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].

Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories for more than a year before Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on her introduction of the unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. The change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 although Labour regained the lead more than once.\n\nThe \"yo-yo\" in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme \"It's Time for a Change\", urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a change of leader from Thatcher to Major, and replaced the Community Charge.  From the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 \"Poll of Polls\" was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much reduced majority of 21.<ref name=\"1992: Tories win again against odds\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm 1992: Tories win again against odds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908173422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm |date=8 September 2017 }} BBC News, 5 April 2005</ref> Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for supporters of the Labour party. For the first time in over 30 years there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government.\n\nKinnock then resigned as leader and was succeeded by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Once again the battle erupted between the old guard on the party's left and those identified as \"modernisers\".  The old guard argued that trends showed they were regaining strength under Smith's strong leadership.  Meanwhile, the breakaway SDP merged with the Liberal Party. The new [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] seemed to pose a major threat to the Labour base. [[Tony Blair]] (the Shadow Home Secretary) had a different vision to traditional Labour politics. Blair, the leader of the \"modernising\" faction, argued that the long-term trends had to be reversed, arguing that the party was too locked into a base that was shrinking, since it was based on the working-class, on trade unions, and on residents of subsidised council housing. Blair argued that the rapidly growing middle class was largely ignored, as well as more ambitious working-class families. Blair said that they aspired to become middle-class and accepted the Conservative argument that traditional Labour was holding ambitious people back to some extent with higher tax policies. To present a fresh face and new policies to the electorate, [[New Labour]] needed more than fresh leaders; it had to jettison outdated policies, argued the modernisers.<ref>David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh, ''The British general election of 1997'' (1997) pp 46\u201367.</ref> The first step was procedural, but essential.

Although the recession was declared over in April 1993 and a period of strong and sustained economic growth followed, coupled with a relatively swift fall in unemployment, the Labour lead in the opinion polls remained strong.

The Labour Party only gained a \"socialist\" commitment with the original party constitution of 1918, but that \"socialist\" element, the original [[Clause IV]], was seen by its strongest advocates as a straightforward commitment to the \"common ownership\", or [[nationalisation]], of the \"means of production, distribution and exchange\". Although about a third of British industry was taken into public ownership after the Second World War and remained so until the 1980s, the right of the party were questioning the validity of expanding on this objective by the late 1950s. Influenced by [[Anthony Crosland]]'s book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956), the circle around party leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] felt that the commitment was no longer necessary.

The winning entry, emblazoned with the word \"Liberty\" over a design incorporating a torch, shovel and quill symbol, was popularised through its sale, in badge form, for a shilling.

It consists of Neuenstadt, the villages of Stein am Kocher, Kochert\u00fcrn, Cleversulzbach and B\u00fcrg and the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s Brambacher Hof (part of Kochert\u00fcrn), Buchhof and Lobenbacher Hof (part of Stein). The name Neuenstadt is derived from the \u201cder neuen Stadt\u201d or \u201cNew Town\u201d in English.\n\n== Geography ==\nNeuenstadt lies on the [[Kocher]] river in the east of the District of [[Heilbronn]]. It stands on a hill where the Brettach flows into the Kocher river.\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nStarting from the south going in a clockwise direction, Neuenstadt is surrounded by [[Eberstadt]], ''[[Neckarsulm]]'', [[Oedheim]], ''[[Bad Friedrichshall]]'', ''[[Neudenau]]'', Hardthausen am Kocher and Langenbrettach (all also in the district of Heilbronn). Neuenstadt is part of a joint administration agreement with Hardthausen am Kocher and Langenbrettach.\n\n=== Districts of Neuenstadt ===\nThe town of Neuenstadt is subdivided into the districts of Neuenstadt itself, Stein am Kocher, Kochert\u00fcrn, Cleversulzbach, B\u00fcrg and the hamlets of Brambacherhof, Buchhof and Lobenbacher Hof (of Stein).\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Neuensstadt-lindenanlage3.JPG|thumb|The Lime garden on the former site of the 'Great 1000-year-old Lime']]\n[[Image:Neuenstadt-schloss-11.JPG|thumb|Neuenstadt Castle]]\nNeuenstadt was originally a settlement known as Helmbund which was first mentioned in records as early in 797 A.D. Helmbund stood in the meadows of Brettach. It is believed that the settlement moved a kilometer away at some time around the beginning of the 14th century to avoid flooding. Since then it has stood on higher ground between the Kocher and Brettach rivers. This gave rise to name New Town, or \"Neue Stadt\" in German. The hamlet of Helmbund subsequently all but disappeared with only the scattered ruins of the Gothic church of Helmbund remaining. Neuenstadt first fell under the reign of the rulers of [[Weinsberg]] whose lineage came to an end in 1507. As a result, it was originally a town from the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] before falling into the area of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1504. In the 17th and 18th century the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt]] branch line of the ducal house of W\u00fcrttemberg took up residence in Neuenstadt castle until the male lineage of dukes died out in 1742.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Second World War]] the fortified stronghold of Neuenstadt came under heavy fire from allied forces. In April 1945, nearly 80% of Neuenstadt old town was destroyed. During fighting, one of the wires holding up the legendary lime tree that stood outside the gates of the town, which had given the town part of its name in medieval times, was torn into pieces. Subsequently, a violent storm shattered the tree. Since then, fragments of live wood, suitable for 'cuttings', were garnered, grown until rooted then large enough to hold a structure, a kind of pergola in an attractive lime garden, which now surrounds the bottom of the tree trunk that has survived. This is so substantial it gives some idea of just how enormous the original tree would have been.\n\n=== Annexed communities ===\n* January 1, 1972: Cleversulzbach\n* September 1, 1972: Kochert\u00fcrn\n* December 31, 1972: Stein am Kocher\n* January 1, 1973: B\u00fcrg\n\n=== Religion ===\nNeuenstadt underwent the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1541 and is now home to the deanery of the W\u00fcrttembergisch State Church. The Evangelical Church Parish of Neuenstadt, which also encompasses Kochert\u00fcrn, Stein and B\u00fcrg currently boasts 2960 members. The font in the church at Gosheim castle is said to have originally stood in B\u00fcrg church.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== District council  ===\nLocal elections on June 13, 2004 returned the following seats:\n{| border=0\n|- bgcolor=#FFFFFF\n|- bgcolor=#CCDDEE\n|- bgcolor=#CCDDEE\n|party||amount||+/-||seats||+/-\n|- bgcolor=#DDEEFF\n|[[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] ||align=right | 44.2%||align=right | (+3.9)||align=right | 9||align=right | (=)\n|- bgcolor=#DDEEFF\n|BG citizens party ||align=right | 31.5%||align=right | (\u22123.5)||align=right | 6||align=right | (\u22121)\n|- bgcolor=#DDEEFF\n|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] ||align=right | 24.3%||align=right | (\u22120.4)||align=right | 4||align=right | (\u22121)\n|- bgcolor=#DDEEFF\n|}\n\nThe town mayor is also member and chairman of the district council.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe Neuenstadt coat of arms depicts two silver shields over a silver helmet on a blue background. Blue and white are the town\u2019s official colours.\n\nThe coat of arms originate from a seal first used in the late 13th century. The colours have remained unchanged since 1535. The shields are believed to represent the two founders of the \u201cnew town\u201d \u2013 the Lords of Weinsberg \u2013 who used three silver shields on a red background as their coat of arms. The helmet (German:\u2018Helm\u2019) points to the origins of the town, the now lost settlement of Helmbund.\n\n== International relations==\n{{Main article|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nNeuenstadt am Kocher belongs to a \u2018towns association\u2019 consisting of 36 towns in 5 European states. All towns in the association share a similar name in the indigenous language: '[[:de:Neustadt in Europa|New Town]]'.\n\n== People, culture and architecture ==\n\n=== Architecture ===\n*From 1618 to 1781 Neuenstadt Renaissance Castle was residence to the W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt branch line of the royal house of W\u00fcrttemberg. The castle was built between 1559 and 1565 on the fortification walls of the Lords of Weinsberg\u2019s castle.\n*The evangelical Nikolaus Church dates back to the 16th century. Under the chancel is a crypt which was used as a burial vault between 1659 and 1781 for the three Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt.\n*The castle and church join together to form the upper Gate Tower which was built in 1300 and renewed in 1703. The current tower was reconstructed following a fire in 1831.\n*A number of historical timber-framed buildings still stand in Neuenstadt old town including the Old Apothecary and gate, dating back to 1801, the rectory from 1749 and the Old Forestry Commission office.\n*Until April 1945 a huge lime tree stood near the castle outside the Gate Tower. It was reputed to be 1000 years old and lent the town its alternative name of Neuenstadt of the Great Lime Tree. The lime was destroyed by allied bombing during fighting near the end of the Second World War, but locals people found live shoots from the destroyed tree and grew new lime trees around the former lime. Their branches now form a shady garden, supported by approx 100 stone pillars donated by local citizens and aristocrats. The pillars in the garden were renovated between 1962 and 1981 and now bear the coats of arms of the manor houses of the Lords of Ehrenberg, the Lords of Berlichingen and the Lords of Gemmingen from 1557.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Neuenstadt-nikolauskirche3.JPG|The Nikolaus Church\nImage:Neuenstadt-brunnen1703-reko1952.JPG|The town fountain\nImage:Neuenstadt-hauptstr4.JPG|Neuenstadt High Street, Autumn 2006\n</gallery>\n\n[[Image:Neuenstadt-freilichtbuehne1.JPG|thumb|The open-air theatre in the castle moat]]\n\n=== Open-air theatre ===\nSince 1958, Neuenstadt has staged an open-air theatre every year between June and July in the castle moat.

It was part of a Royalist campaign led by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to take control of the Severn Valley from the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. Following the costly [[storming of Bristol]] on 26 July, Charles invested Gloucester in the hope that a show of force would prompt it to surrender quickly and without bloodshed. When the city, under the the governorship of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused, the Royalists attempted to bombard it into submission. Massey adopted an aggressive defence, and the Royalist positions outside the city were regularly disrupted by Parliamentarian raids. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate for the task of siege work and, faced with a shortage of ammunition, the besiegers attempted to breach the city walls by mining. With Royalist miners about to reach the city's east gate and the defenders critically low on gunpowder, a Parliamentarian army led by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] arrived and forced Charles to lift the siege.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|King Charles I|alt=Painting]]\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, [[Storming of Bristol|seized Bristol]]. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege|alt=Map]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north gates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 pp. 242\u2013245</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\n[[File:Edward Massie.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Massey|alt=Painting]]\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey to consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve in the days immediately before the siege began. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, Royalist reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege|alt=Map]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref>\n\nMassey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned nearby to target the east wall.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Earl of Essex on horseback (State 2).jpg|thumb|Earl of Essex|alt=Drawing]]\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, remained vigilant behind their defences rather than attempt to harass the retreating Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Charles I (State 3).jpg|thumb|left|Charles leading his troops|alt=Drawing]]\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], Essex was able to march back up into the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\nGloucester resumed its role as a logistic base for local operations and remained a Parliamentarian centre for the rest of the war, though Massey was removed as governor in 1645 over suspicions about his loyalty. By 1649 the burden of maintaining the garrison was generating divisions within the city. In 1651 a Scottish army moved south in support of the Royalists, prompting the city to restore its fortifications and raise a new town regiment. The garrison was withdrawn two years later, but in 1659, the city became increasingly divided as support for Parliament dissipated. Pury raised 300 troops to defend Gloucester for Parliament, while Massey, now a Royalist, plotted its capture.

English Civil War]]. It was part of a Royalist campaign led by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to take control of the Severn Valley from the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. Following the costly [[storming of Bristol]] on 26 July, Charles invested Gloucester in the hope that a show of force would prompt it to surrender quickly and without bloodshed. When the city, under the the governorship of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused, the Royalists attempted to bombard it into submission. Massey adopted an aggressive defence, and the Royalist positions outside the city were regularly disrupted by Parliamentarian raids. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate for the task of siege work and, faced with a shortage of ammunition, the besiegers attempted to breach the city walls by mining. With Royalist miners about to breach the city's east gate and the defenders critically low on gunpowder, a Parliamentarian army led by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] arrived and forced Charles to lift the siege.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|King Charles I|alt=Painting]]\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, [[Storming of Bristol|seized Bristol]]. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege|alt=Map]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north gates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 pp. 242\u2013245</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\n[[File:Edward Massie.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Massey|alt=Painting]]\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey to consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve in the days immediately before the siege began. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, Royalist reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege|alt=Map]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref>\n\nMassey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned nearby to target the east wall.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Earl of Essex on horseback (State 2).jpg|thumb|Earl of Essex|alt=Drawing]]\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, remained vigilant behind their defences rather than attempt to harass the retreating Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Charles I (State 3).jpg|thumb|left|Charles leading his troops|alt=Drawing]]\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], Essex was able to march back up into the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\nGloucester resumed its role as a logistic base for local operations and remained a Parliamentarian centre for the rest of the war, though Massey was removed as governor in 1645 over suspicions about his loyalty. By 1649 the burden of maintaining the garrison was generating divisions within the city. In 1651 a Scottish army moved south in support of the Royalists, prompting the city to restore its fortifications and raise a new town regiment. The garrison was withdrawn two years later, but in 1659, the city became increasingly divided as support for Parliament dissipated. Pury raised 300 troops to defend Gloucester for Parliament, while Massey, now a Royalist, plotted its capture. As the war came to an end Massey returned to and was elected as the member of parliament for Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 156</ref><ref>Herbert 1988 pp. 92\u201395</ref> After the [[The Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] ordered Gloucester's walls to be demolished.<ref>Warmington 1997 p. 182</ref>\n\nIn 1956 Professor [[David Daube]] suggested that the nursery rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]] originated from a [[siege engine]] used at Gloucester, based on a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected.<ref>Daube 2009 pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia,<ref>Rodger 1999</ref> but it was derided by others as \"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\" and declared to be a spoof.<ref>Opie 1997 p. 254</ref><ref>Opie 2004 p. 76.</ref> In 2009 the annual [[Gloucester Day]] \u2013 a tradition begun after the siege to celebrate its lifting \u2013 was resurrected, having died out in the 19th century.<ref>BBC News 2009</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Daube |first=David |title=Ethics and Other Writings |publisher=Robins Collection, University of California |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-882239-15-3 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Day |first=Jon |title=Gloucester and Newbury 1643: The Turning Point of the Civil War |type=E-Book |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84415-591-0 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Opie |first=I. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-860088-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Opie |first=I. |editor-last=Hunt|editor-first=Hunt|title=International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature |chapter=Playground rhymes and the oral tradition|publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2004 |isbn=0-203-16812-7 }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Rhodes|first=John|title=The Severn Flood-Plain at Gloucester in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods|journal= Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society|volume=124|publisher=|year=2006|pages=9\u201336|doi=}}\n* {{cite news |last=Rodger |first=Alan |date=5 March 1999 |work=[[The Independent]]|title=Obituary: Professor David Daube}}\n* {{cite book |last=Warmington |first=Andrew Richard |title=Civil War, Interregnum and Restoration in Gloucestershire, 1640-1672 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |year=1997 |isbn=9780861932368 }}\n\n===Websites===\n* {{cite web |editor-last=Herbert |editor-first=N.M. |year=1988 |title=A History of the County of Gloucester: Gloucester: Bridges, gates and walls|volume=4|publisher=British History Online |pages=242\u2013245|accessdate=8 April 2020|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol4/pp242-245 }}\n* {{cite web |editor-last=Herbert |editor-first=N.M. |year=1988 |title=A History of the County of Gloucester: Gloucester, 1640-60: The English Revolution|volume=4|publisher=British History Online |pages=92\u201395|accessdate=12 April 2020|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol4/pp92-95 }}\n* {{cite news |last= |first= |date=5 September 2009 |work=BBC News|title=Tradition revived for city pride}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Atkin |first1=Malcolm |last2=Laughlin |first2=Wayne |title=Gloucester and the Civil War : a city under siege |publisher=Far Thrupp |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |year=1993|isbn=9780750901482 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Morris |first=Robert |title=The siege of Gloucester, 1643 |publisher=Stuart Press |location=Bristol |year=1993|isbn=9781858040141 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Whiting |first=J.R.S. |title=Gloucester besieged: The story of a roundhead city 1640-1660 |publisher=City Museum |location=Gloucester |year=1984|edition=2nd|orig-year=1975 |oclc=12509753 }}\n\n{{coord |51.864|-2.2438|type:event_region:GB-GLS|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Sieges of the English Civil Wars|Gloucester, Siege of]]\n[[Category:1643 in England]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1643]]\n[[Category:History of Gloucester]]\n[[Category:Military history of Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:17th century in Gloucestershire]]\n", "name_user": "Factotem", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Gloucester"}

{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], ruled by [[Zamorin]]s.  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although da Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Da Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat da Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.  All the chroniclers\u2014Castanheda, Barros, etc.\u2014name Gaspar de Lemos instead of Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves. Chronicler [[Jer\u00f3nimo Os\u00f3rio]] (''De rebus Emmanuelis'', 1571) does not list captain names.</ref> The main conflict is with [[Gaspar Correia]]'s ''Lendas da \u00cdndia'', who omits P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde and Aires Gomes da Silva, listing instead Braz Matoso and Pedro de Figueir\u00f3, and introduces Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves in addition to Lemos. Correia also identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as vice-admiral and captain of Cabral's own flagship.<ref>Gaspar Correia ''Lendas da India'' (c.1550, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 148])</ref><ref group=note>This list conforms very closely with the original ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'',  but not with its corrected marginal gloss (Maldonado, 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7pTrH3zmhj8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false p.10]).  The other great deviant is the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which introduces four new names: Diogo de Figueir\u00f3, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, Ruy de Miranda, and Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves, who replace P. d'Ataide, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, and G. de Lemos.</ref>  Neither of the two eyewitnesses\u2014an anonymous Portuguese pilot and [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\u2014give a list of captains in their sources. \n\n[[File:Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral - steel engraving by American Bank Note Company.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.]]\n\nThe Second Armada was to be headed by the Portuguese nobleman [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], a master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]. Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope back in 1488, and his brother [[Diogo Dias]], who had served as clerk on da Gama's ship in the first expedition, also served as captains in the trip. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco da Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Zamorin's kingdom taken by da Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal da Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Sofala factor Afonso Furtado, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. Calicut had been visited by [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada in 1498, but failed to impress the elderly ruling [[Zamorin|Manivikraman Raja Zamorin]] ('Samoothiri Raja') of Calicut, and no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were precisely to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, to be placed under Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the [[East Africa]]n port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p.107</ref>  Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the end-point of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, instructions were probably also given to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala (see [[Kilwa Sultanate]]).  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but overlooked by Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of 'primitive' Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the 'Hindu church' up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of [[Franciscan]] friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nFinally, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon.\n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some controversial debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>e.g. Peres (1948). Among the pieces of 'evidence', is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]], in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1505, Cap. 2), that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.  That's about the full extent of the evidence of 'intentionality'.  See Greenlee (1938: pp.l-lv) for a critical assessment.</ref>    This claim is largely speculative.  There is no evidence of any such instructions, and various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the [[South America]]n mainland (around [[Guyana]]) in 1498, on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela]]n coast, with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]] exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] (in [[Pernambuco]]), and explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it.  It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref>Although the person the Spanish crown was trying to claim land away from was not the king of Portugal (that was already mediated by Tordesillas anyway), but from  Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies!  Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e. to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty, limiting him to the islands he already had.  This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500 (indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea).  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  And, even if they were, it would not seem sensible to deviate Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, on an important mission to India, to pursue some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters, that could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a couple of little caravels.\n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by [[Vasco da Gama]] on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.  The Anonymous Pilot says the supply ship captain was sent back\u2014but does not identify him by name.  The principal ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' is similarly obscure, although its marginal gloss identifies him as Lemos.</ref>) back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] composed by the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to announce the discovery.  It also carries a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identifies the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s</ref>  The supply ship will arrive in Lisbon in June.\n\nMay 3, 1500 \u2013 Leaving behind a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral orders the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nLate May, 1500 \u2013 After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reaches the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by da Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that da Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], ruled by [[Zamorin]]s.  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although da Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Da Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat da Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope back in 1488, and his brother [[Diogo Dias]], who had served as clerk on da Gama's ship in the first expedition, also served as captains in the trip. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco da Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Zamorin's kingdom taken by da Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal da Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Sofala factor Afonso Furtado, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. Calicut had been visited by [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada in 1498, but failed to impress the elderly ruling [[Zamorin|Manivikraman Raja Zamorin]] ('Samoothiri Raja') of Calicut, and no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were precisely to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, to be placed under Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the [[East Africa]]n port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p.107</ref>  Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the end-point of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, instructions were probably also given to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala (see [[Kilwa Sultanate]]).  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but overlooked by Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of 'primitive' Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the 'Hindu church' up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of [[Franciscan]] friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nFinally, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon.\n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some controversial debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>e.g. Peres (1948). Among the pieces of 'evidence', is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]], in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1505, Cap. 2), that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.  That's about the full extent of the evidence of 'intentionality'.  See Greenlee (1938: pp.l-lv) for a critical assessment.</ref>    This claim is largely speculative.  There is no evidence of any such instructions, and various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the [[South America]]n mainland (around [[Guyana]]) in 1498, on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela]]n coast, with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]] exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] (in [[Pernambuco]]), and explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it.  It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref>Although the person the Spanish crown was trying to claim land away from was not the king of Portugal (that was already mediated by Tordesillas anyway), but from  Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies!  Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e. to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty, limiting him to the islands he already had.  This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500 (indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea).  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  And, even if they were, it would not seem sensible to deviate Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, on an important mission to India, to pursue some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters, that could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a couple of little caravels.\n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by [[Vasco da Gama]] on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.

It also carries a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identifies the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s</ref>  The supply ship will arrive in Lisbon in June.\n\nMay 3, 1500 \u2013 Leaving behind a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral orders the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nLate May, 1500 \u2013 After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reaches the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by da Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that da Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]].\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.
