Switzerland, with a [[Swiss neutrality|tradition of neutrality]] stretching back to [[Congress of Vienna|1815]], suddenly found itself accepting requests to provide diplomatic and consular services around the world on behalf of various governments that no longer wished to pursue diplomatic interactions directly.   Diplomatic relations between Britain and Germany were broken off.<ref name=DiplVertrCL/>   At the Swiss consulate in [[Mandatory Palestine|(British) Palestine]] Carl Lutz was placed in charge of diplomatic representation in behalf of several foreign countries including [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], which since [[Machtergreifung|1933]] had been governed as a [[one-party state|one-]][[Nazi Party|party]] [[Enabling Act of 1933|dictatorship]].<ref name=CuGLFlautPK/><ref name=DiplVertrCL>{{cite web|url=https://alt.juedischerundschau.de/wp-content/uploads/archiv/jr-42.pdf|page=33|title=Der Schweizer war pl\u00f6tzlich Vertreter mehrerer L\u00e4nder|work=Der erfinderische Konsul Lutz:  Die Rolle des schweizerischen Diplomaten Carl Lutz bei der Rettung der ungarischen Jude|publisher=[[:de:J\u00fcdische Rundschau|J\u00fcdische Rundschau]], Berlin|author=Matthias Dornfeldt |date=February 2018|accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>   Alongside an enormous increase in administrative work, and having to work with various [[Nazi Party|National Socialist agencies]], representing Germany diplomatically in Palestine also involved coping with a massive level of humanitarian and social work.

Another major responsibility involved creating and sustaining contacts with large numbers of German Jews in the territory who had suddenly found themselves rendered stateless in 1935 as a result of the [[Nuremberg Laws |Nuremberg [race] Laws]].   Through their diplomatic and consular work together in [[Mandatory Palestine |Palestine]] Carl and Gertrud Lutz built up experience and established contacts internationally that would prove invaluable through the challenges ahead, notably during their posting in [[Budapest]].<ref name=CuGLFlautPK/>\n\nAfter the transfer of the \"German interest section\" in Palestine of the Swiss consular department to Spain [[Carl Lutz]] was returned to Switzerland in the Autumn of 1940.<ref name=CLlautETHZue>{{cite web |url=http://onlinearchives.ethz.ch/detail.aspx?guid=500e929d9626406796c4425762d74125 |title=Lutz, Carl   30.3.1895-12.2.1975   Konsul  |work=Archiv f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte |publisher=[[ETH Zurich |ETH Z\u00fcrich]] |accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>   Gertrud Lutz stayed on, liaising closely with the British military authorities, and looking after the German women and children whom the British had identified as \"enemy aliens\" when the war broke out, and who continued to be detained in camps.

While they had been apart, the Swiss Foreign Minister [[Giuseppe Motta]], in recognition of his remarkable contribution and that of his wife during their time in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], had promoted Carl Lutz to the rank of vice-consul.<ref name=CuGLFlautPK/>   During 1941 he had been representing the interests of [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in [[Berlin]].   In January 1942 he was appointed to head up the foreign interests section at the Swiss embassy in [[Budapest]].   It was a prestigious posting but also an inherently complicated one.<ref name=CuGLFlautPK/>   At various stages he represented the interests of up to fourteen foreign states which found themselves at war with [[Hungary in World War II |Hungary]].   These included [[United States of America|the USA]] and [[Great Britain]], along with its [[Dominion#Dominions|dominions round the world]] (including [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]).<ref name=\"Frank\u00f32011\">{{cite book|author=Krisztina Frank\u00f3|title=Methodenauswahl und Forschungsdurchfuehrung |work=Interkulturelle Kommunikation in Ungarn t\u00e4tiger Unternehmen aus dem deutschsprachigen Raum (Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich, Schweiz): Konzeptionelle Grundlagen, Empirische Ergebnisse, Gestaltungsempfehlungen |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DQsjW2FkYUQC&pg=PA67|year=2011|publisher=Rainer Hampp Verlag |isbn=978-3-86618-753-5 |pages= 60\u201373}}</ref>   At the time of their posting to Budapest, Hungary was [[Tripartite Pact|allied to]] [[Nazi Germany |Germany]].

As the German military authorities began the grim task of herding the Jewish population of Budapest into ghettoes, approximately 30,000 people received protection in their homes from protection documents issued by the Swiss vice-consul, with 76 houses designated as buildings under Swiss diplomatic protection.   Limited quotas of protection documents that Lutz had been allocated in the anticipation that they would be used for individuals were instead adapted so that each applied to entire family units, this increasing the number of people protected.   Lutz's team engaged in constant legalistic wrangles to ensure that the diplomatic protections were respected under wartime conditions, but with the German forces accustomed to following rules and frightened of the consequences of not doing so, the protective documents issued and administered on behalf of neutral Switzerland were widely respected by soldiers on the ground through most of 1944.<ref name=CuGLFlautPK/><ref name=DiplVertrCL/><ref name=\"Lustiger2012\">{{cite book|author=Arno Lustiger|title=Diplomaten:  Die Schweizer Botschaft in Budapest |work=Rettungswiderstand: \u00dcber die Judenretter in Europa w\u00e4hrend der NS-Zeit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gl4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA332|date=27 January 2012|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|isbn=978-3-8353-2150-2|pages=331\u2013343}}</ref>\n\nBetween December 1944 and February 1945, during the [[Siege of Budapest|50-day Soviet blockade of Budapest]], Carl and Gertrud Lutz looked after \"more than 50\" people who were hidden in the basement of the Swiss embassy buildings, which now included not merely the pre-war Swiss embassy building but also the former embassies of states that were now, following the severing of direct diplomatic relations, being represented by the foreign interest section of the much expended Swiss diplomatic estate.

There was no mass starvation, but the great majority of children were badly underweight, while the poor quality of the remaining housing caused an alarmingly high level of [[Tuberculosis]], which meant that agencies including the Red Cross and UNICEF were called upon to provide extensive medical support along with the feeding programme.   UNICEF also funded an anti-rickets campaign and short post-graduate study programmes in Switzerland for young Polish doctors.   In Poland as in Germany most of the industrial capacity had been reduced to rubble during the war.   During Lutz-Fankhauser's time running the UNICEF mission in Poland, in collaboration with the government and other agencies, UNICEF arranged vaccination programmes.   They also supplied pasteurisation equipment for milk collection depots and set up five powdered milk factories.<ref name=GLlautRF/>\n\nHer longest and in many ways most successful posting was to [[Brazil]] where she headed up the UNICEF mission between 1951 and 1964.   It was a period of rapid change.   There were serious challenges to be addressed with respect to child nutrition and health issues in the remoter parts of the interior and north-east of the country.   The high levels of currency depreciation and inflation presented challenges in respect of budgeting.   Getting round the country became less of an issue after the capital was relocated to [[Brasilia]], since this was rapidly followed by a massive road building programme, which reduced dependency on ancient [[Douglas DC-3]]s.   An initial challenge, rapidly overcome, was that Lutz-Fankhauser had never mastered [[Portuguese language |Portuguese]].   However, mastering the language was not too easy, given the Latin origins that in many respects also surface in [[French language |French]] she was also amused to find that some of the more nasal sounds used in Brazilian Portuguese were unexpectedly similar to vowel sounds familiar from the [[Bernese German |Bernese dialect]] which was the mother tongue with which she had grown up.   In 1964 she agreed her transfer to [[Turkey]] only with reluctance, fearing the disruptive impact on UNICEF work in Brazil of a change in the organisation's management there.   As matters turned out she was nevertheless received with great cordiality by colleagues at the UNICEF office in Turkey (where she was the only non-Turkish national on the organisation's payroll).<ref name=GLlautRF/>\n\n{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFDEAD|align=right|width=38%|Gertrud Lutz was asked how she reacted to her enforced \"return to Europe\" in 1968, when she took over at the UNICEF Paris office as \"Vice-president and director for Europe and North Africa\": \n* \"... much as I knew that a highly challenging mission was awaiting me at the European office, I returned rather reluctantly, since I was fundamentally a field person, feeling closest to the people in poor areas of the countries I had been assigned to.

To her initial astonishment, a priority defining much of her work in Turkey involved a large and very necessary UNICEF [[malaria]] eradication programme.   The situation was particularly grim in the remoter regions, notably in the Kurdish provinces to the east.   UNICEF supplied vehicles, equipment and insecticide.   Insecticide formulations had to be changed saveral times as the mosquitoes adapted and acquired new immunities.   The vehicles were also a problem.   They were mostly [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon|Willys Jeeps]] sent over as kits and assembled at a manufactory in [[Istanbul]].   It turned out that roughly 100 of the 400 UNICEF Jeeps were \"not in running condition\".   The drivers had received no training in vehicle maintenance.   They had merely been given English language \"manufacturers' instructions\" and left to work them out.   Some of the drivers had difficulty reading even [[Turkish language|Turkish]]:  English was not widely understood beyond the merchant classes in the cities.   One of the new mission chief's most pressing tasks was therefore to arrange hands-on vehicle maintenance courses for drivers and mechanics, and to have the manufacturers' documentation translated into Turkish.   The drivers and the vehicles were critical elements in the malaria eradication programme, and while funding for the necessary training was released by UNICEF without demur, the launch of the lengthy exercise was significantly delayed by the Jeep problems.

It was he who offered her a job with [[UNICEF]].   She was employed as head of the [[UNICEF]] \"mission to Poland\" between July 1947 and the mission's closure in December 1950.{{efn | Be aware that sources differ over the precise dates of her time heading up the UNICEF Poland mission.}}<ref name=GLFselonTSG/><ref name=GLlautRF/><ref name=GLlautWIP>{{cite web|url =https://www.womeninpeace.org/l-names/2017/7/7/gertrud-lutz-fankhauser |title=Gertrud Lutz|publisher=Women in Peace |accessdate= 10 March 2020}}</ref>   Interviewed later, she recalled that the most important aspect of her mission in Poland was the feeding programme.   There was no mass starvation, but the great majority of children were badly underweight, while the poor quality of the remaining housing caused an alarmingly high level of [[Tuberculosis]], which meant that agencies including the Red Cross and UNICEF were called upon to provide extensive medical support along with the feeding programme.   UNICEF also funded an anti-rickets campaign and short post-graduate study programmes in Switzerland for young Polish doctors.   In Poland as in Germany most of the industrial capacity had been reduced to rubble during the war.   During Lutz-Fankhauser's time running the UNICEF mission in Poland, in collaboration with the government and other agencies, UNICEF arranged vaccination programmes.   They also supplied pasteurisation equipment for milk collection depots and set up five powdered milk factories.<ref name=GLlautRF/>\n\nHer longest and in many ways most successful posting was to [[Brazil]] where she headed up the UNICEF mission between 1951 and 1964.   It was a period of rapid change.   There were serious challenges to be addressed with respect to child nutrition and health issues in the remoter parts of the interior and north-east of the country.   The high levels of currency depreciation and inflation presented challenges in respect of budgeting.   Getting round the country became less of an issue after the capital was relocated to [[Brasilia]], since this was rapidly followed by a massive road building programme, which reduced dependency on ancient [[Douglas DC-3]]s.   An initial challenge, rapidly overcome, was that Lutz-Fankhauser had never mastered [[Portuguese language |Portuguese]].   However, mastering the language was not too easy, given the Latin origins that in many respects also surface in [[French language |French]] she was also amused to find that some of the more nasal sounds used in Brazilian Portuguese were unexpectedly similar to vowel sounds familiar from the [[Bernese German |Bernese dialect]] which was the mother tongue with which she had grown up.   In 1964 she agreed her transfer to [[Turkey]] only with reluctance, fearing the disruptive impact on UNICEF work in Brazil of a change in the organisation's management there.   As matters turned out she was nevertheless received with great cordiality by colleagues at the UNICEF office in Turkey (where she was the only non-Turkish national on the organisation's payroll).<ref name=GLlautRF/>\n\n{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFDEAD|align=right|width=38%|Gertrud Lutz was asked how she reacted to her enforced \"return to Europe\" in 1968, when she took over at the UNICEF Paris office as \"Vice-president and director for Europe and North Africa\": \n* \"... much as I knew that a highly challenging mission was awaiting me at the European office, I returned rather reluctantly, since I was fundamentally a field person, feeling closest to the people in poor areas of the countries I had been assigned to.

To her initial astonishment, a priority defining much of her work in Turkey involved a large and very necessary UNICEF [[malaria]] eradication programme.   The situation was particularly grim in the remoter regions, notably in the Kurdish provinces to the east.   UNICEF supplied vehicles, equipment and insecticide.   Insecticide formulations had to be changed saveral times as the mosquitoes adapted and acquired new immunities.   The vehicles were also a problem.   They were mostly [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon|Willys Jeeps]] sent over as kits and assembled at a manufactory in [[Istanbul]].   It turned out that roughly 100 of the 400 UNICEF Jeeps were \"not in running condition\".   The drivers had received no training in vehicle maintenance.   They had merely been given English language \"manufacturers' instructions\" and left to work them out.   Some of the drivers had difficulty reading even [[Turkish language|Turkish]]:  English was not widely understood beyond the merchant classes in the cities.   One of the new mission chief's most pressing tasks was therefore to arrange hands-on vehicle maintenance courses for drivers and mechanics, and to have the manufacturers' documentation translated into Turkish.   The drivers and the vehicles were critical elements in the malaria eradication programme, and while funding for the necessary training was released by UNICEF without demur, the launch of the lengthy exercise was significantly delayed by the Jeep problems.   The eradication was in full swing, but still far from completed, when Gertrud Lutz-Fankhauser was moved on again in 1966, this time back to (western) Europe.<ref name=GLlautRF/>   Based (initially) in [[Paris]] she served between 1966 and 1971, as UNICEF Vice-president and director for Europe and North Africa,<ref name=GLFselonTSG/> reluctantly reconciling herself to a more office-based style of working as she chain-smoked her way through endless meetings at which, frequently, she was the only woman present.<ref name=GLFlautBJ>{{cite web |url= https://www.uniaktuell.unibe.ch/2006/die_kaeserstochter_die_fuer_eine_bessere_welt_kaempfte/index_ger.html |date= 7 November 2006|title=Die K\u00e4serstochter, die f\u00fcr eine bessere Welt k\u00e4mpfte|work=Ob in Pal\u00e4stina, Budapest, Finnland oder Brasilien: Die Konsulsgattin Gertrud Lutz setzte sich unerm\u00fcdlich f\u00fcr die Benachteiligten ein.

Starting in [[Dawson Creek]], the pipeline's route crosses through the [[Canadian Rockies]] and other mountain ranges to [[Kitimat]], where the gas will be exported to Asian customers. Its route passes through several [[First Nations]] peoples' traditional lands, including some that are [[aboriginal title|unceded]]. Although approved by 20 First Nations' elected councils,<ref name=\"nyt-2020-02-10\"/> the hereditary chiefs of the [[Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen]] people withheld their approval on ecological grounds and organized a blockade of construction within the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen peoples' traditional lands.\n\nA court injunction against protesters blocking the project in an effort to defend their unceded land was granted twice by the [[BC Supreme Court]], in 2018 and 2019. In 2019 and 2020, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) entered the blocked area and cleared road access for construction, arresting several of the land defenders. The 2020 arrests have sparked [[2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests|widespread protests across Canada]] in solidarity with the original protests. Protests have targeted government offices, ports and rail lines. A protest in February 2020 by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk First Nation]] people of [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory|Tyendinaga]] in [[Ontario]] blocked a critical segment of rail, causing [[Via Rail]] to shut down much of its passenger rail network and [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) to shut down freight service in eastern Canada for several weeks.\n\nCGL resumed construction after the RCMP cleared Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen from the access road. A conference between the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen, BC government and Canadian governments was held, leading to a provisional land rights agreement, however the pipeline project is still opposed by the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen hereditary chiefs. The Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen have asked CGL to halt construction due to the worldwide pandemic of [[COVID-19]], over concerns about spreading the disease.\n\n==Project==\n\nThe Coastal GasLink pipeline is owned and operated by [[TC Energy]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[LNG Canada]] selected TC Energy to design, build, and own the pipeline in 2012.<ref name=\":0\" /> The natural gas transported by the pipeline will be converted into [[liquefied natural gas]] by LNG Canada in Kitimat and then exported to global markets.

GasLink pipeline''' is a [[TC Energy]] [[natural gas]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] under construction in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Starting in [[Dawson Creek]], the pipeline's route crosses through the [[Canadian Rockies]] and other mountain ranges to [[Kitimat]], where the gas will be exported to Asian customers. Its route passes through several [[First Nations]] peoples' traditional lands, including some that are [[aboriginal title|unceded]]. Although approved by 20 First Nations' elected councils,<ref name=\"nyt-2020-02-10\"/> the hereditary chiefs of the [[Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen]] people withheld their approval on ecological grounds and organized a blockade of construction within the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen peoples' traditional lands.\n\nA court injunction against protesters blocking the project in an effort to defend their unceded land was granted twice by the [[BC Supreme Court]], in 2018 and 2019. In 2019 and 2020, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) entered the blocked area and cleared road access for construction, arresting several of the land defenders. The 2020 arrests have sparked [[2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests|widespread protests across Canada]] in solidarity with the original protests. Protests have targeted government offices, ports and rail lines. A protest in February 2020 by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk First Nation]] people of [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory|Tyendinaga]] in [[Ontario]] blocked a critical segment of rail, causing [[Via Rail]] to shut down much of its passenger rail network and [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) to shut down freight service in eastern Canada for several weeks.\n\nCGL resumed construction after the RCMP cleared Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen from the access road. A conference between the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen, BC government and Canadian governments was held, leading to a provisional land rights agreement, however the pipeline project is still opposed by the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen hereditary chiefs. The Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen have asked CGL to halt construction due to the worldwide pandemic of [[COVID-19]], over concerns about spreading the disease.\n\n==Project==\n\nThe Coastal GasLink pipeline is owned and operated by [[TC Energy]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[LNG Canada]] selected TC Energy to design, build, and own the pipeline in 2012.<ref name=\":0\" /> The natural gas transported by the pipeline will be converted into [[liquefied natural gas]] by LNG Canada in Kitimat and then exported to global markets.

His work lay in the King's Household and in the control of the State Affairs of Scotland and he was the King's chief Scottish advisor. With the full backing and trust of [[James I of England|King James]] he travelled regularly from London to Edinburgh via [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].\n\n==In Scotland==\nHome was the son and third child of Sir Alexander Home of [[Manderston]], [[Berwickshire]], by his spouse Janet, daughter of George Home of Spott, Haddingtonshire, and was introduced, at the age of 26, to the Court of sixteen-year-old [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] by a relative, [[Alexander Home, 6th Lord Home]]. Establishing himself as a [[favourite]] at court, he was in the retinue which accompanied King [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] to [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] to collect his future Queen. During the trip, James VI made him Keeper of the Royal Wardrobe and sacked Sir [[William Keith of Delny]], who had appeared in richer clothing than himself.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 478.</ref> In 1606, when making him [[Earl of Dunbar]] James VI praised him for his tact and diplomacy at this time, his \"high prudence and rare discretion.\" <ref>''HMC 5th Report: M. E. Stirling of Renton'' (London, 1876), p. 648 \"summa prudentia et rara taciturnitas\".</ref>\n\nHe was knighted on 4 November 1590, and known as \"Sir George Home of Primrose Knowe\" and after 1593, \"Sir George Home of Spot\". [[Spott, East Lothian|Spott]] is a village in [[East Lothian]].\n\nIn the 1590s Home presided over an arrangement where clothes and textiles for the royal households were provided by the goldsmith [[Thomas Foulis]] and merchant [[Robert Jousie]], partly financed by money sent as a gift or subsidy to James VI by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].<ref>Jemma Field, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626120 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590\u20131603', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019), p. 154.]</ref> Home had a role in financing the household of [[Anne of Denmark]] giving her \u00a33833 Scots in 1591, and in 1592 a dividend of \u00a34000 from her dowry which had been invested in various Scottish towns. He was in charge of paying her Danish servants who were owed fees by the Scottish exchequer, totalling \u00a31,200 in 1592.<ref>George Powell McNeill, ''[[Exchequer Rolls of Scotland]]'', vol. 22 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 153, 199, 232.</ref>\n\nIn November 1593 Anne of Denmark complained that people around the king were speaking disrespectfully of her. James asked Home to be watchful of the queen's honour. [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] wrote that Home himself was suspected of speaking against the queen, and [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]] endorsed this, adding \"The wolf to be a watchman.\"<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 230-1.</ref>\n\nIn 1598 he was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]], and the following year appears as Sheriff of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], (by then in England).\n\nIn October 1600 James VI visited his house at Spott and was banqueted. The \"merry\" party included [[Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe|Sir Robert Ker]], the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]], [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie|Sir Thomas Erskine]], and [[David Murray, 1st Viscount of Stormont|Sir David Murray]]. The English courtier [[Roger Aston]] noted that all the gentlemen of the chamber there were \"inward\" with one another and with Home, who was the most \"inward\" with the king. Aston took the opportunity to ride to [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] to see his friends.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603'', vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 720, 722-3.</ref>\n\nIn 1601 he was made Master of the King's Wardrobe, and on 31 July the same year was appointed one of the Componitors to the [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland|Lord High Treasurer]], and acceded to that position in September. In 1601 he was also made Provost of [[Dunbar]].\n\n==In England==\nUpon James's accession as James I of England in 1603, Home accompanied his sovereign to Westminster, where he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (and ''ex officio'' the [[Second Lord of the Treasury]]) from 1603 to 1606. In 1603 he was also appointed to the [[Privy Council of England]], and on 1 June that year received a grant as [[Keeper of the Great Wardrobe]] for life. On 7 July 1604 he was created [[Baron Hume of Berwick]] in the [[Peerage of England]]. In 1605 he was appointed a [[Knight of the Garter]], and on 3 July was created [[Earl of Dunbar]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. There is evidence that he took a part in the interrogation of [[Guy Fawkes]] in the immediate aftermath of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.\n\nIn July 1606 the earl's office of keeper of the wardrobe in Scotland was given to [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Sir James Hay]], then a gentleman of the king's bedchamber. Dunbar was receipted for jewels held in the [[Tower of London]] and elsewhere, including; the ruby and chain from the (dismantled) pendant called the \"[[Great H of Scotland]]\", a hat badge with the monogram \"J.A.R\" in diamonds with three pendant pearls, a gold ring with five diamonds and clasped hands called the \"espousal ring of Denmark\", a band for hat with 23 links including six pieces with letters made of diamonds, and a diamond cross which had been brought from Scotland for their value and significance.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''Collection of Inventories'' (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 327-330: ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), pp. 207-8.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Stanhope (1593-1675)|Sir Charles Stanhope]] recorded an anecdote that the Earl of Dunbar had made \u00a360,000 from sales of clothes from the wardrobe of [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]], and spent \u00a320,000 on the house he built on the site of [[Berwick Castle]].<ref>G. P. V. Akrigg, 'The Curious Marginalia of Charles, Second Lord Stanhope', in James G. McManaway, Giles E. Dawson, and Edwin E.

On 12 December a [[charter|Royal Charter]] gave him the custody and captaincy of the Castle of [[St Andrews]]. In July 1605 he had a confirmation of all the lands previously granted to him incorporated and combined into a free earldom, Lordship of Parliament, and Barony of Dunbar.\n\n==Religious affairs==\nIn 1608, Home journeyed to [[Scotland]] with [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]] to arrange to promote the Episcopal Church, and to seek some sort of union between the [[Church of England]] and [[Church of Scotland]]. [[James I of England|King James]] was pleased with the initial results, although the hoped-for Union never occurred and the gulf between the King and the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] widened. In July 1605 some nineteen ministers assembled at [[Aberdeen]] in defiance of the King's prohibition against the General Assembly meeting. Six of them were subsequently imprisoned in [[Blackness Castle]] near [[Linlithgow]], and there, on 10 January 1606, the Earl of Dunbar came from London to be present at their trial and to act as the assessor. Everything was done that could be done by him to win a verdict for the King against the six ministers and it is said that he \"brought plenty of money with him to purchase a verdict\". In addition, the Earl himself selected the 15 jurymen, five of whom were Homes, his relatives. But even then the jury could not agree. In the end it was a majority verdict of nine against six in favour of the guilty verdict. Regardless of the irregularities, the verdict stood, and established the law that it was [[High Treason]] for any minister of the Established Church to dispute the authority of the King and the [[Privy Council]] in religious matters.\n\n==Family==\nHe married, around 1590, Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon of [[Gight]]<ref>Some sources call this laird of Gight \"George Gordon\", see Duncan Forbes,''Ane account of the familie of Innes'' (Aberdeen, 1864), p. 248.</ref> and Agnes Beaton, daughter of Cardinal [[David Beaton]], [[Archbishop of St. Andrews]], and [[Marion Ogilvy]]. Their children were:\n\n*Anne (d. 1621), who married Sir James Home of Whitrig (d. between 1614\u20131620), (whose son became James Home, 3rd Earl of Home).\n*Elizabeth, who married [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]].\n\nThe [[Earl of Dunbar]] died in Whitehall, London, in 1611, without male issue, whereupon the earldom and the barony became dormant.\n\nHis body was embalmed, but his funeral service did not take place in Westminster until April, after which his body was placed in a lead coffin and sent to Scotland where it was buried under the floor of [[Dunbar Collegiate Church|Dunbar parish church]], midway between the font and the pulpit. A magnificent monument, said to be finer than any in [[Westminster Abbey]], was erected in his honour, which is still the distinguishing feature of the interior of this church.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holy Jesus Hospital]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''George Home, Earl of Dunbar'', three lectures by the Reverend J Kirk, MC, CF, (Minister of Dunbar Parish Church 1913-1918), Edinburgh, 1918.\n*''MSS of Colonel Mordaunt-Hay of Duns Castle'', [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]], collection no.5, 1909, page 66, number 180.

His work lay in the King's Household and in the control of the State Affairs of Scotland and he was the King's chief Scottish advisor. With the full backing and trust of [[James I of England|King James]] he travelled regularly from London to Edinburgh via [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].\n\n==In Scotland==\nHome was the son and third child of Sir Alexander Home of [[Manderston]], [[Berwickshire]], by his spouse Janet, daughter of George Home of Spott, Haddingtonshire, and was introduced, at the age of 26, to the Court of sixteen-year-old [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] by a relative, [[Alexander Home, 6th Lord Home]]. Establishing himself as a [[favourite]] at court, he was in the retinue which accompanied King [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] to [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] to collect his future Queen. During the trip, James VI made him Keeper of the Royal Wardrobe and sacked Sir [[William Keith of Delny]], who had appeared in richer clothing than himself.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 478.</ref> In 1606, when making him [[Earl of Dunbar]] James VI praised him for his tact and diplomacy at this time, his \"high prudence and rare discretion.\" <ref>''HMC 5th Report: M. E. Stirling of Renton'' (London, 1876), p. 648 \"summa prudentia et rara taciturnitas\".</ref>\n\nHe was knighted on 4 November 1590, and known as \"Sir George Home of Primrose Knowe\" and after 1593, \"Sir George Home of Spot\". [[Spott, East Lothian|Spott]] is a village in [[East Lothian]].\n\nIn the 1590s Home presided over an arrangement where clothes and textles for the royal households were provided by the goldsmith [[Thomas Foulis]] and merchant [[Robert Jousie]], partly financed by money sent as a gift or subsidy to James VI by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].<ref>Jemma Field, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626120 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590\u20131603', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019), p. 154.]</ref> Home had a role in financing the household of [[Anne of Denmark]] giving her \u00a33833 Scots in 1591, and in 1592 a dividend of \u00a34000 from her dowry which had been invested in various Scottish towns. He was in charge of paying her Danish servants who were owed fees by the Scottish exchequer, totalling \u00a31,200 in 1592.<ref>George Powell McNeill, ''[[Exchequer Rolls of Scotland]]'', vol. 22 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 153, 199, 232.</ref>\n\nIn November 1593 Anne of Denmark complained that people around the king were speaking disrespectfully of her. James asked Home to be watchful of the queen's honour. [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] wrote that Home himself was suspected of speaking against the queen, and [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]] endorsed this, adding \"The wolf to be a watchman.\"<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 230-1.</ref>\n\nIn 1598 he was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]], and the following year appears as Sheriff of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], (by then in England).\n\nIn October 1600 James VI visited his house at Spott and was banqueted. The \"merry\" party included [[Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe|Sir Robert Ker]], the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]], [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie|Sir Thomas Erskine]], and [[David Murray, 1st Viscount of Stormont|Sir David Murray]]. The English courtier [[Roger Aston]] noted that all the gentlemen of the chamber there were \"inward\" with one another and with Home, who was the most \"inward\" with the king. Aston took the opportunity to ride to [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] to see his friends.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603'', vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 720, 722-3.</ref>\n\nIn 1601 he was made Master of the King's Wardrobe, and on 31 July the same year was appointed one of the Componitors to the [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland|Lord High Treasurer]], and acceded to that position in September. In 1601 he was also made Provost of [[Dunbar]].\n\n==In England==\nUpon James's accession as James I of England in 1603, Home accompanied his sovereign to Westminster, where he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (and ''ex officio'' the [[Second Lord of the Treasury]]) from 1603 to 1606. In 1603 he was also appointed to the [[Privy Council of England]], and on 1 June that year received a grant as [[Keeper of the Great Wardrobe]] for life. On 7 July 1604 he was created [[Baron Hume of Berwick]] in the [[Peerage of England]]. In 1605 he was appointed a [[Knight of the Garter]], and on 3 July was created [[Earl of Dunbar]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. There is evidence that he took a part in the interrogation of [[Guy Fawkes]] in the immediate aftermath of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.\n\nIn July 1606 the earl's office of keeper of the wardrobe in Scotland was given to [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Sir James Hay]], then a gentleman of the king's bedchamber. Dunbar was receipted for jewels held in the [[Tower of London]] and elsewhere, including; the ruby and chain from the (dismantled) pendant called the \"[[Great H of Scotland]]\", a hat badge with the monogram \"J.A.R\" in diamonds with three pendant pearls, a gold ring with five diamonds and clasped hands called the \"espousal ring of Denmark\", a band for hat with 23 links including six pieces with letters made of diamonds, and a diamond cross which had been brought from Scotland for their value and significance.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''Collection of Inventories'' (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 327-330: ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), pp. 207-8.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Stanhope (1593-1675)|Sir Charles Stanhope]] recorded an anecdote that the Earl of Dunbar had made \u00a360,000 from sales of clothes from the wardrobe of [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]], and spent \u00a320,000 on the house he built on the site of [[Berwick Castle]].<ref>G. P. V. Akrigg, 'The Curious Marginalia of Charles, Second Lord Stanhope', in James G. McManaway, Giles E. Dawson, and Edwin E. Willoughby ed., ''Joseph Quincy Adams Memorial Studies'' (FSL, Washington, 1948), pp. 785-801, p. 794 noted only: Lawrence Stone, ''The Crisis of the Aristocracy'' (Oxford, 1965), p. 563 fn. 2</ref> A similar story was recorded by [[Symonds D'Ewes]] on 21 January 1620, that King James had given the late queen's wardrobe to the Earl of Dunbar, who had exported it to the Low Countries and sold it for \u00a3100,000.<ref>[[Janet Arnold]], ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'' (London, 1988), p. 174: Maria Hayward, ''Stuart Style'' (Yale, 2020), p. 55.</ref>\n\n==Landed interests==\nOf these, on the 27 September 1603 Home received the manor and castle of [[Norham]], with its fishing rights on the [[River Tweed]]. On 12 December a [[charter|Royal Charter]] gave him the custody and captaincy of the Castle of [[St Andrews]]. In July 1605 he had a confirmation of all the lands previously granted to him incorporated and combined into a free earldom, Lordship of Parliament, and Barony of Dunbar.\n\n==Religious affairs==\nIn 1608, Home journeyed to [[Scotland]] with [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]] to arrange to promote the Episcopal Church, and to seek some sort of union between the [[Church of England]] and [[Church of Scotland]]. [[James I of England|King James]] was pleased with the initial results, although the hoped-for Union never occurred and the gulf between the King and the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] widened. In July 1605 some nineteen ministers assembled at [[Aberdeen]] in defiance of the King's prohibition against the General Assembly meeting. Six of them were subsequently imprisoned in [[Blackness Castle]] near [[Linlithgow]], and there, on 10 January 1606, the Earl of Dunbar came from London to be present at their trial and to act as the assessor. Everything was done that could be done by him to win a verdict for the King against the six ministers and it is said that he \"brought plenty of money with him to purchase a verdict\". In addition, the Earl himself selected the 15 jurymen, five of whom were Homes, his relatives. But even then the jury could not agree. In the end it was a majority verdict of nine against six in favour of the guilty verdict. Regardless of the irregularities, the verdict stood, and established the law that it was [[High Treason]] for any minister of the Established Church to dispute the authority of the King and the [[Privy Council]] in religious matters.\n\n==Family==\nHe married, around 1590, Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon of [[Gight]]<ref>Some sources call this laird of Gight \"George Gordon\", see Duncan Forbes,''Ane account of the familie of Innes'' (Aberdeen, 1864), p. 248.</ref> and Agnes Beaton, daughter of Cardinal [[David Beaton]], [[Archbishop of St. Andrews]], and [[Marion Ogilvy]]. Their children were:\n\n*Anne (d. 1621), who married Sir James Home of Whitrig (d. between 1614\u20131620), (whose son became James Home, 3rd Earl of Home).\n*Elizabeth, who married [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]].\n\nThe [[Earl of Dunbar]] died in Whitehall, London, in 1611, without male issue, whereupon the earldom and the barony became dormant.\n\nHis body was embalmed, but his funeral service did not take place in Westminster until April, after which his body was placed in a lead coffin and sent to Scotland where it was buried under the floor of [[Dunbar Collegiate Church|Dunbar parish church]], midway between the font and the pulpit. A magnificent monument, said to be finer than any in [[Westminster Abbey]], was erected in his honour, which is still the distinguishing feature of the interior of this church.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holy Jesus Hospital]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''George Home, Earl of Dunbar'', three lectures by the Reverend J Kirk, MC, CF, (Minister of Dunbar Parish Church 1913-1918), Edinburgh, 1918.\n*''MSS of Colonel Mordaunt-Hay of Duns Castle'', [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]], collection no.5, 1909, page 66, number 180.
