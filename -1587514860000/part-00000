There is pre-degree school in Funtua a few kilometres from main campus owned by the university. The Samaru campus houses the administrative offices and the faculties of physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, arts and languages, education, environmental design, engineering, medical sciences, agricultural sciences and research facilities. The Kongo campus hosts the faculties of Law and Administration. The Faculty of Administration consists of Accounting, Business Administration, Local Government and Development Studies and Public Administration Departments. Additionally, the university is responsible for other institutions and programmes at other locations.\n\nIt is named after the Sardauna of [[Sokoto]], Alhaji Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]], the first premier of Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe university runs a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate programmes (and offers associate degrees and vocational and remedial programmes). It has a large medical programme with its own ABU Teaching Hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe University has thirteen faculties:\n\n*\n*\n* Faculty of Administration\n* Faculty of Agriculture\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Education\n* Faculty of Engineering\n* Faculty of Environmental Design\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Life Science\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science\n* Faculty of Physical Science\n* Faculty of Social Science\n* Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n\nThe university also has a Division of Agric Collages (DAC) a research institution established before the university was but later merged with the university. \n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and first years===\nAs Nigeria approached independence on October 1, 1960, it had only a single university: the [[University of Ibadan]], established in 1948. The important [[Ashby Commission]] report<ref>Sir Eric Ashby.  ''Investment in Education: The Report of the Commission on Post-School Certificate and Higher Education'' (Lagos, 1960)</ref> (submitted a month before independence) recommended adding new universities in each of Nigeria's then-three regions and the capital, [[Lagos]]. Even before the report, however, the regional governments had begun planning universities. In May 1960, the Northern Region had upgraded the School of Arabic Studies in [[Kano]] to become the Ahmadu Bello College for Arabic and Islamic Studies. (The college was named after the region's dominant political leader, Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello.)\n\nThe Ashby Commission report recommendations gave a new impetus and direction. It was ultimately decided to create a University of Northern Nigeria at Zaria (rather than Kano). The university would take over the facilities of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology at Samaru just outside Zaria, and would incorporate the Ahmadu Bello College in Kano, the Agricultural Research Institute at Samaru, the Institute of Administration at Zaria, and the Veterinary Research Institute at Vom on the [[Jos Plateau]]. The law establishing the new university was passed by the Northern Region legislature in 1961. It was decided to name the university after Ahmadu Bello, and the Kano college took the name of [[Abdullahi Bayero]], a past Emir of Kano.\n\nAt the opening on 4 October 1962, thanks in part to absorbing existing institutions, ABU claimed four faculties comprising 15 departments.<ref>Details on all aspects of ABU's development are provided in the chapters and appendices of ''A History of Ahmadu Bello University, 1962\u20131987,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1989.</ref> Students in all programmes numbered only 426.\n\nThe challenges were enormous. Over 60 years of British colonial rule, education in the Northern Region had lagged far behind that of the two southern regions. Few students from the north had qualifications for university entrance, and fewer still northerners had qualifications for teaching appointments. Of the original student body, only 147 were from the north.\n\nABU's first vice chancellor (principal administrator and leader) was British, as were most of the professorial appointments. Only two Nigerians \u2014 Dr. [[Iya Abubakar]] (Mathematics) and Adamu Baikie (Education) \u2014 were among the earliest round of faculty appointments. Facilities on the main Samaru campus were inadequate, and the administration and integration of the physically separated pre-existing institutions was difficult.\n\nNevertheless, under the vice chancellorship of Dr. [[Norman Alexander]], academic and administrative staffing was developed, new departments and programmes were created, major building plans were undertaken, and student enrollments grew rapidly. By the end of Alexander's tenure (1965\u201366), almost 1,000 students were enrolled. The [[New Zealand]]-born Alexander, from 1966, became a kind of \"freelance vice-chancellor\", offering his expertise to help in the setting up of other [[Commonwealth]] universities in the [[West Indies]], [[Fiji]] and Africa.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituarysir-norman-alexander-1265280.html | work=The Independent | title=Obituary:Sir Norman Alexander | date=5 April 1997 | accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Development through the middle 1970s===\n\nIn 1966, Dr. Alexander was succeeded as ABU vice chancellor by Dr. [[Ishaya Audu|Ishaya Shuaibu Audu]], a pediatrician and associate professor at the [[University of Lagos]]. Audu had been born in Wusasa, near Zaria, in 1928. A native Hausa, he was ABU's first Nigerian vice chancellor and a northerner. However, his membership in the Hausa Christian community of Wusasa probably had some later impact on his tenure.\n\nABU was seriously affected by the coups and the anti-Igbo riots of 1966. But, under Dr. Audu's leadership, ABU was to grow and develop at an even faster pace. Growth in student enrollments had been held hostage to growth and development of A-level training at the secondary school level. So beginning in 1968\u201369 ABU broke free from the British three-year heritage and established the School of Basic Studies to provide advanced secondary pre-degree training on campus.<ref>See ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' p. 270.</ref> Students who entered through the School of Basic Studies essentially embarked on a four-year programme toward a bachelor's degree.\n\nOpposed initially by some, the school proved a great success and enrollments expanded even more rapidly. By its tenth year ABU total enrollments including non- and pre-degree programmes were put at over 7,000 of which more than half were in degree programmes. In its first ten years, the University of Ibadan produced 615 graduates. At ABU the corresponding figure after 10 years was 2,333 first degrees, along with several advanced degrees.<ref>''Ten Years: The First Decade of Ahmadu Bello University, October 1962-October 1972,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1972; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 267\u2013282.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, ABU was remarkable for the breadth of its ambition. In its institutions, but mainly on or close by the main campus by Samaru, ABU was creating a range of programmes that only the very most comprehensive of U.S. state universities could have matched. Ranging far beyond the standard fields of the arts, languages, social sciences and sciences, it included engineering, medicine (the Zaria hospital was an ABU teaching hospital), pharmacy, architecture, and a wide variety of agricultural departments including veterinary medicine.\n\nWhat was called the Kongo campus just outside the old city in Zaria taught [[public administration]] and carried out a programme of in-service training for local government throughout the north. The Faculty of Law was based at the Kongo campus. The Faculty of Education taught education courses and managed the Advanced Teacher's Colleges in the northern states. At the Kano campus (now called Abdullahi Bayero College) ABU taught courses in Hausa, Arabic and Islamic studies.\n\nABU was likewise remarkable among Nigeria's universities for the breadth and national character of its student recruitment. ABU had been founded to be the University of Northern Nigeria. Yet, more than any other of Nigeria's universities, ABU has served students from every state of the Nigerian federation.<ref>Paul Beckett and James O\u2019Connell, ''Education and Power in Nigeria,'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, pp. 26\u201330; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Appendix V and VI, pp. 280\u20131.</ref>\n\nProfessorial staffing to serve the burgeoning student enrollments and course offerings was a potential limitation during this period. In the early 1970s relatively abundant funding made it possible to send some senior academic staff to overseas institutions to complete advanced degrees. A small but increasing number of Nigerians with Ph.D.s or other advanced degrees were returning from abroad (but ABU had to compete with other Nigerian universities to recruit them). In the meantime, appointment of expatriate teaching staff was essential and it expanded greatly and diversified in nationalities. Vice chancellor Audu endeavored to balance the goals of Nigerianization (and \"northernization\") of ABU's professors with the commitment to maintaining all programmes at an international level of academic quality.\n\nBy 1975, this balance was strained. The teaching faculty remained more than half expatriate overall; at senior levels still more so.<ref>''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Table X, p. 307.</ref> The development of Nigerian staffing (and especially of northern-origin teaching staff) was perceived as too slow. In 1975, ABU turned toward a much heavier emphasis on internal staff development as it adopted the Graduate Assistantship programme. Under this programme, the best graduates from the departments\u2019 undergraduate programmes are recruited to join the department as staff-in-training and undertake advanced training as they gain on-the-job experience. Within a few years, a significant proportion of ABU senior staff were products of the internal training programmes. From 1975, the proportion of expatriate teaching staff diminished rapidly.<ref>See Chapter Ten (\"Staff Recruitment and Development in ABU, 1962\u20131987\") in ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 196\u2013219.</ref>\n\n===Later development===\n\nBy the end of the vice chancellorship of Ishaya Audu (mid-1975), ABU was solidly established as Nigeria's largest university and among Africa's academically strongest university institutions. Strong growth has continued. But ABU has been increasingly buffeted by external events and challenges. No vice-chancellorship has been as long (or, arguably, as successful) as that of Ishaya Audu. Beginning in the early 1980s, ABU was hit with sharply reduced funding as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] imposed the [[Structural Adjustment Programme]]: the value of the national currency plummeted in relation to international currencies. Staff salaries were reduced rapidly in cost-of-living terms, and funding for facilities, library acquisitions, and other necessary resources was abruptly curtailed. Further, ABU increasingly competed for students, staff and funding with all the other institutions in the rapidly expanding Nigerian [[List of universities in Nigeria|university system]].\n\nIn May 1986 the security forces killed around 20 demonstrators and bystanders at ABU in order to prevent a peaceful demonstration against the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Programme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structural Adjustment Program|url=http://www.whirledbank.org/development/sap.html|publisher=The Whirled Bank Group|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, ABU has been affected by national political instability. The very fact of ABU's strikingly \"national character\" (in drawing students and staff from an unusually broad range of Nigeria's regional, ethnic and religious communities) may incline the institution to internal instability. ABU has been among Nigeria's universities that have suffered most from closures.\n\nYet ABU continues to occupy a particularly important place among Nigerian universities. As it approaches its half-century anniversary, ABU can claim to be the largest and the most extensive of universities in Sub-Saharan Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} It covers a land area of 7,000 hectares and encompasses 12 academic faculties, a postgraduate school and 82 academic departments. It has five institutes, six specialized centers, a Division of Agricultural Colleges, demonstration secondary and primary schools, as well as extension and consultancy services which provide services to the wider society. The total student enrollment in the university's degree and sub-degree programmes is about 35,000, drawn from every state of Nigeria, from Africa, and from the rest of world. There are about 1,400 academic and research staff and 5,000 support staff.\n\nThe university has nurtured two new institutions: [[Bayero University Kano]] and the [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University]] of Technology, Bauchi. Some 27 tertiary institutions made up of colleges of education, polytechnics and schools of basic or preliminary studies are affiliated to it.\n\n==Administration==\n{{See also|List of Ahmadu Bello University chancellors}}\nAhmadu Bello University has a [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] as its ceremonial head, while the [[vice-chancellor]] is the chief executive and academic officer. The vice-chancellor is usually appointed for a five-year, non-renewable term.

There is pre-degree school in Funtua a few kilometres from main campus owned by the university. The Samaru campus houses the administrative offices and the faculties of physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, arts and languages, education, environmental design, engineering, medical sciences, agricultural sciences and research facilities. The Kongo campus hosts the faculties of Law and Administration. The Faculty of Administration consists of Accounting, Business Administration, Local Government and Development Studies and Public Administration Departments. Additionally, the university is responsible for other institutions and programmes at other locations.\n\nIt is named after the Sardauna of [[Sokoto]], Alhaji Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]], the first premier of Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe university runs a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate programmes (and offers associate degrees and vocational and remedial programmes). It has a large medical programme with its own ABU Teaching Hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe University has thirteen faculties:\n\n*\n*\n* Faculty of Administration\n* Faculty of Agriculture\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Education\n* Faculty of Engineering\n* Faculty of Environmental Design\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Life Science\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science\n* Faculty of Physical Science\n* Faculty of Social Science\n* Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n\nThe university also has a Division of Agric Collages (DAC) a research institution established before the university was but later merged with the university. \n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and first years===\nAs Nigeria approached independence on October 1, 1960, it had only a single university: the [[University of Ibadan]], established in 1948. The important [[Ashby Commission]] report<ref>Sir Eric Ashby.  ''Investment in Education: The Report of the Commission on Post-School Certificate and Higher Education'' (Lagos, 1960)</ref> (submitted a month before independence) recommended adding new universities in each of Nigeria's then-three regions and the capital, [[Lagos]]. Even before the report, however, the regional governments had begun planning universities. In May 1960, the Northern Region had upgraded the School of Arabic Studies in [[Kano]] to become the Ahmadu Bello College for Arabic and Islamic Studies. (The college was named after the region's dominant political leader, Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello.)\n\nThe Ashby Commission report recommendations gave a new impetus and direction. It was ultimately decided to create a University of Northern Nigeria at Zaria (rather than Kano). The university would take over the facilities of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology at Samaru just outside Zaria, and would incorporate the Ahmadu Bello College in Kano, the Agricultural Research Institute at Samaru, the Institute of Administration at Zaria, and the Veterinary Research Institute at Vom on the [[Jos Plateau]]. The law establishing the new university was passed by the Northern Region legislature in 1961. It was decided to name the university after Ahmadu Bello, and the Kano college took the name of [[Abdullahi Bayero]], a past Emir of Kano.\n\nAt the opening on 4 October 1962, thanks in part to absorbing existing institutions, ABU claimed four faculties comprising 15 departments.<ref>Details on all aspects of ABU's development are provided in the chapters and appendices of ''A History of Ahmadu Bello University, 1962\u20131987,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1989.</ref> Students in all programmes numbered only 426.\n\nThe challenges were enormous. Over 60 years of British colonial rule, education in the Northern Region had lagged far behind that of the two southern regions. Few students from the north had qualifications for university entrance, and fewer still northerners had qualifications for teaching appointments. Of the original student body, only 147 were from the north.\n\nABU's first vice chancellor (principal administrator and leader) was British, as were most of the professorial appointments. Only two Nigerians \u2014 Dr. [[Iya Abubakar]] (Mathematics) and Adamu Baikie (Education) \u2014 were among the earliest round of faculty appointments. Facilities on the main Samaru campus were inadequate, and the administration and integration of the physically separated pre-existing institutions was difficult.\n\nNevertheless, under the vice chancellorship of Dr. [[Norman Alexander]], academic and administrative staffing was developed, new departments and programmes were created, major building plans were undertaken, and student enrollments grew rapidly. By the end of Alexander's tenure (1965\u201366), almost 1,000 students were enrolled. The [[New Zealand]]-born Alexander, from 1966, became a kind of \"freelance vice-chancellor\", offering his expertise to help in the setting up of other [[Commonwealth]] universities in the [[West Indies]], [[Fiji]] and Africa.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituarysir-norman-alexander-1265280.html | work=The Independent | title=Obituary:Sir Norman Alexander | date=5 April 1997 | accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Development through the middle 1970s===\n\nIn 1966, Dr. Alexander was succeeded as ABU vice chancellor by Dr. [[Ishaya Audu|Ishaya Shuaibu Audu]], a pediatrician and associate professor at the [[University of Lagos]]. Audu had been born in Wusasa, near Zaria, in 1928. A native Hausa, he was ABU's first Nigerian vice chancellor and a northerner. However, his membership in the Hausa Christian community of Wusasa probably had some later impact on his tenure.\n\nABU was seriously affected by the coups and the anti-Igbo riots of 1966. But, under Dr. Audu's leadership, ABU was to grow and develop at an even faster pace. Growth in student enrollments had been held hostage to growth and development of A-level training at the secondary school level. So beginning in 1968\u201369 ABU broke free from the British three-year heritage and established the School of Basic Studies to provide advanced secondary pre-degree training on campus.<ref>See ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' p. 270.</ref> Students who entered through the School of Basic Studies essentially embarked on a four-year programme toward a bachelor's degree.\n\nOpposed initially by some, the school proved a great success and enrollments expanded even more rapidly. By its tenth year ABU total enrollments including non- and pre-degree programmes were put at over 7,000 of which more than half were in degree programmes. In its first ten years, the University of Ibadan produced 615 graduates. At ABU the corresponding figure after 10 years was 2,333 first degrees, along with several advanced degrees.<ref>''Ten Years: The First Decade of Ahmadu Bello University, October 1962-October 1972,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1972; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 267\u2013282.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, ABU was remarkable for the breadth of its ambition. In its institutions, but mainly on or close by the main campus by Samaru, ABU was creating a range of programmes that only the very most comprehensive of U.S. state universities could have matched. Ranging far beyond the standard fields of the arts, languages, social sciences and sciences, it included engineering, medicine (the Zaria hospital was an ABU teaching hospital), pharmacy, architecture, and a wide variety of agricultural departments including veterinary medicine.\n\nWhat was called the Kongo campus just outside the old city in Zaria taught [[public administration]] and carried out a programme of in-service training for local government throughout the north. The Faculty of Law was based at the Kongo campus. The Faculty of Education taught education courses and managed the Advanced Teacher's Colleges in the northern states. At the Kano campus (now called Abdullahi Bayero College) ABU taught courses in Hausa, Arabic and Islamic studies.\n\nABU was likewise remarkable among Nigeria's universities for the breadth and national character of its student recruitment. ABU had been founded to be the University of Northern Nigeria. Yet, more than any other of Nigeria's universities, ABU has served students from every state of the Nigerian federation.<ref>Paul Beckett and James O\u2019Connell, ''Education and Power in Nigeria,'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, pp. 26\u201330; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Appendix V and VI, pp. 280\u20131.</ref>\n\nProfessorial staffing to serve the burgeoning student enrollments and course offerings was a potential limitation during this period. In the early 1970s relatively abundant funding made it possible to send some senior academic staff to overseas institutions to complete advanced degrees. A small but increasing number of Nigerians with Ph.D.s or other advanced degrees were returning from abroad (but ABU had to compete with other Nigerian universities to recruit them). In the meantime, appointment of expatriate teaching staff was essential and it expanded greatly and diversified in nationalities. Vice chancellor Audu endeavored to balance the goals of Nigerianization (and \"northernization\") of ABU's professors with the commitment to maintaining all programmes at an international level of academic quality.\n\nBy 1975, this balance was strained. The teaching faculty remained more than half expatriate overall; at senior levels still more so.<ref>''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Table X, p. 307.</ref> The development of Nigerian staffing (and especially of northern-origin teaching staff) was perceived as too slow. In 1975, ABU turned toward a much heavier emphasis on internal staff development as it adopted the Graduate Assistantship programme. Under this programme, the best graduates from the departments\u2019 undergraduate programmes are recruited to join the department as staff-in-training and undertake advanced training as they gain on-the-job experience. Within a few years, a significant proportion of ABU senior staff were products of the internal training programmes. From 1975, the proportion of expatriate teaching staff diminished rapidly.<ref>See Chapter Ten (\"Staff Recruitment and Development in ABU, 1962\u20131987\") in ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 196\u2013219.</ref>\n\n===Later development===\n\nBy the end of the vice chancellorship of Ishaya Audu (mid-1975), ABU was solidly established as Nigeria's largest university and among Africa's academically strongest university institutions. Strong growth has continued. But ABU has been increasingly buffeted by external events and challenges. No vice-chancellorship has been as long (or, arguably, as successful) as that of Ishaya Audu. Beginning in the early 1980s, ABU was hit with sharply reduced funding as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] imposed the [[Structural Adjustment Programme]]: the value of the national currency plummeted in relation to international currencies. Staff salaries were reduced rapidly in cost-of-living terms, and funding for facilities, library acquisitions, and other necessary resources was abruptly curtailed. Further, ABU increasingly competed for students, staff and funding with all the other institutions in the rapidly expanding Nigerian [[List of universities in Nigeria|university system]].\n\nIn May 1986 the security forces killed around 20 demonstrators and bystanders at ABU in order to prevent a peaceful demonstration against the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Programme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structural Adjustment Program|url=http://www.whirledbank.org/development/sap.html|publisher=The Whirled Bank Group|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, ABU has been affected by national political instability. The very fact of ABU's strikingly \"national character\" (in drawing students and staff from an unusually broad range of Nigeria's regional, ethnic and religious communities) may incline the institution to internal instability. ABU has been among Nigeria's universities that have suffered most from closures.\n\nYet ABU continues to occupy a particularly important place among Nigerian universities. As it approaches its half-century anniversary, ABU can claim to be the largest and the most extensive of universities in Sub-Saharan Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} It covers a land area of 7,000 hectares and encompasses 12 academic faculties, a postgraduate school and 82 academic departments. It has five institutes, six specialized centers, a Division of Agricultural Colleges, demonstration secondary and primary schools, as well as extension and consultancy services which provide services to the wider society. The total student enrollment in the university's degree and sub-degree programmes is about 35,000, drawn from every state of Nigeria, from Africa, and from the rest of world. There are about 1,400 academic and research staff and 5,000 support staff.\n\nThe university has nurtured two new institutions: [[Bayero University Kano]] and the [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University]] of Technology, Bauchi. Some 27 tertiary institutions made up of colleges of education, polytechnics and schools of basic or preliminary studies are affiliated to it.\n\n==Administration==\n{{See also|List of Ahmadu Bello University chancellors}}\nAhmadu Bello University has a [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] as its ceremonial head, while the [[vice-chancellor]] is the chief executive and academic officer. The vice-chancellor is usually appointed for a five-year, non-renewable term.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XII and Russia", "text_new": "{{main|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\n'''Pope Pius XII and Russia''' describes relations of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] with the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]], the [[Orthodox Church]], and United Oriental Churches resulting in the eradication of the Church in most parts of the Soviet Union during the [[Stalinist]] era. Most [[persecution]]s of the Church occurred during the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope Pius XII]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe relations of the Vatican with Russia are one element of the topic [[Persecutions against the Catholic Church and Pope Pius XII]]. Equally destructive to the Church were the simultaneous persecutions of [[Pope Pius XII and the Church in China|the Church in China]]\n\nRelations between [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities and the Holy See were always difficult, although at times, both sides tries to show some flexibility. On January 23, 1918, the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana''<ref>AAS 12, 1020, 313-317</ref> in which he condemned the philosophy and practices of [[communism]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''Miserantissimus Redemptor'',<ref>AAS 20 1928 165-178</ref> ''Caritate Christi'',<ref>AAS 24 1932 177-194</ref> and ''Divini Redemptoris''<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65-106</ref>\n\n==The War years: 1941-1945 ==\nThe [[pontificate]] of Pius XII faced extraordinary problems. During the 1930s, the public protests and condemnations of his predecessors had not deterred the Soviet authorities to persecute all Christian Churches within the Soviet Union as hostile to [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The persecution of the Catholic Church was a part of an overall attempt to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union. In 1940, after [[Germany]] occupied the Western part of [[Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the Eastern part along with the [[Baltic Countries]] including predominantly Catholic [[Lithuania]]. Persecution began at once, as large parts of Poland and the Baltic States were incorporated into the USSR. Almost immediately, the United Catholic Churches of Armenia, Ukraine and Ruthenia were attacked. While most Oriental Christians belong to an Orthodox Church, some like the Armenian Catholic Church, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Church, are united with Rome which allowed them to keep their own Oriental liturgy and Church laws.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Pius XII upholding the neutrality of the Holy See had abstained from any criticisms of the Soviet Union as it was attacked by Germany. Contrary to many rumours, the Pope never called the war a crusade against communism, nor did he encourage the extension of the war into the Soviet Union. In his letter to the Russian people [[Sacro Vergente]], he wrote that despite of these Church persecutions during the war, he would not utter one word which could have been used unfairly. Despite growing pressure, he never condoned or approved a war against communism or against Russia in 1941.<ref>AAS 1952, 508</ref> Helping to save lives whenever possible, especially in Soviet and German occupied Poland, he did not issue protests when the allies in the East engaged in Mass killings or deportations during the war.\n\n==  The destruction of Catholic Oriental Churches ==\n\nAfter the war, the Russian Orthodox Church was given some freedom by the government of [[Joseph Stalin]], but not the Orthodox Oriental Churches which was united with Rome. Leaders of the Orthodox Oriental Churches faced intense pressure to break with Rome and unite with Moscow. Pope Pius addressed specifically the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] located in the Ukraine. Ruthenian Catholics call themselves Rusyns. They are closely related to the Ukrainians and speak a dialect of the same language. The traditional Rusyn homeland extends into northeast Slovakia and the Lemko region of southeast Poland. Until 1922, the area was largely a part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. After becoming Polish, which follows the Latin rite, [[Polonisation]] and significant problems for all Orthodox, including united Christians developed.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\">Giovannetti, 112</ref><ref>Wikipedia Polonisation</ref> Some Ruthenians, resisting [[Polonisation]], felt deserted by the Vatican and returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the Pontificate of Pope Pius XI.\n\nAfter 1945, it was claimed that the union with Rome was a Polish conspiracy to dominate and wipe out the Oriental culture of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]: United orthodox faithful and priests had to suffer under Polish bishops of the Latin Rite and Polonisation. But they were apprehended by the [[Soviet Army]] under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, and therefore, continued ties to Rome were made impossible.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\"/> The new [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] of Moscow called on all Catholics in the Soviet Union for a separation from Rome:\n\n* Liberate yourself! You must break the Vatican chains, which throw you into the abyss of error, darkness and spiritual decay. Hurry, return to the your true mother, the Russian Orthodox Church!<ref>Giovannetti,  115</ref>\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] replied: \"Who does not know, that [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia, openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church in a letter lately addressed to the Ruthenian Church, a letter, which contributes not a little to the persecution?\"<ref>AAS 1946,  Orientales omnes Ecclesias 57</ref> Pope Pius never shared Roosevelt's war time optimism regarding Stalin' allegedly changed attitudes towards religious freedom and tolerance and related guarantees from the newly established [[United Nations]]. [[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]] refers to [[United Nations]] resolutions of a world of tolerance, free of religious persecution . Pius continues, \"This had given us hope that peace and true liberty would be granted everywhere to the Catholic Church, the more so since the Church has always taught, and teaches, that obedience to the ordinances of the lawfully established civil power, within the sphere and bounds of its authority, is a duty of conscience. But, unfortunately, the events we have mentioned have grievously and bitterly weakened, have almost destroyed, our hope and confidence so far as the lands of the Ruthenians are concerned.\"<ref>AAS 1946, Orientales omnes Ecclesias, 58</ref>\n\nThe Pope knew not only about the attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome. He also was aware, that in months preceding the encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, and Josaphat Kocylovskyi. Some, including Bishop [[Nicetas Budka]], perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946. July 1, 1945, some three hundred priests of the United Church wrote to Molotov. They protested the arrest of all bishops and large parts of the Catholic clergy.<ref>Guglielmo de Vries, Oriente Cristiano, ieri e oggi, Roma, 270-275</ref> After the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome, and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. Mass arrests of priests followed. In Lemko, some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945 Giovan<ref>netti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church's public presence in Russia was annihilated. Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi,  517</ref> After the war, the Catholic United Churches were integrated under the Moscow Patriarchy, after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested on March 6, 1946.<ref>Adrianyi,  518</ref> The Catholic Church of Ukraine was thus liquidated. All properties were turned over to the Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"peaceful coexistence\" became subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical cooperation, whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of [[de-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce results, aside from modest improvements in [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after 1956. January 1958, [[Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow, to have formal relations with the Vatican in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on World peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position, which he claimed was identical with Kremlin policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref> The Vatican did not respond officially, and reported unofficial contacts will not be known until 2028, when Vatican Archives open access to all documents of the pontificate of Pius XII.\n\n== Pope Pius XII on Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church ==\n\nTwo months after his election on May 12, 1939, in ''Singolari Animi'', a papal letter to the Sacred Congregation of the Oriental Church, Pius XII reported again the persecutions of the Catholic faith in the Soviet Union. Three weeks later, while honouring the memory of Saint Vladimir on the 950th anniversary of his baptism, he welcomed Ruthenian priests and bishops and members of the Russian colony in Rome, and prayed for those who suffer in their country, awaiting with their tears the hour of the coming of the Lord.<ref>AAS 1939, 165</ref>\n\nThe encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'' is a summary of the relations between the united oriental churches and Rome until the persecutions 1945.Pope Pius presents a comprehensive historical review of the reunion, to show the many trials and bloody persecutions but also the advantages of the union to the faithful in Ukraine. In Sacro Vergente this history is repeated with view to relations with Russia in general. He again rejects [[communism]] but not [[communists]]. Those who err, are always welcome.<ref>AAS,1952,  509</ref> At Saint Josaphat College he mourns the terrible changes of the past twenty years in Russia, bishops incarcerated, in concentration camps, banned from their homes, killed while in jail, for one reason only, they are faithful to the Holy See.<ref>AAS,1952,  877</ref>\n\n[[Orientales Ecclesias]] reviews the efforts of the Vatican of improving relations with the oriental Churches. Pope Pius XII mentions the naming of the first ever Oriental Cardinal [[Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian]], and the reform of the Eastern [[Canon Law]] as two examples. But the most flourishing Christian communities are wiped out without trace these days. He does not know details except that many bishops and priests are deported to unknown destinations, to [[concentration camps]] and to jails, while some are under house arrest. AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 5 In Bulgaria, Bishop Bossilkoff was executed with many others. But Bulgaria is not alone. Many are robbed of the most basic natural and human rights, and mistreated in the most extreme ways. The suffering in Ukraine is immense.<ref>AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 12</ref> The Pope refers specifically to the Kiev show trial against bishops of the oriental Church. Still there is reason for comfort and hope: The strength of the faithful. The Christian faith makes better citizens, who use their God-given freedom to work for their societies to further the causes of justice and unity.<ref>AAS 1952,  Orientales Ecclesias 19</ref> The Pope concludes by requesting worldwide public prayers for the persecuted, and hopes hat they may open the jails and loosen the chains in those countries.\n\n[[Novimus Nos]] is a letter to the bishops of the Oriental rite asking for faith, strength and hope. The Pope expresses his ardent desire for unity of all Eastern Christians with the Western church and comforts those who suffer in jail or unknown locations for their faith and faithfulness to the Holy See. In ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, Pope Pius reminds the whole world of the sufferings and persecutions in Russia and dedicates her to the special protection of Mary, who has so many Russian followers.\n\n** 1.\t''Singulari Animi, Apostolic Letter, May 12, 1939'', AAS 1939, 258\n** 2.\t''The 950th

the [[Holy See|Vatican]] with the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]], the [[Orthodox Church]], United Oriental Churches resulting in the eradication of the Church in most parts of the Soviet Union during the [[Stalinist]] era. Most [[persecution]]s of the Church occurred during the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope Pius XII]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe relations of the Vatican with Russia are one element of the topic [[Persecutions against the Catholic Church and Pope Pius XII]].  Equally destructive to the Church were the simultaneous persecutions in China. [[Pope Pius XII and the Church in China]]\n\nRelations between [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities  and the Holy See were always difficult, although at times, both sides tries to show some flexibility. On January 23, 1918, the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later,  in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana''<ref>AAS 12, 1020, 313-317</ref> in which he condemned the philosophy and practices of [[communism]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''Miserantissimus Redemptor'',<ref>AAS 20 1928 165-178</ref>  ''Caritate Christi'',<ref>AAS 24 1932 177-194</ref>  and ''Divini Redemptoris''<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65-106</ref>\n\n==The War years: 1941-1945 ==\nThe [[pontificate]] of Pius XII faced extraordinary  problems. During the 1930s, the public protests and condemnations of his predecessors had not deterred the Soviet authorities to persecute all Christian Churches within the Soviet Union as hostile to [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The persecution of the Catholic Church was a part of an overall attempt to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union. In 1940, after [[Germany]] occupied the Western part of [[Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the Eastern part along with the [[Baltic Countries]] including predominantly Catholic [[Lithuania]]. Persecution began at once, as large parts of Poland and the Baltic States were incorporated into the USSR. Almost immediately, the United Catholic Churches of Armenia, Ukraine and Ruthenia were attacked. While most Oriental Christians belong to an Orthodox Church, some like the Armenian Catholic Church, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Church, are united with Rome which allowed them to keep their own Oriental liturgy and Church laws.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Pius XII upholding the neutrality of the Holy See had abstained from any criticisms of the Soviet Union as it was attacked by Germany. Contrary to many rumours, the Pope never called the war a crusade against communism, nor did he encourage the extension of the war into the Soviet Union. In his letter to the Russian people [[Sacro Vergente]], he wrote that despite of these Church persecutions during the war, he would not utter one word which could have been used unfairly. Despite growing pressure, he never condoned or approved a war against communism or against Russia in 1941.<ref>AAS 1952, 508</ref> Helping to save lives whenever possible, especially in Soviet and German occupied Poland, he did not issue protests when the allies in the East engaged in Mass killings or deportations during the war.\n\n==  The destruction of Catholic Oriental Churches ==\n\nAfter the war, the Russian Orthodox Church was given some freedom by the government of [[Joseph Stalin]], but not the Orthodox Oriental Churches which was united with Rome. Leaders of the Orthodox Oriental Churches faced intense pressure to break with Rome and unite with Moscow. Pope Pius addressed specifically the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] located in the Ukraine. Ruthenian Catholics call themselves Rusyns. They are closely related to the Ukrainians and speak a dialect of the same language. The traditional Rusyn homeland extends into northeast Slovakia and the Lemko region of southeast Poland. Until 1922, the area was largely a  part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. After becoming Polish, which follows the Latin rite, [[Polonisation]] and significant problems for all Orthodox, including united Christians developed.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\">Giovannetti, 112</ref><ref>Wikipedia Polonisation</ref>  Some  Ruthenians,  resisting  [[Polonisation]], felt deserted by the Vatican and returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the Pontificate of Pope Pius XI.\n\nAfter 1945, it was claimed that the union with Rome was a Polish conspiracy to dominate and wipe out the Oriental culture of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]:  United orthodox faithful and priests had to suffer under Polish bishops of the Latin Rite and Polonisation. But they were apprehended by the [[Soviet Army]]  under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, and therefore, continued ties to Rome were made impossible.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\"/>   The new  [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]]  of Moscow called on all  Catholics in the Soviet Union for a separation from Rome:\n\n* Liberate yourself! You must break the Vatican chains, which throw you into the abyss of error, darkness and spiritual decay. Hurry, return to the your true mother, the Russian Orthodox Church!<ref>Giovannetti,  115</ref>\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] replied: \"Who does not know, that [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia, openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church in a letter lately addressed to the Ruthenian Church, a letter, which contributes not a little to the  persecution?\"<ref>AAS 1946,  Orientales omnes Ecclesias 57</ref>   Pope Pius never shared   Roosevelt's war time optimism regarding Stalin' allegedly changed   attitudes towards religious freedom and tolerance and related guarantees from the newly established [[United Nations]].  [[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]] refers to  [[United Nations]]  resolutions of a world of tolerance, free of religious persecution . Pius continues,  \"This had given us hope that peace and true liberty would be granted everywhere to the Catholic Church, the more so since the Church has always taught, and teaches, that obedience to the ordinances of the lawfully established civil power, within the sphere and bounds of its authority, is a duty of conscience. But, unfortunately, the events we have mentioned have grievously and bitterly weakened, have almost destroyed, our hope and confidence so far as the lands of the Ruthenians are concerned.\"<ref>AAS 1946, Orientales omnes Ecclesias, 58</ref>\n\nThe Pope knew not only about the attempts to separate  the United Churches from Rome. He also was aware, that in months preceding the  encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'',  all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian  Church had been arrested, including  [[Josyf Slipyj]], Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, and Josaphat Kocylovskyi.  Some, including  Bishop [[Nicetas Budka]],  perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref>  Subjected to  Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received   severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and  heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried  in 1945 and 1946.  July 1, 1945, some three hundred priests of the United Church wrote  to Molotov. They  protested the arrest of all bishops and large parts of the Catholic clergy.<ref>Guglielmo de Vries, Oriente Cristiano, ieri e oggi, Roma, 270-275</ref> After the  Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation  from Rome, and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. Mass arrests of priests followed. In  Lemko, some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945  Giovan<ref>netti, 90</ref>  or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church's public presence in Russia was annihilated. Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches,  monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi,  517</ref>  After the war, the Catholic United Churches were integrated under the Moscow Patriarchy,  after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested  on March 6, 1946.<ref>Adrianyi,  518</ref> The Catholic Church of Ukraine was thus liquidated. All properties were turned over to the Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"peaceful coexistence\" became subject of numerous discussions.    In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for  peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical cooperation, whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of [[de-Stalinisation]] and the  Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce results, aside from modest improvements in [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after 1956.  January 1958, [[Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow, to have formal relations with the Vatican in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on World peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position, which he claimed was identical with  Kremlin policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref> The Vatican did not respond officially, and reported  unofficial contacts will not be known until 2028, when  Vatican Archives open access to all documents of the pontificate of Pius XII.\n\n== Pope Pius XII on Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church ==\n\nTwo months after his election on May 12, 1939, in ''Singolari Animi'', a papal letter to the Sacred  Congregation of the  Oriental Church,   Pius XII reported again the persecutions of the Catholic faith in the Soviet Union. Three weeks later, while honouring the memory of Saint Vladimir on the 950th anniversary of his baptism, he welcomed Ruthenian priests and bishops and members of the Russian colony in Rome,  and prayed for those who suffer in their country, awaiting with their tears the hour of the coming of the Lord.<ref>AAS 1939, 165</ref>\n\nThe encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'' is a summary of the relations between the united oriental churches and Rome until the persecutions  1945.Pope Pius presents  a comprehensive historical review of the reunion, to show the many trials and bloody persecutions but also the  advantages of the union to the faithful in Ukraine.   In Sacro Vergente this history is repeated with view to relations with Russia in general. He again rejects [[communism]] but not [[communists]]. Those who  err, are always welcome.<ref>AAS,1952,  509</ref> At Saint Josaphat College he mourns the terrible changes of the past twenty years in Russia, bishops incarcerated, in concentration camps, banned from their homes, killed while in jail, for one reason only, they are faithful to the Holy See.<ref>AAS,1952,  877</ref>\n\n[[Orientales Ecclesias]] reviews the efforts of the Vatican of improving relations with the oriental Churches. Pope Pius XII mentions the naming of the first ever Oriental Cardinal [[Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian]], and the reform of the Eastern [[Canon Law]] as two examples.  But the most flourishing Christian communities are wiped out without trace these days. He does not know details except that many bishops and priests are deported to unknown destinations, to [[concentration camps]] and to jails, while some are under house arrest. AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 5 In Bulgaria, Bishop Bossilkoff was executed with many others. But Bulgaria is not alone. Many are robbed of the most basic natural and human rights,  and mistreated in the most extreme ways. The suffering in Ukraine is immense.<ref>AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 12</ref>  The Pope refers specifically to the Kiev show trial against bishops of the oriental Church. Still there is reason for comfort and hope: The strength of the faithful. The Christian faith makes better citizens, who use their God-given freedom to work for their societies to further the causes of justice and unity.<ref>AAS 1952,  Orientales Ecclesias 19</ref> The Pope concludes by requesting worldwide public prayers for the persecuted,  and hopes hat they may open the jails and loosen the chains in those countries.\n\n[[Novimus Nos]] is a letter to the bishops of the Oriental rite asking for faith, strength and hope. The Pope expresses his ardent desire for unity of all Eastern Christians with the Western church and comforts those who  suffer in jail or unknown locations for their faith and faithfulness to the Holy See.  In ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, Pope Pius reminds the whole world of the sufferings and persecutions in Russia and dedicates her to the special protection of Mary, who has so many Russian followers.\n\n** 1.\t''Singulari Animi, Apostolic Letter, May 12, 1939'', AAS  1939, 258\n** 2.\t''The 950th Anniversary of the Baptism of St Wladimir'', Discorsi 1939, 163\n** 3.\t[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]], Encyclical, AAS 1946, 33\n** 4.\t[[Sempiternus Rex]], Encyclical, September 8, 1951, AAS 1951, 624\n** 5.\t[[Sacro Vergente]],  Apostolic letter, July 7, 1952,  AAS 1952,  505\n** 6.\t''Speech to the St. Josaphat College'', December 15, 1952, AAS 1952, 876\n** 7.\t[[Orientales Ecclesias]], encyclical,  December 15, 1952, AAS 1953,  5\n** 8.\t[[Novimus Nos]],  Apostolic Letter, January 20, 1956, AAS 1956,  260\n** 9.\t[[Fulgens corona]] encyclical, September 8, 1954,  AAS 1954,  577\n\n==''Operation Seat 12'' -
