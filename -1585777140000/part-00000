British troops were met with fierce resistance as Hamburg was the last remaining pocket of resistance in the north.

The Allied armies started a general advance across Germany, with the Americans pushing the centre and the British holding their northern flank. The main British thrust came from the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]], under the command of [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Miles Dempsey|Miles C.

The British came across little resistance, compared with the Americans further south, and advanced at a steady and fast pace. The [[1st Parachute Army (Wehrmacht)|1st Parachute Army]] and the newly formed Army Group Northwest were the last German forces in the north. As the British continued their advance, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German high command]] in Berlin, which was under siege by the [[Red Army|Soviet Red Army]], refused to send reinforcements.

Elements of the [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]] attacked Hamburg itself from the northwest. On their way to Harburg, the 7th Division captured [[Welle, Germany|Welle]] and [[Tostedt]] on 18 April and advanced into [[Hollenstedt]] the next day. By this time, the Germans had built up defenses in Harburg as the British moved closer. On 20 April, the division captured [[Daerstorf]], eight miles west of the city. The [[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]] Forward Observation Officers (FOOs), reached the Elbe and began to direct artillery fire upon troops and trains on the other side of the river.

They were supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88mm guns]] and 75mm howitzers and reached the town centre, but were pushed back once British tanks arrived.

Nevertheless, the Germans blew up parts of the autobahn at Hittfeld, slowing the British advance. As the British advanced towards the city, it was clear that the Germans would not give up. The troops of the 1st Parachute Army were now a mix of a few SS, paratroopers, ''[[Volkssturm]]'', along with regular ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' soldiers, supported by sailors, police, firemen and Hitler Youth. They were supported by 88 mm guns, no longer needed for the air defense. Many German units including a [[tank destroyer]] battalion, a Hungarian SS unit and many ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' anti-tank troops were also still located in the woods south of Hamburg, as the British had bypassed the area and were now mopping it up. The 53rd Division, supported by the 1st Royal Tank Regiment assaulted the woods and captured all remaining German troops, a total of 2,000 men.\n\nOn 28 April the [[3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery]] began shelling the [[Phoenix AG|Phoenix Rubber Works]] in Hamburg, which brought about a white flag delegation. On 29 April a deputation from the city came out to discuss surrender. On 1 May General [[Alwin Wolz]] staff car  under a white flag approached the D Company of the 9th Durham Light Infantry. On 30 April, [[Adolf Hitler]] had committed suicide in [[Berlin]] and Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who was commanding the foces in the north, had ordered Wolz to discuss surrendering the city to the British. Wolz, along with a small German delegation, arrived at Division HQ on 2 May and formally surrendered Hamburg on the 3rd May .

They were hindered by occasional shortages of suitable paper, ink, [[typesetting|compositors]] and printers. Publication sometimes had to be suspended due to such shortages.\n\nAustralia's longest-running newspaper, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', was first published as the ''Sydney Herald'' in 1831. The ''Herald''{{'}}s rival, ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', was first published in July 1879. Weekly newspapers were an important feature of the Australian newspaper scene in the nineteenth century. Illustrated newspapers became increasingly important. They initially featured woodcut engravings and toward the end on the nineteenth century black and white photographs began to appear.\n\nAustralia's first foreign-language newspaper, ''Die Deutsche Post f\u00fcr die australischen Kolonien'' was published in Adelaide from 1848\u20131850.<ref name=\"AussieData\" />\n\nAustralia's first national daily newspaper, ''Daily Commercial News'' (now ''[[Lloyd's List Australia]]'') was first published in April 1891.<ref>{{citation | publisher = National Library of Australia|work=Trove | url = \nhttp://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17114605?selectedversion=NBD6648874 | title = \t\nDaily commercial news and shipping list}}.</ref> Only during the second part of the twentieth century did other national newspapers start to be published.<ref name=\"isaacs\" />\n\nNewspapers played an important role in Australia in the nineteenth century. According to historian and former newspaper man [[Thomas McCombie]] in his, ''History of the Colony of Victoria'' (1858),\n\n{{quotation|the newspaper press constitutes nearly the only literature published in the Australian colonies. It monopolises the greater part of the thought. The newspaper occupy the space of all literature, and stop the channels of information from all other sources; by far the largest class derive no information from any other quarter ...<ref>McCombie, Thomas (1858), ''A History of the Colony of Victoria from its Settlement to the Death of Sir Charles Hotham'', Melbourne, Sands & Kenny, p.323</ref>}}\n\nThese sentiments were echoed by [[Richard Twopeny]] in, ''Town Life in Australia'' (1883),\n\n{{quotation|This is essentially the land of newspapers. Nearly everyone can read, and nearly everybody has the leisure to do so ... The proportion of the population who can afford to purchase and subscribe to newspapers is ten times as large as in England; hence the number of sheets issued is comparatively much greater.<ref>Twopeny, R.E.N. (1883) ''Town Life in Australia'', London, Eliot Stock, p.221</ref>}}\n\nThis national obsession with newspapers continued into the 20th century so that historian [[Ken Inglis]] could note in 1962 that,\n\n{{quotation|Australians are more intensely addicted to daily newspapers than almost all other people in the world ... We buy more than 40 papers a day per 100 of population. Nearly 90 per cent of us usually read, or look at, a morning paper, and 70 per cent an evening paper.<ref>K.S.

Permanent European settlement began in 1788 with the establishment of a [[British Empire|British]] [[penal colony]] in [[New South Wales]]. From early [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, Australia maintained the [[White Australia policy|White Australia Policy]], which was abolished after World War II, heralding the modern era of [[multiculturalism in Australia]]. From the late 1970s there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries.\n\nAustralia is also a signatory to the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and recognises the [[right of asylum]].\n\n== Original inhabitants ==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Australia}}\nThe first inhabitants in Australia were the ancestors of the present [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people. Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 43,000 years [[Before Present|Before Present (BP)]], while the upper range supported by others is 60,000 to 70,000 years BP.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html | title= Australia colonized earlier than previously thought? | date= 24 July 2003 | accessdate= 2 November 2007 | publisher= stonepages.com, Paola Arosio & Diego Meozzi | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/675MBX9gl?url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html | archivedate= 21 April 2012 | df= dmy-all }} \u2013 reporting on news in ''The West Australian (19 July 2003)''</ref>\n\nIn any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the [[Pleistocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], when [[sea level]]s were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended [[glaciation]] resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100\u2013150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the [[Timor Sea]] than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as [[Sahul continent|Sahul]]), connected by an extensive [[land bridge]] across the [[Arafura Sea]], [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and [[Torres Strait]].\n\nIt is theorised that these original peoples first navigated the shorter distances from and between the [[Sunda Islands]] to reach Sahul; then via the land bridge to spread out through the continent. Archaeological evidence indicates human habitation at the upper [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River, Western Australia]] by about 40,000 years ago; [[Tasmania]] (also at that time connected via a land bridge) was reached at least 30,000 years ago.\n\nThe ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversify and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the [[Timeline of glaciation|most recent glacial period]] some 10,000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150&nbsp;km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern [[Cape York Peninsula]].\n\nSeveral thousand years ago the [[Melanesia]]n [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples were established in the [[Torres Strait Islands]], and commerce and contact was continued via this route although there is little evidence to suggest immediate influences extended much further south. A more sporadic contact along the northern Australian coast was maintained by seafarers across the Timor and Arafat Seas, with substantial evidence of [[Macassan contact with Australia]] in the centuries prior to European arrival, and also evidence of earlier contacts and exchanges by other groups. However, these exchanges do not appear to have involved any extended settlement or migrations of non-Aboriginal peoples to the region.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/science/08abor.html?ex=1187236800&en=3051874ea83b3233&ei=5070 | title=From DNA Analysis, Clues to a Single Australian Migration | work=The New York Times | date=8 May 2007 | last=Wade | first=Nicholas | accessdate=5 June 2008 | quote=Geneticists re-examining the first settlement of Australia and Papua-New Guinea by modern humans have concluded that the two islands were reached some 50,000 years ago by a single group of people who remained in substantial or total isolation until recent times. | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515233043/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/science/08abor.html?ex=1187236800&en=3051874ea83b3233&ei=5070 | archivedate=15 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2013 German study by a team of researchers on [[Indigenous Australian]] DNA genes reveal that a wave of migrants from [[India]] arrived in Australia about 4,230 years ago. It shows that the Indian migrants settled in Australia before [[Captain James Cook]]'s first recorded contact with the Australian coastline. The study also suggests that up to 11 per cent of Aboriginal Australians [[DNA]] derives from Indians. During the migration period, [[dingo]]s first appeared in the fossil suggests that the Indians took their dingos with them and they may also have brought stone tools called [[microliths]]. This study overturns the view that Australian continent was isolated from the time it was first colonised about 45,000\u201350,000 years ago until Europeans discovered Australia in the eighteenth century. Doctor Mark Stoneking, from the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] had explained that the DNA link could have been by people actually moving, physically travelling from India directly to Australia, or their genetic material could have moved in terms of contact between India and neighbouring populations who then had contact with other neighbor populations and eventually, there would have been contact with Australia. Professor Alan Cooper, from the [[University of Adelaide]]'s Centre for Ancient DNA, says that the Indian influence may well have played a role in the development of the [[Australian Aboriginal culture]].

On 26 January 1788 a landing was made at [[Sydney Cove]]. The new colony was formally proclaimed as the Colony of New South Wales on 7 February. Other transport fleets bringing further convicts as well as freemen to the colony followed. As a result of agitation by the free settlers in Sydney, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840. It continued to the colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (where settlement began in 1803) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for some years longer. The small settlement of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], founded in 1829 on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] in Western Australia by free settlers, failed to prosper and asked for convicts. In contrast, [[South Australia]], with its capital Adelaide founded in 1836, and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], with its capital Melbourne founded in 1839, was settled only by free settlers. South Australia not only received British migrants, but also a significant influx of Prussian farmers and tradesmen, initially seeking freedom from religious persecution. By the end of the [[penal transportation]] in 1868, approximately 165,000 people had entered Australia as convicts.\n\nFrom about 1815 Sydney began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Ireland and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free land. Many settlers occupied land without authority; they were known as [[squatter]]s and became the basis of a powerful landowning class.[[File:StateLibQld 1 110096 Drawing of migrants disembarking from a ship, ca. 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of migrants disembarking from a ship, ca. 1885]]\n\n==Gold rushes==\n{{See also|Australian gold rushes}}\nThe discovery of [[gold]], beginning in 1851 first near [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in New South Wales and then in the newly formed colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], transformed Australia economically, politically and demographically. The [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] occurred hard on the heels of a major worldwide economic depression. As a result, about two per cent of the population of the British Isles emigrated to New South Wales and Victoria during the 1850s{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. There were also a significant number of continental Europeans, North Americans and Chinese.\n\nIn 1851 the Australian population was 437,655, of which 77,345, or just under 18%, were Victorians. A decade later the Australian population had grown to 1,151,947 and the Victorian population had increased to 538,628; just under 47% of the Australian total and a sevenfold increase. The rapid growth was predominantly a result of the gold rushes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Caldwell | first = J.

The government found that if it wanted immigrants it had to subsidise migration; the great distance from Europe made Australia a more expensive and less attractive destination than Canada, the United States, Brazil or Argentina.\n\nThe number of immigrants needed during different stages of the economic cycle could be controlled by varying the subsidy.

There was much resistance to Chinese immigration and the use of indentured workers from [[New Caledonia]] to work in the [[Queensland]] sugar industry.\n\nThe White Australia policy involved the exclusion of all non-European people from immigrating into Australia, and was the official policy of all governments and all mainstream political parties in Australia from the 1890s to the 1950s, and elements of the policy survived until the 1970s. Although the expression 'White Australia policy' was never in official use, it was common in political and public debate throughout the period.<ref>The History of Immigration of Australia of the Last Century Book</ref>\n\nBy 1938, many Jews were seeking to leave Germany and Austria due to the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] policy of [[Judenfrei|Judenrein]], the forced removal of Jews. In June 1938 at the [[Evian Conference]] was held in France to discuss the [[Jewish refugee]] crisis by which time there were hundreds of thousands of Jewish seeking to immigrate. Although many nations attended the conference and expressed their concerns for the refugees, No progress was made towards re-settlement of the refugees. Australia agreed to accept 15,000 Jewish refugees over three years with Australia's delegate, Tomas W. White saying \"As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/09/23/refugee-crises-and-the-sad-legacy-of-the-1938-evian-conference/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328020046/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/09/23/refugee-crises-and-the-sad-legacy-of-the-1938-evian-conference/ |archivedate=28 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA predominantly European nation on the periphery of Asia, historically many white citizens of Australia feared being demographically overwhelmed by the heavily populated Asian countries to the north. Following the [[Bombing of Darwin (February 1942)|attacks on Darwin]] and the associated fear of [[Imperial Japan]]ese invasion in WWII, Minister of Immigration [[Arthur Calwell]] stated in 1947: \"We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us.\" This concern about Australia's demographic vulnerability was a driving force behind the country's massive post-war program of European immigration.\n\n== Post-war immigration ==\n{{main|Post-war immigration to Australia}}\n[[Image:Dutch Migrant 1954 MariaScholte=50000thToAustraliaPostWW2.jpg|thumb|In 1954 the 50,000th [[Dutch Australian|Dutch migrant]] arrived; Maria Scholte is to the right of the picture]]\nAfter [[World War II]], Australia believed that it must increase its population to avoid the threat of another invasion and launched an immigration program whose goal was to increase Australia's population with the slogan \"populate or perish\". Hundreds of thousands of displaced Europeans immigrated to Australia with more than three million people immigrating from Europe during the late 1940s until the 1960s. The [[Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Immigration Minister]], [[Arthur Calwell]], introduced the [[Assisted Passage Migration Scheme]] in 1945. The government was still trying to increase Australia's population, especially with people who have skills in the secondary industry sector. As the world was transforming into a more industrial and technological world, Australia needed to keep up.\n\nAustralia looked first to Britain for migrants. In the beginning the assisted immigration scheme was popular among young married couples and single people. It was inexpensive, an adventure and an opportunity. After only a year, however, there was a shortage of ships and numbers dropped. The immigration targets were not being met. For the first time, in a revolutionary step for both Australian society and international relations, Australia looked outside Britain for migrants. In 1947, Calwell agreed to bring 12,000 people every year from [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]]. Many of these people were [[refugee]]s who were being cared for by the [[International Refugee Organisation]] (IRO). They were accepted on [[humanitarian]] grounds with the condition that they would remain in Australia for two years and work in government selected jobs. 182,159 people were sponsored by the IRO from the end of World War II up to the end of 1954 to resettle in Australia from Europe.\n\nOver the next twenty years, patterns of immigration continued to change. The government encouraged more people to come to Australia and many more assisted agreements were made with countries. In the late 1950s, more immigrants began to be accepted from the [[Middle East]]. In 1958, under the ''[[Migration Act 1958]]'', the dictation test was removed and a new universal visa scheme or entry permits introduced. This allowed non-Europeans to immigrate. Their entry was now based on what they could contribute to Australia and if it could be shown that they could integrate into Australian society. This attracted many professionals and highly qualified people who added to Australia's relatively small [[tertiary industry]].\n\nThe Australian government assisted many of the refugees, such as helping them find work (due to an expanding economy and major infrastructure projects, the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] being the most famous). This growth of immigration greatly changed the national image regarding the Australian way of life which, before the war, had been dominated by Anglo-Saxons. Immigration was still strict in allowing non-Europeans to immigrate into the country due to the White Australia Policy.\n\nThe White Australia Policy [[White Australia Policy#End of the White Australia Policy|began to be abandoned]] in 1966, under Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Harold Holt (26 January 1966 \u2013 19 December 1967)|url = http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|website = primeministers.naa.gov.au|access-date = 24 January 2016|language = en-AU|publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]]|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220813/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|archivedate = 3 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The last reside of the policy was finally abolished in 1973 under the Government of [[Gough Whitlam]].\n\n== Modern era ==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s around 120,000 southern [[Asian people|Asian]] refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration [[Al Grassby]] termed \"[[multiculturalism]]\". The development of Australia's multicultural policy was heavily influenced by the Galbally Report of 1978, which addressed issues with living in and planning for a multicultural Australian society.\n\nMigration to Australia in the late twentieth century was influenced by a number of world events, including:\n\n* [[Vietnam War|The fall of Saigon]] in 1975, the start of migration waves from Indo-China to Western countries, including Australia.\n* The fall of [[East Timor]] to Indonesian's troops in 1975, which led many East-Timorese to seek refuge in Australia. \n* Dictatorships in South America, which led political dissidents from [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] to flee military regimes during the 1970s and seek refuge in Australia.\n* [[Lebanese Australians|The Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975\u20131990, which saw many Lebanese refugees come to Australia.\n* [[Tiananmen Square massacre]] in June 1989, as a result of which many Chinese students in Australia were granted permanent residency.\n* The [[Yugoslav Wars]] in [[Balkans|the Balkans]] from 1991\u20132001, which drove many [[Albanians]], [[Bosnians]], [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], to settle in Australia.\n* The [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]], which led migrants from [[Jakarta]] to trickle into major cities in Australia.\n[[File:ABS-3401.0-OverseasArrivalsDeparturesAustralia-TotalMovementArrivals CategoryMovement-NumberMovements-PermanentSettlerArrivals-A83808877L.svg|thumb|right|300px|Monthly arrivals of permanent settlers since 1976|alt=Plot showing a staggered rise, and peaks around 1982, 1988, and 2009.]]In 1994\u201395, Australia accepted 87,000 immigrants,<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/most/apmrnwp5.htm APMRN \u2013 Migration Issues in the Asia Pacific \u2013 Australia<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511010950/http://www.unesco.org/most/apmrnwp5.htm |date=11 May 2008 }}</ref> the last financial year before the [[Howard Government]] was elected.<ref name=\"Sheehan2006\">{{cite news|url = https://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/little-squares-that-define-the-nation/2006/01/01/1136050344123.html|title = Little squares that define the nation|date = 2 January 2006|newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald|last = Sheehan|first = Paul|authorlink = Paul Sheehan (journalist)|accessdate = 19 June 2008|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517045056/http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/little-squares-that-define-the-nation/2006/01/01/1136050344123.html|archivedate = 17 May 2008|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Planned immigrant intake was reduced to 68,000 following the election of [[John Howard]] in 1996.<ref name=\"Gittins20070613\">{{cite news | url = https://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/backscratching-at-a-national-level/2007/06/12/1181414298095.html%7C?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | title = Back-scratching at a national level | last = Gittins | first = Ross | authorlink = Ross Gittins | newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald | date = 13 June 2007 | accessdate = 4 June 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080926235621/http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/backscratching-at-a-national-level/2007/06/12/1181414298095.html%7C?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | archivedate = 26 September 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=1486_0_5_0 Migration News \u2013 Migration Dialogue<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906152546/http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=1486_0_5_0 |date=6 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004\u201305, Australia accepted 123,000 new settlers,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Immigration-numbers-over-123000/2005/12/31/1135915716249.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Immigration numbers over 123,000 | date=31 December 2005 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108065910/http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Immigration-numbers-over-123000/2005/12/31/1135915716249.html | archivedate=8 January 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> a 40% increase over the past 10 years.

With a sharp rise in unauthorised boat arrivals in the late 1990s, mostly from war-torn countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], the [[Howard government]] enforced the mandatory detention policy created by the previous [[Paul Keating]] government. This came to international attention during the [[Tampa affair]] of 2001.\n\nDuring the 2001 election campaign, immigration and border protection became the hot issue, as a result of incidents such as the Tampa affair, the [[Children overboard affair]], and the sinking of the [[SIEV X|SIEV-X]]. This was a major factor contributing to the victory of the Coalition, deemed impossible only a few months earlier, and also marked the beginning of the controversial [[Pacific Solution]].\n\nAfter the election, the government continued with its hard line on unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers. Legislation was developed to excise certain islands from Australia's [[Australian migration zone|migration zone]] meaning that if asylum seekers landed on an excised island, Australia was not required to provide access to the Australian courts or permanent settlement. Australia still adheres to its international obligations by considering such refugee applications offshore and providing temporary protection visas to those in genuine need of protection.\n\nBy 2004, the number of unauthorised boat arrivals had been reduced dramatically. The government argued that this was the result of its strong policy towards asylum seekers. Others argued that the decrease was the result of global factors, such as changing circumstances in the primary source nations of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n== Opposition to immigration ==\nIn March 1984, Professor [[Geoffrey Blainey]], an Australian historian, made a speech criticizing what he saw as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration to Australia. Blainey's remarks touched off a flood of debate and controversy about immigration and multiculturalism, known as the 'Blainey debate'. In 1984, he wrote a book outlining his ideas on immigration and multiculturalism titled ''[[All for Australia]]''. Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism throughout the 1980s, claiming multiculturalism was a \"sham\", \"anti-British\" and threatened to transform Australia into a \"cluster of tribes\".\n\nBlainey's views were echoed by some politicians. In August 1988, [[John Howard]], then opposition leader, launched the ''[[One Australia policy]]'', stating that he believed the rate of Asian immigration into Australia should be slowed down for the sake of social cohesion. He stated: \"I do believe that if it is \u2013 in the eyes of some in the community \u2013 that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.\"\n\nIn her maiden speech to the House of Representatives after her election in 1996, [[Pauline Hanson]] expressed her concern that Australia \"was in danger of being swamped by Asians\". This message exposed a population deeply divided on the issue of immigration. Hanson went on to form the [[One Nation Party]], which subsequently won nearly one quarter of the vote in Queensland state elections. Hanson claimed government policies were favoring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians. The issue of immigration remains highly sensitive in Australia.\n\nA 2018, [[Lowy Institute]] Poll found that a majority of Australians oppose the current rate of immigration to Australia. In 2018, 54% of Australians say that \u2018the total number of migrants coming to Australia each year is too high\u2019. A minority say its \u2018too low\u2019 (14%). These results represent a significant rise in opposition to the existing migration rate \u2013 up 14 points since last year, and up 17 points since we first asked this question in 2014.<ref>https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/2018-lowy-institute-poll</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n*[[Immigration to Australia]]\n*[[Demographics of Australia]]\n*[[History of Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Betts, Katharine.

Permanent European settlement began in 1788 with the establishment of a [[British Empire|British]] [[penal colony]] in [[New South Wales]]. From early [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, Australia maintained the [[White Australia policy|White Australia Policy]], which was abolished after World War II, heralding the modern era of [[multiculturalism in Australia]]. From the late 1970s there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries.\n\nAustralia is also a signatory to the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and recognises the [[right of asylum]].\n\n== Original inhabitants ==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Australia}}\nThe first inhabitants in Australia were the ancestors of the present [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people. Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 43,000 years [[Before Present|Before Present (BP)]], while the upper range supported by others is 60,000 to 70,000 years BP.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html | title= Australia colonized earlier than previously thought? | date= 24 July 2003 | accessdate= 2 November 2007 | publisher= stonepages.com, Paola Arosio & Diego Meozzi | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/675MBX9gl?url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html | archivedate= 21 April 2012 | df= dmy-all }} \u2013 reporting on news in ''The West Australian (19 July 2003)''</ref>\n\nIn any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the [[Pleistocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], when [[sea level]]s were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended [[glaciation]] resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100\u2013150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the [[Timor Sea]] than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as [[Sahul continent|Sahul]]), connected by an extensive [[land bridge]] across the [[Arafura Sea]], [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and [[Torres Strait]].\n\nIt is theorised that these original peoples first navigated the shorter distances from and between the [[Sunda Islands]] to reach Sahul; then via the land bridge to spread out through the continent. Archaeological evidence indicates human habitation at the upper [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River, Western Australia]] by about 40,000 years ago; [[Tasmania]] (also at that time connected via a land bridge) was reached at least 30,000 years ago.\n\nThe ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversify and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the [[Timeline of glaciation|most recent glacial period]] some 10,000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150&nbsp;km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern [[Cape York Peninsula]].\n\nSeveral thousand years ago the [[Melanesia]]n [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples were established in the [[Torres Strait Islands]], and commerce and contact was continued via this route although there is little evidence to suggest immediate influences extended much further south. A more sporadic contact along the northern Australian coast was maintained by seafarers across the Timor and Arafat Seas, with substantial evidence of [[Macassan contact with Australia]] in the centuries prior to European arrival, and also evidence of earlier contacts and exchanges by other groups. However, these exchanges do not appear to have involved any extended settlement or migrations of non-Aboriginal peoples to the region.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/science/08abor.html?ex=1187236800&en=3051874ea83b3233&ei=5070 | title=From DNA Analysis, Clues to a Single Australian Migration | work=The New York Times | date=8 May 2007 | last=Wade | first=Nicholas | accessdate=5 June 2008 | quote=Geneticists re-examining the first settlement of Australia and Papua-New Guinea by modern humans have concluded that the two islands were reached some 50,000 years ago by a single group of people who remained in substantial or total isolation until recent times. | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515233043/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/science/08abor.html?ex=1187236800&en=3051874ea83b3233&ei=5070 | archivedate=15 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2013 German study by a team of researchers on [[Indigenous Australian]] DNA genes reveal that a wave of migrants from [[India]] arrived in Australia about 4,230 years ago. It shows that the Indian migrants settled in Australia before [[Captain James Cook]]'s first recorded contact with the Australian coastline. The study also suggests that up to 11 per cent of Aboriginal Australians [[DNA]] derives from Indians. During the migration period, [[dingo]]s first appeared in the fossil suggests that the Indians took their dingos with them and they may also have brought stone tools called [[microliths]]. This study overturns the view that Australian continent was isolated from the time it was first colonised about 45,000\u201350,000 years ago until Europeans discovered Australia in the eighteenth century. Doctor Mark Stoneking, from the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] had explained that the DNA link could have been by people actually moving, physically travelling from India directly to Australia, or their genetic material could have moved in terms of contact between India and neighbouring populations who then had contact with other neighbor populations and eventually, there would have been contact with Australia. Professor Alan Cooper, from the [[University of Adelaide]]'s Centre for Ancient DNA, says that the Indian influence may well have played a role in the development of the [[Australian Aboriginal culture]]. It has taken a while for the Indian influence to be discovered because Indigenous Australians have been hesitant to participate in these kinds of genetic studies.<ref name=\"Daily mail\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2262843/Migrants-India-settled-Australia-4-000-years-ago-Captain-Cooks-arrival-took-dingos-them.html |title=Migrants from India settled in Australia 4,000 years ago before Captain Cook's arrival (and they took their dingos with them) |work=Daily mail |accessdate=16 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160413053441/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2262843/Migrants-India-settled-Australia-4-000-years-ago-Captain-Cooks-arrival-took-dingos-them.html |archivedate=13 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"abc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-15/research-shows-ancient-indian-migration-to-australia/4466382 |title=Research shows ancient Indian migration to Australia |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=15 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115170026/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-15/research-shows-ancient-indian-migration-to-australia/4466382 |archivedate=15 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-21016700 |title=Ancient migration: Genes link Australia with India |work=BBC |accessdate=14 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007085339/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-21016700 |archivedate=7 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"sbs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/01/15/dna-confirms-recent-indian-influx |title=DNA confirms recent Indian influx |work=SBS Australia |accessdate=26 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404171952/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/01/15/dna-confirms-recent-indian-influx |archivedate=4 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== British colonisation and settlement: 1787\u20131850s ==\n{{See also|First Fleet|German settlement in Australia}}\nAfter the loss of the United States, Britain experienced overcrowding of its prisons and sought to ease the problems by transportation of its prisoners. In 1787 the [[First Fleet]] of 11 ships and about 1350 people under the command of [[Arthur Phillip|Captain Arthur Phillip]] sailed for Australia. On 26 January 1788 a landing was made at [[Sydney Cove]]. The new colony was formally proclaimed as the Colony of New South Wales on 7 February. Other transport fleets bringing further convicts as well as freemen to the colony followed. As a result of agitation by the free settlers in Sydney, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840. It continued to the colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (where settlement began in 1803) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for some years longer. The small settlement of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], founded in 1829 on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] in Western Australia by free settlers, failed to prosper and asked for convicts. In contrast, [[South Australia]], with its capital Adelaide founded in 1836, and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], with its capital Melbourne founded in 1839, was settled only by free settlers. South Australia not only received British migrants, but also a significant influx of Prussian farmers and tradesmen, initially seeking freedom from religious persecution. By the end of the [[penal transportation]] in 1868, approximately 165,000 people had entered Australia as convicts.\n\nFrom about 1815 Sydney began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Ireland and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free land. Many settlers occupied land without authority; they were known as [[squatter]]s and became the basis of a powerful landowning class.[[File:StateLibQld 1 110096 Drawing of migrants disembarking from a ship, ca. 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of migrants disembarking from a ship, ca. 1885]]\n\n==Gold rushes==\n{{See also|Australian gold rushes}}\nThe discovery of [[gold]], beginning in 1851 first near [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in New South Wales and then in the newly formed colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], transformed Australia economically, politically and demographically. The [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] occurred hard on the heels of a major worldwide economic depression. As a result, about two per cent of the population of the British Isles emigrated to New South Wales and Victoria during the 1850s{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. There were also a significant number of continental Europeans, North Americans and Chinese.\n\nIn 1851 the Australian population was 437,655, of which 77,345, or just under 18%, were Victorians. A decade later the Australian population had grown to 1,151,947 and the Victorian population had increased to 538,628; just under 47% of the Australian total and a sevenfold increase. The rapid growth was predominantly a result of the gold rushes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Caldwell | first = J.

The government found that if it wanted immigrants it had to subsidise migration; the great distance from Europe made Australia a more expensive and less attractive destination than Canada, the United States, Brazil or Argentina.\n\nThe number of immigrants needed during different stages of the economic cycle could be controlled by varying the subsidy.

There was much resistance to Chinese immigration and the use of indentured workers from [[New Caledonia]] to work in the [[Queensland]] sugar industry.\n\nThe White Australia policy involved the exclusion of all non-European people from immigrating into Australia, and was the official policy of all governments and all mainstream political parties in Australia from the 1890s to the 1950s, and elements of the policy survived until the 1970s. Although the expression 'White Australia policy' was never in official use, it was common in political and public debate throughout the period.<ref>The History of Immigration of Australia of the Last Century Book</ref>\n\nBy 1938, many Jews were seeking to leave Germany and Austria due to the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] policy of [[Judenfrei|Judenrein]], the forced removal of Jews.

Although many nations attended the conference and expressed their concerns for the refugees, No progress was made towards re-settlement of the refugees. Australia agreed to accept 15,000 Jewish refugees over three years with Australia's delegate, Tomas W. White saying \"As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/09/23/refugee-crises-and-the-sad-legacy-of-the-1938-evian-conference/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328020046/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/09/23/refugee-crises-and-the-sad-legacy-of-the-1938-evian-conference/ |archivedate=28 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA predominantly European nation on the periphery of Asia, historically many white citizens of Australia feared being demographically overwhelmed by the heavily populated Asian countries to the north. Following the [[Bombing of Darwin (February 1942)|attacks on Darwin]] and the associated fear of [[Imperial Japan]]ese invasion in WWII, Minister of Immigration [[Arthur Calwell]] stated in 1947: \"We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us.\" This concern about Australia's demographic vulnerability was a driving force behind the country's massive post-war program of European immigration.\n\n== Post-war immigration ==\n{{main|Post-war immigration to Australia}}\n[[Image:Dutch Migrant 1954 MariaScholte=50000thToAustraliaPostWW2.jpg|thumb|In 1954 the 50,000th [[Dutch Australian|Dutch migrant]] arrived; Maria Scholte is to the right of the picture]]\nAfter [[World War II]], Australia believed that it must increase its population to avoid the threat of another invasion and launched an immigration program whose goal was to increase Australia's population with the slogan \"populate or perish\". Hundreds of thousands of displaced Europeans immigrated to Australia with more than three million people immigrating from Europe during the late 1940s until the 1960s. The [[Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Immigration Minister]], [[Arthur Calwell]], introduced the [[Assisted Passage Migration Scheme]] in 1945. The government was still trying to increase Australia's population, especially with people who have skills in the secondary industry sector. As the world was transforming into a more industrial and technological world, Australia needed to keep up.\n\nAustralia looked first to Britain for migrants. In the beginning the assisted immigration scheme was popular among young married couples and single people. It was inexpensive, an adventure and an opportunity. After only a year, however, there was a shortage of ships and numbers dropped. The immigration targets were not being met. For the first time, in a revolutionary step for both Australian society and international relations, Australia looked outside Britain for migrants. In 1947, Calwell agreed to bring 12,000 people every year from [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]]. Many of these people were [[refugee]]s who were being cared for by the [[International Refugee Organisation]] (IRO). They were accepted on [[humanitarian]] grounds with the condition that they would remain in Australia for two years and work in government selected jobs. 182,159 people were sponsored by the IRO from the end of World War II up to the end of 1954 to resettle in Australia from Europe.\n\nOver the next twenty years, patterns of immigration continued to change. The government encouraged more people to come to Australia and many more assisted agreements were made with countries. In the late 1950s, more immigrants began to be accepted from the [[Middle East]]. In 1958, under the ''[[Migration Act 1958]]'', the dictation test was removed and a new universal visa scheme or entry permits introduced. This allowed non-Europeans to immigrate. Their entry was now based on what they could contribute to Australia and if it could be shown that they could integrate into Australian society. This attracted many professionals and highly qualified people who added to Australia's relatively small [[tertiary industry]].\n\nThe Australian government assisted many of the refugees, such as helping them find work (due to an expanding economy and major infrastructure projects, the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] being the most famous). This growth of immigration greatly changed the national image regarding the Australian way of life which, before the war, had been dominated by Anglo-Saxons. Immigration was still strict in allowing non-Europeans to immigrate into the country due to the White Australia Policy.\n\nThe White Australia Policy [[White Australia Policy#End of the White Australia Policy|began to be abandoned]] in 1966, under Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Harold Holt (26 January 1966 \u2013 19 December 1967)|url = http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|website = primeministers.naa.gov.au|access-date = 24 January 2016|language = en-AU|publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]]|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220813/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|archivedate = 3 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The last reside of the policy was finally abolished in 1973 under the Government of [[Gough Whitlam]].\n\n== Modern era ==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s around 120,000 southern [[Asian people|Asian]] refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration [[Al Grassby]] termed \"[[multiculturalism]]\". The development of Australia's multicultural policy was heavily influenced by the Galbally Report of 1978, which addressed issues with living in and planning for a multicultural Australian society.\n\nMigration to Australia in the late twentieth century was influenced by a number of world events, including:\n\n* [[Vietnam War|The fall of Saigon]] in 1975, the start of migration waves from Indo-China to Western countries, including Australia.\n* The fall of [[East Timor]] to Indonesian's troops in 1975, which led many East-Timorese to seek refuge in Australia. \n* Dictatorships in South America, which led political dissidents from [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] to flee military regimes during the 1970s and seek refuge in Australia.\n* [[Lebanese Australians|The Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975\u20131990, which saw many Lebanese refugees come to Australia.\n* [[Tiananmen Square massacre]] in June 1989, as a result of which many Chinese students in Australia were granted permanent residency.\n* The [[Yugoslav Wars]] in [[Balkans|the Balkans]] from 1991\u20132001, which drove many [[Albanians]], [[Bosnians]], [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], to settle in Australia.\n* The [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]], which led migrants from [[Jakarta]] to trickle into major cities in Australia.\n[[File:ABS-3401.0-OverseasArrivalsDeparturesAustralia-TotalMovementArrivals CategoryMovement-NumberMovements-PermanentSettlerArrivals-A83808877L.svg|thumb|right|300px|Monthly arrivals of permanent settlers since 1976|alt=Plot showing a staggered rise, and peaks around 1982, 1988, and 2009.]]In 1994\u201395, Australia accepted 87,000 immigrants,<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/most/apmrnwp5.htm APMRN \u2013 Migration Issues in the Asia Pacific \u2013 Australia<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511010950/http://www.unesco.org/most/apmrnwp5.htm |date=11 May 2008 }}</ref> the last financial year before the [[Howard Government]] was elected.<ref name=\"Sheehan2006\">{{cite news|url = https://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/little-squares-that-define-the-nation/2006/01/01/1136050344123.html|title = Little squares that define the nation|date = 2 January 2006|newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald|last = Sheehan|first = Paul|authorlink = Paul Sheehan (journalist)|accessdate = 19 June 2008|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517045056/http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/little-squares-that-define-the-nation/2006/01/01/1136050344123.html|archivedate = 17 May 2008|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Planned immigrant intake was reduced to 68,000 following the election of [[John Howard]] in 1996.<ref name=\"Gittins20070613\">{{cite news | url = https://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/backscratching-at-a-national-level/2007/06/12/1181414298095.html%7C?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | title = Back-scratching at a national level | last = Gittins | first = Ross | authorlink = Ross Gittins | newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald | date = 13 June 2007 | accessdate = 4 June 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080926235621/http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/backscratching-at-a-national-level/2007/06/12/1181414298095.html%7C?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | archivedate = 26 September 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=1486_0_5_0 Migration News \u2013 Migration Dialogue<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906152546/http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=1486_0_5_0 |date=6 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004\u201305, Australia accepted 123,000 new settlers,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Immigration-numbers-over-123000/2005/12/31/1135915716249.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Immigration numbers over 123,000 | date=31 December 2005 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108065910/http://www.theage.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Immigration-numbers-over-123000/2005/12/31/1135915716249.html | archivedate=8 January 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> a 40% increase over the past 10 years.

With a sharp rise in unauthorised boat arrivals in the late 1990s, mostly from war-torn countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], the [[Howard government]] enforced the mandatory detention policy created by the previous [[Paul Keating]] government. This came to international attention during the [[Tampa affair]] of 2001.\n\nDuring the 2001 election campaign, immigration and border protection became the hot issue, as a result of incidents such as the Tampa affair, the [[Children overboard affair]], and the sinking of the [[SIEV X|SIEV-X]]. This was a major factor contributing to the victory of the Coalition, deemed impossible only a few months earlier, and also marked the beginning of the controversial [[Pacific Solution]].\n\nAfter the election, the government continued with its hard line on unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers. Legislation was developed to excise certain islands from Australia\u2019s [[Australian migration zone|migration zone]] meaning that if asylum seekers landed on an excised island, Australia was not required to provide access to the Australian courts or permanent settlement. Australia still adheres to its international obligations by considering such refugee applications offshore and providing temporary protection visas to those in genuine need of protection.\n\nBy 2004, the number of unauthorised boat arrivals had been reduced dramatically. The government argued that this was the result of its strong policy towards asylum seekers. Others argued that the decrease was the result of global factors, such as changing circumstances in the primary source nations of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n== Opposition to immigration ==\nIn March 1984, Professor [[Geoffrey Blainey]], an Australian historian, made a speech criticizing what he saw as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration to Australia. Blainey's remarks touched off a flood of debate and controversy about immigration and multiculturalism, known as the 'Blainey debate'. In 1984, he wrote a book outlining his ideas on immigration and multiculturalism titled ''[[All for Australia]]''. Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism throughout the 1980s, claiming multiculturalism was a \"sham\", \"anti-British\" and threatened to transform Australia into a \"cluster of tribes\".\n\nBlainey's views were echoed by some politicians. In August 1988, [[John Howard]], then opposition leader, launched the ''[[One Australia policy]]'', stating that he believed the rate of Asian immigration into Australia should be slowed down for the sake of social cohesion. He stated: \"I do believe that if it is \u2013 in the eyes of some in the community \u2013 that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.\"\n\nIn her maiden speech to the House of Representatives after her election in 1996, [[Pauline Hanson]] expressed her concern that Australia \"was in danger of being swamped by Asians\". This message exposed a population deeply divided on the issue of immigration. Hanson went on to form the [[One Nation Party]], which subsequently won nearly one quarter of the vote in Queensland state elections. Hanson claimed government policies were favoring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians. The issue of immigration remains highly sensitive in Australia.\n\nA 2018, [[Lowy Institute]] Poll found that a majority of Australians oppose the current rate of immigration to Australia. In 2018, 54% of Australians say that \u2018the total number of migrants coming to Australia each year is too high\u2019. A minority say its \u2018too low\u2019 (14%). These results represent a significant rise in opposition to the existing migration rate \u2013 up 14 points since last year, and up 17 points since we first asked this question in 2014.<ref>https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/2018-lowy-institute-poll</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n*[[Immigration to Australia]]\n*[[Demographics of Australia]]\n*[[History of Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Betts, Katharine.

His masterpiece is the nave ceiling of the Church of [[Sant'Ignazio]] in Rome. Through his techniques, he became one of the most noteworthy figures of the Baroque period. He is also noted for the architectural plans of  [[Ljubljana Cathedral]] (1700), inspired by the designs of the Jesuit churches [[Church of the Ges\u00f9|Il Ges\u00f9]] and S. Ignazio in Rome.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nBorn in [[Trento]] (then under Austrian rule), he studied [[Humanities]] at the local Jesuit High School. Showing artistic inclinations he was sent by his father to work with an artist; Pozzo was then 17 years old (in 1659). Judging by aspects of his early style this initial artistic training came probably from [[Palma il Giovane]]. After three years he came under the guidance of another unidentified painter from the workshop of [[Andrea Sacchi]] who appears to have taught him the techniques of Roman High Baroque. He would later travel to [[Como]] and [[Milan]].\n\n===As a Jesuit===\nOn 25 December 1665, he entered the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] as a lay brother. In 1668, he was assigned to the ''Casa Professa of San Fidele'' in [[Milan]], where his festival decorations in honour of [[Francis Borgia]] recently [[canonised]] (1671) met general approval. He continued artistic training in [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]]. His early paintings attest the influence of the [[Lombard School]]: rich colour, graphic [[chiaroscuro]]. When he painted in Genoa the ''Life of Jesus'' for the ''Congregazione de' Mercanti'', he was undoubtedly inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].\n\n===Early church decoration===\nPozzo's artistic activity was related to the Jesuit Order's enormous artistic needs; many Jesuit churches had been built in recent decades and were devoid of painted decoration. He was frequently employed by the Jesuits to decorate churches and buildings such as their churches of [[Modena]], [[Bologna]] and [[Arezzo]]. In 1676, he decorated the interior of San [[Francis Xavier]] church in [[Mondov\u00ec]]. In this church one can already see his later illusionistic techniques: fake gilding, bronze-coloured statues, marbled columns and a ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'' dome on a flat ceiling, peopled with foreshortened figures in architectural settings.  This was his first large [[fresco]].\n\nIn Turin (1678) Pozzo painted the ceiling of the Jesuit church of SS. Martiri. The frescoes gradually deteriorated through water infiltration. They were replaced in 1844 by new paintings by Luigi Vacca. Only fragments of the original frescoes survive.\n\n===Call to Rome===\nIn 1681, Pozzo was called to Rome by [[Giovanni Paolo Oliva]], Superior General of the [[Jesuits]]. Among others, Pozzo worked for [[Livio Odescalchi]], the powerful nephew of the pope, [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]]. Initially he was used as a stage designer for biblical pageants, but his illusionistic paintings in perspective for these stages soon gave him a reputation as a virtuoso in wall and ceiling decorations.\n\n====The Ges\u00f9 rooms====\nHis first Roman [[fresco]]es were in the corridor linking the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9]] to the rooms where [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] had lived.  His ''trompe-l'\u0153il'' architecture and paintings depicting the Saint's life for the ''Camere di San Ignazio'' (1681\u20131686), blended well with already existing paintings by [[Jacques Courtois|Giacomo Borgognone]].\n\n====The St Ignatius' Church====\n[[File:Andrea pozzo, gloria di sant'ignazio, 1685-94, 02.jpg|thumb|Andrea Pozzo's painted ceiling in the Church of St. Ignazio]]\nHis masterpiece, the illusory perspectives in frescoes of the dome,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060526214006/http://www.insecula.com/contact/A010775.html/</ref> the apse and the ceiling of Rome's Jesuit church of [[Sant'Ignazio]] were painted between 1685\u20131694 and are emblematic of the dramatic conceits of High Roman Baroque. For several generations, they set the standard for the decoration of Late Baroque ceiling frescos throughout Catholic Europe. Compare this work to [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli|Gaulli]]'s masterpiece in the other major Jesuit church in Rome, [[Ges\u00f9, Rome|Il Ges\u00f9]].\n\nThe church of Sant'Ignazio had remained unfinished with bare ceilings even after its consecration in 1642. Disputes with the original donors, the Ludovisi, had prevented the completion of the planned dome. Pozzo proposed to resolve this by creating the illusion of a dome, when viewed from inside, by painting on canvas. It was impressive to viewers, but controversial; some feared the canvas would soon darken.\n\nOn the flat ceiling he painted an allegory of the ''Apotheosis of S. Ignatius'', in breathtaking perspective. The painting, 17 m in diameter, is devised to make an observer, looking from a spot marked by a metal plate set into the floor of the nave,<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/775 775] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/775 }}</ref> seem to see a lofty vaulted roof decorated by statues, while in fact the ceiling is flat. The painting celebrates the apostolic goals of Jesuit missionaries, eager to expand the reach of Roman Catholicism in other continents. The [[Counter-Reformation]] also encouraged a militant Catholicism. For example, rather than placing the usual evangelists or scholarly pillars of doctrine in the pendentives, Pozzo depicted the victorious warriors of the old testament: ''[[Book of Judith|Judith]] and [[Holofernes]]''; ''David and Goliath''; ''[[Jael]] and [[Sisera]]''; and ''Samson and the Philistines''. It is said that when completed, some said \"Sant'Ignazio {{sic}} was a good place to buy meat, since four new butchers are now there.\"\n\n[[File:Sant'Ignazio - painted dome - antmoose.jpg|thumb|The illustionistic perspective of Pozzo's ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'' dome at Sant'Ignazio (1685) is revealed by viewing it from the opposite end]]\n\nIn the nave fresco, light comes from God the Father to the Son who transmits it to [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]], whence it breaks into four rays leading to the four continents. Pozzo explained that he illustrated the words of Christ in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]: ''I am come to send fire on the earth'', and the words of Ignatius: ''Go and set everything aflame''. A further ray illuminates the name of Jesus. The attention to movement within a large canvas with deep perspective in the scene, including a heavenly assembly whirling above, and the presence space-enlarging illusory architecture offered an example which was copied in several Italian, Austrian, German and Central European churches of the Jesuit order.\n\nThe architecture of the ''trompe-l'\u0153il'' dome seems to erase and raise the ceiling with such a realistic impression that it is difficult to distinguish what is real or not. Andrea Pozzo painted this ceiling and trompe-l'oeil dome on a canvas, 17 m wide. The paintings in the apse depict scenes from the life of St. Ignatius, St Francis Xavier and St Francis Borgia.\n\n====St Ignatius chapel (Ges\u00f9)====\nIn 1695 he was given the prestigious commission, after winning a competition against [[Sebastiano Cipriani]] and Giovanni Battista Origone, for an altar in the St. Ignatius chapel in the left transept of the Church of the Ges\u00f9. This grandiose altar above the tomb of the saint, built with rare marbles and precious metals, shows the [[Trinity]], while four [[lapis lazuli]] columns (these are now copies) enclose the colossal statue of the saint by [[Pierre Legros]]. It was the coordinated work of more than 100 sculptors and craftsmen, among them Pierre Legros, [[Bernardino Ludovisi]], Il Lorenzone and [[Jean-Baptiste Th\u00e9odon]]. Andrea Pozzo also designed the altar in the Chapel of St Francesco Borgia in the same church.\n\n====Altars in St Ignatius church====\nIn 1697 he was asked to build similar Baroque altars with scenes from the life of St Ignatius in the apse of the Sant'Ignazio church in Rome. These altars house the relics of St. [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] and of St. [[John Berchmans]].\n\n====Other works of art====\nMeanwhile he continued painting frescoes and illusory domes in [[Turin]], [[Mondov\u00ec]], [[Modena]], [[Montepulciano]] and [[Arezzo]]. In 1681 he was asked by [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] to paint his self-portrait for the ducal collection (now in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence). This oil on canvas has become a most original self-portrait. It shows the painter in a diagonal pose, showing with his right index finger his illusionist easel painting (a trompe-l'\u0153il dome, perhaps of the Badia church in Arezzo) while his left hand rests on three books (probably alluding to his not-yet published treatises on perspective). The painting was sent to the duke in 1688. He also painted scenes from the life of St [[Stanislaus Kostka]] in the saint's rooms of the Jesuit novitiate of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] in Rome.\n\n[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'\u0153il'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuit Church, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], Vienna, Austria]]\n===In Vienna===\nIn 1694 Andrea Pozzo had explained his illusory techniques in a letter to Anton Florian, Prince of [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] and ambassador of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] to the Papal Court in Rome. Recommended by Prince Liechtenstein to the emperor, Andrea Pozzo, on the invitation of Leopold I, moved in 1702 (1703?) to [[Vienna]]. There he worked for the sovereign, the court, Prince Johann Adam von Liechtenstein, and various religious orders and churches, such as the frescoes and the trompe-l'\u0153il dome in the [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]]. Some of his tasks were of a decorative, occasional character (church and theatre scenery), and these were soon destroyed.\n\nHis most significant surviving work in Vienna is the monumental ceiling fresco of the Hercules Hall of the [[Liechtenstein Museum#Liechtenstein Garden Palace|Liechtenstein garden palace]] (1707), an ''Admittance of Hercules to Olympus'', which, according to the sources, was very admired by contemporaries. Through illusionistic effects, the [[architectural painting]] starts unfolding at the border of the ceiling, while the ceiling seems to open up into a heavenly realm filled with [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] gods.\n\nSome of his Viennese altarpieces have also survived ([[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Vienna's Jesuit church]]). His compositions of altarpieces and illusory ceiling frescoes had a strong influence on the Baroque art in Vienna. He also had many followers in  Hungary, [[Bohemia]], Moravia, Slovakia and Poland. His canvases show him to be a far less compelling a painter at close inspection.\n\n===Death===\nPozzo died in Vienna in 1709 at a moment when he intended to return to Italy to design a new Jesuit church in Venice. He was buried with great honours in one of his best realisations, the Jesuit church in Vienna. [[Agostino Collaceroni]] was also a pupil.\n\n==Family==\nPozzo's brother, Giuseppe Pozzo, a [[Discalced Carmelite]] [[friar]] in Venice, was also a painter. He decorated the high altar of the church of the ''Scalzi'' in that city during the last years of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite book| first=Michael| last=Bryan| year=1889| title=''Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, Biographical and Critical'' (Volume II L-Z)| editor = Walter Armstrong & Robert Edmund Graves| publisher=George Bell and Sons|location=York St. #4, Covent Garden, London; Original from Fogg Library, Digitized May 18, 2007 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2cCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Michael+Bryan+Painters+Engravers#PPP7,M1|p=318}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and architecture==\nPozzo published his artistic ideas in a noted theoretical work, entitled ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'' (2 volumes, 1693, 1698) illustrated with 118 engravings, dedicated to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Leopold I]]. In it he offered instruction in painting [[architectural perspectives]] and stage-sets. The work was one of the earliest manuals on perspective for artists and architects and went into many editions, even into the 19th century, and has been translated from the original Latin and Italian into numerous languages such as French, German, English and, Chinese thanks to Pozzo's Jesuit connection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/rulesexamplesofp00pozz|title=Rules and examples of perspective proper for painters and architects, etc|last=Pozzo|first=Andrea|date=1724\u20131732|publisher=J Senex and R Gosling|access-date=2018-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThere are a few architectural designs in Pozzo's book ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'', indicating that he did not make any designs before 1690. These designs were not realized, but the design for the S. Apollinare church in Rome was used for the Jesuit church of San Francesco Saverio (1700\u20131702) in [[Trento]]. The interior of this church was equally designed by Pozzo.\n\nBetween 1701 and 1702, Pozzo designed the Jesuit churches of San Bernardo and [[Church of the Ges\u00f9, Montepulciano|Chiesa del Ges\u00f9]] in [[Montepulciano]], but his plans for the last church were only partly realized.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anamorphosis]]\n* [[Quadratura]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Burda-Stengel, Felix (2001).

His masterpiece is the nave ceiling of the Church of [[Sant'Ignazio]] in Rome. Through his techniques, he became one of the most noteworthy figures of the Baroque period. He is also noted for the architectural plans of  [[Ljubljana Cathedral]] (1700), inspired by the designs of the Jesuit churches [[Church of the Ges\u00f9|Il Ges\u00f9]] and S. Ignazio in Rome.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nBorn in [[Trento]] (then under Austrian rule), he studied [[Humanities]] at the local Jesuit High School. Showing artistic inclinations he was sent by his father to work with an artist; Pozzo was then 17 years old (in 1659). Judging by aspects of his early style this initial artistic training came probably from [[Palma il Giovane]]. After three years he came under the guidance of another unidentified painter from the workshop of [[Andrea Sacchi]] who appears to have taught him the techniques of Roman High Baroque. He would later travel to [[Como]] and [[Milan]].\n\n===As a Jesuit===\nOn 25 December 1665, he entered the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] as a lay brother. In 1668, he was assigned to the ''Casa Professa of San Fidele'' in [[Milan]], where his festival decorations in honour of [[Francis Borgia]] recently [[canonised]] (1671) met general approval. He continued artistic training in [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]]. His early paintings attest the influence of the [[Lombard School]]: rich colour, graphic [[chiaroscuro]]. When he painted in Genoa the ''Life of Jesus'' for the ''Congregazione de' Mercanti'', he was undoubtedly inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].\n\n===Early church decoration===\nPozzo's artistic activity was related to the Jesuit Order's enormous artistic needs; many Jesuit churches had been built in recent decades and were devoid of painted decoration. He was frequently employed by the Jesuits to decorate churches and buildings such as their churches of [[Modena]], [[Bologna]] and [[Arezzo]]. In 1676, he decorated the interior of San [[Francis Xavier]] church in [[Mondov\u00ec]]. In this church one can already see his later illusionistic techniques: fake gilding, bronze-coloured statues, marbled columns and a ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'' dome on a flat ceiling, peopled with foreshortened figures in architectural settings.  This was his first large [[fresco]].\n\nIn Turin (1678) Pozzo painted the ceiling of the Jesuit church of SS. Martiri. The frescoes gradually deteriorated through water infiltration. They were replaced in 1844 by new paintings by Luigi Vacca. Only fragments of the original frescoes survive.\n\n===Call to Rome===\nIn 1681, Pozzo was called to Rome by [[Giovanni Paolo Oliva]], Superior General of the [[Jesuits]]. Among others, Pozzo worked for [[Livio Odescalchi]], the powerful nephew of the pope, [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]]. Initially he was used as a stage designer for biblical pageants, but his illusionistic paintings in perspective for these stages soon gave him a reputation as a virtuoso in wall and ceiling decorations.\n\n====The Ges\u00f9 rooms====\nHis first Roman [[fresco]]es were in the corridor linking the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9]] to the rooms where [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] had lived.  His ''trompe-l'\u0153il'' architecture and paintings depicting the Saint's life for the ''Camere di San Ignazio'' (1681\u20131686), blended well with already existing paintings by [[Jacques Courtois|Giacomo Borgognone]].\n\n====The St Ignatius' Church====\n[[File:Andrea pozzo, gloria di sant'ignazio, 1685-94, 02.jpg|thumb|Andrea Pozzo's painted ceiling in the Church of St. Ignazio]]\nHis masterpiece, the illusory perspectives in frescoes of the dome,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060526214006/http://www.insecula.com/contact/A010775.html/</ref> the apse and the ceiling of Rome's Jesuit church of [[Sant'Ignazio]] were painted between 1685\u20131694 and are emblematic of the dramatic conceits of High Roman Baroque. For several generations, they set the standard for the decoration of Late Baroque ceiling frescos throughout Catholic Europe. Compare this work to [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli|Gaulli]]'s masterpiece in the other major Jesuit church in Rome, [[Ges\u00f9, Rome|Il Ges\u00f9]].\n\nThe church of Sant'Ignazio had remained unfinished with bare ceilings even after its consecration in 1642. Disputes with the original donors, the Ludovisi, had prevented the completion of the planned dome. Pozzo proposed to resolve this by creating the illusion of a dome, when viewed from inside, by painting on canvas. It was impressive to viewers, but controversial; some feared the canvas would soon darken.\n\nOn the flat ceiling he painted an allegory of the ''Apotheosis of S. Ignatius'', in breathtaking perspective. The painting, 17 m in diameter, is devised to make an observer, looking from a spot marked by a metal plate set into the floor of the nave,<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/775 775] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/775 }}</ref> seem to see a lofty vaulted roof decorated by statues, while in fact the ceiling is flat. The painting celebrates the apostolic goals of Jesuit missionaries, eager to expand the reach of Roman Catholicism in other continents. The [[Counter-Reformation]] also encouraged a militant Catholicism. For example, rather than placing the usual evangelists or scholarly pillars of doctrine in the pendentives, Pozzo depicted the victorious warriors of the old testament: ''[[Book of Judith|Judith]] and [[Holofernes]]''; ''David and Goliath''; ''[[Jael]] and [[Sisera]]''; and ''Samson and the Philistines''. It is said that when completed, some said \"Sant'Ignazio {{sic}} was a good place to buy meat, since four new butchers are now there.\"\n\n[[File:Sant'Ignazio - painted dome - antmoose.jpg|thumb|The illustionistic perspective of Pozzo's ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'' dome at Sant'Ignazio (1685) is revealed by viewing it from the opposite end]]\n\nIn the nave fresco, light comes from God the Father to the Son who transmits it to [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]], whence it breaks into four rays leading to the four continents. Pozzo explained that he illustrated the words of Christ in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]: ''I am come to send fire on the earth'', and the words of Ignatius: ''Go and set everything aflame''. A further ray illuminates the name of Jesus. The attention to movement within a large canvas with deep perspective in the scene, including a heavenly assembly whirling above, and the presence space-enlarging illusory architecture offered an example which was copied in several Italian, Austrian, German and Central European churches of the Jesuit order.\n\nThe architecture of the ''trompe-l'\u0153il'' dome seems to erase and raise the ceiling with such a realistic impression that it is difficult to distinguish what is real or not. Andrea Pozzo painted this ceiling and trompe-l'oeil dome on a canvas, 17 m wide. The paintings in the apse depict scenes from the life of St. Ignatius, St Francis Xavier and St Francis Borgia.\n\n====St Ignatius chapel (Ges\u00f9)====\nIn 1695 he was given the prestigious commission, after winning a competition against [[Sebastiano Cipriani]] and Giovanni Battista Origone, for an altar in the St. Ignatius chapel in the left transept of the Church of the Ges\u00f9. This grandiose altar above the tomb of the saint, built with rare marbles and precious metals, shows the [[Trinity]], while four [[lapis lazuli]] columns (these are now copies) enclose the colossal statue of the saint by [[Pierre Legros]]. It was the coordinated work of more than 100 sculptors and craftsmen, among them Pierre Legros, [[Bernardino Ludovisi]], Il Lorenzone and [[Jean-Baptiste Th\u00e9odon]]. Andrea Pozzo also designed the altar in the Chapel of St Francesco Borgia in the same church.\n\n====Altars in St Ignatius church====\nIn 1697 he was asked to build similar Baroque altars with scenes from the life of St Ignatius in the apse of the Sant'Ignazio church in Rome. These altars house the relics of St. [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] and of St. [[John Berchmans]].\n\n====Other works of art====\nMeanwhile he continued painting frescoes and illusory domes in [[Turin]], [[Mondov\u00ec]], [[Modena]], [[Montepulciano]] and [[Arezzo]]. In 1681 he was asked by [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] to paint his self-portrait for the ducal collection (now in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence). This oil on canvas has become a most original self-portrait. It shows the painter in a diagonal pose, showing with his right index finger his illusionist easel painting (a trompe-l'\u0153il dome, perhaps of the Badia church in Arezzo) while his left hand rests on three books (probably alluding to his not-yet published treatises on perspective). The painting was sent to the duke in 1688. He also painted scenes from the life of St [[Stanislaus Kostka]] in the saint's rooms of the Jesuit novitiate of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] in Rome.\n\n[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'\u0153il'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuit Church, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], Vienna, Austria]]\n===In Vienna===\nIn 1694 Andrea Pozzo had explained his illusory techniques in a letter to Anton Florian, Prince of [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] and ambassador of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] to the Papal Court in Rome. Recommended by Prince Liechtenstein to the emperor, Andrea Pozzo, on the invitation of Leopold I, moved in 1702 (1703?) to [[Vienna]]. There he worked for the sovereign, the court, Prince Johann Adam von Liechtenstein, and various religious orders and churches, such as the frescoes and the trompe-l'\u0153il dome in the [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]]. Some of his tasks were of a decorative, occasional character (church and theatre scenery), and these were soon destroyed.\n\nHis most significant surviving work in Vienna is the monumental ceiling fresco of the Hercules Hall of the [[Liechtenstein Museum#Liechtenstein Garden Palace|Liechtenstein garden palace]] (1707), an ''Admittance of Hercules to Olympus'', which, according to the sources, was very admired by contemporaries. Through illusionistic effects, the [[architectural painting]] starts unfolding at the border of the ceiling, while the ceiling seems to open up into a heavenly realm filled with [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] gods.\n\nSome of his Viennese altarpieces have also survived ([[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Vienna's Jesuit church]]). His compositions of altarpieces and illusory ceiling frescoes had a strong influence on the Baroque art in Vienna. He also had many followers in  Hungary, [[Bohemia]], Moravia, Slovakia and Poland. His canvases show him to be a far less compelling a painter at close inspection.\n\n===Death===\nPozzo died in Vienna in 1709 at a moment when he intended to return to Italy to design a new Jesuit church in Venice. He was buried with great honours in one of his best realisations, the Jesuit church in Vienna. [[Agostino Collaceroni]] was also a pupil.\n\n==Family==\nPozzo's brother, Giuseppe Pozzo, a [[Discalced Carmelite]] [[friar]] in Venice, was also a painter. He decorated the high altar of the church of the ''Scalzi'' in that city during the last years of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite book| first=Michael| last=Bryan| year=1889| title=''Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, Biographical and Critical'' (Volume II L-Z)| editor = Walter Armstrong & Robert Edmund Graves| publisher=George Bell and Sons|location=York St. #4, Covent Garden, London; Original from Fogg Library, Digitized May 18, 2007 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2cCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Michael+Bryan+Painters+Engravers#PPP7,M1|p=318}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and architecture==\nPozzo published his artistic ideas in a noted theoretical work, entitled ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'' (2 volumes, 1693, 1698) illustrated with 118 engravings, dedicated to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Leopold I]]. In it he offered instruction in painting [[architectural perspectives]] and stage-sets. The work was one of the earliest manuals on perspective for artists and architects and went into many editions, even into the 19th century, and has been translated from the original Latin and Italian into numerous languages such as French, German, English and, Chinese thanks to Pozzo's Jesuit connection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/rulesexamplesofp00pozz|title=Rules and examples of perspective proper for painters and architects, etc|last=Pozzo|first=Andrea|date=1724\u20131732|publisher=J Senex and R Gosling|access-date=2018-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThere are a few architectural designs in Pozzo's book ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'', indicating that he did not make any designs before 1690. These designs were not realized, but the design for the S. Apollinare church in Rome was used for the Jesuit church of San Francesco Saverio (1700\u20131702) in [[Trento]]. The interior of this church was equally designed by Pozzo.\n\nBetween 1701 and 1702, Pozzo designed the Jesuit churches of San Bernardo and [[Church of the Ges\u00f9, Montepulciano|Chiesa del Ges\u00f9]] in [[Montepulciano]], but his plans for the last church were only partly realized.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anamorphosis]]\n* [[Quadratura]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Burda-Stengel, Felix (2001).

Although only a small nation of 7 million people, and trying to ready itself for war.  The government gave very strong support to the [[appeasement]] policies of the Chamberlain government in London regarding Germany.

MacArthur worked very closely with the Australian government and took command of its combat operations. Fighting continued throughout [[Southeast Asia]] for the next two years. When the European war was declared over, Australia and the US still had a war to win against Japan.

Immigration acted as a catalyst. After the war, the [[Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Immigration Minister]], [[Arthur Calwell]], introduced an assisted immigration scheme with the slogan \"populate or perish\". The government was still trying to increase Australia's population, especially with people who have skills in the secondary industry sector. As the world was transforming into a more industrial and technological world, Australia needed to keep up.\n\nAustralia looked first to Britain for migrants. In the beginning the assisted immigration scheme was popular among young married couples and single people. It was inexpensive, an adventure and an opportunity. After only a year however, there was a shortage of ships and numbers dropped. The immigration targets were not being met. For the first time, in a revolutionary step for both Australian society and international relations, Australia looked outside Britain for migrants. In 1947, Arthur Calwell agreed to bring 12,000 people every year from [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]]. Many of these people were [[refugee]]s who were being cared for by the [[International Refugee Organisation]] (IRO). They were accepted on [[humanitarian]] grounds with the condition that they would remain in Australia for two years and work in government selected jobs.\n\nOver the next twenty years, patterns of immigration continued to change. The government encouraged more people to come to Australia and many more assisted agreements were made with countries. In the late 1950s, more immigrants began to be accepted from the [[Middle East]]. In 1958, under the Migration Act, the dictation test was removed and a new scheme of entry permits was introduced. This allowed many non-Europeans to emigrate. Their entry was now based on what they could contribute to Australia and if it could be shown that they could integrate into Australian society. This attracted many professionals and highly qualified people who added to Australia's relatively small [[tertiary industry]].\n\nChanging global opinions in the late 20th century resulted in particular hostility to the [[White Australia policy]], which was still in effect. This was eventually disbanded, and since then Australia has received a steady increase in migrants from [[Asians|Asia]] and around the world through its controversial policy of '[[multiculturalism]]'.\n\n==Communism and the Cold War era==\nAlthough the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and the United States co-operated during World War II, the tensions between the two superpowers over economics (Communism versus capitalism), political authority (totalitarianism versus liberalism) and the fate of Europe (East versus West) escalated into the [[Cold War]] by 1947. Australia unequivocally stood on the American side and the Cold War became the preponderant influence on Australian foreign policy.<ref>David McLean, \"From British colony to American satellite? Australia and the USA during the cold war.\" ''Australian Journal of Politics & History'' (2006) 52#1 pp: 64-79.</ref>\n\n<ref>Peter Geoffrey Edwards and Gregory Pemberton, ''Crises and Commitments: The Politics and Diplomacy of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948-1965'' (Allen & Unwin in association with the Australian War Memorial, 1992)</ref>\n\nAs the international community polarised into opposing blocs, led by the respective superpowers, Australia too moved to strengthen its alliance with the USA. Along with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]], Australia was a main ally of the US in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.<ref>Ritchie Ovendale, ''The English-Speaking Alliance: Britain, the United States, the Dominions and the Cold War 1945-1951'' (Routledge, 1985).</ref> China (after 1949) and North Vietnam (after 1954) supported the USSR. The Asian nations were commonly regarded with suspicion. Memories from WWII reinforced the fear and want for security from Asia. After the Communist Revolution of China in 1949 and the [[North Korea]]n infiltration of South Korea in 1950, Australia's foreign policy was influenced by growing concern over communist aggression. Australia increasingly looked to the US, as its new \"great and powerful friend\" for help to contain and fight communism. The Menzies government made a great effort of linking Australia to US foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region. Two major alliance agreements were made between members of the Western Bloc in the 1950s: [[ANZUS]], an agreement for aid in the event of an attack between Australia, [[New Zealand]] and the US and [[SEATO]], an agreement guaranteeing defensive action in the event of an attack against the US, Australia, Great Britain, France, New Zealand, [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], and [[South Vietnam]].\n\n===Vietnam War===\nWhen communist [[North Vietnam]] infiltrated South Vietnam, the Western Bloc viewed it as a fundamental step in what could result in the communist subjugation of the democratic world. In a country gripped by this fear, the government's defence policy was dominated by the idea of \"forward defence\", in which Australia would seek to prevent the Communist \"thrust into South-East Asia\". The committal of troops to the [[Vietnam War]] was viewed as an attempt by the Menzies Government to strengthen the alliance with the USA following Great Britain's withdrawal \"east of Suez\".\n\nWith his arrival in October 1966, [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] became the first [[President of the United States|US President]] to visit Australia. The visit came in the light of increasing international criticism over the war in Vietnam.<ref>James Curran, \"Beyond the Euphoria: Lyndon Johnson in Australia and the Politics of the Cold War Alliance.\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (2015).</ref> The majority of Australians seemed to support the war, obvious from the return of the Liberal/Country Party in late 1966. Many Australians were however protesting against the war. They wondered why we had followed the United States into a war that they thought had nothing to do with them and were concerned at our apt readiness to fall in line with American foreign policy. The slogan used by Harold Holt - \"All the way with L.B.J.\" - clearly demonstrates this partnership which perhaps could be considered rather inequitable and profitable for the US. They were tired of military solutions and \"power politics\", and as one Labor politician said, \"tired of anti-communism as a substitute for common sense.\" By 1970, the anti-war sentiment in the society had exploded into huge rallies, church services and candlelight processions. The moratorium movement represented a great range of people's opinions, from young political radicals to people who would not normally challenge government decisions and from mothers of conscripted men to prominent politicians, writers, academics, artists and church leaders.<ref>Peter Geoffrey Edwards, ''A Nation at War: Australian Politics, society and diplomacy during the Vietnam War 1965-1975'' (Allen & Unwin, 1997)</ref>\n\nThe intensity of conflict in Australia over this issue contributed to the 1972 election of the first Labor government in 23 years. The new Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]] immediately abolished conscription and withdrew troops from Vietnam. The US Signed a peace treaty for Vietnam in 1973, after withdrawing all of its troops in 1972. South Vietnam, however, was invaded and overwhelmed by North Vietnam in 1975.\n\n===D\u00e9tente with communism===\n\nThe Whitlam government, a new type of Labor government, developed a general opposition to the US and especially President Nixon who they viewed as especially conservative and paranoid.<ref>R. Catley,  \"Australia and the great powers 1933\u201383.\" ''Australian Journal of International Affairs'' 37.3 (1983): 143-149.</ref>  Whitlam announced that Australia was not automatically going to follow US defence policy any more and this annoyed the United States Government. In late 1972, when Nixon bombed North Vietnam, the controversial Tom Uren and two other left-wing politicians publicly attacked Nixon, resulting in an immediate halt in Australian/American cooperation. Instead Whitlam reached out to our geographically nearer neighbours, Asia. He eliminated the last remaining remnants of the [[White Australia Policy]] and introduced a new quota/permit system. With race no longer a barrier, substantial immigration from Asia began, especially from Vietnam. This immigration provided impetuous for the swing in Australia's foreign policy from the US to Asia and increased Australia's trade relations with Asia. In 1973, the People's Republic of China was officially recognised as the \"real\" China and it was realised that the move towards a more open political and trading relationship with China was a priority. Dr Stephen Fitzgerald was appointed as the first Australian ambassador to the People's Republic of China and Australian understanding and appreciation of China's history and culture was encouraged. The Whitlam government was leaving behind the racist \"yellow peril\" past and was poised for the move towards a multicultural Australia.\n\n==Recent developments==\nThis focus of multiculturalism and a focus on Asia in our foreign policy was not lost with the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975; contact and understanding continued to grow during the following decade.<ref>Neville Meaney,  \"The end of \u2018white Australia\u2019and Australia's changing perceptions of Asia, 1945\u20131990.\" ''Australian Journal of International Affairs'' (1995) 49#2 pp: 171-189.</ref> Relationships with China continued to develop until the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]].

Whitlam did not object to the invasion of [[Portuguese Timor]] by Indonesian troops in 1975 because maintaining good diplomatic relations with Indonesia was considered the highest priority at the time. The government could only express regret for the Timorese people as they were not prepared to go to war. Hawke and especially Keating also supported Indonesia despite their continuing maltreatment of the East Timorese people. When John Howard was elected in 1996, he saw the opportunity to distinguish himself from the previous Labor approach to the East Timor conflict. Immediately he sent peacekeeping forces into East Timor and advocated Australia's support for their independence. The role of this support of an essentially Christian country against a Muslim nation was detrimental to Australia's reputation with other Muslim countries.<ref>Gareth J.

With race no longer a barrier, substantial immigration from Asia began, especially from Vietnam. This immigration provided impetuous for the swing in Australia's foreign policy from the US to Asia and increased Australia's trade relations with Asia. In 1973, the People's Republic of China was officially recognised as the \"real\" China and it was realised that the move towards a more open political and trading relationship with China was a priority. Dr Stephen Fitzgerald was appointed as the first Australian ambassador to the People's Republic of China and Australian understanding and appreciation of China's history and culture was encouraged. The Whitlam government was leaving behind the racist \"yellow peril\" past and was poised for the move towards a multicultural Australia.\n\n==Recent developments==\nThis focus of multiculturalism and a focus on Asia in our foreign policy was not lost with the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975; contact and understanding continued to grow during the following decade.<ref>Neville Meaney,  \"The end of \u2018white Australia\u2019and Australia's changing perceptions of Asia, 1945\u20131990.\" ''Australian Journal of International Affairs'' (1995) 49#2 pp: 171-189.</ref> Relationships with China continued to develop until the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]]. Along with many other nations, Australia ceased diplomatic and trade relations with China for the next two years.<ref>Kaushik Kapisthalam,  \"Australia and Asia's rise.\" ''Australian Journal of International Affairs'' (2006) 60#3 pp: 369-375.</ref>\n\nAnother nation with which Australia had a developing relationship was Indonesia. Whitlam did not object to the invasion of [[Portuguese Timor]] by Indonesian troops in 1975 because maintaining good diplomatic relations with Indonesia was considered the highest priority at the time. The government could only express regret for the Timorese people as they were not prepared to go to war. Hawke and especially Keating also supported Indonesia despite their continuing maltreatment of the East Timorese people. When John Howard was elected in 1996, he saw the opportunity to distinguish himself from the previous Labor approach to the East Timor conflict. Immediately he sent peacekeeping forces into East Timor and advocated Australia's support for their independence. The role of this support of an essentially Christian country against a Muslim nation was detrimental to Australia's reputation with other Muslim countries.<ref>Gareth J.
