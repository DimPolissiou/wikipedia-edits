It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa.

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most politically and economically powerful polities in eastern Indonesia. The twin kingdoms' attempt to retain their hegemony brought them to a conflict with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), which wanted to monopolize the [[spice trade]] in the [[Moluccas]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=45\u201347}} In 1660, the Dutch attacked Gowa and managed to seize the fort of Paqnakkukang.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=49}} Gowa then forced its vassals to provide labor to build military constructions in anticipation of further conflict, which ultimately resulted in a rebellion led by the Bon\u00e9 noble [[Arung Palakka]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=50\u201352}} However, his attempt to revive the ''Tellumpocco'' alliance failed, as Wajoq refused to break its treaty with Gowa to join forces with the rebels.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=54}}<!-- According to the historian [[Leonard Andaya]], Wajoq's decision can be explained by the fact that its recent experiences with Gowa were much more positive than those with Bon\u00e9.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}} In the most recent memory of the Wajorese, it was Bon\u00e9, not Gowa, which invaded their country.

It can also switch allegiance between different states, and by doing so, both its people and its territory will be subject to the new state.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}\n\nThe paramount ruler of Wajoq was titled ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}} The ''arung matoa'' was chosen among the \"white-blood\" or nobility class. The position of arung matoa cannot be held at once with another office. It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nIn running the day-to-day administration of Wajoq, the ''arung matoa'' was assisted by three pairs of civilian and military leaders, each pair representing one of the three ''limpo''.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} The civilian leader of a ''limpo'' was called a ''ranreng'' or regent, while the military leader was called a ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' (lit. \"great banner\") or standard bearer.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}} The titles of the ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were taken from the banner they carried: ''Pilla'' or \"Scarlet\" for B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, ''Patola'' or \"Multi-colored\" for Talotenreng, and ''Cakkuridi'' or \"Yellow\" for Tua.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=485}} Each of the ''ranreng'' and  ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were at least as powerful as the ''arung matoa''; together, these seven officials formed the state's highest governing body, known as ''Petta Wajoq''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}} The power of ''Arung Patampulu'', in turn, was balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} These ''punggawa'' had considerable power.

These commoners may discuss and give input to the government on the best way to resolve these issues, although the ultimate decision in this kind of situations rested in the hands of ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=246}}\n<!--\n- Diaspora governmental structure (focus on Borneo and Makassar)...\n-->\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Bugis people}}\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nWajorese texts often reiterate that \"the people of Wajoq are free\", and that their only master is the customary law, which is based on consensus. The concept of the \"freedoms of Wajoq\" included, among others: [[freedom of speech|freedom of expressing opinions]], freedom to act based on one's intention, [[freedom of movement]], [[freedom of contract]], and the freedom from unjust punishment.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=148}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=481}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=433, 447\u2013448}} These \"freedoms\", however, had limitations and do not necessarily apply to the whole population.\n\nBugis women in the precolonial states of South Sulawesi were routinely involved in many aspects of the society. Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

The term 'torus' was derived due to the biconcave disk and C-shape of the virion in the extracellular environment. Due to genetic similarities and replication behavior, in 1992, the Torovirus has been included in the Coronaviridae family. Various envelope genes and the enzymes like polymerase in the Toroviruses and Coronaviruses can be ancestrally related to the common predecessor. Hence the nomenclature of the Torovirus constituents like proteins and mRNAs and other structures has been derived from the family Coronaviridae. However, varying structural components and diversity in the molecular sequences in genomes of Torovirus put them in a separate genus. Currently, the [[international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) recognize four species in the genus Torovirus, namely EToV, BToV, PToV, and HToV. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157456/#s0015title</ref>\n\n==Clinical signs and diagnosis==\nIn cattle, the disease causes [[diarrhoea]] and systemic signs such as [[pyrexia]], [[lethargy]] and anorexia.

Currently, the [[international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) recognize four species in the genus Torovirus, namely EToV, BToV, PToV, and HToV. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157456/#s0015title</ref>\n\n==Clinical signs and diagnosis==\nIn cattle, the disease causes [[diarrhoea]] and systemic signs such as [[pyrexia]], [[lethargy]] and anorexia. In calves, it may cause neurological signs and lead to death.\n\nPigs can be infected without showing any signs.\n\nDiagnosis of the viral infection involves [[electron microscopy]], [[ELISA]] or [[Hemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] inhibition.\n\n==Treatment and control==\nSupportive treatment may be given to prevent [[dehydration]] and secondary infections.\n\nControl relies on good [[biosecurity]] measures including prompt [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] and [[disinfection]] of premises.\n\n==Evolution==\nPorcine torovirus evolved ~1951.<ref name=Cong2013>Cong Y, Zarlenga DS, Richt JA, Wang X, Wang Y, Suo S, Wang J, Ren Y, Ren X (2013) Evolution and homologous recombination of the hemagglutinin-esterase gene sequences from porcine torovirus. Virus Genes</ref> Most of the strains appear to fall into two distinct clades.\n\n==History==\nIn 1972, a virus was isolated from a horse in Berne, Switzerland. The virus did not react with antisera against known equine viruses and was shown to have a unique morphology and substructure.<ref name=\"pmid6886677\">{{cite journal\n| vauthors = Weiss M, Steck F, Horzinek MC\n| title = Purification and partial characterization of a new enveloped RNA virus (Berne virus)\n| journal = J.

Early press releases for the album reveal that its working title was ''Danzig 7: Kiss the Skull''.\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\nThe CD booklet contains a quotation from [[Celsus]], a second-century AD opponent of Christianity: \"They worship neither a god nor even a demon, but a dead man!\"\n\nPorn star [[Devon (actress)|Devon]] appears in the CD booklet and on the back of the CD jacket.\n\nThe lyric sheet for the song \"Black Mass\" contains a misprint: \"Asan un Nefer\".

The correct missing lyric is \"five-pointed star-tail\": as the lyric is repeated at one point in the video for the song, the camera focuses on the tail/chain of a girl's cat costume; at the end of the chain is a [[pentagram]].\n\n==Reception==\n* ''[[Allmusic]]'' \u2013 \"Uneven as ''I Luciferi'' is, it's a quite listenable and welcome return to truly metallic form for Glenn Danzig...Sure, his best years are most likely behind him at this point, but ''I Luciferi'' proves that this old snake still has some venom left in his fangs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r588643|pure_url=yes}}|title=I Luciferi|last=Serba|first=John|website=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n* ''Punknews.org'' \u2013 \"This album is extremely dark and heavy, as you might expect...The best thing about this album is that it is devoid of filler, the hard smacks just keep coming and don't stop 'till the end.\"<ref name=\"Punknews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/1004|title=Danzig 777: I Luciferi|last=Sideleau|first=Brandon|date=June 14, 2002|publisher=Punknews.org|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n* ''[[LA Weekly]]'' \u2013 \"Controlled, relentless darkness and passion.
