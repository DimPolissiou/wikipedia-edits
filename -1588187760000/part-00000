Woody came to Cheers at the beginning of the fourth season of ''Cheers'' in 1985 in the episode \"Birth, Death, Love and Rice\".\n\nWoody appeared in 200 episodes of ''Cheers'' between 1985 and 1993.  He also made a guest appearance on ''[[Frasier]]'' in the episode \"[[The Show Where Woody Shows Up]]\". He is portrayed as simple-minded but good-hearted.\n\n==''Cheers''==\nWoody was born on July 23 (like the actor who played him) and hails from [[Hanover, Indiana]], where he was voted the smartest student in school. His mother's name was Margaret and his father's name is Edgel.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Suspicion |episode-link= |url= |access-date=April 19, 2018 |series=Cheers |series-link=Cheers |first=Tom |last=Reeder |network=[[NBC]] |station= |date=January 16, 1986 |season=4 |series-no= |number=14 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote=My mother's name's Margaret and my father's name's Edgel. |language=}}</ref>\n\nHe and his childhood sweetheart, Beth Curtis, were also voted \"Couple Most Likely to Explode,\" as they were both obese at the time.

Woody was essentially a [[Double act|straight man]] for all of the other characters at Cheers, though his humor stemmed from his misunderstandings.\n\nWoody seemed to have an off-center mentality, misunderstanding others' comments much as Coach had done. For example, when [[Bill Medley]] of [[The Righteous Brothers]] appears and starts singing \"[[You've Lost That Loving Feeling]],\" Woody asks him, \"How come you changed your name from Righteous?\" With the exception of Carla, Eddie, and Sam, Woody always addresses other characters by their [[honorific]]. Sometimes this leads to awkward phrasing such as referring to Lilith as Mrs. Dr. Sternin-Crane.\n\nWoody arrived at Cheers expecting to meet his \"pen pal\" Coach, with whom he exchanged pens instead of letters. Upon learning of Coach's death, he filled the open bartender position, and was quickly accepted by the staff and regulars. He also developed a \"big brother/little brother\" relationship with [[Sam Malone]], the owner of Cheers. In the coming years, he filled the void left by Coach and eventually married the wealthy Kelly Gaines ([[Jackie Swanson]]), overcoming her father's objections to Woody's lowly station in life as well as conflicting religious views: he's [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], she's [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|\"Evangelical Lutheran Church of America\"]] (The episode uses \"of\" but the denomination is \"in America\").\n\nIn the final season, [[Frasier Crane]] orchestrated an experiment that went awry and resulted in Woody's election to the Boston City Council. He and Kelly were expecting their first child when ''Cheers'' ended. Frasier extrapolates on Woody's interest in a political career to the point that Woody becomes President of the United States and shows his displeasure with another country by using [[nuclear weaponry|\"The Bomb\"]] (illustrated twice in Frasier's imagination as a [[mushroom cloud]]).\n\n==In other appearances==\nWoody Harrelson reprised his role in the 1990 [[Walt Disney anthology television series]] episode ''Disneyland 35th Anniversary Celebration'',<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1990 |title=Television Guide, Volume 38 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9GDvAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Disneyland+35th+Anniversary+Celebration%22+woody+-wikipedia&dq=%22Disneyland+35th+Anniversary+Celebration%22+woody+-wikipedia |location= |publisher=[[Triangle Publications]] |page=88 |isbn= |author-link= |access-date=June 28, 2017}}</ref> where his young self in a flashback is played by Branden Maciel.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Cotter |year=1997 |title=The Wonderful World of Disney Television: A Complete History |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AA5mAAAAMAAJ&dq=Disneyland+35th+Anniversary+woody+harrelson+-wikipedia&q=woody+harrelson+-Wikipedia |publisher=Disney Editions |isbn=978-0786863594 |accessdate=June 28, 2017 }}</ref> The character also appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]\".<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season6/page11.shtml|title=Fear of Flying|accessdate=August 17, 2010|first1=Warren |last1=Martyn |first2=Adrian |last2=Wood |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==''Frasier''==\nWoody makes a guest appearance on ''[[Frasier]]'', the spin-off show from ''Cheers'', in the season 6 episode \"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\".

After a one-night reunion, the two begin to spend a great deal of time with each other \u2013 which gradually turns into an ordeal for both, as they quickly realize they have moved on from their past and settled into new lives, with neither man seeing the other's life as being particularly fulfilling. The two men decide to part company on good terms, after sharing a final drink with each other, leading Woody to utter his final line: \"Cheers\".\n\nAlthough this is Woody's only appearance on the show, he is referenced both prior to and after this. When Sam visits Frasier in the season 2 episode, \"The Show Where Sam Comes Back\", he reveals that Kelly and Woody's first child was a boy, who is of normal intelligence. In the season 9 episode \"Cheerful Goodbyes,\" Frasier reveals that at his going-away party at Cheers before returning to Seattle, Woody grabbed onto his legs and begged him not to go.

It is the second installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as the title character. After arriving in [[India]], [[Indiana Jones]] is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a [[Thuggee]] cult practicing [[child slavery]], [[black magic]] and ritualistic [[human sacrifice]] in honor of the goddess [[Kali]].\n\nNot wishing to feature the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] as the villains again, [[George Lucas]], executive producer and co-writer, decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three [[plot device]]s were rejected before Lucas wrote a [[film treatment]] that resembled the final storyline. [[Lawrence Kasdan]], Lucas' collaborator on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', turned down the offer to write the script, and [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]] were hired as his replacements, who had previously worked with Lucas. The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its dark tone. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13]] rating.<ref name=Parker />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

With his eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the [[Himalayas]]. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover the sabotage and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft just before it crashes into the mountainside. They ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern [[British Raj|India]]. The impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by [[Shiva]] to retrieve the sacred [[lingam]] stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\n\nThe trio receives a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay for the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young [[Maharaja]], Zalim Singh. Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient [[Thuggee]] cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is wrong. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.\n\nThe trio reaches an underground temple where the Thuggees worship [[Kali]] with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thuggees chain one of their victims in a cage, and the high priest Mola Ram uses his evil magic to rip out the victim's still-beating heart. While the victim is still alive, he is slowly lowered into a lava pit, burning him alive, with his heart held in Mola Ram's hand burning as well. They discover that Mola Ram (who has plans for world domination) and the Thuggees are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, which were hidden in the catacombs by a Thuggee priest when the British raided their temple to put an end to their activities, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two, as well as to mine jewels to fund their operations. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is [[Flagellation|whipped]] and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, causing him to enter a trance-like state and mindlessly serve the Thuggees. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple, where he burns Indy with a torch to bring him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes via a trapdoor under the Sankara stones' altar. Indy retrieves the stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, Singh\u2014also under Mola Ram's control\u2014tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a steamroller. Singh then tells Shorty how to get out of the mine.\n\nThe trio escape from the temple in a minecart, pursued by Thuggees, while Mola Ram orders a huge water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again ambushed by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge in half with a sword, leaving them to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of [[Shiva]] by proclaiming him to be a traitor, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to be devoured alive by the crocodiles below. Losing two, Indy catches the last stone safely and climbs up just as a company of [[British Indian Army]] riflemen, summoned by Singh, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot Indy. Gaining the upper hand, the British Indian army quickly dispatches the Thuggees and forces them to flee. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children.

It is the second installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as the title character. After arriving in [[India]], [[Indiana Jones]] is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a [[Thuggee]] cult practicing [[child slavery]], [[black magic]] and ritualistic [[human sacrifice]] in honor of the goddess [[Kali]].\n\nNot wishing to feature the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] as the villains again, [[George Lucas]], executive producer and co-writer, decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three [[plot device]]s were rejected before Lucas wrote a [[film treatment]] that resembled the final storyline. [[Lawrence Kasdan]], Lucas' collaborator on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', turned down the offer to write the script, and [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]] were hired as his replacements, who had previously worked with Lucas. The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its dark tone. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13]] rating.<ref name=Parker />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

With his eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the [[Himalayas]]. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover the sabotage and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft just before it crashes into the mountainside. They ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern [[British Raj|India]]. The impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by [[Shiva]] to retrieve the sacred [[lingam]] stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\n\nThe trio receives a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay for the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young [[Maharaja]], Zalim Singh. Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient [[Thuggee]] cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is wrong. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.\n\nThe trio reaches an underground temple where the Thuggees worship [[Kali]] with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thuggees chain one of their victims in a cage, and the high priest Mola Ram uses his evil magic to rip out the victim's still-beating heart. While the victim is still alive, he is slowly lowered into a lava pit, burning him alive, with his heart held in Mola Ram's hand burning as well. They discover that Mola Ram, who has plans for world domination, and the Thuggees are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, which were hidden in the catacombs by a priest when the British raided their temple, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two, as well as to mine jewels to fund their operations. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is [[Flagellation|whipped]] and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, causing him to enter a trance-like state and mindlessly serve the Thuggees. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple, where he burns Indy with a torch to bring him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes via a trapdoor under the Sankara stones' altar. Indy retrieves the stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, Singh\u2014also under Mola Ram's control\u2014tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a steamroller. Singh then tells Shorty how to get out of the mine.\n\nThe trio escape from the temple in a minecart, pursued by Thuggees, while Mola Ram orders a huge water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again ambushed by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge in half with a sword, leaving them to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of [[Shiva]] by proclaiming him to be a traitor, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to be devoured alive by the crocodiles below. Losing two, Indy catches the last stone safely and climbs up just as a company of [[British Indian Army]] riflemen, summoned by Singh, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot Indy. Gaining the upper hand, the British army has them surrounded forcing the Thuggee to surrender. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children.

Capshaw learned to sing in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and took [[tap dance]] lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw was not able to dance in it. Made by [[Barbara Matera (costume designer)|Barbara Matera]] out of original 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an [[elephant]] had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was [[costume design]]er [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] who had to fill in the insurance forms.

However, there have been more than one of these dresses on display at the same time in different countries, so this story cannot be entirely true - from late 2014, a dress was on display at the Hollywood Costume exhibition in Los Angeles (exhibition ran from October 2, 2014 - March 2, 2015). At the very same time, the travelling \"Indiana Jones: Adventure of Archaeology\" exhibition was on display in Edmonton in Canada (October 11, 2014 - April 6, 2015) and there featured another of the red & gold dresses.

AES is a variant of Rijndael, with a fixed [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 [[bit]]s, and a [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, Rijndael ''per se'' is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.\n\nAES operates on a 4 \u00d7 4 [[column-major order]] array of bytes, termed the ''state''.<ref group=\"note\">Large-block variants of Rijndael use an array with additional columns, but always four rows.</ref> Most AES calculations are done in a particular [[Finite field arithmetic|finite field]].\n\nFor instance, if there are 16 bytes, <math>b_0, b_1, ..., b_{15}</math>, these bytes are represented as this two-dimensional array:\n::<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_0 & b_4 & b_8 & b_{12} \\\\\nb_1 & b_5 & b_9 & b_{13} \\\\\nb_2 & b_6 & b_{10} & b_{14} \\\\\nb_3 & b_7 & b_{11} & b_{15}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of transformation rounds that convert the input, called the [[plaintext]], into the final output, called the [[ciphertext]]. The number of rounds are as follows:\n\n* 10 rounds for 128-bit keys.\n* 12 rounds for 192-bit keys.\n* 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.\n\nEach round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key itself. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.\n\n=== High-level description of the algorithm ===\n\n# {{mono | KeyExpansion}}\u2014round keys are derived from the cipher key using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]. AES requires a separate Darien Bejleri \n128-bit round key block for each round plus one more.\n# Initial round key addition:\n## {{mono | AddRoundKey}}\u2014each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round key using [[bitwise xor]].\n# 9, 11 or 13 rounds:\n## {{mono | SubBytes}}\u2014a [[linear map|non-linear]] substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a [[Rijndael S-box|lookup table]].\n## {{mono | ShiftRows}}\u2014a transposition step where the last three rows of the state are shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.\n## {{mono | MixColumns}}\u2014a linear mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.\n## {{mono | AddRoundKey}}\n# Final round (making 10, 12 or 14 rounds in total):\n## {{mono | SubBytes}}\n## {{mono | ShiftRows}}\n## {{mono | AddRoundKey}}\n\n=== The {{mono | SubBytes}} step ===\n{{Main|Rijndael S-box}}\n[[Image:AES-SubBytes.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | SubBytes}} step, each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in a fixed 8-bit lookup table, ''S''; ''b<sub>ij</sub>'' = ''S(a<sub>ij</sub>)''.]]\nIn the {{mono | SubBytes}} step, each byte <math>a_{i,j}</math> in the ''state'' array is replaced with a {{mono | SubByte}} <math>S(a_{i,j})</math> using an 8-bit [[substitution box]]. This operation provides the non-linearity in the [[cipher]]. The S-box used is derived from the [[multiplicative inverse]] over {{math|[[Finite field|GF]](2<sup>8</sup>)}}, known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible [[affine transformation]]. The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a [[derangement]]), i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) \\neq a_{i,j} </math>, and also any opposite fixed points, i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) \\oplus a_{i,j} \\neq \\text{FF}_{16} </math>.\nWhile performing the decryption, the {{mono | InvSubBytes}} step (the inverse of {{mono | SubBytes}}) is used, which requires first taking the inverse of the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse.\n\n=== The {{mono | ShiftRows}} step ===\n[[Image:AES-ShiftRows.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | ShiftRows}} step, bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left. The number of places each byte is shifted differs incrementally for each row.]]\nThe {{mono | ShiftRows}} step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain [[Offset (computer science)|offset]]. For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively.<ref group=\"note\">Rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets. For blocks of sizes 128 bits and 192 bits, the shifting pattern is the same. Row <math>n</math> is shifted left circular by <math>n-1</math> bytes.  For a 256-bit block, the first row is unchanged and the shifting for the second, third and fourth row is 1 byte, 3 bytes and 4 bytes respectively\u2014this change only applies for the Rijndael cipher when used with a 256-bit block, as AES does not use 256-bit blocks.</ref> In this way, each column of the output state of the {{mono | ShiftRows}} step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. The importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES degenerates into four independent block ciphers.\n\n=== The {{mono | MixColumns}} step ===\n{{main|Rijndael MixColumns}}\n[[Image:AES-MixColumns.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | MixColumns}} step, each column of the state is multiplied with a fixed polynomial <math>c(x)</math>.]]\nIn the {{mono | MixColumns}} step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible [[linear transformation]]. The {{mono | MixColumns}} function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes. Together with {{mono | ShiftRows}}, {{mono | MixColumns}} provides [[diffusion (cryptography)|diffusion]] in the cipher.\n\nDuring this operation, each column is transformed using a fixed matrix (matrix left-multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state):\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_{0,j} \\\\ b_{1,j} \\\\ b_{2,j} \\\\ b_{3,j}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n3 & 1 & 1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{0,j} \\\\ a_{1,j} \\\\ a_{2,j} \\\\ a_{3,j}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad 0 \\le j \\le 3\n</math>\n\nMatrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries. Entries are 8-bit bytes treated as coefficients of polynomial of order <math>x^7</math>. Addition is simply XOR. Multiplication is modulo irreducible polynomial <math>x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1</math>. If processed bit by bit, then, after shifting, a conditional [[Exclusive or|XOR]] with 1B<sub>16</sub> should be performed if the shifted value is larger than FF<sub>16</sub> (overflow must be corrected by subtraction of generating polynomial). These are special cases of the usual multiplication in <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math>.\n\nIn more general sense, each column is treated as a polynomial over <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math> and is then multiplied modulo <math>{01}_{16} \\cdot z^4+{01}_{16}</math> with a fixed polynomial <math>c(z) = {03}_{16} \\cdot z^3 + {01}_{16} \\cdot z^2 +{01}_{16} \\cdot z + {02}_{16}</math>. The coefficients are displayed in their [[hexadecimal]] equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2)[x]</math>. The {{mono | MixColumns}} step can also be viewed as a multiplication by the shown particular [[MDS matrix]] in the [[finite field]] <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math>. This process is described further in the article [[Rijndael MixColumns]].\n\n=== The {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step ===\n[[Image:AES-AddRoundKey.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step, each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round subkey using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation (\u2295).]]\nIn the {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main [[key (cryptography)|key]] using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]; each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise [[Exclusive or|XOR]].\n\n=== Optimization of the cipher ===\nOn systems with 32-bit or larger words, it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by combining the {{mono | SubBytes}} and {{mono | ShiftRows}} steps with the {{mono | MixColumns}} step by transforming them into a sequence of table lookups. This requires four 256-entry 32-bit tables (together occupying 4096 bytes).  A round can then be performed with 16 table lookup operations and 12 32-bit exclusive-or operations, followed by four 32-bit exclusive-or operations in the {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2F3-540-36400-5_13 \"Efficient software implementation of AES on 32-bit platforms\".] Lecture Notes in Computer Science: 2523. 2003</ref>  Alternatively, the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256-entry 32-bit table (occupying 1024 bytes) followed by circular rotation operations.\n\nUsing a byte-oriented approach, it is possible to combine the {{mono | SubBytes}}, {{mono | ShiftRows}}, and {{mono | MixColumns}} steps into a single round operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes |title=byte-oriented-aes \u2013 A public domain byte-oriented implementation of AES in C \u2013 Google Project Hosting |accessdate=2012-12-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720155538/http://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes/ |archivedate=2013-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nThe [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data.

AES is a variant of Rijndael, with a fixed [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 [[bit]]s, and a [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, Rijndael ''per se'' is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.\n\nAES operates on a 4 \u00d7 4 [[column-major order]] array of bytes, termed the ''state''.<ref group=\"note\">Large-block variants of Rijndael use an array with additional columns, but always four rows.</ref> Most AES calculations are done in a particular [[Finite field arithmetic|finite field]].\n\nFor instance, if there are 16 bytes, <math>b_0, b_1, ..., b_{15}</math>, these bytes are represented as this two-dimensional array:\n::<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_0 & b_4 & b_8 & b_{12} \\\\\nb_1 & b_5 & b_9 & b_{13} \\\\\nb_2 & b_6 & b_{10} & b_{14} \\\\\nb_3 & b_7 & b_{11} & b_{15}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of transformation rounds that convert the input, called the [[plaintext]], into the final output, called the [[ciphertext]]. The number of rounds are as follows:\n\n* 10 rounds for 128-bit keys.\n* 12 rounds for 192-bit keys.\n* 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.\n\nEach round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key itself. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.\n\n=== High-level description of the algorithm ===\n\n# {{mono | KeyExpansion}}\u2014round keys are derived from the cipher key using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]. AES requires a separate 128-bit round key block for each round plus one more.\n# Initial round key addition:\n## {{mono | AddRoundKey}}\u2014each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round key using [[bitwise xor]].\n# 9, 11 or 13 rounds:\n## {{mono | SubBytes}}\u2014a [[linear map|non-linear]] substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a [[Rijndael S-box|lookup table]].\n## {{mono | ShiftRows}}\u2014a transposition step where the last three rows of the state are shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.\n## {{mono | MixColumns}}\u2014a linear mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.\n## {{mono | AddRoundKey}}\n# Final round (making 10, 12 or 14 rounds in total):\n## {{mono | SubBytes}}\n## {{mono | ShiftRows}}\n## {{mono | AddRoundKey}}\n\n=== The {{mono | SubBytes}} step ===\n{{Main|Rijndael S-box}}\n[[Image:AES-SubBytes.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | SubBytes}} step, each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in a fixed 8-bit lookup table, ''S''; ''b<sub>ij</sub>'' = ''S(a<sub>ij</sub>)''.]]\nIn the {{mono | SubBytes}} step, each byte <math>a_{i,j}</math> in the ''state'' array is replaced with a {{mono | SubByte}} <math>S(a_{i,j})</math> using an 8-bit [[substitution box]]. This operation provides the non-linearity in the [[cipher]]. The S-box used is derived from the [[multiplicative inverse]] over {{math|[[Finite field|GF]](2<sup>8</sup>)}}, known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible [[affine transformation]]. The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a [[derangement]]), i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) \\neq a_{i,j} </math>, and also any opposite fixed points, i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) \\oplus a_{i,j} \\neq \\text{FF}_{16} </math>.\nWhile performing the decryption, the {{mono | InvSubBytes}} step (the inverse of {{mono | SubBytes}}) is used, which requires first taking the inverse of the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse.\n\n=== The {{mono | ShiftRows}} step ===\n[[Image:AES-ShiftRows.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | ShiftRows}} step, bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left. The number of places each byte is shifted differs incrementally for each row.]]\nThe {{mono | ShiftRows}} step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain [[Offset (computer science)|offset]]. For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively.<ref group=\"note\">Rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets. For blocks of sizes 128 bits and 192 bits, the shifting pattern is the same. Row <math>n</math> is shifted left circular by <math>n-1</math> bytes.  For a 256-bit block, the first row is unchanged and the shifting for the second, third and fourth row is 1 byte, 3 bytes and 4 bytes respectively\u2014this change only applies for the Rijndael cipher when used with a 256-bit block, as AES does not use 256-bit blocks.</ref> In this way, each column of the output state of the {{mono | ShiftRows}} step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. The importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES degenerates into four independent block ciphers.\n\n=== The {{mono | MixColumns}} step ===\n{{main|Rijndael MixColumns}}\n[[Image:AES-MixColumns.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | MixColumns}} step, each column of the state is multiplied with a fixed polynomial <math>c(x)</math>.]]\nIn the {{mono | MixColumns}} step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible [[linear transformation]]. The {{mono | MixColumns}} function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes. Together with {{mono | ShiftRows}}, {{mono | MixColumns}} provides [[diffusion (cryptography)|diffusion]] in the cipher.\n\nDuring this operation, each column is transformed using a fixed matrix (matrix left-multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state):\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nb_{0,j} \\\\ b_{1,j} \\\\ b_{2,j} \\\\ b_{3,j}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n3 & 1 & 1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{0,j} \\\\ a_{1,j} \\\\ a_{2,j} \\\\ a_{3,j}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad 0 \\le j \\le 3\n</math>\n\nMatrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries. Entries are 8-bit bytes treated as coefficients of polynomial of order <math>x^7</math>. Addition is simply XOR. Multiplication is modulo irreducible polynomial <math>x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1</math>. If processed bit by bit, then, after shifting, a conditional [[Exclusive or|XOR]] with 1B<sub>16</sub> should be performed if the shifted value is larger than FF<sub>16</sub> (overflow must be corrected by subtraction of generating polynomial). These are special cases of the usual multiplication in <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math>.\n\nIn more general sense, each column is treated as a polynomial over <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math> and is then multiplied modulo <math>{01}_{16} \\cdot z^4+{01}_{16}</math> with a fixed polynomial <math>c(z) = {03}_{16} \\cdot z^3 + {01}_{16} \\cdot z^2 +{01}_{16} \\cdot z + {02}_{16}</math>. The coefficients are displayed in their [[hexadecimal]] equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2)[x]</math>. The {{mono | MixColumns}} step can also be viewed as a multiplication by the shown particular [[MDS matrix]] in the [[finite field]] <math>\\operatorname{GF}(2^8)</math>. This process is described further in the article [[Rijndael MixColumns]].\n\n=== The {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step ===\n[[Image:AES-AddRoundKey.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step, each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round subkey using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation (\u2295).]]\nIn the {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main [[key (cryptography)|key]] using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]; each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise [[Exclusive or|XOR]].\n\n=== Optimization of the cipher ===\nOn systems with 32-bit or larger words, it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by combining the {{mono | SubBytes}} and {{mono | ShiftRows}} steps with the {{mono | MixColumns}} step by transforming them into a sequence of table lookups. This requires four 256-entry 32-bit tables (together occupying 4096 bytes).  A round can then be performed with 16 table lookup operations and 12 32-bit exclusive-or operations, followed by four 32-bit exclusive-or operations in the {{mono | AddRoundKey}} step.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2F3-540-36400-5_13 \"Efficient software implementation of AES on 32-bit platforms\".] Lecture Notes in Computer Science: 2523. 2003</ref>  Alternatively, the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256-entry 32-bit table (occupying 1024 bytes) followed by circular rotation operations.\n\nUsing a byte-oriented approach, it is possible to combine the {{mono | SubBytes}}, {{mono | ShiftRows}}, and {{mono | MixColumns}} steps into a single round operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes |title=byte-oriented-aes \u2013 A public domain byte-oriented implementation of AES in C \u2013 Google Project Hosting |accessdate=2012-12-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720155538/http://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes/ |archivedate=2013-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nThe [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data.
