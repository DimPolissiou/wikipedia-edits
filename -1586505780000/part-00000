Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges.

This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1459/>\n\nThe Bulga Bridge is particularly technically significant because it has very large supporting trestles, has the rare feature of trussed cross girders, and is the largest span Dare truss bridge built. The bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Bulga Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1459/>\n\nThe Bulga Bridge over Wollombi Brook was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1459/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1459/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible.

[[California]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the city had a population of 85,331, reflecting an increase of 1,631 from the 83,680 counted in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], and encompasses {{convert|38.0|km2|order=flip}}. Like nearby [[Montebello, California|Montebello]], the city constitutes part of the [[Gateway Cities]]. Whittier was incorporated in February 1898 and became a [[charter city]] in 1955.<ref name=\"city\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwhittier.org/ |title=Whitter Web - Homepage |publisher=Cityofwhittier.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> The city is named for the [[Quaker]] poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] and is home to [[Whittier College]].\n\n==History==\nWhittier's roots can be traced to Spanish soldier [[Manuel Nieto]].<ref name=\"History\">[http://www.cityofwhittier.org/content/AW01.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217052032/http://www.cityofwhittier.org/content/AW01.html |date=February 17, 2015 }}</ref>  In 1784, Nieto received a [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant of {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}}, [[Rancho Los Nietos]], as a reward for his military service and to encourage settlement in California.<ref name=\"city\" /> The area of Nieto's land grant was reduced in 1790 as the result of a dispute with [[Mission San Gabriel]]. Nonetheless, Nieto still had claim to {{convert|167000|acre|km2|-1}} stretching from the hills north of Whittier, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[Brea, California|Brea]], south to the Pacific Ocean, and from what is known today as the [[Los Angeles River]] east to the [[Santa Ana River]]. Nieto built a rancho for his family near  Whittier, and purchased cattle and horses for his ranch and also planted cornfields. When Nieto died in 1804,  his children inherited their father's property.\n\nAt the time of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], much of the land that would become Whittier was owned by [[Pio Pico]], a rancher and the last Mexican governor of Alta California.<ref name=\"city\" /> Pio Pico built a hacienda here on the San Gabriel River, known today as [[Pio Pico State Historic Park]].<ref name=\"city\" />  Following the Mexican\u2013American War, German immigrant [[Jacob F. Gerkens]] paid $234 to the U.S. government to acquire {{convert|160|acre|km2|1}} of land under the [[Homestead Act]] and built the cabin known today as the [[Jonathan Bailey House (Whittier, California)|Jonathan Bailey House]].<ref name=\"Points of Interest\">{{cite web|title=Points of Interest|url=http://www.cityofwhittier.org/about/poi.asp|website=City of Whittier|accessdate=6 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905085550/http://www.cityofwhittier.org/about/poi.asp|archive-date=September 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Gerkens would later become the first chief of police of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Gerkens' land was owned by several others before a group of Quakers purchased it and expanded it to {{convert|1259|acre|km2|0}}, with the intent of founding a Quaker community. The area soon became known as a thriving citrus ranching region, with \"Quaker Brand\" fruit being shipped all over the United States. Later, [[Paradox Hybrid Walnut Tree|walnut trees]] were also planted, and Whittier became the largest walnut grower in the United States.<ref name=\"city\" /> In addition to walnuts and citrus, Whittier was also a major producer of [[pampas grass (disambiguation)|pampas grass]].\n\nFor many years, the sole means of transport from this area to Los Angeles was on foot, or via horse and wagon over rough dirt roads, impeding settlement, development, and the export of agriculture.<ref name=\"Arnold and Clark\">{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Benjamin F.|last2=Clark|first2=Artilissa Dorland|title=History of Whittier|date=1933|publisher=Western Printing Corporation|location=Whittier, California|page=19}}</ref> Thus in 1887 \"enterprising and aggressive businessmen\" contracted with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] to build the first railroad spur to Whittier, including a depot.<ref>Arnold and Clark, 20</ref> The businessmen covered the $43,000 construction cost for the six-mile spur, which branched off from the Southern Pacific mainline at a junction near what is now Studebaker Road between Firestone Boulevard and Imperial Highway.<ref name=\"Whittier Museum\">{{cite web|last1=Church|first1=William|title=A Brief History of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Whittier|url=http://www.whittiermuseum.org/railroad.html|publisher=Whittier Museum and Historical Society|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> By 1906, 650 carloads of oranges and 250 carloads of lemons were shipped annually by rail. In 1904, the [[Pacific Electric]] opened the trolley line known as \"Big Red Cars\" from Los Angeles to Whittier. In the first two decades, over a million passengers a year rode to and from Los Angeles on the Whittier line.<ref name=\"city\" /> Groves of walnuts were planted in 1887 and eventually Whittier was known as the primary walnut growing town in the United States.<ref name=\"History\" />\nAfter [[World War II]] Whittier grew rapidly and the sub-dividing of orange groves began, driven by housing shortages in southern California. In 1955 the new Civic Center complex was completed and the City Council met in new chambers for the first time on March 8, 1955. The city continued to grow as the City annexed portions of Whittier Boulevard and East Whittier. The 1961 annexation added over 28,000 people to the population, bringing the total to about 67,000.<ref name=\"city\" />\n\n===Etymology===\nIn the founding days of Whittier, when it was a small isolated town, Jonathan Bailey and his wife, Rebecca, were among the first residents. They followed the [[Quaker]] religious faith and practice, and held religious meetings on their porch. Other early settlers, such as Aquila Pickering, espoused the Quaker faith. As the city grew, the citizens named it after [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], a respected Quaker [[poet]], and deeded a lot to him. Whittier wrote a dedication poem, and is honored today with statues and a small exhibit at the Whittier museum; a statue of him sits in Whittier's Central Park, and another representing his poem ''The Barefoot Boy''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174752|title=The Barefoot Boy by John Greenleaf Whittier|date=April 7, 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref> used to reside by the City Hall.  Whittier never set foot there, but the city still bears his name and is rooted in the Quaker tradition.<ref name=\"city\" />\n[[File:Jonathan Bailey House, Whittier.jpg|thumb|left|Jonathan Bailey House]]\n\n===Quakers===\nThe first Quaker meetings were held on the front porch of the [[Jonathan Bailey House (Whittier, California)|Jonathan Bailey House]].<ref name=\"Points of Interest\" /> Eventually, as more Quakers arrived, the need for an actual Meeting House arose and the first [[Friends meeting house|Quaker meeting house]] was built on the corner of Comstock Avenue and Wardman Street in 1887. The meeting soon outgrew this 100 seat meeting house and a new larger building was erected on the corner of Philadelphia Street and Washington Avenue in 1902. By 1912, membership had grown to 1,200 and a third building was dedicated on the same site in 1917. With a capacity of 1,700, the 1917 meeting house featured a balcony and was constructed of brick with mahogany paneling and pews. The present meeting house, dedicated in 1975, features many architectural elements and materials from the 1917 building including the stained glass windows and mahogany interior.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Carl|title=Whittier Friends Church: Eighty-Eight Years of Service|year=1975 |publisher=First Friends Church|location=Library of William Wright|pages=2\u20139}}</ref> The Quakers also founded Whittier Academy (later Whittier College), and additional meetings met in East Whittier and at Whittier College's Mendenhall. Both the Mendenhall meeting and the East Whittier meeting kept the silent meeting longer than the main church.\n\n===Colleges===\nIn 1887 the Pickering Land and Water Company set aside a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land for the development of a college, but a collapse in the land boom stalled construction. Progress on developing a college was sporadic, but on July 30, 1896 the Whittier Academy, operating since 1891, officially changed its name to [[Whittier College]] with 100 students enrolled. The school mascot is \"The Poet.\" By 1906, Whittier College was an educational institution with laboratories, boarding halls, a large gymnasium and athletic fields. Due to an economic depression in the 1890s, the first bachelor's degrees were not awarded at the college for 17 years.<ref name=\"city\" />\n\nThe Mendenhall Building at Whittier College was donated by Leona May Mendenhall in honor of her husband Oscar. The Mendenhalls were among the founding families of Whittier. Oscar's brother, Samuel Mendenhall, helped bring in the water system and post office. The Mendenhalls were large growers for [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]] oranges and [[Blue Diamond Growers|Blue Diamond]] walnuts.\n\nWhittier was the first home to [[Azusa Pacific University]], established on March 3, 1899, by the Quaker community and a Methodist evangelist under the name Training School for Christian Workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apu.edu/about/history/timeline|title=Timeline - About APU - Azusa Pacific University|website=www.apu.edu|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Whittier Narrows earthquake===\nOn October 1, 1987, at 7:42&nbsp;a.m., the [[1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake|Whittier Narrows earthquake]] struck, the epicenter being six miles (10&nbsp;km) north by northwest of Whittier. The seismic event, which registered 5.9 on the moment magnitude scale, resulted in eight casualties and massive damage to uptown Whittier's historic buildings. Three days later, on October 4, 1987, at 3:59&nbsp;a.m., a major aftershock measuring 5.2 occurred, causing further damage. Buildings and residential structures which were already borderline unsafe were now deemed unsafe or  uninhabitable. In the years following the earthquake, the city's deteriorating uptown business district, which suffered substantial damage in the earthquake, became the focus of renewed development, which met with opposition from many Whittier citizens. Out of the rubble of the earthquake the [[Whittier Conservancy]] was formed in 1987 in an effort to stop the demolition of many historic buildings and residences after the disaster. The city also created a [[Historic Resources Commission]] to oversee the approval of historic designations, historic districts and [[Mills Act]] proposals. The Whittier Narrows earthquake also destroyed [[The Quad at Whittier]], a shopping mall which had to be rebuilt.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|14.7|sqmi|km2}}, virtually all land.\n\nWhittier is bordered by the community of [[Hacienda Heights]] to the northeast, [[City of Industry, CA|City of Industry]] to the north, and several other unincorporated communities in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] mostly along its northern sections. [[Pico Rivera, CA|Pico Rivera]] lies at the west, [[La Habra Heights, CA|La Habra Heights]] to the east, [[La Habra, CA|La Habra]] to the southeast and [[Santa Fe Springs, CA|Santa Fe Springs]] to the south.\n\nWhittier is situated approximately {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} inland of the Pacific Ocean, resulting in higher daytime temperatures, and since it lies at a higher elevation than the cities further west, cold air drains into the lower elevation of the [[Los Angeles Basin]] which results in warmer night-time lows, producing an example of [[thermal inversion]]. Winter daytime highs typically range from 68&nbsp;\u00b0F to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C) with overnight lows dropping to about 43&nbsp;\u00b0F to 54&nbsp;\u00b0F (6\u00b0 to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C). In the summer highs range from 78&nbsp;\u00b0F to 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (26&nbsp;\u00b0C to 35&nbsp;\u00b0C) and corresponding overnight lows in the 58&nbsp;\u00b0F to 72&nbsp;\u00b0F (14&nbsp;\u00b0C to 22&nbsp;\u00b0C). Rainfall follows a Mediterranean pattern with the majority of the rain falling during the winter months, while summers tend to be rather dry. The mean annual rainfall is approximately 14 inches.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Whitter CA (Wx-Station located 4.5mi NNW at Montebello, CA 1971\u20132000 Normals)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 91\n|Feb record high F = 95\n|Mar record high F = 100\n|Apr record high F = 104\n|May record high F = 105\n|Jun record high F = 108\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 106\n|Sep record high F = 113\n|Oct record high F = 106\n|Nov record high F = 100\n|Dec record high F = 88\n|year record high F = 113\n|Jan high F = 69.7\n|Feb high F = 71.3\n|Mar high F = 72.6\n|Apr high F = 77.4\n|May high F = 79.2\n|Jun high F = 84.2\n|Jul high F = 88.9\n|Aug high F = 89.4\n|Sep high F = 87.5\n|Oct high F = 82.2\n|Nov high F = 75.2\n|Dec high F = 70.7\n|year high F = 79.0\n|Jan mean F = 58.8\n|Feb mean F = 60.0\n|Mar mean F = 61.6\n|Apr mean F = 65.3\n|May mean F = 68.1\n|Jun mean F = 72.6\n|Jul mean F = 76.6\n|Aug mean F = 77.4\n|Sep mean F = 75.7\n|Oct mean F = 70.3\n|Nov mean F = 63.6\n|Dec mean F = 59.0\n|year mean F = 67.4\n|Jan low F = 47.9\n|Feb low F = 48.7\n|Mar low F = 50.5\n|Apr low F = 53.1\n|May low F = 56.9\n|Jun low F = 60.9\n|Jul low F = 64.3\n|Aug low F = 65.4\n|Sep low F = 63.8\n|Oct low F = 58.4\n|Nov low F = 52.0\n|Dec low F = 47.3\n|year low F = 55.8\n|Jan record low F = 30\n|Feb record low F = 29\n|Mar record low F = 33\n|Apr record low F = 39\n|May record low F = 30\n|Jun record low F = 30\n|Jul record low F = 38\n|Aug record low F = 44\n|Sep record low F = 50\n|Oct record low F = 44\n|Nov record low F = 37\n|Dec record low F = 30\n|year record low F = 29\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.53\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.60\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.94\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.90\n|May precipitation inch = 0.23\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.06\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.01\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.02\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.17\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.31\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.00\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1.67\n|year precipitation inch = 14.44\n|source 1 = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca5790 <ref>{{cite web | author=WRCC | title=Western U.S. Climate Historical Summaries Weather | url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca5790 | publisher=Desert Research Institute | date= | accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref>\n|date=February 2011\n}}\n\n===Neighborhoods===\nThere are several neighborhoods in Whittier. The area centered around Philadelphia Street and Greenleaf Avenue is known as Uptown Whittier and contains the traditional central business core. Just north of '''Uptown''' Whittier are the neighborhoods known as Central Park and Hadley-Greenleaf. They have been designated historic districts by the city Historic Resources Commission, and together comprise most of the area of the Whittier Historic Neighborhood Association. These districts contain many Craftsman and Spanish Colonial Revival homes. In and abutting the hills north of the historic districts is Starlite Estates.  The area surrounding Whittier College is known as College Hills and was also recently designated a historic district, as has a small cluster of homes along Earlham Drive. The area east of College Avenue is referred to as '''East Whittier'''. East Whittier was a separate agricultural community until the postwar era. The eastern parts of East Whittier, developed in the 1950s and \u201960s, are Friendly Hills, which was developed at the same time as Murphy Ranch and Leffingwell Ranch.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 585\n|1900= 1590\n|1910= 4550\n|1920= 7997\n|1930= 14822\n|1940= 16115\n|1950= 23433\n|1960= 33663\n|1970= 72863\n|1980= 68558\n|1990= 77671\n|2000= 83680\n|2010= 85331\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=86064\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Image:C.W.

With an initial collection of 60 books and 200 magazines, the library facilities began in the Woody Building as a reading room, maintained by Mr. Hester in exchange for space for his telegraph office. In 1907, a Carnegie grant funded the construction of the building at Bailey and Greenleaf that many Whittierites fondly remember. As the city expanded, a larger library was needed, and the Friends of the Library organized in 1956 to raise money for a new building. Through their efforts, and those of the board members, librarians, and citizen fund raising groups, the new library was completed at the Washington Avenue site in May 1959. In 1968, service was further expanded with the construction of the Whittwood Branch Library on Santa Gertrudes Avenue.<ref>[http://www.whittierlibrary.org/about_the_library.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331041030/http://www.whittierlibrary.org/about_the_library.html |date=March 31, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Image:Lou Henry Hoover School, Whittier.JPG|thumb|195px|right|Lou Henry Hoover School]]\n[[Image:Frieze at Lou Henry Hoover School, Whittier.JPG|thumb|195px|right|Frieze at Hoover School, designed by Bartholomew Mako]]\nThe city of Whittier is served by the [[Whittier Union High School District]], [[East Whittier City School District]], [[Whittier City School District]], [[Lowell Joint School District]] and the [[Fullerton Joint Union High School District]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nFive high schools, [[California High School (Whittier, California)|California High School]], [[La Serna High School]], [[Pioneer High School (Whittier, California)|Pioneer High School]], [[Santa Fe High School (California)|Santa Fe High School]], and [[Whittier High School]] comprise the Whittier Union High School District.

[[California]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the city had a population of 85,331, reflecting an increase of 1,631 from the 83,680 counted in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], and encompasses {{convert|38.0|km2|order=flip}}. Like nearby [[Montebello, California|Montebello]], the city constitutes part of the [[Gateway Cities]]. Whittier was incorporated in February 1898 and became a [[charter city]] in 1955.<ref name=\"city\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwhittier.org/ |title=Whitter Web - Homepage |publisher=Cityofwhittier.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> The city is named for the [[Quaker]] poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] and is home to [[Whittier College]].\n\n==History==\nWhittier's roots can be traced to Spanish soldier [[Manuel Nieto]].<ref name=\"History\">[http://www.cityofwhittier.org/content/AW01.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217052032/http://www.cityofwhittier.org/content/AW01.html |date=February 17, 2015 }}</ref>  In 1784, Nieto received a [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant of {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}}, [[Rancho Los Nietos]], as a reward for his military service and to encourage settlement in California.<ref name=\"city\" /> The area of Nieto's land grant was reduced in 1790 as the result of a dispute with [[Mission San Gabriel]]. Nonetheless, Nieto still had claim to {{convert|167000|acre|km2|-1}} stretching from the hills north of Whittier, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[Brea, California|Brea]], south to the Pacific Ocean, and from what is known today as the [[Los Angeles River]] east to the [[Santa Ana River]]. Nieto built a rancho for his family near  Whittier, and purchased cattle and horses for his ranch and also planted cornfields. When Nieto died in 1804,  his children inherited their father's property.\n\nAt the time of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], much of the land that would become Whittier was owned by [[Pio Pico]], a rancher and the last Mexican governor of Alta California.<ref name=\"city\" /> Pio Pico built a hacienda here on the San Gabriel River, known today as [[Pio Pico State Historic Park]].<ref name=\"city\" />  Following the Mexican\u2013American War, German immigrant [[Jacob F. Gerkens]] paid $234 to the U.S. government to acquire {{convert|160|acre|km2|1}} of land under the [[Homestead Act]] and built the cabin known today as the [[Jonathan Bailey House]].<ref name=\"Points of Interest\">{{cite web|title=Points of Interest|url=http://www.cityofwhittier.org/about/poi.asp|website=City of Whittier|accessdate=6 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905085550/http://www.cityofwhittier.org/about/poi.asp|archive-date=September 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Gerkens would later become the first chief of police of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Gerkens' land was owned by several others before a group of Quakers purchased it and expanded it to {{convert|1259|acre|km2|0}}, with the intent of founding a Quaker community. The area soon became known as a thriving citrus ranching region, with \"Quaker Brand\" fruit being shipped all over the United States. Later, [[Paradox Hybrid Walnut Tree|walnut trees]] were also planted, and Whittier became the largest walnut grower in the United States.<ref name=\"city\" /> In addition to walnuts and citrus, Whittier was also a major producer of [[pampas grass (disambiguation)|pampas grass]].\n\nFor many years, the sole means of transport from this area to Los Angeles was on foot, or via horse and wagon over rough dirt roads, impeding settlement, development, and the export of agriculture.<ref name=\"Arnold and Clark\">{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Benjamin F.|last2=Clark|first2=Artilissa Dorland|title=History of Whittier|date=1933|publisher=Western Printing Corporation|location=Whittier, California|page=19}}</ref> Thus in 1887 \"enterprising and aggressive businessmen\" contracted with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] to build the first railroad spur to Whittier, including a depot.<ref>Arnold and Clark, 20</ref> The businessmen covered the $43,000 construction cost for the six-mile spur, which branched off from the Southern Pacific mainline at a junction near what is now Studebaker Road between Firestone Boulevard and Imperial Highway.<ref name=\"Whittier Museum\">{{cite web|last1=Church|first1=William|title=A Brief History of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Whittier|url=http://www.whittiermuseum.org/railroad.html|publisher=Whittier Museum and Historical Society|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> By 1906, 650 carloads of oranges and 250 carloads of lemons were shipped annually by rail. In 1904, the [[Pacific Electric]] opened the trolley line known as \"Big Red Cars\" from Los Angeles to Whittier. In the first two decades, over a million passengers a year rode to and from Los Angeles on the Whittier line.<ref name=\"city\" /> Groves of walnuts were planted in 1887 and eventually Whittier was known as the primary walnut growing town in the United States.<ref name=\"History\" />\nAfter [[World War II]] Whittier grew rapidly and the sub-dividing of orange groves began, driven by housing shortages in southern California. In 1955 the new Civic Center complex was completed and the City Council met in new chambers for the first time on March 8, 1955. The city continued to grow as the City annexed portions of Whittier Boulevard and East Whittier. The 1961 annexation added over 28,000 people to the population, bringing the total to about 67,000.<ref name=\"city\" />\n\n===Etymology===\nIn the founding days of Whittier, when it was a small isolated town, Jonathan Bailey and his wife, Rebecca, were among the first residents. They followed the [[Quaker]] religious faith and practice, and held religious meetings on their porch. Other early settlers, such as Aquila Pickering, espoused the Quaker faith. As the city grew, the citizens named it after [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], a respected Quaker [[poet]], and deeded a lot to him. Whittier wrote a dedication poem, and is honored today with statues and a small exhibit at the Whittier museum; a statue of him sits in Whittier's Central Park, and another representing his poem ''The Barefoot Boy''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174752|title=The Barefoot Boy by John Greenleaf Whittier|date=April 7, 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref> used to reside by the City Hall.  Whittier never set foot there, but the city still bears his name and is rooted in the Quaker tradition.<ref name=\"city\" />\n[[File:Jonathan Bailey House, Whittier.jpg|thumb|left|Jonathan Bailey House]]\n\n===Quakers===\nThe first Quaker meetings were held on the front porch of the [[Jonathan Bailey House (Whittier, California)|Jonathan Bailey House]].<ref name=\"Points of Interest\" /> Eventually, as more Quakers arrived, the need for an actual Meeting House arose and the first [[Friends meeting house|Quaker meeting house]] was built on the corner of Comstock Avenue and Wardman Street in 1887. The meeting soon outgrew this 100 seat meeting house and a new larger building was erected on the corner of Philadelphia Street and Washington Avenue in 1902. By 1912, membership had grown to 1,200 and a third building was dedicated on the same site in 1917. With a capacity of 1,700, the 1917 meeting house featured a balcony and was constructed of brick with mahogany paneling and pews. The present meeting house, dedicated in 1975, features many architectural elements and materials from the 1917 building including the stained glass windows and mahogany interior.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Carl|title=Whittier Friends Church: Eighty-Eight Years of Service|year=1975 |publisher=First Friends Church|location=Library of William Wright|pages=2\u20139}}</ref> The Quakers also founded Whittier Academy (later Whittier College), and additional meetings met in East Whittier and at Whittier College's Mendenhall. Both the Mendenhall meeting and the East Whittier meeting kept the silent meeting longer than the main church.\n\n===Colleges===\nIn 1887 the Pickering Land and Water Company set aside a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land for the development of a college, but a collapse in the land boom stalled construction. Progress on developing a college was sporadic, but on July 30, 1896 the Whittier Academy, operating since 1891, officially changed its name to [[Whittier College]] with 100 students enrolled. The school mascot is \"The Poet.\" By 1906, Whittier College was an educational institution with laboratories, boarding halls, a large gymnasium and athletic fields. Due to an economic depression in the 1890s, the first bachelor's degrees were not awarded at the college for 17 years.<ref name=\"city\" />\n\nThe Mendenhall Building at Whittier College was donated by Leona May Mendenhall in honor of her husband Oscar. The Mendenhalls were among the founding families of Whittier. Oscar's brother, Samuel Mendenhall, helped bring in the water system and post office. The Mendenhalls were large growers for [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]] oranges and [[Blue Diamond Growers|Blue Diamond]] walnuts.\n\nWhittier was the first home to [[Azusa Pacific University]], established on March 3, 1899, by the Quaker community and a Methodist evangelist under the name Training School for Christian Workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apu.edu/about/history/timeline|title=Timeline - About APU - Azusa Pacific University|website=www.apu.edu|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Whittier Narrows earthquake===\nOn October 1, 1987, at 7:42&nbsp;a.m., the [[1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake|Whittier Narrows earthquake]] struck, the epicenter being six miles (10&nbsp;km) north by northwest of Whittier. The seismic event, which registered 5.9 on the moment magnitude scale, resulted in eight casualties and massive damage to uptown Whittier's historic buildings. Three days later, on October 4, 1987, at 3:59&nbsp;a.m., a major aftershock measuring 5.2 occurred, causing further damage. Buildings and residential structures which were already borderline unsafe were now deemed unsafe or  uninhabitable. In the years following the earthquake, the city's deteriorating uptown business district, which suffered substantial damage in the earthquake, became the focus of renewed development, which met with opposition from many Whittier citizens. Out of the rubble of the earthquake the [[Whittier Conservancy]] was formed in 1987 in an effort to stop the demolition of many historic buildings and residences after the disaster. The city also created a [[Historic Resources Commission]] to oversee the approval of historic designations, historic districts and [[Mills Act]] proposals. The Whittier Narrows earthquake also destroyed [[The Quad at Whittier]], a shopping mall which had to be rebuilt.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|14.7|sqmi|km2}}, virtually all land.\n\nWhittier is bordered by the community of [[Hacienda Heights]] to the northeast, [[City of Industry, CA|City of Industry]] to the north, and several other unincorporated communities in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] mostly along its northern sections. [[Pico Rivera, CA|Pico Rivera]] lies at the west, [[La Habra Heights, CA|La Habra Heights]] to the east, [[La Habra, CA|La Habra]] to the southeast and [[Santa Fe Springs, CA|Santa Fe Springs]] to the south.\n\nWhittier is situated approximately {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} inland of the Pacific Ocean, resulting in higher daytime temperatures, and since it lies at a higher elevation than the cities further west, cold air drains into the lower elevation of the [[Los Angeles Basin]] which results in warmer night-time lows, producing an example of [[thermal inversion]]. Winter daytime highs typically range from 68&nbsp;\u00b0F to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C) with overnight lows dropping to about 43&nbsp;\u00b0F to 54&nbsp;\u00b0F (6\u00b0 to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C).

The area centered around Philadelphia Street and Greenleaf Avenue is known as Uptown Whittier and contains the traditional central business core. Just north of '''Uptown''' Whittier are the neighborhoods known as Central Park and Hadley-Greenleaf. They have been designated historic districts by the city Historic Resources Commission, and together comprise most of the area of the Whittier Historic Neighborhood Association. These districts contain many Craftsman and Spanish Colonial Revival homes. In and abutting the hills north of the historic districts is Starlite Estates.  The area surrounding Whittier College is known as College Hills and was also recently designated a historic district, as has a small cluster of homes along Earlham Drive. The area east of College Avenue is referred to as '''East Whittier'''. East Whittier was a separate agricultural community until the postwar era. The eastern parts of East Whittier, developed in the 1950s and \u201960s, are Friendly Hills, which was developed at the same time as Murphy Ranch and Leffingwell Ranch.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 585\n|1900= 1590\n|1910= 4550\n|1920= 7997\n|1930= 14822\n|1940= 16115\n|1950= 23433\n|1960= 33663\n|1970= 72863\n|1980= 68558\n|1990= 77671\n|2000= 83680\n|2010= 85331\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=86064\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Image:C.W.

In 1907, a Carnegie grant funded the construction of the building at Bailey and Greenleaf that many Whittierites fondly remember. As the city expanded, a larger library was needed, and the Friends of the Library organized in 1956 to raise money for a new building. Through their efforts, and those of the board members, librarians, and citizen fund raising groups, the new library was completed at the Washington Avenue site in May 1959. In 1968, service was further expanded with the construction of the Whittwood Branch Library on Santa Gertrudes Avenue.<ref>[http://www.whittierlibrary.org/about_the_library.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331041030/http://www.whittierlibrary.org/about_the_library.html |date=March 31, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Image:Lou Henry Hoover School, Whittier.JPG|thumb|195px|right|Lou Henry Hoover School]]\n[[Image:Frieze at Lou Henry Hoover School, Whittier.JPG|thumb|195px|right|Frieze at Hoover School, designed by Bartholomew Mako]]\nThe city of Whittier is served by the [[Whittier Union High School District]], [[East Whittier City School District]], [[Whittier City School District]], [[Lowell Joint School District]] and the [[Fullerton Joint Union High School District]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nFive high schools, [[California High School (Whittier, California)|California High School]], [[La Serna High School]], [[Pioneer High School (Whittier, California)|Pioneer High School]], [[Santa Fe High School (California)|Santa Fe High School]], and [[Whittier High School]] comprise the Whittier Union High School District.

There are ten different recognised schools of ''qira'at'', each one deriving its name from a noted Quran reciter or \"reader\" (''Qari''). Each reciter recited to two narrators whose narrations are known as ''riwaya'' (transmissions) and named after its primary narrator.  Each ''Rawi'' (singular of ''riwaya'') has ''turuq'' (transmission lines) with more variants created by  notable students of the master who recited them and named after the student of the master. Passed down from  ''Turuq'' are  ''wujuh'': the ''wajh'' of so-and-so from the ''tariq'' of so-and-so. There are about twenty ''riwayat'' and eighty ''turuq''.<ref name=Bewley/>\n\nVarious [[hadith]]\u2014where Muhammad listens to recitations of various [[Companions of the Prophet|companion]]s and approves of each of them,<ref name=\"Munajjid\"/> or corrects [[Umar]]'s berating another [[Companions of the Prophet|companion]]'s recitation saying the \"Quran has been revealed in seven ''[[Ahruf]]''\",<ref name=\"muw\"/> or claim Muhammad asked the angel [[Gabriel#Islam|Jibreel]] to teach him different styles of recitation until he had learned seven<ref name=bukhari-Muslim/>\u2014provide an Islamic basis for the different variants (''[[Ahruf]]'') of the Quran. (Both ''[[Ahruf]]'' and ''Qira'at'' are variations in recitation but ''[[Ahruf]]'' were discontinued by order of caliph Uthman sometime in the mid-7th century CE when \"the Quran began to be read in only one ''harf'' (variation)\",<ref name=\"ri\">Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, 1990, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, p. 28-29</ref> while the seven readings of the ''Qira'at'' began to be passed down in the 8th century CE.)<ref name=shady129/>\n\nDifferences between ''Qira'at'' are slight and include differences in stops,{{#tag:ref|for example, in Surat al-Baqara (1): \"Dhalika'l-Kitabu la rayb\" or \"Dhalika'l-Kitabu la rayba fih\"  <ref name=Bewley>[https://bewley.virtualave.net/qira.html The Seven ''Qira'at'' of the Qur'an by Aisha Bewley]</ref>|group=Note}} vowels,{{#tag:ref|an example being \"suddan\" or \"saddan\"<ref name=Bewley/>|group=Note}} and sometimes letters.{{#tag:ref|(due to different diacritical marks, for example, ya' or ta' (turja'una or yurja'una) or a word having a long consonant or not (a consonant will have a [[shadda]] making it long, or not have one).<ref name=Bewley/>|group=Note}}\nRecitation should be in accordance with rules of [[pronunciation]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], and [[caesura]]s established by [[Muhammad]] and first recorded during the eighth century CE.

Each reciter had variations in their [[tajwid]] rules and occasional words in their recitation of the Qur'an are different or of a different morphology with the same root.

Some scholars, such as Ibn al-Jazari, took this list of seven from Ibn Mujahid and added three other reciters (Abu Ja\u2019far from Madinah, Ya\u2019qub from Basrah, and Khalaf from Kufa) to form the canonical list of ten.<ref name=\"ajaja\"></ref><ref name=\"yaqeen\">{{cite web |last1=Khan |first1=Nazir |last2=Khatib |first2=Ammar |title=The Origins of the Variant Readings of the Qur\u2019an |url=https://yaqeeninstitute.org/nazir-khan/the-origins-of-the-variant-readings-of-the-quran/#ftnt2 |website=Yaqeen Institute |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nImam [[Al-Shatibi]] (1320 - 1388 CE) wrote a poem outlining the two most famous ways passed down from each of seven strong imams, known as ''ash-Shatibiyyah.''

The other recitations reported from companions that differ from the Uthm\u0101nic codex may represent an abrogated or abandoned \u1e25arf, or a recitation containing word alterations for commentary or for facilitation for a learner.

''Ahruf'' variants were more significant (involving differences in the consonants of the some words of the Quran) and Caliph 'Uthman is believed to have eliminated all but one.<ref name=FMDQiRS2008:35-6/> The seven ''Qira'at''  readings which are currently notable were selected by [[Abu Bakr Ibn Mujahid]] (died 324 AH, 936 CE) from prominent reciters of his time, three from [[Kufa]] and one each from [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], and [[Basra]] and [[Damascus]].<ref name=MCKaVSI2000:73>[[#MCKaVSI2000|Cook, ''The Koran'', 2000]]: p.73</ref>  \n\n[[Bilal Philips]] writes that the Quran continued to be read according to the seven ''ahruf'' until midway through Caliph 'Uthman's rule, when confusion developed in the outlying provinces about the Quran's recitation. Some Arab tribes boasted about the superiority of their ''ahruf'', and rivalries began; new Muslims also began combining the forms of recitation out of ignorance. Caliph 'Uthman decided to make official copies of the Quran according to the writing conventions of the [[Quraysh]] and send them with the Quranic reciters to the Islamic centres. His decision was approved by Sahaabah, and all unofficial copies of the Quran were ordered destroyed; Uthman carried out the order. After the distribution of the official copies, the other ahruf were dropped and the Quran began to be read in one ''harf''. The Quran which is currently available worldwide is written and recited according to the ''harf'' of Quraysh.<ref name=\"ri\">Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, 1990, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, p. 28-29</ref>\n\nPhilips writes that ''Qira'at'' is primarily a method of pronunciation used in recitations of the Quran. These methods are different from the seven forms, or modes (''ahruf''), in which the Quran was revealed. The methods have been traced back to Muhammad through a number of ''Sahaabah'' (companions) who were noted for their Quranic recitations; they recited the Quran to Muhammad (or in his presence), and received his approval. The ''Sahaabah'' included: \n*Ubayy Ibn Kab]\n*[[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]] \n*Zayd Ibn Thaabit \n*Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud \n*Abu ad-Dardaa\n*Abu Musa al-Ash'aree \nMany of the other Sahaabah learned from them; master Quran commentator Ibn 'Abbaas learned from Ubayy and Zayd.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (pp.&nbsp;29\u201330)\n\nAccording to Philips, in the next generation of Muslims (referred to as ''[[Tabi'in]]'') were many scholars who learned the methods of recitation from the ''Sahaabah'' and taught them to others. Centres of Quranic recitation developed in al-Madeenah, Makkah, Kufa, Basrah and Syria, leading to the development of Quranic recitation as a science. By the mid-eighth century CE, a large number of scholars were considered specialists in the field of recitation. Most of their methods were authenticated by chains of reliable narrators, ending with Muhammad. The methods which were supported by a large number of reliable narrators on each level of their chain were called ''mutawaatir'', and were considered the most accurate. Methods in which the number of narrators were few (or only one) on any level of the chain were known as ''shaadhdh''. Some scholars of the following period began the practice of designating a set number of individual scholars from the previous period as the most noteworthy and accurate. The number seven became popular by the mid-10th century, since it coincided with the number of dialects in which the Quran was revealed.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (p.&nbsp;30)\n\n[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] writes about hadith in Muwatta<ref name=\"muw\"/> that if Ahruf are taken in the context of pronunciation (for which the words are ''lughat'' and ''lahjat''), the content of the hadith rejects this meaning; [[Umar]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah|Hisham]] belonged to the same tribe (the [[Quraysh]]), and members of the same tribe cannot use different pronunciations. Ghamidi questions the hadith which claim \"variant readings\", on the basis of Quranic verses ({{quran-usc-range|87|6-7}}, {{quran-usc-range|75|16-19}}), the Quran was compiled during Muhammad's lifetime and questions the hadith which report its compilation during [[Uthman]]'s reign.<ref name=\"jav\"/> Since most of these narrations are reported by [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]], Imam Layth Ibn Sa'd wrote to [[Imam Malik]]:<ref name=\"jav\"/><ref>[[Ibn Qayyim]], I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in, vol. 3 (Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, n.d.), 96.</ref>\n{{quote|And when we would meet Ibn Shihab, there would arise a difference of opinion in many issues. When any one of us would ask him in writing about some issue, he, in spite of being so learned, would give three very different answers, and he would not even be aware of what he had already said. It is because of this that I have left him \u2013 something which you did not like.}}\n\nAbu 'Ubayd Qasim Ibn Sallam (died 224 [[Hijri year|AH]]) reportedly selected twenty-five readings in his book. The seven readings which are currently notable were selected by [[Abu Bakr Ibn Mujahid]] (died 324 AH, 936 CE) at the end of the third century. It is generally accepted that although their number cannot be ascertained, every reading is Quran which has been reported through a chain of narration and is [[Arabic|linguistically]] correct. Some readings are regarded as ''mutawatir'', but their chains of narration indicate that they are ''ahad'' (isolate) and their narrators are suspect in the eyes of ''[[Biographical evaluation|rijal]]'' authorities.<ref name=\"jav\"/>\n\n==Quranic orthography==\nTo ensure the correct reading of the Quran (particularly for those following the first generation of Muslims), gradual steps were taken to improve its [[orthography]]. This began with the introduction of dots to distinguish similarly-shaped consonants, followed by dots (to indicate different vowels) and [[nunation]] in different-coloured ink from the text. The work was done primarily by Abu'l Aswad ad-Du'al\u00ee (d. 69 AH/688 CE), Na\u1e63r Ibn \u02bf\u0100\u1e63im (d. 89 AH/707 CE) and Ya\u1e25ya Ibn Ya\u02bfmur (d. 129 AH/746 CE). There was initial opposition to any additions to the Quran. Although Ibn \u02bfUmar (73/692) disliked the dotting, others welcomed it because it ensured the proper reading of the Quran as received from Muhammad; the latter view has been accepted by most Muslims throughout the Muslim world since the [[Tabi'un]]. The people of [[Medina|Madinah]] reportedly used red dots for vowels (''[[tanwin]]'', ''[[Shadda|tashdid]]'', ''takhfif'', ''[[Arabic diacritics#Sukun|sukun]]'', ''wa\u1e63l'' and ''madd'') and yellow dots for [[hamza]]s. ''Naqt'' (dotting the ''[[rasm]]''), became a separate subject of study.\n\n=={{anchor|The Ten Readers and their Transmitters}}The ten readers and their transmitters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The seven readers and their transmitters\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" Style=\"background:#efefef;\"|''Qari'' (reader)\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |''Rawi'' (transmitter)\n|-\n!

His decision was approved by Sahaabah, and all unofficial copies of the Quran were ordered destroyed; Uthman carried out the order. After the distribution of the official copies, the other ahruf were dropped and the Quran began to be read in one ''harf''. The Quran which is currently available worldwide is written and recited according to the ''harf'' of Quraysh.<ref name=\"ri\">Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, 1990, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, p. 28-29</ref>\n\nPhilips writes that ''Qira'at'' is primarily a method of pronunciation used in recitations of the Quran. These methods are different from the seven forms, or modes (''ahruf''), in which the Quran was revealed. The methods have been traced back to Muhammad through a number of ''Sahaabah'' (companions) who were noted for their Quranic recitations; they recited the Quran to Muhammad (or in his presence), and received his approval. The ''Sahaabah'' included: \n*Ubayy Ibn Kab]\n*[[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]] \n*Zayd Ibn Thaabit \n*Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud \n*Abu ad-Dardaa\n*Abu Musa al-Ash'aree \nMany of the other Sahaabah learned from them; master Quran commentator Ibn 'Abbaas learned from Ubayy and Zayd.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (pp.&nbsp;29\u201330)\n\nAccording to Philips, in the next generation of Muslims (referred to as ''[[Tabi'in]]'') were many scholars who learned the methods of recitation from the ''Sahaabah'' and taught them to others. Centres of Quranic recitation developed in al-Madeenah, Makkah, Kufa, Basrah and Syria, leading to the development of Quranic recitation as a science. By the mid-eighth century CE, a large number of scholars were considered specialists in the field of recitation. Most of their methods were authenticated by chains of reliable narrators, ending with Muhammad. The methods which were supported by a large number of reliable narrators on each level of their chain were called ''mutawaatir'', and were considered the most accurate. Methods in which the number of narrators were few (or only one) on any level of the chain were known as ''shaadhdh''. Some scholars of the following period began the practice of designating a set number of individual scholars from the previous period as the most noteworthy and accurate. The number seven became popular by the mid-10th century, since it coincided with the number of dialects in which the Quran was revealed.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (p.&nbsp;30)\n\n[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] writes about hadith in Muwatta<ref name=\"muw\"/> that if Ahruf are taken in the context of pronunciation (for which the words are ''lughat'' and ''lahjat''), the content of the hadith rejects this meaning; [[Umar]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah|Hisham]] belonged to the same tribe (the [[Quraysh]]), and members of the same tribe cannot use different pronunciations. Ghamidi questions the hadith which claim \"variant readings\", on the basis of Quranic verses ({{quran-usc-range|87|6-7}}, {{quran-usc-range|75|16-19}}), the Quran was compiled during Muhammad's lifetime and questions the hadith which report its compilation during [[Uthman]]'s reign.<ref name=\"jav\"/> Since most of these narrations are reported by [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]], Imam Layth Ibn Sa'd wrote to [[Imam Malik]]:<ref name=\"jav\"/><ref>[[Ibn Qayyim]], I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in, vol. 3 (Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, n.d.), 96.</ref>\n{{quote|And when we would meet Ibn Shihab, there would arise a difference of opinion in many issues. When any one of us would ask him in writing about some issue, he, in spite of being so learned, would give three very different answers, and he would not even be aware of what he had already said. It is because of this that I have left him \u2013 something which you did not like.}}\n\nAbu 'Ubayd Qasim Ibn Sallam (died 224 [[Hijri year|AH]]) reportedly selected twenty-five readings in his book. The seven readings which are currently notable were selected by [[Abu Bakr Ibn Mujahid]] (died 324 AH, 936 CE) at the end of the third century. It is generally accepted that although their number cannot be ascertained, every reading is Quran which has been reported through a chain of narration and is [[Arabic|linguistically]] correct. Some readings are regarded as ''mutawatir'', but their chains of narration indicate that they are ''ahad'' (isolate) and their narrators are suspect in the eyes of ''[[Biographical evaluation|rijal]]'' authorities.<ref name=\"jav\"/>\n\n==Quranic orthography==\nTo ensure the correct reading of the Quran (particularly for those following the first generation of Muslims), gradual steps were taken to improve its [[orthography]]. This began with the introduction of dots to distinguish similarly-shaped consonants, followed by dots (to indicate different vowels) and [[nunation]] in different-coloured ink from the text. The work was done primarily by Abu'l Aswad ad-Du'al\u00ee (d. 69 AH/688 CE), Na\u1e63r Ibn \u02bf\u0100\u1e63im (d. 89 AH/707 CE) and Ya\u1e25ya Ibn Ya\u02bfmur (d. 129 AH/746 CE). There was initial opposition to any additions to the Quran. Although Ibn \u02bfUmar (73/692) disliked the dotting, others welcomed it because it ensured the proper reading of the Quran as received from Muhammad; the latter view has been accepted by most Muslims throughout the Muslim world since the [[Tabi'un]]. The people of [[Medina|Madinah]] reportedly used red dots for vowels (''[[tanwin]]'', ''[[Shadda|tashdid]]'', ''takhfif'', ''[[Arabic diacritics#Sukun|sukun]]'', ''wa\u1e63l'' and ''madd'') and yellow dots for [[hamza]]s. ''Naqt'' (dotting the ''[[rasm]]''), became a separate subject of study.\n\n=={{anchor|The Ten Readers and their Transmitters}}The ten readers and their transmitters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The ten readers and their transmitters\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" Style=\"background:#efefef;\"|''Qari'' (reader)\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |''Rawi'' (transmitter)\n|-\n!
