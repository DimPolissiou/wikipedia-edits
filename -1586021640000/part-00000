Furthermore, in September 1948 ''SDM Sarajevo'' was joined by Yugoslav footballing legend, [[Miroslav Brozovi\u0107]], who brought in a largely needed level of experience to the new team.  The [[Mostar]]-native previously wore the black and white jersey of [[FK Partizan]], as well as captaining the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national team]].

The team had a dream start with back to back wins against [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and their city rivals [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar]]. This was followed by a draw against the [[European Cup]] runners-up, [[FK Partizan]], in which Sarajevo squandered an early lead.  With seven points from their first three fixtures, Sarajevo was still not considered a title favorite, but that was to change after Brozovi\u0107's boys returned from the Dalmatian coast with a win against [[Hajduk Split]]. Four days later Sarajevo beat [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1945\u20132005)|NK Olimpija]] 2:1 at a sold out Ko\u0161evo stadium. Hard earned wins against [[HNK Rijeka]] and [[Red Star Belgrade]] followed, and by the winter break Sarajevo had won 14 out of their first 20 league fixtures, finishing the year at pole position. The team opened the second part of the season away to [[Dinamo Zagreb]] in the last sixteen of the [[Yugoslav Cup]] winning 1:0 courtesy of a [[Bo\u0161ko Anti\u0107]] stunner.

[[FK Vardar]] was defeated next thanks to a [[Vahidin Musemi\u0107|Musemi\u0107]] brace, while Dinamo dropped points in Rijeka. In the last league fixture of the season Sarajevo hosted [[NK \u010celik]] in front of 30,000 spectators and went on to win 5:2, bringing home the club's first league title.

Team captain Predrag Pa\u0161i\u0107 and tallysman Husref Musemi\u0107 combined by scoring in the next two, crucial matches against Pri\u0161tina and Osijek, and in doing so ensured a win and draw. Musemi\u0107 again snatched a brace in the following fixture against Radni\u010dki, while Merdanovi\u0107 and Had\u017eibegi\u0107 added a goal a piece for a comfortable 4:2 win. The next round saw Hajduk host Rijeka, while Sarajevo travelled to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Stadium]] in Novi Sad to play Vojvodina. Hajduk secured a comfortable route over the visitors, while Sarajevo had a much more difficult time in Novi Sad. Namely, the hosts broke the deadlock after just two minutes of play. Luckily for the huge number of travelling fans, Bo\u0161ko Anti\u0107's men were able to equalize ten minutes from the break through a Jakovljevi\u0107 effort, and to eventually snatch the win seven minutes from time courtesy of a phenomenal volley from the edge of the box by [[Slavi\u0161a Vuki\u0107evi\u0107]].<ref name=\"history1\"/> The maroon-whites now needed five points from their three last fixtures to clinch the title.

Team captain Predrag Pa\u0161i\u0107 and tallysman Husref Musemi\u0107 combined by scoring in the next two, crucial matches against Pri\u0161tina and Osijek, and in doing so ensured a win and draw. Musemi\u0107 again snatched a brace in the following fixture against Radni\u010dki, while Merdanovi\u0107 and Had\u017eibegi\u0107 added a goal a piece for a comfortable 4:2 win. The next round saw Hajduk host Rijeka, while Sarajevo travelled to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Stadium]] in Novi Sad to play Vojvodina. Hajduk secured a comfortable route over the visitors, while Sarajevo had a much more difficult time in Novi Sad. Namely, the hosts broke the deadlock after just two minutes of play. Luckily for the huge number of travelling fans, Bo\u0161ko Anti\u0107's men were able to equalize ten minutes from the break through a Jakovljevi\u0107 effort, and to eventually snatch the win seven minutes from time courtesy of a phenomenal volley from the edge of the box by [[Slavi\u0161a Vuki\u0107evi\u0107]].<ref name=\"history1\"/> The maroon-whites now needed five points from their three last fixtures to clinch the title.

Just three weeks later, Partizan went on the first of many international tours, travelling to [[Czechoslovakia]] where they beat the selection of [[Military of Slovakia|Slovak Army]] with 3\u20131. At the time, just months after the [[World War II]] in Yugoslavia ended, no organized football competition was yet restored, so Partizan played only friendly games and tournaments both home and abroad.

In 1950, the club evolved from a football section of the Army into independent club under the umbrella organization [[JSD Partizan]] (Yugoslav Sports Association Partizan). The first club's president became [[Ratko Vujovi\u0107]]. In 1953, the remaining formal connections between the club and the Army ceased. Although during the 1950s Partizan had a very strong squad, led by national team players like [[Stjepan Bobek|Bobek]], [[Zlatko \u010cajkovski|\u010cajkovski]], [[Milo\u0161 Milutinovi\u0107]], [[Marko Valok]], [[Bruno Belin]], [[Tomislav Kaloperovi\u0107]] and [[Branko Zebec]], the club had a long break without winning a championship, only winning cup titles in 1952, [[1954 Yugoslav Cup|1954]] and [[1956\u201357 Yugoslav Cup|1957]]. Despite the absence of domestic titles, Partizan's great performances on high quality tournaments throughout Europe gained them significant continental reputation. On 4 September 1955, Partizan participated in the first ever [[UEFA Champions League|Champions Cup]] match, in [[Lisbon]] against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]].

In 1958, club left way behind 13 years of playing in blue-red kits and adopted the now famous black and white colors. The change in a club's image and appearance was followed by radical changes in the playing squad. The number of young players, offsprings of Partizan's own youth ranks known as ''Partizanove bebe'' (The Partizan's babies), soon emerged into one of the best generations Europe's ever seen. The rise of the generation began with [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Fahrudin Jusufi]], [[Jovan Miladinovi\u0107]], [[Velibor Vasovi\u0107]], [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Ilija Miti\u0107]], [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] and [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]].

In the first leg, held in [[Prague]], Partizan suffered a hard 4\u20131 defeat.

After the defeat in the finals, club administration failed to operate on a higher level, and Partizan entered a long organizational crisis. All main players signed contracts with biggest western clubs, and the promising generation was scattered. [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]] went to [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]], [[Milan Gali\u0107]] to [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]] to [[FC Nantes]], [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] to [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[Velibor Vasovi\u0107]], who had scored in the final, was transferred to [[Ajax Amsterdam]] where he would come to feature again in the story of the European Cup. This was a period of mediocre results, and for a decade not a single trophy was won. Few players remained from the previous generation \u2013 [[Milan Damjanovi\u0107]], [[Blagoje Paunovi\u0107]] and [[Borivoje \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]]. In a short period of time, numerous managers were in position. The arrival of the talented young players [[Mom\u010dilo Vukoti\u0107]], who came through Partizan's youth ranks, and [[Nenad Bjekovi\u0107]] from [[Proleter Zrenjanin]], announced better days for the ''Black & Whites''.\n\n===The brief return - the first European trophy (1976\u20131982)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ivan Golac scanned clipping.jpg|130px|thumb|right|[[Ivan Golac]] (with ball) and [[Jusuf Hatuni\u0107]].]] -->\nOn 11 July 1976, in [[Ljubljana]], Partizan played the last game of the season against [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911\u20132004)|Olimpija]] and needed a win to clinch the title ahead of rivals [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]].

Unexpectedly, the next 1978\u201379 season turned out to be the worst in Partizan history. They finished 15th in the league, barely avoiding relegation with a 4\u20132 victory against [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]] in the last fixture. The new crisis was serious, which reflected in the results next season, when Partizan finished 13th.

Partizan refused to replay its match, after which the game was awarded 3\u20130 to [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar]], and the title was given to [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]], who got to play in [[1986\u201387 European Cup|1986\u201387]] European Cup. Because of these events, twelve clubs started the next [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League|1986\u201387]] season with a deduction of 6 points, Partizan among them. [[FK Vardar|Vardar]], who had not been deducted 6 points, won the title, and participated in [[1987\u201388 European Cup|1987\u201388]] European Cup. However, after a sequence of appeals and lawsuits which eventually led to Yugoslav Constitutional Court, the original final table of [[1985\u201386 Yugoslav First League|1985\u201386]] season, with Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in mid-1987. Also, the points deduction from [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League|1986\u201387]] season was annulled, and the title was given to Partizan, who headed the table without the deduction. These controversial events prevented the generation of [[Milko \u0110urovski]], [[Fahrudin Omerovi\u0107]], [[Zvonko Varga]], [[Vladimir Vermezovi\u0107]], [[Admir Smaji\u0107]], [[Goran Stevanovi\u0107]], [[Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010di\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Milo\u0161 \u0110elma\u0161]], [[Sre\u010dko Katanec]], [[Fadil Vokrri]] and [[Bajro \u017dupi\u0107]] from showing their full potential in Europe.\n\nPartizan spent the final years in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] undergoing significant organizational changes. In 1989, former goalkeeper [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]] became club president while [[Mirko Marjanovi\u0107]] became the president of Partizan's executive board. Most important Partizan players in this final years were [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], [[Predrag Spasi\u0107]], [[Dragoljub Brnovi\u0107|Dragoljub]] and [[Branko Brnovi\u0107]], [[Budimir Vuja\u010di\u0107]], [[Vujadin Stanojkovi\u0107]], [[Darko Milani\u010d]] and [[D\u017eoni Novak]]. However, this great generation was overshadowed by their crosstown rival [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] and its rampage through domestic league, Europe and the World. Partizan only won the [[1988\u201389 Yugoslav Cup|1989 national cup]], 32 years after the last victory in that competition. The last trophy won before the breakup of Yugoslavia was the 1989 Yugoslav Super Cup, the first and the only one organized. In 1987, Partizan signed [[China PR national football team|Chinese national team]] players [[Jia Xiuquan]] and [[Liu Haiguang]] and they entered history as they, along [[Xie Yuxin]] and [[Gu Guangming]], were the first Chinese footballers ever to have played in Europe.<ref name=\"Foreign\">[http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/196576.htm Saga over As Dong Joins Man Utd] at china.org.cn, 18-1-2007, Retrieved 5-4-2012</ref>\n\n===Dark decade and domestic success (1990s)===\n[[File:Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 2007 b.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Former Partizan striker [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]].]]\n\nAfter the death of President [[Josip Broz Tito]] in 1980, ethnic tension grew in Yugoslavia, with the follow, that in the early 1990s the Yugoslav state began to fall apart, and the civil war broke out. At the end of May in 1992, the [[United Nations Security Council]] imposed [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against the country, which led to political isolation, economic decline and [[hyperinflation]] of the [[Yugoslav dinar]], and finally dislodged Yugoslav football from the international scene. The disintegration of [[Yugoslavia]], the [[Yugoslav wars]] from 1991 to 1995, the resulting difficulties, as well as the sanctions had hit all Yugoslav clubs hard. After the breakup of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] in 1991, a new Yugoslavia was formed out from [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] and was named [[FR Yugoslavia]]. Anyway, Partizan won during the war two titles in a row, in [[1992\u201393 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1993]] and [[1993\u201394 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1994]]. Next two championships Partizan won in [[1995\u201396 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1996]] and [[1996\u201397 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1997]]. But after only few years of peace, the Yugoslav clubs stood again before difficult times. Between 1998 and 1999, peace was broken again, because the situation in [[Kosovo]] worsened with continued clashes between Yugoslav security forces and the [[Kosovo Liberation Army|''U\u00c7K'']]. The confrontations led to the [[Kosovo War]] and finally to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], which started 4 days after the 112th [[Eternal derby (Serbia)|Red Star - Partizan derby]], and this without [[UN Mandate]],<ref>[http://geopolitiker.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/kosovo-europas-mafia-staat/ wordpress.com - Kosovo: Europa\u2019s Mafia Staat]</ref>  and thus without the permission of the [[UN]]. The bombing campaign was criticized, especially for the number of [[Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force|civilian casualties that resulted from the bombing]].<ref>Steven Erlanger, \u2018Human-rights Group Assails Nato For Yugoslavia Bombing Campaign\u2019, ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, June 8, 2000, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-06-08/news/0006080080_1_nato-violated-international-law-civilian-object-nato-forces.html]</ref> By this time, Partizan won in [[1998\u201399 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1999]] a further championship title, again during a war. \n\nDuring these turbulent 1990s, the club won also several national cups, this in 1992, 1994 and 1998. The key man for these trophies was '''[[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107]]'''. He became the most successful manager in the history of Partizan. In 1997, Partizan was reintroduced to European competitions following the lift of the [[UEFA]] ban on clubs from [[FR Yugoslavia]], but while the national team continued where they had stopped in the spring of 1992, the clubs had all their results erased and were treated as the beginners in the European competitions. The decision met with incomprehension among the club officials of the Yugoslav clubs. That decision will have long-term catastrophic consequences for Partizan \u2013 instead of enjoying the merits of its own many-year work, they would get harder opponents from the start and the competition would start already in July. Well, this decade has been marked by numerous team changes and the circle of selling the best players to richer European clubs after just a couple of seasons of first-team football and replacing them with fresh young talents. Many players are credited with the successes of the nineties, such as [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], [[Albert Na\u0111]], [[Dragan \u0106iri\u0107]], [[Zoran Mirkovi\u0107]], [[Sa\u0161a \u0106ur\u010di\u0107]], [[Branko Brnovi\u0107]], [[Goran Pandurovi\u0107]], [[Dra\u017een Boli\u0107]], [[Ni\u0161a Savelji\u0107]], [[Damir \u010cakar]], [[Budimir Vuja\u010di\u0107]], [[Ivan Tomi\u0107]], [[Gjorgji Hristov]], [[\u0110or\u0111e Tomi\u0107]], [[Ivica Kralj]], [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]] and many others.\n\n===Domination in Serbia and reestablishment in Europe (2000\u20132012)===\nThe new millennium has arrived, but the goals remain the same.

Just three weeks later, Partizan went on the first of many international tours, travelling to [[Czechoslovakia]] where they beat the selection of [[Military of Slovakia|Slovak Army]] with 3\u20131. At the time, just months after the [[World War II]] in Yugoslavia ended, no organized football competition was yet restored, so Partizan played only friendly games and tournaments both home and abroad.

In 1950, the club evolved from a football section of the Army into independent club under the umbrella organization [[JSD Partizan]] (Yugoslav Sports Association Partizan). The first club's president became [[Ratko Vujovi\u0107]]. In 1953, the remaining formal connections between the club and the Army ceased. Although during the 1950s Partizan had a very strong squad, led by national team players like [[Stjepan Bobek|Bobek]], [[Zlatko \u010cajkovski|\u010cajkovski]], [[Milo\u0161 Milutinovi\u0107]], [[Marko Valok]], [[Bruno Belin]], [[Tomislav Kaloperovi\u0107]] and [[Branko Zebec]], the club had a long break without winning a championship, only winning cup titles in 1952, [[1954 Yugoslav Cup|1954]] and [[1956\u201357 Yugoslav Cup|1957]]. Despite the absence of domestic titles, Partizan's great performances on high quality tournaments throughout Europe gained them significant continental reputation. On 4 September 1955, Partizan participated in the first ever [[UEFA Champions League|Champions Cup]] match, in [[Lisbon]] against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]]. The final result was 3\u20133, with [[Milo\u0161 Milutinovi\u0107|Milutinovi\u0107]] becoming the first scorer in a most prestigious club competition in Europe.\n\n===Partizan's babies - the first European final (1958\u20131966)===\n\n{| style=\"float: right; width: 160px; border: #99B3FF solid 1px\"\n|-\n| <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n[[File:Soccer Field Transparant.svg|175px]]\n{{Image label|x=0.22|y=0.05|scale=350|text=[[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:Black;\">'''\u0160o\u0161ki\u0107'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.07|y=0.20|scale=350|text=[[Fahrudin Jusufi|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:White;\">'''Jusufi'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.13|y=0.15|scale=350|text=[[Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:White;\">'''Ra\u0161ovi\u0107'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.27|y=0.15|scale=350|text=[[Velibor Vasovi\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:White;\">'''Vasovi\u0107 (C)'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.33|y=0.20|scale=350|text=[[Ljubomir Mihajlovi\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:White;\">'''Mihajlovi\u0107'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.08|y=0.37|scale=350|text=[[Mane Baji\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:Black;\">'''Baji\u0107'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.12|y=0.31|scale=350|text=[[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:Black;\">'''Kova\u010devi\u0107'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.32|y=0.31|scale=350|text=[[Radoslav Be\u010dejac|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:Black;\">'''Be\u010dejac'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.35|y=0.37|scale=350|text=[[Josip Pirmajer|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:Black;\">'''Pirmajer'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.14|y=0.50|scale=350|text=[[Milan Gali\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:White;\">'''Gali\u0107'''</span>]]}}\n{{Image label|x=0.29|y=0.50|scale=350|text=[[Mustafa Hasanagi\u0107|<span style=\"font-size:0.8em; color:White;\">'''Hasanagi\u0107'''</span>]]}}\n</div>\n|-\n| <small>[[1966 European Cup Final]] starting lineup (coach: [[Abdulah Gegi\u0107]])</small>\n|}\nBy the mid-1950s, the first big Partizan generation was well over its peak. Only two titles and four cups in first 15 years of existence were not enough for a club of Partizan's stature, ambition and popularity. In 1958, club left way behind 13 years of playing in blue-red kits and adopted the now famous black and white colors. The change in a club's image and appearance was followed by radical changes in the playing squad. The number of young players, offsprings of Partizan's own youth ranks known as ''Partizanove bebe'' (The Partizan's babies), soon emerged into one of the best generations Europe's ever seen. The rise of the generation began with [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Fahrudin Jusufi]], [[Jovan Miladinovi\u0107]], [[Velibor Vasovi\u0107]], [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Ilija Miti\u0107]], [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] and [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]].

After the defeat in the finals, club administration failed to operate on a higher level, and Partizan entered a long organizational crisis. All main players signed contracts with biggest western clubs, and the promising generation was scattered. [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]] went to [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]], [[Milan Gali\u0107]] to [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]] to [[FC Nantes]], [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] to [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[Velibor Vasovi\u0107]], who had scored in the final, was transferred to [[Ajax Amsterdam]] where he would come to feature again in the story of the European Cup. This was a period of mediocre results, and for a decade not a single trophy was won. Few players remained from the previous generation \u2013 [[Milan Damjanovi\u0107]], [[Blagoje Paunovi\u0107]] and [[Borivoje \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]]. In a short period of time, numerous managers were in position. The arrival of the talented young players [[Mom\u010dilo Vukoti\u0107]], who came through Partizan's youth ranks, and [[Nenad Bjekovi\u0107]] from [[Proleter Zrenjanin]], announced better days for the ''Black & Whites''.\n\n===The brief return - the first European trophy (1976\u20131982)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ivan Golac scanned clipping.jpg|130px|thumb|right|[[Ivan Golac]] (with ball) and [[Jusuf Hatuni\u0107]].]] -->\nOn 11 July 1976, in [[Ljubljana]], Partizan played the last game of the season against [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911\u20132004)|Olimpija]] and needed a win to clinch the title ahead of rivals [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]].

Unexpectedly, the next 1978\u201379 season turned out to be the worst in Partizan history. They finished 15th in the league, barely avoiding relegation with a 4\u20132 victory against [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]] in the last fixture. The new crisis was serious, which reflected in the results next season, when Partizan finished 13th.

Partizan refused to replay its match, after which the game was awarded 3\u20130 to [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar]], and the title was given to [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]], who got to play in [[1986\u201387 European Cup|1986\u201387]] European Cup. Because of these events, twelve clubs started the next [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League|1986\u201387]] season with a deduction of 6 points, Partizan among them. [[FK Vardar|Vardar]], who had not been deducted 6 points, won the title, and participated in [[1987\u201388 European Cup|1987\u201388]] European Cup. However, after a sequence of appeals and lawsuits which eventually led to Yugoslav Constitutional Court, the original final table of [[1985\u201386 Yugoslav First League|1985\u201386]] season, with Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in mid-1987. Also, the points deduction from [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League|1986\u201387]] season was annulled, and the title was given to Partizan, who headed the table without the deduction. These controversial events prevented the generation of [[Milko \u0110urovski]], [[Fahrudin Omerovi\u0107]], [[Zvonko Varga]], [[Vladimir Vermezovi\u0107]], [[Admir Smaji\u0107]], [[Goran Stevanovi\u0107]], [[Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010di\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Milo\u0161 \u0110elma\u0161]], [[Sre\u010dko Katanec]], [[Fadil Vokrri]] and [[Bajro \u017dupi\u0107]] from showing their full potential in Europe.\n\nPartizan spent the final years in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] undergoing significant organizational changes. In 1989, former goalkeeper [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]] became club president while [[Mirko Marjanovi\u0107]] became the president of Partizan's executive board. Most important Partizan players in this final years were [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], [[Predrag Spasi\u0107]], [[Dragoljub Brnovi\u0107|Dragoljub]] and [[Branko Brnovi\u0107]], [[Budimir Vuja\u010di\u0107]], [[Vujadin Stanojkovi\u0107]], [[Darko Milani\u010d]] and [[D\u017eoni Novak]]. However, this great generation was overshadowed by their crosstown rival [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] and its rampage through domestic league, Europe and the World. Partizan only won the [[1988\u201389 Yugoslav Cup|1989 national cup]], 32 years after the last victory in that competition. The last trophy won before the breakup of Yugoslavia was the 1989 Yugoslav Super Cup, the first and the only one organized. In 1987, Partizan signed [[China PR national football team|Chinese national team]] players [[Jia Xiuquan]] and [[Liu Haiguang]] and they entered history as they, along [[Xie Yuxin]] and [[Gu Guangming]], were the first Chinese footballers ever to have played in Europe.<ref name=\"Foreign\">[http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/196576.htm Saga over As Dong Joins Man Utd] at china.org.cn, 18-1-2007, Retrieved 5-4-2012</ref>\n\n===Dark decade and domestic success (1990s)===\n[[File:Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 2007 b.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Former Partizan striker [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]].]]\n\nAfter the death of President [[Josip Broz Tito]] in 1980, ethnic tension grew in Yugoslavia, with the follow, that in the early 1990s the Yugoslav state began to fall apart, and the civil war broke out. At the end of May in 1992, the [[United Nations Security Council]] imposed [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against the country, which led to political isolation, economic decline and [[hyperinflation]] of the [[Yugoslav dinar]], and finally dislodged Yugoslav football from the international scene. The disintegration of [[Yugoslavia]], the [[Yugoslav wars]] from 1991 to 1995, the resulting difficulties, as well as the sanctions had hit all Yugoslav clubs hard. After the breakup of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] in 1991, a new Yugoslavia was formed out from [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] and was named [[FR Yugoslavia]]. Anyway, Partizan won during the war two titles in a row, in [[1992\u201393 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1993]] and [[1993\u201394 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1994]]. Next two championships Partizan won in [[1995\u201396 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1996]] and [[1996\u201397 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1997]]. But after only few years of peace, the Yugoslav clubs stood again before difficult times. Between 1998 and 1999, peace was broken again, because the situation in [[Kosovo]] worsened with continued clashes between Yugoslav security forces and the [[Kosovo Liberation Army|''U\u00c7K'']]. The confrontations led to the [[Kosovo War]] and finally to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], which started 4 days after the 112th [[Eternal derby (Serbia)|Red Star - Partizan derby]], and this without [[UN Mandate]],<ref>[http://geopolitiker.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/kosovo-europas-mafia-staat/ wordpress.com - Kosovo: Europa\u2019s Mafia Staat]</ref>  and thus without the permission of the [[UN]]. The bombing campaign was criticized, especially for the number of [[Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force|civilian casualties that resulted from the bombing]].<ref>Steven Erlanger, \u2018Human-rights Group Assails Nato For Yugoslavia Bombing Campaign\u2019, ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, June 8, 2000, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-06-08/news/0006080080_1_nato-violated-international-law-civilian-object-nato-forces.html]</ref> By this time, Partizan won in [[1998\u201399 First League of FR Yugoslavia|1999]] a further championship title, again during a war. \n\nDuring these turbulent 1990s, the club won also several national cups, this in 1992, 1994 and 1998. The key man for these trophies was '''[[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107]]'''. He became the most successful manager in the history of Partizan. In 1997, Partizan was reintroduced to European competitions following the lift of the [[UEFA]] ban on clubs from [[FR Yugoslavia]], but while the national team continued where they had stopped in the spring of 1992, the clubs had all their results erased and were treated as the beginners in the European competitions. The decision met with incomprehension among the club officials of the Yugoslav clubs. That decision will have long-term catastrophic consequences for Partizan \u2013 instead of enjoying the merits of its own many-year work, they would get harder opponents from the start and the competition would start already in July. Well, this decade has been marked by numerous team changes and the circle of selling the best players to richer European clubs after just a couple of seasons of first-team football and replacing them with fresh young talents. Many players are credited with the successes of the nineties, such as [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]], [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], [[Albert Na\u0111]], [[Dragan \u0106iri\u0107]], [[Zoran Mirkovi\u0107]], [[Sa\u0161a \u0106ur\u010di\u0107]], [[Branko Brnovi\u0107]], [[Goran Pandurovi\u0107]], [[Dra\u017een Boli\u0107]], [[Ni\u0161a Savelji\u0107]], [[Damir \u010cakar]], [[Budimir Vuja\u010di\u0107]], [[Ivan Tomi\u0107]], [[Gjorgji Hristov]], [[\u0110or\u0111e Tomi\u0107]], [[Ivica Kralj]], [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]] and many others.\n\n===Domination in Serbia and reestablishment in Europe (2000\u20132012)===\nThe new millennium has arrived, but the goals remain the same.

In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Muslim army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her.

When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting.

She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the religious community of Aphrodite originated in Phoenicia (modern day Lebanon) and came to Greeks from there. He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.\n*[[Tanit]] is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling \"Tanith\", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal (\"face of Baal\") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).\n\n==South Asia==\n[[File:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|Image of [[Durga]], shown riding her tiger and attacking the demon [[Mahishasura]].]]\n\n=== Razia Sultana ===\n\n*[[Razia Sultana]], usually referred to in history as Razia Sultan or Razia Sultana, was the Sultana of Delhi in India from 1236 to 1240.

She was born, as Rudrama, to King Ganapathideva (or Ganapatideva, or Ganapathi Devudu). As Ganapathideva had no sons, Rudrama was formally designated as a son through the ancient Putrika ceremony and given the male name of Rudradeva. When she was only fourteen years old, Rani Rudrama Devi succeeded her father. Rudramadevi was married to Veerabhadra, Eastern Chalukyan prince of Nidadavolu.<ref>History of the Minor Ch\u0101\u1e37ukya Families in Medieval \u0100ndhrad\u0113\u015ba By Kolluru Suryanarayana [https://books.google.com/books?id=f6seAAAAMAAJ&q=kakatiya+chalukya+prince+marriage&dq=kakatiya+chalukya+prince+marriage&pgis=1]</ref>\n\n===Rani Mangammal===\n*[[Rani Mangammal ]] (1689\u20131704) was a queen regent on behalf of her grandson, in the Madurai Nayak kingdom in present-day Madurai, India, towards the end of the century. She was a popular administrator and is still widely remembered as a maker of roads and avenues, and a builder of temples, tanks, and choultries with many of her public works still in use. She is also known for her diplomatic and political skills and successful military campaigns. The capital of Madurai Kingdom during her times was Tiruchy.\n\n===Rani Velu Nachiyar===\n*Rani [[Velu Nachiyar]] (Tamil: \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0bb2\u0bc1 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd) was an 18th-century Indian Queen from Sivaganga. Rani Velu Nachiyar was the first Queen to fight against the British in India, even preceding the famous Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi. She was the princess of Ramanathapuram and the daughter of Chellamuthu Sethupathy. She married the king of Siva Gangai and they had a daughter - Vellachi Nachiar. When her husband Muthuvaduganathaperiya Udaiyathevar was killed, she was drawn into battle. Her husband and his second wife were killed by a few British soldiers and the son of the Nawab of Arcot. She escaped with her daughter, lived under the protection of Hyder Ali at Virupachi near Dindigul for eight years. During this period, she formed an army and sought an alliance with Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali with the aim of attacking the British. In 1780, Rani Velu Nachiyar fought the British with military assistance from Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali and won the battle. When Velu Nachiyar finds the place where the British stock their ammunition, she builds the first human bomb. A faithful follower, Kuyili douses herself in oil, lights herself and walks into the storehouse. Rani Velu Nachiyar formed a woman's army named \u201cudaiyaal\u201d in honour of her adopted daughter \u2014 Udaiyaal, who died detonating a British arsenal. Nachiar was one of the few rulers who regained her kingdom and ruled it for 10 more years.\n\n===Chand Bibi===\n*[[Chand Bibi]] (1550\u20131599), also known as Chand Khatun or Chand Sultana, was an Indian Muslim woman warrior. She acted as the Regent of Bijapur (1580\u201390) and Regent of Ahmednagar (1596\u201399). Chand Bibi is best known for defending Ahmednagar against the Mughal forces of Emperor Akbar.\n\n===Abbakka Rani===\n*[[Abbakka Rani]] or Abbakka Mahadevi was the queen of Tulunadu who fought the Portuguese in the latter half of the 16th century. She belonged to the Chowta dynasty who ruled over the area from the temple town of Moodabidri.\n\nIn Dakshina Kannada\u2019s Bantwal taluk, a historian has erected a museum in the memory of a 16th-century warrior queen. The man behind the museum, called Tulu Baduku Museum, is Prof. Thukaram Poojary and his subject is Rani Abbakka Chowta of Ullal.\n\nThe only woman in history to confront, fight and repeatedly defeat the Portuguese, Rani Abbakka\u2019s unflagging courage and indomitable spirit are at par with the legendary Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi, Rani Rudramma Devi of Warangal and Rani Chennamma of Kittur.

She is considered to be the epitome of Kannada women pride, with the same standing as Kittur Chennamma and Keladi Chennamma.\n\nDuring the reign of Madakari Nayaka, the city of Chitradurga was besieged by the troops of Hyder Ali (1754-1779). A chance sighting of a man entering the Chitradurga fort through a hole in the rocks led to a plan by Hyder Ali to send his soldiers through that hole. The Guard (Kahale Mudda Hanuma, who was on duty near that hole) had gone home to have his lunch. During his meal he needed some water to drink, so his wife Obavva went to collect water in a pot[3] from a pond which was near the hole in the rocks, halfway up the hill.[4] She noticed the army trying to enter the fort through the hole. She used the Onake or pestle (a wooden long club meant for pounding paddy grains) to kill the soldiers one by one by hitting them on the head and then quietly moving the dead without raising the suspicions of the rest of the troops. Mudda Hanuma, Obavva's husband, returned from lunch, was shocked to see Obavva standing with a blood stained Onake and several of the enemies' dead bodies around her. Later, the same day, she was found dead either due to shock or having been killed by the enemy soldiers.[1] She belonged to the Holayas (Chalavadi) community.[5] Though her brave attempt saved the fort this time, Madakari could not resist the attack by Hyder Ali during 1779, when the fort of Chitradurga was lost to Hyder Ali.[6]\n\n===Begum Samru===\n*[[Begum Samru]] (c. 1753\u20131836), also known as Zebunissa, Farzana, and Joanna after baptism, started her career as a Nautch girl in 18th century India, and eventually became the ruler of Sardhana, a principality near Meerut. Later on, she played a key role in the politics and power struggle in 18th and 19th century India. She is also regarded as the only Roman Catholic Ruler in India.\n\n===Kittur Chennamma===\n*[[Kittur Chennamma]] (1778\u20131829) was the queen of the princely state of Kittur in Karnataka. Her legacy and first victory are still commemorated in Kittur, during the Kittur Utsava of every 22\u201324 October. The festival is similar to the Mysore Dasara.\n\nChennamma\u2019s husband died in 1824, leaving her with a son and a state full of volatility. This was followed by her son\u2019s death in 1824. Rani Chennamma was left with the state of Kittur and an uphill task to save it from the British. Following the death of her husband and son, Rani Chennamma adopted Shivalingappa in the year 1824 and made him the heir to the throne. This irked the East India Company, who ordered Shivalingappa\u2019s expulsion, on the pretext of the Doctrine of Lapse. This doctrine was based on the idea that in case the ruler of an independent state died childless, the right of ruling the State reverted or \u2018lapsed\u2019 to the sovereign. The state of Kittur came under the administration of Dharwad collectorate in charge of St John Thackeray of which Mr. Chaplin was the commissioner, both of whom did not recognize the new ruler and regent and notified Kittur to accept the British regime.\n\nRani Chennamma sent a letter to Mountstuart Elphinstone, Lieutenant-Governor of the Bombay Presidency pleading her cause, but the request was turned down, and war broke out.[2] The British tried to confiscate the treasure and jewels of Kittur, valued at around 1.5 million rupees.[3] They attacked with a force of 20,797 men and 437 guns, mainly from the third troop of Madras Native Horse Artillery.[4]\n\nIn the first round of war, during October 1824, British forces lost heavily and St John Thackeray, collector and political agent,[5] was killed in the war.[2] Amatur Balappa, a lieutenant of Chennamma, was mainly responsible for his killing and losses to British forces.[6] Two British officers, Sir Walter Elliot and Mr. Stevenson[5] were also taken as hostages.[2] Rani Chennamma released them with an understanding with Chaplin that the war would be terminated but Chaplin continued the war with more forces.[2] During the second assault, Subcollector of Solapur, Mr. Munro, nephew of Thomas Munro was killed.[5] Rani Chennamma fought fiercely with the aid of her lieutenant, Sangolli Rayanna, but was ultimately captured and imprisoned at Bailhongal Fort, where she died on 2 February 1829.[2] Chennamma was also helped by her lieutenant Gurusiddappa in the war against British.[7]\n\nSangolli Rayanna continued the guerrilla war to 1829, in vain, until his capture.[2] He wanted to install the adopted boy Shivalingappa as the ruler of Kittur, but Sangolli Rayanna was caught and hanged. Shivalingappa was arrested by the British.[2] Chennamma's legacy and first victory are still commemorated in Kittur, during the Kittur Utsava was held on {{nowrap|22\u201324 oct}} annually.\n\n===Rani Lakshmibai===\n*[[Rani Lakshmibai]] known as Jhansi Ki Rani, was the queen of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha-ruled]] the princely state of Jhansi, was one of the leading figures of the India  Rebellion of 1857, and a symbol of resistance to British rule in India.\n\n===Rani Durgavati===\n*[[Rani Durgavati]] was born in the family of famous [[Rajput]] Chandel Emperor Keerat Rai.\n\n===Keladi Chennamma===\n*[[Keladi Chennamma]] was the daughter of Siddappa Setty of Kundapur. She became the queen of Keladi Nayaka dynasty who fought the Mughal Army of Aurangzeb from her base in the kingdom of Keladi in the Shimoga district of Karnataka State, India. Her rule lasted for 25 years and Keladi kingdom was probably the last to lose autonomy to Mysore rulers and subsequently to British.\n\n===Belawadi Mallamma===\n*[[Belawadi Mallamma]], to defend her husband's kingdom, she fought against the Maratha king [[Shivaji Maharaj]].\n\n===Unniyarcha===\n*[[Unniyarcha]]: She was a chekava/[[Ezhava]] woman warrior from [[Kerala]] famous for her valour and beauty.\n\n===Hinduism Mythology===\n*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|\"the inaccessible\"<ref>\"Durga.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2007.

According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon.

The name Kali comes from ''k\u0101la'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means \"the black one\".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In K\u0101li's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.<ref>D. Kinsley p. 118.</ref>  Durga, in need of help, summons K\u0101li to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess K\u0101li at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.\n* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] (\"the killer of demon Chanda and Munda\") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] (\"Mothers\").\n*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made.

The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Muslim army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.\n\n*[[Nusaybah bint Ka\u2019ab]], also known as [[Umm Ammarah]] (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam.

But after the Muslim archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism.

She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the religious community of Aphrodite originated in Phoenicia (modern day Lebanon) and came to Greeks from there. He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.\n*[[Tanit]] is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling \"Tanith\", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal (\"face of Baal\") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).\n\n==South Asia==\n[[File:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|Image of [[Durga]], shown riding her tiger and attacking the demon [[Mahishasura]].]]\n\n=== Razia Sultana ===\n\n*[[Razia Sultana]], usually referred to in history as Razia Sultan or Razia Sultana, was the Sultana of Delhi in India from 1236 to 1240.

She was born, as Rudrama, to King Ganapathideva (or Ganapatideva, or Ganapathi Devudu). As Ganapathideva had no sons, Rudrama was formally designated as a son through the ancient Putrika ceremony and given the male name of Rudradeva. When she was only fourteen years old, Rani Rudrama Devi succeeded her father. Rudramadevi was married to Veerabhadra, Eastern Chalukyan prince of Nidadavolu.<ref>History of the Minor Ch\u0101\u1e37ukya Families in Medieval \u0100ndhrad\u0113\u015ba By Kolluru Suryanarayana [https://books.google.com/books?id=f6seAAAAMAAJ&q=kakatiya+chalukya+prince+marriage&dq=kakatiya+chalukya+prince+marriage&pgis=1]</ref>\n\n===Rani Mangammal===\n*[[Rani Mangammal ]] (1689\u20131704) was a queen regent on behalf of her grandson, in the Madurai Nayak kingdom in present-day Madurai, India, towards the end of the century. She was a popular administrator and is still widely remembered as a maker of roads and avenues, and a builder of temples, tanks, and choultries with many of her public works still in use. She is also known for her diplomatic and political skills and successful military campaigns. The capital of Madurai Kingdom during her times was Tiruchy.\n\n===Rani Velu Nachiyar===\n*Rani [[Velu Nachiyar]] (Tamil: \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0bb2\u0bc1 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd) was an 18th-century Indian Queen from Sivaganga. Rani Velu Nachiyar was the first Queen to fight against the British in India, even preceding the famous Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi. She was the princess of Ramanathapuram and the daughter of Chellamuthu Sethupathy. She married the king of Siva Gangai and they had a daughter - Vellachi Nachiar. When her husband Muthuvaduganathaperiya Udaiyathevar was killed, she was drawn into battle. Her husband and his second wife were killed by a few British soldiers and the son of the Nawab of Arcot. She escaped with her daughter, lived under the protection of Hyder Ali at Virupachi near Dindigul for eight years. During this period, she formed an army and sought an alliance with Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali with the aim of attacking the British. In 1780, Rani Velu Nachiyar fought the British with military assistance from Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali and won the battle. When Velu Nachiyar finds the place where the British stock their ammunition, she builds the first human bomb. A faithful follower, Kuyili douses herself in oil, lights herself and walks into the storehouse. Rani Velu Nachiyar formed a woman's army named \u201cudaiyaal\u201d in honour of her adopted daughter \u2014 Udaiyaal, who died detonating a British arsenal. Nachiar was one of the few rulers who regained her kingdom and ruled it for 10 more years.\n\n===Chand Bibi===\n*[[Chand Bibi]] (1550\u20131599), also known as Chand Khatun or Chand Sultana, was an Indian Muslim woman warrior. She acted as the Regent of Bijapur (1580\u201390) and Regent of Ahmednagar (1596\u201399). Chand Bibi is best known for defending Ahmednagar against the Mughal forces of Emperor Akbar.\n\n===Abbakka Rani===\n*[[Abbakka Rani]] or Abbakka Mahadevi was the queen of Tulunadu who fought the Portuguese in the latter half of the 16th century. She belonged to the Chowta dynasty who ruled over the area from the temple town of Moodabidri.\n\nIn Dakshina Kannada\u2019s Bantwal taluk, a historian has erected a museum in the memory of a 16th-century warrior queen. The man behind the museum, called Tulu Baduku Museum, is Prof. Thukaram Poojary and his subject is Rani Abbakka Chowta of Ullal.\n\nThe only woman in history to confront, fight and repeatedly defeat the Portuguese, Rani Abbakka\u2019s unflagging courage and indomitable spirit are at par with the legendary Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi, Rani Rudramma Devi of Warangal and Rani Chennamma of Kittur.

She is considered to be the epitome of Kannada women pride, with the same standing as Kittur Chennamma and Keladi Chennamma.\n\nDuring the reign of Madakari Nayaka, the city of Chitradurga was besieged by the troops of Hyder Ali (1754-1779). A chance sighting of a man entering the Chitradurga fort through a hole in the rocks led to a plan by Hyder Ali to send his soldiers through that hole. The Guard (Kahale Mudda Hanuma, who was on duty near that hole) had gone home to have his lunch. During his meal he needed some water to drink, so his wife Obavva went to collect water in a pot[3] from a pond which was near the hole in the rocks, halfway up the hill.[4] She noticed the army trying to enter the fort through the hole. She used the Onake or pestle (a wooden long club meant for pounding paddy grains) to kill the soldiers one by one by hitting them on the head and then quietly moving the dead without raising the suspicions of the rest of the troops. Mudda Hanuma, Obavva's husband, returned from lunch, was shocked to see Obavva standing with a blood stained Onake and several of the enemies' dead bodies around her. Later, the same day, she was found dead either due to shock or having been killed by the enemy soldiers.[1] She belonged to the Holayas (Chalavadi) community.[5] Though her brave attempt saved the fort this time, Madakari could not resist the attack by Hyder Ali during 1779, when the fort of Chitradurga was lost to Hyder Ali.[6]\n\n===Begum Samru===\n*[[Begum Samru]] (c. 1753\u20131836), also known as Zebunissa, Farzana, and Joanna after baptism, started her career as a Nautch girl in 18th century India, and eventually became the ruler of Sardhana, a principality near Meerut. Later on, she played a key role in the politics and power struggle in 18th and 19th century India. She is also regarded as the only Roman Catholic Ruler in India.\n\n===Kittur Chennamma===\n*[[Kittur Chennamma]] (1778\u20131829) was the queen of the princely state of Kittur in Karnataka. Her legacy and first victory are still commemorated in Kittur, during the Kittur Utsava of every 22\u201324 October. The festival is similar to the Mysore Dasara.\n\nChennamma\u2019s husband died in 1824, leaving her with a son and a state full of volatility. This was followed by her son\u2019s death in 1824. Rani Chennamma was left with the state of Kittur and an uphill task to save it from the British. Following the death of her husband and son, Rani Chennamma adopted Shivalingappa in the year 1824 and made him the heir to the throne. This irked the East India Company, who ordered Shivalingappa\u2019s expulsion, on the pretext of the Doctrine of Lapse. This doctrine was based on the idea that in case the ruler of an independent state died childless, the right of ruling the State reverted or \u2018lapsed\u2019 to the sovereign. The state of Kittur came under the administration of Dharwad collectorate in charge of St John Thackeray of which Mr. Chaplin was the commissioner, both of whom did not recognize the new ruler and regent and notified Kittur to accept the British regime.\n\nRani Chennamma sent a letter to Mountstuart Elphinstone, Lieutenant-Governor of the Bombay Presidency pleading her cause, but the request was turned down, and war broke out.[2] The British tried to confiscate the treasure and jewels of Kittur, valued at around 1.5 million rupees.[3] They attacked with a force of 20,797 men and 437 guns, mainly from the third troop of Madras Native Horse Artillery.[4]\n\nIn the first round of war, during October 1824, British forces lost heavily and St John Thackeray, collector and political agent,[5] was killed in the war.[2] Amatur Balappa, a lieutenant of Chennamma, was mainly responsible for his killing and losses to British forces.[6] Two British officers, Sir Walter Elliot and Mr. Stevenson[5] were also taken as hostages.[2] Rani Chennamma released them with an understanding with Chaplin that the war would be terminated but Chaplin continued the war with more forces.[2] During the second assault, Subcollector of Solapur, Mr. Munro, nephew of Thomas Munro was killed.[5] Rani Chennamma fought fiercely with the aid of her lieutenant, Sangolli Rayanna, but was ultimately captured and imprisoned at Bailhongal Fort, where she died on 2 February 1829.[2] Chennamma was also helped by her lieutenant Gurusiddappa in the war against British.[7]\n\nSangolli Rayanna continued the guerrilla war to 1829, in vain, until his capture.[2] He wanted to install the adopted boy Shivalingappa as the ruler of Kittur, but Sangolli Rayanna was caught and hanged. Shivalingappa was arrested by the British.[2] Chennamma's legacy and first victory are still commemorated in Kittur, during the Kittur Utsava was held on {{nowrap|22\u201324 oct}} annually.\n\n===Rani Lakshmibai===\n*[[Rani Lakshmibai]] known as Jhansi Ki Rani, was the queen of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha-ruled]] the princely state of Jhansi, was one of the leading figures of the India  Rebellion of 1857, and a symbol of resistance to British rule in India.\n\n===Rani Durgavati===\n*[[Rani Durgavati]] was born in the family of famous [[Rajput]] Chandel Emperor Keerat Rai.\n\n===Keladi Chennamma===\n*[[Keladi Chennamma]] was the daughter of Siddappa Setty of Kundapur. She became the queen of Keladi Nayaka dynasty who fought the Mughal Army of Aurangzeb from her base in the kingdom of Keladi in the Shimoga district of Karnataka State, India. Her rule lasted for 25 years and Keladi kingdom was probably the last to lose autonomy to Mysore rulers and subsequently to British.\n\n===Belawadi Mallamma===\n*[[Belawadi Mallamma]], to defend her husband's kingdom, she fought against the Maratha king [[Shivaji Maharaj]].\n\n===Unniyarcha===\n*[[Unniyarcha]]: She was a chekava/[[Ezhava]] woman warrior from [[Kerala]] famous for her valour and beauty.\n\n===Hinduism Mythology===\n*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|\"the inaccessible\"<ref>\"Durga.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2007.

According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon.

The name Kali comes from ''k\u0101la'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means \"the black one\".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In K\u0101li's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.<ref>D. Kinsley p. 118.</ref>  Durga, in need of help, summons K\u0101li to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess K\u0101li at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.\n* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] (\"the killer of demon Chanda and Munda\") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] (\"Mothers\").\n*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made.
