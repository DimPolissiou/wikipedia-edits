The channel also houses educational content via a segment known as ''Michael's Toys''. In these videos, Stevens investigates tools and toys that are useful for explaining scientific or mathematical phenomena. The channel was renamed to D!NG on May 12, 2019, seemingly due to the channel being demonetized for having a name that wasn't considered advertiser friendly.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garcia |first1=Elijah |title=Vsauce Experimental Channel Changes Name From 'DONG' To 'D!NG', Fearing Demonetization |url=https://mammothgamers.com/2019/05/vsauce-experimental-channel-changes-name-from-dong-to-dng-fearing-demonetization/ |website=Mammoth Gamers |accessdate=18 May 2019 |date=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}\nExcept for ''BiDiPi'' and some older videos, much of the music used in Vsauce content was created by Jake Chudnow.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Stevens|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2tKg3E53DM|title=How Much Money is There on Earth?|publisher=YouTube|work=Vsauce|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}: \"''music by https://www.youtube.com/JakeChudnow''\".</ref> Since mid-2014, Vsauce also uses music from the public domain music site audionetwork.com.

Jake made much of the music in the earlier \"The Key of Awesome\" music videos. Because of this, Chudnow gives Vsauce exclusive rights to his music, and all Vsauce channels use his music in their videos. One of the most recognizable pieces of his music is \"Moon Men\", which is used in the original Vsauce channel and is often played whenever Stevens poses a mysterious question or makes a mysterious statement. Other pieces of music used by the channels include \"145-(Poodles)\", \"Sunday\", \"It's Good to be D\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Darwin\", \"Carlin Dream\", \"Lions Tigers and Apes Part II\", \"Hanami\", \"Pressed Pennies\", \"Keith\" and \"Shona\". They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

The channel also houses educational content via a segment known as ''Michael's Toys''. In these videos, Stevens investigates tools and toys that are useful for explaining scientific or mathematical phenomena. The channel was renamed to D!NG on May 12, 2019, seemingly due to the channel being demonetized for having a name that wasn't considered advertiser friendly.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garcia |first1=Elijah |title=Vsauce Experimental Channel Changes Name From 'DONG' To 'D!NG', Fearing Demonetization |url=https://mammothgamers.com/2019/05/vsauce-experimental-channel-changes-name-from-dong-to-dng-fearing-demonetization/ |website=Mammoth Gamers |accessdate=18 May 2019 |date=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}\nExcept for ''BiDiPi'' and some older videos, much of the music used in Vsauce content was created by Jake Chudnow.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Stevens|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2tKg3E53DM|title=How Much Money is There on Earth?|publisher=YouTube|work=Vsauce|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}: \"''music by https://www.youtube.com/JakeChudnow''\".</ref> Since mid-2014, Vsauce also uses music from the public domain music site audionetwork.com.

Jake made much of the music in the earlier \"The Key of Awesome\" music videos. Because of this, Chudnow gives Vsauce exclusive rights to his music, and all Vsauce channels use his music in their videos. One of the most recognizable pieces of his music is \"Moon Men\", which is used in the original Vsauce channel and is often played whenever Stevens poses a mysterious question or makes a mysterious statement. Other pieces of music used by the channels include \"145-(Poodles)\", \"Sunday\", \"It's Good to be D\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Darwin\", \"Carlin Dream\", \"Lions Tigers and Apes Part II\", \"Hanami\", \"Pressed Pennies\", \"Keith\" and \"Shona\". They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

He was a supporter of Pulteney in opposition to Walpole, and was briefly part of an Administration. He was [[Father of the House]] from 1762.\n\n==Early life==\nRushout was the fourth son of [[Sir James Rushout, 1st Baronet]] and his wife Alice Pitt, daughter of Edmund Pitt. His elder brother [[Sir James Rushout, 2nd Baronet|James]] succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father. <ref name=Cokayne3>{{Citation| editor-last=Cokayne| editor-first=George Edward |year=1903 | title= Complete Baronetage volume 3 (1649-1664)  | url=   https://archive.org/details/cu31924092524390/page/n229 | volume=3| location=Exeter | publisher=William Pollard and Co| pages=| accessdate = 9 October 2018}}</ref> He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] in 1698, and joined the army. He was a cornet in the [[Horse Guards Regiment|Royal Horse Guards]] in 1705 and lieutenant in 1706. In 1710 he became captain. On the death of his nephew, the third baronet, on 21 September 1711 he succeeded to the [[Rushout baronets|baronetcy]] and most of the family's estates in Worcestershire. He resigned his army commission in January 1712 which he later claimed was to pre-empt his dismissal under the Duke of Ormond's policy of weeding out Whig officers in order to defeat the Hanoverian succession.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url =http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/rushout-sir-john-1685-1775 | title= RUSHOUT, Sir John, 4th Bt.

He voted against the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. At the [[1713 British general election]], he stood without success at Evesham, but was returned unopposed for Malmesbury again. He voted  against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March 1714 and acted as a teller for the Whig side on the Harwich election petition on 16 July 1714.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nAt the [[1715 British general election]], Rushout was returned again as MP for Malmesbury. He voted against the septennial bill, but for the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts. He was absent from the vote on the peerage bill. At the [[1722 British general election]], he was returned for  both Malmesbury and [[Evesham (UK Parliament constituency)|Evesham]]. However he was unseated on petition at Malmesbury  on 13 December 1722, and so took up his seat at Evesham. He initiated the House of Commons inquiry into the Atterbury plot, and in 1725 sponsored the complaint leading to Lord Macclesfield's impeachment. He then followed his friend, [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|William Pulteney]], into opposition. He spoke against a vote of credit on 25 March 1726, and introduced a bill against election bribery on 27 April which was lost in the House of Lords after being passed in the Commons. He was returned as MP for Evesham at the [[1727 British general election]] and was a lieutenant to Pulteney, playing a leading role in the Whig opposition. He acted as Pulteney's second in his duel with Lord Hervey in 1731. He chaired a select committee of the House of Commons, whose report led to the passing of the Molasses Act. During the excise bill crisis in 1733 he was put down as secretary at war in the list of a new ministry prepared by the opposition leaders.

Unlike traditional parties, they also do not belong to international organizations of like-minded parties, and they do not use similar terms to describe themselves.{{sfn|Norris|2005|pp=43\u201344}}\n\n[[Cas Mudde]] argues that two definitions can be given of the \"populist radical right\": a maximum and a minimum one, with the \"maximum\" group being a subgroup of the \"minimum\" group. The minimum definition describes what [[Michael Freeden]] has called the \"core concept\"{{Efn|Freeden has developed in 1996 the idea that every ideology has \"core\" and \"peripheral\" concepts. Building on his work, Terance Ball (1999) has given the following definition: \"A core concept is one that is both central to, and constitutive of, a particular ideology and therefore of the ideological community to which it gives inspiration and identity. For example, the concept of 'class' (and of course 'class struggle') is a key or core concept in Marxism, as 'gender' is in feminism, and 'liberty' (or 'individual liberty') is in liberalism, and so on through the list of leading ideologies.\"|name=|group=}} of the right-wing populist ideology, that is the concept shared by all parties generally included in the family. Looking at the primary literature, Mudde concludes that the core concept of right-populism \"is undoubtedly the \"[[nation]]\". \"This concept\", he explains, \"also certainly functions as a \"coat-hanger\" for most other ideological features. Consequently, the minimum definition of the party family should be based on the key concept, the nation\". He however rejects the use of \"[[nationalism]]\" as a \"core ideology\" of right-wing populism on the ground that there are also purely \"civic\" or \"liberal\" forms of nationalism, preferring instead the term \"[[nativism (politics)|nativism]]\": a xenophobic form of nationalism asserting that \"states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (\"the nation\"), and that non-native elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogeneous nation-state\". Mudde further argues that \"while nativism could include racist arguments, it can also be non-racist (including and excluding on the basis of culture or even religion)\", and that the term nativism does not reduce the parties to mere single-issue parties, such as the term \"anti-immigrant\" does. In the maximum definition, to nativism is added [[authoritarianism]]\u2014an attitude, not necessary anti-democratic or automatic, to prefer \"[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]\" and the submission to authority{{Efn|[[Cas Mudde|Mudde]]: authoritarianism \"is the belief in a strictly ordered society, in which infringements of authority are to be punished severely. In this interpretation, [it] includes law and order and \u201cpunitive conventional moralism.\u201d It does not necessarily mean an anti-democratic attitude, but neither does it preclude one. In addition, the authoritarian\u2019s submission to authority, established or not, is \u201cnot absolute, automatic, nor blind\u201d.

Right-wing populism has been fostered by RSS which stands against persecution of Hindus by various [[History of India|invading forces over the centuries]] and have also been attributed to the concept of  [[Hindutva]]. It vows to protect the ancient religion and culture of [[Hinduism]] and have strong views against destruction of its ancient heritage, in India.  BJP became a significant force in the state legislative assemblies and in the parliament in the 1990s by raising the issue of  Ram Mandir (temple) establishment  by demolishing the existing Babri Masjid (allegedly constructed by demolishing a Hindu temple) in [[Ayodhya]], in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. BJP and other conservative right wing organization such as [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]], [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]] etc. argues that the Masjid was built by [[Babur]], the first Mughal emperor in India in 1526, by demolishing a Ram temple. This issue is known as the [[Ayodhya dispute|Ayodhya Dispute]] for which the final judgement was declared by the Supreme Court of India on 9 November 2019. The Supreme Court of India ordered the disputed land (2.77 acres) to be handed over to a trust (to be created by Government of India) to build the Ram Janmabhoomi (revered as the birthplace of Hindu deity, Ram) temple. The court also ordered the government to give an alternate 5 acres (almost double that of the Ram Janmabhumi) of land in another place to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.\n\nIn recently concluded [[2019 Indian general election]], the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP have swept across the elections with unprecedented majority of 353 seats by gaining popularity across India and reducing the United Progressive Alliance led by Indian National Congress to only 91 seats.\n\n==== Japan ====\nPrime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] and former Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] are both right-wing nationalists and populists.\n\nIn a speech to [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] lawmakers in Tokyo on March 8, 2019, [[Steve Bannon]] said that \u201cPrime Minister Abe is a great hero to the grassroots, the populist, and the nationalist movement throughout the world.\u201d<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/03/08/national/politics-diplomacy/ex-adviser-steve-bannon-confident-donald-trump-win-2020-despite-probes/#.XILevy2ZPOR], Ex-adviser Steve Bannon says Abe was 'Trump before Trump,' urges him to play hardball with China, Japan Times, 8 March 2019.</ref>\n\n==== Pakistan ====\nThe recent wave of right-wing populism is in Pakistan in the form of [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf]] (PTI).<ref name=\"Daily Times\">{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/284544/populism-visits-pakistan/|title=Populism visits Pakistan - Daily Times|date=17 August 2018|work=Daily Times|access-date=29 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Its leader [[Imran Khan]] has furiously attacked traditional politicians and made people believe that only he has the solutions.<ref name=\"Daily Times\"/> British journalist Ben Judah, in an interview, compared Imran Khan with Donald Trump on his populist rhetoric.<ref name=\"The limits of populism\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/282706-the-limits-of-populism|title=The limits of populism|access-date=29 October 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== South Korea ====\n[[File:Shinz\u014d Abe and Hong Jun-pyo at the Japanese Prime Minister's Office (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Hong Jun-pyo]], former leader of [[Liberty Korea Party|LKP]]]]\n[[Conservatism in South Korea]] has traditionally been more inclined toward [[elitism]] than [[populism]].

The same pattern emerged in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], in which those that saw the price of their house rise, voted to Remain. Whereas those that saw it flatline or drop, voted to Leave.\n\n====Austria====\nThe Austrian [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6) established in 1955 by a former [[Nazi]] functionary claims to represent a \"Third Camp\" (''Drittes Lager''), beside the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialist Party]] and the social Catholic [[Austrian People's Party]]. It succeeded the [[Federation of Independents]] founded after World War II, adopting the pre-war heritage of [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalism]]. Though it did not gain much popularity for decades, it exercised considerable [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] by supporting several [[Austrian Federal Government|federal governments]], be it right-wing or left-wing, e.g. the Socialist [[Bruno Kreisky|Kreisky]] cabinet of 1970 (see [[Kreisky\u2013Peter\u2013Wiesenthal affair]]).\n\n[[File:GuentherZ 2012-07-03 0158 Wien01 Parlament Hans-Christian Strache.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Heinz-Christian Strache]], former leader of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] and [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria]]]]\nFrom 1980, the Freedom Party adopted a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] stance. Upon the [[1983 Austrian legislative election|1983 federal election]], it entered a [[coalition government]] with the Socialist Party, whereby party chairman [[Norbert Steger]] served as [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice-Chancellor]]. The liberal interlude however ended, when [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] was elected chairman in 1986. By his down-to-earth manners and [[patriotism|patriotic]] attitude, Haider re-integrated the party's nationalist base voters. Nevertheless, he was also able to obtain votes from large sections of population disenchanted with politics by publicly denouncing corruption and [[nepotism]] of the Austrian ''[[Proporz]]'' system. The electoral success was boosted by Austria's [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|accession to the European Union]] in 1995.\n\nUpon the [[1999 Austrian legislative election|1999 federal election]], the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) with 26.9% of the votes cast became the second strongest party in the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] parliament. Having entered a coalition government with the People's Party, Haider had to face the disability of several FP\u00d6 ministers, but also the impossibility of agitation against members of his own cabinet. In 2005, he finally countered the FP\u00d6's loss of reputation by the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) relaunch in order to carry on his government. The remaining FP\u00d6 members elected [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] chairman, but since the [[2006 Austrian legislative election|2006 federal election]] both right-wing parties have run separately. After Haider was killed in a car accident in 2008, the BZ\u00d6 has lost a measurable amount of support.\n\nThe FP\u00d6 regained much of its support in subsequent elections. Its candidate [[Norbert Hofer]] made it into the runoff in the [[2016 Austrian presidential election|2016 presidential election]], though he narrowly lost the election. After the [[2017 Austrian legislative election|2017 legislative elections]], the FP\u00d6 formed a [[First Kurz government|government coalition]] with the [[Austrian People's Party]], but lost seats in [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019]].\n\n====Belgium====\n[[File:Vlaams Blok Flag.png|thumb|150px|Flag used by the now-defunct [[Vlaams Blok]]]]\n[[Vlaams Blok]], established in 1978, operated on a platform of law and order, anti-immigration (with particular focus on Islamic immigration) and secession of the [[Flanders]] region of the country.

In the [[2014 European Parliament election in Italy|2014 European election]], under the leadership of [[Matteo Salvini]] it took 6.2% of votes. Under Salvini, the party has to some extent embraced [[Italian nationalism]] and emphasised Euroscepticism, opposition to immigration and other \"populist\" policies, while forming an alliance with right-wing populist parties in Europe.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-20/italy-s-northern-league-is-suddenly-in-love-with-the-south|title=Italy's Northern League Is Suddenly In Love With the South|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=2 March 2018|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2017/07/24/news/rivoluzione-nella-lega-cambiano-nome-e-simbolo-e-scompare-il-nord-1.306615|title=Rivoluzione nella Lega: cambiano nome e simbolo|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/10/27/news/lega_nord_nuovo_simbolo-179501278/|title=Lega, nuovo simbolo senza \"nord\".

Unlike traditional parties, they also do not belong to international organizations of like-minded parties, and they do not use similar terms to describe themselves.{{sfn|Norris|2005|pp=43\u201344}}\n\n[[Cas Mudde]] argues that two definitions can be given of the \"populist radical right\": a maximum and a minimum one, with the \"maximum\" group being a subgroup of the \"minimum\" group. The minimum definition describes what [[Michael Freeden]] has called the \"core concept\"{{Efn|Freeden has developed in 1996 the idea that every ideology has \"core\" and \"peripheral\" concepts. Building on his work, Terance Ball (1999) has given the following definition: \"A core concept is one that is both central to, and constitutive of, a particular ideology and therefore of the ideological community to which it gives inspiration and identity. For example, the concept of 'class' (and of course 'class struggle') is a key or core concept in Marxism, as 'gender' is in feminism, and 'liberty' (or 'individual liberty') is in liberalism, and so on through the list of leading ideologies.\"|name=|group=}} of the right-wing populist ideology, that is the concept shared by all parties generally included in the family. Looking at the primary literature, Mudde concludes that the core concept of right-populism \"is undoubtedly the \"[[nation]]\". \"This concept\", he explains, \"also certainly functions as a \"coat-hanger\" for most other ideological features. Consequently, the minimum definition of the party family should be based on the key concept, the nation\". He however rejects the use of \"[[nationalism]]\" as a \"core ideology\" of right-wing populism on the ground that there are also purely \"civic\" or \"liberal\" forms of nationalism, preferring instead the term \"[[nativism (politics)|nativism]]\": a xenophobic form of nationalism asserting that \"states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (\"the nation\"), and that non-native elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogeneous nation-state\". Mudde further argues that \"while nativism could include racist arguments, it can also be non-racist (including and excluding on the basis of culture or even religion)\", and that the term nativism does not reduce the parties to mere single-issue parties, such as the term \"anti-immigrant\" does. In the maximum definition, to nativism is added [[authoritarianism]]\u2014an attitude, not necessary anti-democratic or automatic, to prefer \"[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]\" and the submission to authority{{Efn|[[Cas Mudde|Mudde]]: authoritarianism \"is the belief in a strictly ordered society, in which infringements of authority are to be punished severely. In this interpretation, [it] includes law and order and \u201cpunitive conventional moralism.\u201d It does not necessarily mean an anti-democratic attitude, but neither does it preclude one. In addition, the authoritarian\u2019s submission to authority, established or not, is \u201cnot absolute, automatic, nor blind\u201d.

Right-wing populism has been fostered by RSS which stands against persecution of Hindus by various [[History of India|invading forces over the centuries]] and have also been attributed to the concept of  [[Hindutva]]. It vows to protect the ancient religion and culture of [[Hinduism]] and have strong views against destruction of its ancient heritage, in India.  BJP became a significant force in the state legislative assemblies and in the parliament in the 1990s by raising the issue of  Ram Mandir (temple) establishment  by demolishing the existing Babri Masjid (allegedly constructed by demolishing a Hindu temple) in [[Ayodhya]], in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. BJP and other conservative right wing organization such as [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]], [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]] etc. argues that the Masjid was built by [[Babur]], the first Mughal emperor in India in 1526, by demolishing a Ram temple. This issue is known as the [[Ayodhya dispute|Ayodhya Dispute]] for which the final judgement was declared by the Supreme Court of India on 9 November 2019.

The same pattern emerged in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], in which those that saw the price of their house rise, voted to Remain.

It succeeded the [[Federation of Independents]] founded after World War II, adopting the pre-war heritage of [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalism]]. Though it did not gain much popularity for decades, it exercised considerable [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] by supporting several [[Austrian Federal Government|federal governments]], be it right-wing or left-wing, e.g. the Socialist [[Bruno Kreisky|Kreisky]] cabinet of 1970 (see [[Kreisky\u2013Peter\u2013Wiesenthal affair]]).\n\n[[File:GuentherZ 2012-07-03 0158 Wien01 Parlament Hans-Christian Strache.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Heinz-Christian Strache]], former leader of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] and [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria]]]]\nFrom 1980, the Freedom Party adopted a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] stance. Upon the [[1983 Austrian legislative election|1983 federal election]], it entered a [[coalition government]] with the Socialist Party, whereby party chairman [[Norbert Steger]] served as [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice-Chancellor]]. The liberal interlude however ended, when [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] was elected chairman in 1986. By his down-to-earth manners and [[patriotism|patriotic]] attitude, Haider re-integrated the party's nationalist base voters. Nevertheless, he was also able to obtain votes from large sections of population disenchanted with politics by publicly denouncing corruption and [[nepotism]] of the Austrian ''[[Proporz]]'' system. The electoral success was boosted by Austria's [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|accession to the European Union]] in 1995.\n\nUpon the [[1999 Austrian legislative election|1999 federal election]], the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) with 26.9% of the votes cast became the second strongest party in the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] parliament. Having entered a coalition government with the People's Party, Haider had to face the disability of several FP\u00d6 ministers, but also the impossibility of agitation against members of his own cabinet. In 2005, he finally countered the FP\u00d6's loss of reputation by the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) relaunch in order to carry on his government. The remaining FP\u00d6 members elected [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] chairman, but since the [[2006 Austrian legislative election|2006 federal election]] both right-wing parties have run separately. After Haider was killed in a car accident in 2008, the BZ\u00d6 has lost a measurable amount of support.\n\nThe FP\u00d6 regained much of its support in subsequent elections. Its candidate [[Norbert Hofer]] made it into the runoff in the [[2016 Austrian presidential election|2016 presidential election]], though he narrowly lost the election. After the [[2017 Austrian legislative election|2017 legislative elections]], the FP\u00d6 formed a [[First Kurz government|government coalition]] with the [[Austrian People's Party]], but lost seats in [[2019 Austrian legislative election|2019]].\n\n====Belgium====\n[[File:Vlaams Blok Flag.png|thumb|150px|Flag used by the now-defunct [[Vlaams Blok]]]]\n[[Vlaams Blok]], established in 1978, operated on a platform of law and order, anti-immigration (with particular focus on Islamic immigration) and secession of the [[Flanders]] region of the country.

There is also a short e-story, ''A Proper Wizard'', released before the fourth sequel.\n\n==Beginnings==\nPrineas wrote the first chapter of ''The Magic Thief'' for ''[[Cricket (magazine)|Cricket]]'', a [[literature|literary]] magazine for young adults, after a request for stories about wizards and serialized fiction.<ref name=\"A\">[http://www.iowalum.com/magazine/jun08/magictouch.cfm Iowa Alumni Magazine, June 2008]</ref> When she felt the characters had more to tell, she expanded it into a novel, and then into a trilogy. She later published a stand-alone fourth book, and an e-story.\n\n==Overview==\n\nConnwaer, a pickpocket on the streets of the Twilight, one day picks the pocket of a powerful wizard named Nevery and steals his locus magicalicus, a special stone that helps wizards connect to the magical power of the city. It should kill Conn, but Nevery stops the process by saying a spell using Conn's name. It turns out that Nevery has just returned (or rather, snuck in) after a 20-year exile, to try to save the town from the leaching of its magic, upon which so much, including its economy, depends. Curious about the boy, Nevery takes him on as a servant and then later an apprentice. Although it is the wizard's job to stem the tide of the disappearing magic, he seems unable to do so. Conn believes he knows the answer, but his enemies are closing in.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/006137590X The Magic Thief: Sarah Prineas, Antonio Javier Caparo: 9780061375903] Amazon.com</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Connwaer/Conn''' - A former [[Theft|thief]] who lived alone on the streets of Twilight. Nevery takes him on as a servant/assistant, but soon made Conn his apprentice. Conn has a mysterious past which he is reluctant to reveal to anyone.\nConn could be any age from twelve to fourteen, and has unkempt black hair that usually obscures his large, bright blue eyes. He is quick-witted, curious, innovative and bold, completely unbound by the deep-rooted beliefs in magic. Several characters noted him for being quiet.\n<br />\nConn likes reading and thinking about magic, and is a voracious eater. He could touch others' locus stones without dying and has never been ill. Growing up as a thief, Conn learns to be slippery, but he is completely honest (so instead of lying, which he could not do, he sometimes chooses not to reveal), and is sometimes stubborn and impetuous, heading into trouble without much planning beforehand. He wholeheartedly believes the magic must be protected, and that he is chosen to do so by it, and selflessly puts its safety before his own wellbeing. All this coupled with his strange ideas, he has a knack for attracting trouble.\n* '''Nevery Flinglas''' - A [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who had been exiled from Wellmet for 20 years after experimenting with pyrotechnics. He returns to solve a magical problem in Wellmet after Brumbee sent him a plea. Though at first Nevery try not to notice or become attached to Conn, he was impressed by Conn's eagerness and strong affinity to magic, and soon becomes more caring towards his apprentice. Though outwardly irascible and rash, Nevery is deeply kind and flexible; like other wizards, he once stubbornly believes in old truths, but by Conn's influence he starts to be able to accept new ideas.\nNevery lives in Heartsease, a mansion on one of the wizard islands in the Wellmet River. The house has been in his family for generations, and have once been grand, but was partially destroyed in Nevery's pyrotechnic experiment and abandoned for decades. Conn discovered his family chronicles and locus stone collection there, which contain records about Nevery's parents, his relatives, and a young girl who might have been his sister or daughter, all of whom long gone, but the cause of his whole family's demise remains unknown.\n* '''Benet''' - Nevery's bodyguard. He is on bad terms with Conn at first, but after seeing Conn's devotion to learning magic and talent, feels more respect and affection towards him, giving him haircuts, delicious meals and hand-knitted clothes, and risking himself to save Conn several times. Apart from being an intimidating fighter, he is also a great chef and likes to knit things in his free time.\nThough he seems formidable and hard on the outside, Benet has a tendency to understand, as well as notice something wrong with Conn that Nevery frequently overlook, and stood up to his master for his sometimes insensible nature.\n* '''Pettivox''' - The evil master of Keeston, and though they are both magisters, he openly show his mistrust and disdain of Nevery Flinglas. Keeston speaks about him with fear, and Conn guessed that he beats Keeston. Pettivox has white skin and red lips, and speaks with a high voice despite his tall, burly build. It is revealed that Pettivox is working with the Underlord to drain all the magic from Wellmet and sell it. He is later appointed as liaison for the Duchess and the Underlord, and makes use of his position to spy on her and gives her misleading information. He is assumed to have died in the explosion at Dusk House by the end of the book.\n* '''Keeston''' - Pettivox's apprentice whom Pettivox offered as assistant to Nevery, in order for Keeston to spy on him. Tall and blond with blue eyes, Keeston is as proud of his looks as his magical abilities. Being top of the class, he is usually paired with the beginner Conn, much to his angst. He and Conn dislike each other from the start, but become good friends after Pettivox died and Keeston had changed for the better. Keeston later became Brumbee's apprentice, and according to him was heavily influenced by Conn's ideas about magic later on in the series.\n* '''Rowan Forestal''' - At first unknown to Conn, the tomboyish daughter of the Duchess. She has short red hair that looks like it has been hacked off, and catlike grey eyes. She enjoys sword fight and adventure, and is known to be very impatient; Brumbee sets her to teach Conn how to read runes when he first become apprentice, and Rowan herself speculates that it might have been to practice her patience. Though Conn dislikes Rowan at first sight, the pair quickly became friends when he saw her true fun-loving self beneath the haughty pose, and Rowan was impressed by Conn's incredible speed in learning. Rowan is not in the least disturbed by Conn's lowly social status, and devoutly supports Conn.\n* '''Willa Forestal''' - The [[Duke|Duchess]] and mother of Rowan. Rules the richer part of Wellmet: The Sunrise. Discontinuing the common practice of hiring a Ducal Magister, she dislikes magic and mistrusts wizards she deemed dangerous, such as Nevery and Connwaer. The Duchess is serious and has no sense of humour, but is also shown to be clever and cunning.\n* '''Brumbee''' - The [[Head teacher|Principal]] of Academicos and a lifelong friend of Nevery, Brumbee is very knowledgeable, but indecisive and weak. According to Conn, what Brumbee would do in the face of arguments or crisis would be wringing his hands and saying 'Oh dear'. Brumbee is usually kind and soft-spoken, though easily flustered, as opposed to Nevery's temper. After Pettivox's death, he accepts Keeston as his apprentice.\n* '''Underlord Crowe''' - Exerts control over the Twilight side of Wellmet. A cold, almost psychopathic individual with no regard for anyone except for himself; Conn states that Crowe \"would kill his family to get what he wanted\". He looks nondescript; neither short nor tall, neither handsome nor plain, has cold, empty grey eyes and oiled black hair. He works with Pettivox and was exiled after Conn foiled his schemes.\n* '''Captain Kerrn''' - The Captain of the Dawn Palace Guards who serve to protect the Duchess. As she is very strict and true to her duties, she mistrusts and is very hostile towards Conn.\n\n==Runic Messages==\nIn \"The Magic Thief\" messages written in the Rune language are dotted throughout the book.

There is also a short e-story, ''A Proper Wizard'', released before the fourth sequel.\n\n==Beginnings==\nPrineas wrote the first chapter of ''The Magic Thief'' for ''[[Cricket (magazine)|Cricket]]'', a [[literature|literary]] magazine for young adults, after a request for stories about wizards and serialized fiction.<ref name=\"A\">[http://www.iowalum.com/magazine/jun08/magictouch.cfm Iowa Alumni Magazine, June 2008]</ref> When she felt the characters had more to tell, she expanded it into a novel, and then into a trilogy. She later published a stand-alone fourth book, and an e-story.\n\n==Overview==\n\nConnwaer, a pickpocket on the streets of the Twilight, one day picks the pocket of a powerful wizard named Nevery and steals his locus magicalicus, a special stone that helps wizards connect to the magical power of the city. It should kill Conn, but Nevery stops the process by saying a spell using Conn's name. It turns out that Nevery has just returned (or rather, snuck in) after a 20-year exile, to try to save the town from the leaching of its magic, upon which so much, including its economy, depends. Curious about the boy, Nevery takes him on as a servant and then later an apprentice. Although it is the wizard's job to stem the tide of the disappearing magic, he seems unable to do so. Conn believes he knows the answer, but his enemies are closing in.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/006137590X The Magic Thief: Sarah Prineas, Antonio Javier Caparo: 9780061375903] Amazon.com</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Connwaer/Conn''' - A former [[Theft|thief]] who lived alone on the streets of Twilight. Nevery takes him on as a servant/assistant, but soon made Conn his apprentice. Conn has a mysterious past which he is reluctant to reveal to anyone.\nConn could be any age from twelve to fourteen, and has unkempt black hair that usually obscures his large, bright blue eyes. He is quick-witted, curious, innovative and bold, completely unbound by the deep-rooted beliefs in magic. Several characters noted him for being quiet.\n<br />\nConn likes reading and thinking about magic, and is a voracious eater. He could touch others' locus stones without dying and has never been ill. Growing up as a thief, Conn learns to be slippery, but he is completely honest (so instead of lying, which he could not do, he sometimes chooses not to reveal), and is sometimes stubborn and impetuous, heading into trouble without much planning beforehand. He wholeheartedly believes the magic must be protected, and that he is chosen to do so by it, and selflessly puts its safety before his own wellbeing. All this coupled with his strange ideas, he has a knack for attracting trouble.\n* '''Nevery Flinglas''' - A [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who had been exiled from Wellmet for 20 years after experimenting with pyrotechnics. He returns to solve a magical problem in Wellmet after Brumbee sent him a plea. Though at first Nevery try not to notice or become attached to Conn, he was impressed by Conn's eagerness and strong affinity to magic, and soon becomes more caring towards his apprentice. Though outwardly irascible and rash, Nevery is deeply kind and flexible; like other wizards, he once stubbornly believes in old truths, but by Conn's influence he starts to be able to accept new ideas.\nNevery lives in Heartsease, a mansion on one of the wizard islands in the Wellmet River. The house has been in his family for generations, and have once been grand, but was partially destroyed in Nevery's pyrotechnic experiment and abandoned for decades. Conn discovered his family chronicles and locus stone collection there, which contain records about Nevery's parents, his relatives, and a young girl who might have been his sister or daughter, all of whom long gone, but the cause of his whole family's demise remains unknown.\n* '''Benet''' - Nevery's bodyguard. He is on bad terms with Conn at first, but after seeing Conn's devotion to learning magic and talent, feels more respect and affection towards him, giving him haircuts, delicious meals and hand-knitted clothes, and risking himself to save Conn several times. Apart from being an intimidating fighter, he is also a great chef and likes to knit things in his free time.\nThough he seems formidable and hard on the outside, Benet has a tendency to understand, as well as notice something wrong with Conn that Nevery frequently overlook, and stood up to his master for his sometimes insensible nature.\n* '''Pettivox''' - The evil master of Keeston, and though they are both magisters, he openly show his mistrust and disdain of Nevery Flinglas. Keeston speaks about him with fear, and Conn guessed that he beats Keeston. Pettivox has white skin and red lips, and speaks with a high voice despite his tall, burly build. It is revealed that Pettivox is working with the Underlord to drain all the magic from Wellmet and sell it. He is later appointed as liaison for the Duchess and the Underlord, and makes use of his position to spy on her and gives her misleading information. He is assumed to have died in the explosion at Dusk House by the end of the book.\n* '''Keeston''' - Pettivox's apprentice whom Pettivox offered as assistant to Nevery, in order for Keeston to spy on him. Tall and blond with blue eyes, Keeston is as proud of his looks as his magical abilities. Being top of the class, he is usually paired with the beginner Conn, much to his angst. He and Conn dislike each other from the start, but become good friends after Pettivox died and Keeston had changed for the better. Keeston later became Brumbee's apprentice, and according to him was heavily influenced by Conn's ideas about magic later on in the series.\n* '''Rowan Forestal''' - At first unknown to Conn, the tomboyish daughter of the Duchess. She has short red hair that looks like it has been hacked off, and catlike grey eyes. She enjoys sword fight and adventure, and is known to be very impatient; Brumbee sets her to teach Conn how to read runes when he first become apprentice, and Rowan herself speculates that it might have been to practice her patience. Though Conn dislikes Rowan at first sight, the pair quickly became friends when he saw her true fun-loving self beneath the haughty pose, and Rowan was impressed by Conn's incredible speed in learning. Rowan is not in the least disturbed by Conn's lowly social status, and devoutly supports Conn.\n* '''Willa Forestal''' - The [[Duke|Duchess]] and mother of Rowan. Rules the richer part of Wellmet: The Sunrise. Discontinuing the common practice of hiring a Ducal Magister, she dislikes magic and mistrusts wizards she deemed dangerous, such as Nevery and Connwaer. The Duchess is serious and has no sense of humour, but is also shown to be clever and cunning.\n* '''Brumbee''' - The [[Head teacher|Principal]] of Academicos and a lifelong friend of Nevery, Brumbee is very knowledgeable, but indecisive and weak. According to Conn, what Brumbee would do in the face of arguments or crisis would be wringing his hands and saying 'Oh dear'. Brumbee is usually kind and soft-spoken, though easily flustered, as opposed to Nevery's temper. After Pettivox's death, he accepts Keeston as his apprentice.\n* '''Underlord Crowe''' - Exerts control over the Twilight side of Wellmet. A cold, almost psychopathic individual with no regard for anyone except for himself; Conn states that Crowe \"would kill his family to get what he wanted\". He looks nondescript; neither short nor tall, neither handsome nor plain, has cold, empty grey eyes and oiled black hair. He works with Pettivox and was exiled after Conn foiled his schemes.\n* '''Captain Kerrn''' - The Captain of the Dawn Palace Guards who serve to protect the Duchess. As she is very strict and true to her duties, she mistrusts and is very hostile towards Conn.\n\n==Runic Messages==\nIn \"The Magic Thief\" messages written in the Rune language are dotted throughout the book.
