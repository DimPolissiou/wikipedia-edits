The [[Parareptilia]] and [[synapsid]] amniotes were common during the late [[Paleozoic]], while [[diapsid]]s became dominant during the [[Mesozoic]]. In the sea, the [[bony fishes]] became dominant. [[Birds]], a derived form of [[dinosaurs|dinosaur]], evolved in the [[Jurassic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cloudsley-Thompson|first=J.

Fishes of myriad varieties are the main predators in most of the world's water bodies, both freshwater and marine. The rest of the vertebrate species are tetrapods, a single lineage that includes amphibians (with roughly 7,000 species); mammals (with approximately 5,500 species); and reptiles and birds (with about 20,000 species divided evenly between the two classes). Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna of most terrestrial environments and also include many partially or fully aquatic groups (e.g., sea [[snakes]], penguins, cetaceans).\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are several ways of classifying animals. [[Evolutionary taxonomy|Evolutionary systematics]] relies on [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[evolution]]ary history, which is determined through similarities in anatomy and, if possible, the [[genetics]] of organisms. [[Cladistics|Phylogenetic classification]] is based solely on [[phylogeny]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian water bugs: their biology and identification (Hemiptera-Heteroptera, Gerromorpha & Nepomorpha)|year=2004|publisher=Apollo Books|isbn=978-87-88757-78-1|author=Andersen, N.M.|author2=Weir, T.A. |page=38}}</ref> Evolutionary systematics gives an overview; phylogenetic systematics gives detail. The two systems are thus complementary rather than opposed.<ref>Hildebran, M.; Gonslow, G. (2001): Analysis of Vertebrate Structure. 5th edition. ''John Wiley & Sons, Inc''. [[New York (state)|New York]], page 33: ''Comment: The problem of naming sister groups''</ref>\n\n=== Traditional classification ===\n[[File:Spindle diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional spindle diagram of the evolution of the vertebrates at class level]]\n\nConventional classification has living vertebrates grouped into seven classes based on traditional interpretations of gross [[anatomy|anatomical]] and [[Physiology|physiological]] traits. This classification is the one most commonly encountered in school textbooks, overviews, non-specialist, and popular works. The [[extant taxon|extant]] vertebrates are:<ref name=\"Romer\"/>\n\n* '''Subphylum Vertebrata'''\n** Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fishes)\n** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)\n** Class [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fishes)\n** Class [[Amphibia]] (amphibians)\n** Class [[Reptilia]] (reptiles)\n** Class [[Aves]] (birds)\n** Class [[Mammalia]] (mammals)\n\nIn addition to these, there are two classes of extinct armoured fishes, the [[Placodermi]] and the [[Acanthodii]].\n\nOther ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the [[phylogeny]] of [[labyrinthodontia|early amphibians]] and reptiles. An example based on Janvier (1981, 1997), Shu ''et al.'' (2003), and Benton (2004)<ref name=\"Benton2004\">{{cite book | last =Benton | first =M.J. | authorlink =Michael Benton | title =Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher =[[Blackwell Publishing]] | date= 1 November 2004 |edition=Third | location = | pages =33, 455 pp | url =http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/benton/vertclass.html | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0632056378}}</ref> is given here:\n\n\u2020: Extinct\n* '''Subphylum Vertebrata'''\n**''[[Palaeospondylus]]''\n** '''Superclass [[Agnatha]]''' or [[Cephalaspidomorphi]] ([[lamprey]]s and other jawless fishes)\n** '''Infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]]''' (vertebrates with jaws)\n*** Class \u2020[[Placodermi]] (extinct armoured fishes)\n*** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)\n*** Class \u2020[[Acanthodii]] (extinct spiny \"sharks\")\n*** '''Superclass [[Osteichthyes]]''' (bony vertebrates)\n**** Class [[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned bony fishes)\n**** Class [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fishes, including the tetrapods)\n**** Class [[Amphibia]] (amphibians, some ancestral to the [[amniotes]])\u2014now a paraphyletic group\n**** Class [[Synapsida]] (mammals and the extinct mammal-like reptiles)\n**** Class [[Sauropsida]] (reptiles and birds)\n\nWhile this traditional classification is orderly, most of the groups are [[paraphyletic]], i.e. do not contain all descendants of the class's common ancestor.<ref name=Benton2004 /> For instance, descendants of the first reptiles include modern reptiles as well as mammals and birds; the [[agnatha]]ns have given rise to the [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]]; the [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]] have given rise to the [[tetrapoda|land vertebrates]]; the traditional \"[[Labyrinthodont|amphibians]]\" have given rise to the [[Reptilia|reptiles]] (traditionally including the [[synapsid]]s or mammal-like \"reptiles\"), which in turn have given rise to the mammals and birds. Most scientists working with vertebrates use a classification based purely on [[phylogeny]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, organized by their known evolutionary history and sometimes disregarding the conventional interpretations of their anatomy and physiology.\n\n=== Phylogenetic relationships ===\nIn [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic taxonomy]], the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks but illustrated as a nested \"family tree\" known as a [[phylogenetic tree]].

San Giacomo discovered acting while attending [[Morris Knolls High School]]. In 1984, she received a fine arts degree, specializing in acting, from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Drama]] in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating, she moved to New York. San Giacomo then went on to appear in several theater productions, including the [[Garry Marshall]]-[[Lowell Ganz]] production of ''Wrong Turn at Lungfish'' in Los Angeles, the Princeton/McCarter Theatre production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', and off-Broadway in ''Beirut''. She also starred in ''[[Italian American Reconciliation]]'', regional productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', as well as ''[[Crimes of the Heart]]''. In a review of the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] 1986 presentation of ''As You Like It'', San Giacomo received a special mention: \"although doll-like Laura San Giacomo had only a minor role as a wilful shepherdess, she sank her fangs into it and received the only show-interrupting applause of the evening.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-03-13/entertainment/26084264_1_lighting-true-love-maureen-garrett | title=As You Like It: Try It | first=Stuart D.|last=Bykofsky | work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | publisher=[[Philadelphia News Network]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=March 13, 1986 }}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nSan Giacomo's first television appearances were four episodes on three television series during 1987.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0000624}}</ref>  Two notable appearances were in ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'' in 1988 for the episode \"Protected Witness\" (Season 2 / Episode 13) as Theresa Farantino, and in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in 1989 for the episode, \"Leap of Faith\" (Season 5, Episode 19) as Tania Lewis. The ''Miami Vice'' episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor [[Cameron Dye]], one year before their marriage. Prior to that, she was featured on the daytime soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin ([[Carmen Thomas]]).\n\nHowever, San Giacomo first drew international attention in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989), which also marked her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie ''[[Miles from Home]]'', her role as \"Sandy\" was not credited).<ref name=\"imdb\" /> Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and she received a [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] ''New Generation Award''. The film was honored with the [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s prestigious Grand Prize, the [[Palme d'Or]].\n\nIn 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as [[Julia Roberts]]'s character's wisecracking friend Kit De Luca in ''[[Pretty Woman]]''. The [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film ended up generating $178 million at the [[box office]].<ref>{{Mojo title|id=prettywoman|title=Pretty Woman}}</ref>\n\nSan Giacomo has appeared in such films as ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1990), ''Vital Signs'' (1990), ''[[Under Suspicion (1991 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Around]]'' (1991), ''[[Where the Day Takes You]]'' (1992), ''Nina Takes a Lover'' (1994), and ''[[Suicide Kings]]'' (1997). She also appeared as [[List of The Stand characters#Nadine Cross|Nadine Cross]] in the [[Stephen King]] [[TV miniseries]] ''[[The Stand (TV miniseries)|The Stand]]'' opposite [[Rob Lowe]], which landed them on the cover of the May 7\u201313, 1994, issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film ''[[Eat Your Heart Out (film)|Eat Your Heart Out]]''. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the [[Jenifer Estess]] [[bio-pic]] ''Jenifer'', which aired on [[CBS]] in October of that year.\n\nSan Giacomo did voice work for the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (as the character of [[Fox (animated character)|Fox]]). However, she went uncredited for the role because her agent believed it would damage her reputation to have worked on an animated series.\n\n===''Just Shoot Me!''===\n{{Main|Just Shoot Me!}}\nNeeding to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist [[Maya Gallo]] in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997\u20132003).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |title=Laura San Giacomo interview by Chet Cooper |publisher=abilitymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045406/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |archivedate=2011-09-16 }}</ref> Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer [[Steven Levitan]] once had in mind for actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] when he was a writer for ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.\n\nSan Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997\u20131998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].\n\n===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===\nAfter NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E.

A [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] and two-time [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominee, she also played the regular role of Rhetta Rodriguez on the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] drama ''[[Saving Grace (TV series)|Saving Grace]]'' (2007\u20132010), and the recurring role of Dr. Grace Confalone on the [[CBS]] drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2016\u201319).\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan Giacomo, an [[Italian American]],<ref name=\"book1\">{{cite book|last=Stock|first=Ann Marie|authorlink=|title=Framing Latin American Cinema: contemporary critical perspectives|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1997|location=Minnesota|pages=XXVI|url=https://archive.org/details/framinglatinamer0000unse|isbn=0-8166-2972-2|nopp=true}}</ref> was born in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], the daughter of MaryJo and John San Giacomo, a [[paper mill]] owner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/Laura-San-Giacomo.html | title=Laura San Giacomo Biographyggg (1962?-) | publisher=FilmReference.com}}</ref> She grew up in [[Denville, New Jersey]]. San Giacomo discovered acting while attending [[Morris Knolls High School]]. In 1984, she received a fine arts degree, specializing in acting, from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Drama]] in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating, she moved to New York. San Giacomo then went on to appear in several theater productions, including the [[Garry Marshall]]-[[Lowell Ganz]] production of ''Wrong Turn at Lungfish'' in Los Angeles, the Princeton/McCarter Theatre production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', and off-Broadway in ''Beirut''. She also starred in ''[[Italian American Reconciliation]]'', regional productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', as well as ''[[Crimes of the Heart]]''. In a review of the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] 1986 presentation of ''As You Like It'', San Giacomo received a special mention: \"although doll-like Laura San Giacomo had only a minor role as a wilful shepherdess, she sank her fangs into it and received the only show-interrupting applause of the evening.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-03-13/entertainment/26084264_1_lighting-true-love-maureen-garrett | title=As You Like It: Try It | first=Stuart D.|last=Bykofsky | work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | publisher=[[Philadelphia News Network]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=March 13, 1986 }}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nSan Giacomo's first television appearances were four episodes on three television series during 1987.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0000624}}</ref>  Two notable appearances were in ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'' in 1988 for the episode \"Protected Witness\" (Season 2 / Episode 13) as Theresa Farantino, and in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in 1989 for the episode, \"Leap of Faith\" (Season 5, Episode 19) as Tania Lewis. The ''Miami Vice'' episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor [[Cameron Dye]], one year before their marriage. Prior to that, she was featured on the daytime soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin ([[Carmen Thomas]]).\n\nHowever, San Giacomo first drew international attention in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989), which also marked her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie ''[[Miles from Home]]'', her role as \"Sandy\" was not credited).<ref name=\"imdb\" /> Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and she received a [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] ''New Generation Award''. The film was honored with the [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s prestigious Grand Prize, the [[Palme d'Or]].\n\nIn 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as [[Julia Roberts]]'s character's wisecracking friend Kit De Luca in ''[[Pretty Woman]]''. The [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film ended up generating $178 million at the [[box office]].<ref>{{Mojo title|id=prettywoman|title=Pretty Woman}}</ref>\n\nSan Giacomo has appeared in such films as ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1990), ''Vital Signs'' (1990), ''[[Under Suspicion (1991 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Around]]'' (1991), ''[[Where the Day Takes You]]'' (1992), ''Nina Takes a Lover'' (1994), and ''[[Suicide Kings]]'' (1997). She also appeared as [[List of The Stand characters#Nadine Cross|Nadine Cross]] in the [[Stephen King]] [[TV miniseries]] ''[[The Stand (TV miniseries)|The Stand]]'' opposite [[Rob Lowe]], which landed them on the cover of the May 7\u201313, 1994, issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film ''[[Eat Your Heart Out (film)|Eat Your Heart Out]]''. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the [[Jenifer Estess]] [[bio-pic]] ''Jenifer'', which aired on [[CBS]] in October of that year.\n\nSan Giacomo did voice work for the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (as the character of [[Fox (animated character)|Fox]]). However, she went uncredited for the role because her agent believed it would damage her reputation to have worked on an animated series.\n\n===''Just Shoot Me!''===\n{{Main|Just Shoot Me!}}\nNeeding to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist [[Maya Gallo]] in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997\u20132003).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |title=Laura San Giacomo interview by Chet Cooper |publisher=abilitymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045406/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |archivedate=2011-09-16 }}</ref> Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer [[Steven Levitan]] once had in mind for actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] when he was a writer for ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.\n\nSan Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997\u20131998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].\n\n===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===\nAfter NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala'' on 9 September 2006.\n\nIn 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of ''[[Veronica Mars]]''. She reunited with her former [[love interest]] from ''Just Shoot Me!'', [[Enrico Colantoni]], playing Harmony Chase.

They are controlled by the [[Luxembourg Basketball Federation]]. \n\nLuxembourg has qualified for the [[EuroBasket]] three times, in [[EuroBasket 1946|1946]], [[EuroBasket 1951|1951]], and [[EuroBasket 1955|1955]]. Their best result came in eighth place at their first EuroBasket appearance in 1946. Although the national team has yet to qualify for the [[FIBA World Cup]] or [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Basketbal Nederland tegen Luxemburg in Apollohal Amsterdam, Bestanddeelnr 910-8505.jpg|thumb|A match against [[Netherlands national basketball team|Netherlands]] in 1959]]\n[[File:Ire v Lux 02.jpg|thumb|Against [[Ireland national basketball team|Ireland]] in 2009]]\n[[File:PZK 20140824 Koszalin 99991.jpg|thumb|Against [[Poland national basketball team|Poland]] in 2014]]\n===EuroBasket 1946===\nLuxembourg's first [[EuroBasket]] appearance was at [[EuroBasket 1946]] in [[Geneva]]. They found themselves heavily over-matched in the preliminary round. Losing all of their matches and being outscored by 113 points over three games finishing in last place in the group. The semifinal round, which was essentially a 7th\u201310th place classification round for Luxembourg, saw their first win.  They defeated [[England national basketball team|England]] 50\u201327.  This advanced them to a playoff for 7th and 8th places; they were defeated by [[Belgium national basketball team|Belgium]] to finish 8th out of the ten team competition.\n\n===EuroBasket 1951===\nLuxembourg next competed at the [[EuroBasket 1951]] competition in [[Paris]].  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, putting them in fifth place in their group of 5.  Since they were seeded into a group of five teams rather than a group of four teams (the 18 teams were divided into 4 groups, 2 groups with 5 teams and 2 groups with 4 teams), Luxembourg had to play an elimination game against [[Denmark national basketball team|Denmark]] for the right to advance into the classification rounds.  The winner could potentially place as high as 9th; the loser was relegated to 17th place.\n\nLuxembourg was able to get a final half-court shot off before time expired, but the ball bounced off the rim and the team was served their fifth and final loss of the tournament.\n\n===EuroBasket 1955===\nAt [[EuroBasket 1955]] in [[Budapest]] was where Luxembourg next appeared.  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, and were relegated to the classification rounds.  In the first round, Luxembourg was able to win 2 games against [[Denmark national basketball team|Denmark]] and [[Sweden national basketball team|Sweden]], finishing third in the group.  There they lost their 13th\u201316th place semifinal, but won the 15th/16th place final to finish the tournament 15th out of the 18 teams.\n\n===Later years===\nAfter EuroBasket 1955 the national team has struggled qualifying for major international basketball tournaments. Though, they have competed at smaller competitions such as the [[FIBA European Championship for Small Countries|European Championship for Small Countries]] and [[Games of the Small States of Europe]].\n\n==Competitive record==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n===EuroBasket===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

Basketballnationalequipe}}, {{lang-fr|\u00c9quipe du Luxembourg de basketball}}, {{lang-ger|Luxemburgische Basketballnationalmannschaft}}) represents [[Luxembourg]] in men's international [[basketball]] tournaments. They are controlled by the [[Luxembourg Basketball Federation]]. The national team has qualified for the [[EuroBasket]] three times, in [[EuroBasket 1946|1946]], [[EuroBasket 1951|1951]], and [[EuroBasket 1955|1955]]. Their best result came in 8th place at their first EuroBasket appearance in 1946. Although Luxembourg has yet to qualify for the [[FIBA World Cup]] and [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Basketbal Nederland tegen Luxemburg in Apollohal Amsterdam, Bestanddeelnr 910-8505.jpg|thumb|A match against [[Netherlands national basketball team|Netherlands]] in 1959]]\n[[File:Ire v Lux 02.jpg|thumb|Against [[Ireland national basketball team|Ireland]] in 2009]]\n[[File:PZK 20140824 Koszalin 99991.jpg|thumb|Against [[Poland national basketball team|Poland]] in 2014]]\n===EuroBasket 1946===\nLuxembourg's first [[EuroBasket]] appearance was at [[EuroBasket 1946]] in [[Geneva]]. They found themselves heavily over-matched in the preliminary round. Losing all of their matches and being outscored by 113 points over three games finishing in last place in the group. The semifinal round, which was essentially a 7th\u201310th place classification round for Luxembourg, saw their first win.  They defeated [[England national basketball team|England]] 50\u201327.  This advanced them to a playoff for 7th and 8th places; they were defeated by [[Belgium national basketball team|Belgium]] to finish 8th out of the ten team competition.\n\n===EuroBasket 1951===\nLuxembourg next competed at the [[EuroBasket 1951]] competition in [[Paris]].  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, putting them in fifth place in their group of 5.  Since they were seeded into a group of five teams rather than a group of four teams (the 18 teams were divided into 4 groups, 2 groups with 5 teams and 2 groups with 4 teams), Luxembourg had to play an elimination game against [[Denmark national basketball team|Denmark]] for the right to advance into the classification rounds.  The winner could potentially place as high as 9th; the loser was relegated to 17th place.\n\nLuxembourg was able to get a final half-court shot off before time expired, but the ball bounced off the rim and the team was served their fifth and final loss of the tournament.\n\n===EuroBasket 1955===\nAt [[EuroBasket 1955]] in [[Budapest]] was where Luxembourg next appeared.  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, and were relegated to the classification rounds.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.
