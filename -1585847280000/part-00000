At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. [[Intel Corporation]] would supply any new processors to more established companies like [[IBM]] first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering [[prototype]]s. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an [[Intel 80486|Intel 486]], but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard.

At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. [[Intel Corporation]] would supply any new processors to more established companies like [[IBM]] first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering [[prototype]]s. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an [[Intel 80486|Intel 486]], but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' own motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5cSIAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA143&pg=PA143|title = Invisible Gold in Asia: Creating Wealth Through Intellectual Property, page 143, by David Llewelyn |publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd |date = 28 February 2011 |accessdate = 22 December 2013|isbn = 9789814312714 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastbusiness.com/top/asus.htm |title = ASUS Company Information < By Mast Business |website=publishesiness.com|date=3 January 2008|accessdate = 8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2005, Asus released the first [[PhysX]] accelerator card.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.vr-zone.com/?i=2724&s=1  |title = ASUS PhysX Card Ready |publisher = Vr-zone.com |accessdate = 1 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2005, Asus entered the LCD TV market with the TLW32001 model.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.newlaunches.com/archives/ASUS_enters_lcd_tv_market_with_tlw32001_32_lcd_tv.php  |title = ASUS enters LCD TV market with TLW32001 32\" LCD TV |publisher = Newlaunches.com |accessdate = 1 June 2010}}</ref> In January 2006, Asus announced that it would cooperate with [[Lamborghini]] to develop the VX laptop series.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2002091,00.asp |title = ASUS VX1 Lamborghini |accessdate = 1 April 2013 |publisher = PC Mag |date = 11 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Asus was confirmed as one of the manufacturers of the first [[Ultra-Mobile PC|Microsoft Origami]] models, together with [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] and [[Founder Technology]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url        = http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/business/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=181502222\n|title      = Microsoft Unfolds Origami, The 'On The Go' PC\n|first      = Walko\n|last       = John\n|date       = 9 March 2006\n|work       = [[InformationWeek]]\n|accessdate = 16 November 2009\n|quote      = Microsoft (NSDQ: MSFT) says three companies have built working models \u2013 Samsung, ASUS, and Founder, China's second largest PC maker.

Sweeney left the band in late 1981 and Reed permanently took over as vocalist, with Martin Fagan joining as a second guitarist.  The group's sound, featuring a numbing guitar drone, powerfully throbbing [[bass guitar|bass]], pounding [[drum machine]], and Reed's cavernous vocal tones, caused the Lorries (as their fans came to call them) to be quickly lumped into the then-developing [[gothic rock]] scene by pop journalists, although the band themselves denied they were ever associated with goth and preferred to cite [[Wire (band)|Wire]] as an influence,<ref name=\"Gittins\">Gittins, Ian. ''[[Melody Maker]]'', \"The Angry Brigade\" article on the band, 25 October 1986, pg. 32.</ref> and said they \"were primarily inspired by [[MC5]].\"<ref name=\"Wolfenden\">Wolfenden, David.

Fagan and Smith soon departed the band, to be replaced by Dave Wolfenden and Paul Southern respectively.  Afterwards, bassist Southern was replaced by Leon Phillips. While numerous additional personnel changes would occur in the history of the band, Wolfenden became a mainstay and a frequent songwriting partner of Reed's during the band's most productive period.  In 1983 and 1984, the band released several more singles (including \"He's Read\" and \"Monkeys On Juice\", which reached No.&nbsp;9 on the NME indie chart<ref name=\"Chart1\">\"Independent 45s\" Chart, ''New Musical Express'', 4 August 1984, pg. 4</ref>).

Two albums followed, 1988's ''[[Nothing Wrong]]'' and 1989's ''[[Blow (Red Lorry Yellow Lorry album)|Blow]]''.  Neither of the Beggars Banquet albums appeared on any mainstream pop charts.

In 1991, the band released a further single, \"Talking Back\", and then the ''[[Blasting Off]]'' album on the tiny Sparkhead label, after which Reed broke up what was left of the band.\n\nIn 2003, Reed revived the name Red Lorry Yellow Lorry and released four new songs in 2004, available via internet download only on the band\u2019s website.

Because of this, working class children can start out life at a disadvantage.  Their educational experience may be hindered for several reasons, including influences from their parents, the schools they attend, and their expectations and attitudes, all of which are strongly affected by previous generations \n\nThe interaction between low class learning and more high class used to be identified and only available for the people who weren't of low class the treatment. among the two each was was very different and only taken seriously if they were known as being superior.<ref name=\":0\" /> The classrooms were used to make the children from low classes believe that, because they come from low standards they weren't as good as their peers. Children who went to school for education weren\u2019t coming out with the proper variety they needed to be successful. The higher class was known as elite and their education was advanced and gifted.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sterns|first=Peter|title=Encyclopedia of Social History|publisher=|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> They were in charge scholastically and anyone under them was not receiving the same social or academic opportunity. Overall education has been used to keep the social order and academic order for the superior or elite students rather than all students. \n\n==Schools==\nThe schools in the lower income districts are characterized by overcrowding and lack of resources.  This is because the funding of American [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] comes mostly from their district's [[property taxes]].<ref name=\"Shipler\"/> [[Residential segregation]] occurs when people segregate themselves based on [[Social class|class]] and [[race (classification of human beings)|race]].  This leaves schools in the low income school districts with little because those who are capable of paying higher property taxes move to districts where there are higher taxes and schools are receiving more.<ref name=\"Shipler\"/> For example, in [[New York City]], where efforts are being made to level the playing field, students in the wealthiest school districts are given almost twice as much as students in the poorest district, an annual amount of $13,974 compared to $7,457.<ref name=\"Shipler\"/> When schools lack funding, programs such as special education classes and [[extracurricular activities]] are cut back. This causes some working class children to not get the attention and help they require.  When schools and teachers are not receiving the goods required to fulfill their duty, students cannot be expected to display the motivation to learn in a flawed system.<ref name=\"Lareau\"/>\n\n==Parental influences==\nThe way parents act in the home and raise their children has a large effect on how children will interact in social institutions.  Many social scientists claim that [[middle class]] parents practice [[concerted cultivation]], meaning a child's life is filled with organized activities and social interactions with adults.  Due to the extent of their interactions outside of the home, the children of concerted cultivation develop a greater mastery of language and are instilled with a sense of entitlement, both of which allows them to become more comfortable when interacting with institutions.<ref name=\"Lareau\">Lareau, Annette. Unequal Childhoods. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003.</ref>  On the other hand, many working-class parents practice the accomplishment of natural growth, where children have more control over their free time and are exposed to fewer interactions with adults that are outside of the home.<ref name=\"Lareau\"/> These children are usually left to occupy themselves with activities such as watching TV, playing video games, or playing outside. Working-class parents put less emphasis on planned activities, than their middle class counterparts, because they are less likely to have the funds to pay for them.<ref name=\"Doob\">Doob, Christopher Bates. \"Working-Class Development.\" Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2013. N. pag.

New Working-Class Studies. Ithaca: ILR Press, 2005.</ref> Because working-class parents are often uncomfortable around authority figures, they are less likely to communicate with their child's teacher or become involved in the school.  As a result of this, low income school districts have lower involvement in parent teacher conferences.<ref name=\"Shipler\">Shipler, David. The Working Poor. New York: Knopf, 2004.</ref> This could also be attributed to the fact that working-class parents often have to hold down more than one job and do not have very much time to help their children with homework or attend school functions. As a consequence, working-class children mature in narrow social settings, receive fewer resources, and feel less entitlement.<ref name=\"Doob\"/>\n\n==Attitudes==\nThe children of the working class approach school with a different attitude than those of higher class.  This is because their [[non-possession#Sense of Entitlement|sense of entitlement]] is lower than that of their middle class counterparts. Working-class students sometimes feel unentitled or that they do not belong in affluent high schools or colleges.<ref name=\"Doob\"/>  Instead of viewing [[education]] as a way up in the world, the working class views it as valuable but not as a reality for them.<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, Ruby.

Only 54% of students whose parents only received their high school diploma go on to pursue their [[bachelor's degree]].  This statistic is compared to the 82% of students whose parents received their bachelor's degree that go on to college.<ref name=\"Russo\"/> First generation students who do on go to college experience a culture shock once they get there because they are not as comfortable and sure of themselves as those that have come from a family that has received [[higher education]].

The outlook and importance of education is not the same as families with wealth. [[Inheritance]] plays a strong role in the way parents and children view and value education.\n\n==Solving the problem==\nThere are some ways that this may be changed.  In order to break this cycle, working class students might be taught the values of the middle class or the schooling system develop programs that help those students that are not receiving the support and guidance they need from home.  The middle class values are the same values that are felt by the authority figures at school; therefore, through teaching working class students to value education and be more involved they will be able to navigate [[social institutions]] with greater purpose and poise.<ref name=\"Payne\"/> The problem could be that working-class parents did not have these values instilled in them; therefore, they are less likely to pass these values on to their children.  Schools have been left with the responsibility of being the only places for some children to learn the rules and values that are present in most institutions.<ref name=\"Payne\"/>\n\nSolving the problem of racism within these institutions, causing perpetual problems and nearly impossible change, would take large steps towards rectifying problems within the education system. As long as [[institutionalized racism]] exists, problems within the educational system will continue to exist.\n\nDue to the lack of resources in needy schools, educational facilities are forced to develop support systems that do not have any additional costs.  Programs that have been introduced into lower income schools include the following:<ref name=\"Payne\"/>\n\n* A specified amount of time set aside everyday for homework can help the child better understand.  Often working-class parents have neither the time nor the knowledge to help their children with their homework.  By providing time for homework during the school day, students who are not receiving the help they need at home are able to receive supplemental instruction.\n* Keeping the same teachers for a few years or having separate schools within schools can strengthen relationships.  This program allows children and parents to become more familiar with teachers and to form stronger bonds.  By strengthening the student and teacher relationship, students are able to receive more guidance from their teachers and grow more comfortable, which may be a lacking opportunity in the home.\n* The setting of daily goals can help children learn how to face challenges and deadlines.  By setting the goals in writing at the beginning of every day or week, children learn how to manage and prioritize tasks in order to feel a sense of achievement when the goals are met.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Economic inequality]]\n* [[Education in the United States]]\n* [[Educational attainment in the United States]]\n* [[Educational inequality]]\n* ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]''\n* [[Working class culture]]\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Working Class Education}}\n[[Category:Education issues]]\n[[Category:Working class|Education]]\n", "text_old": "{{globalize|date=November 2019}}\n'''Working class education''' is the [[education]] of [[working-class]] people.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the 19th century, education for most members of society was [[elementary education|elementary]] and only an [[elite]] received advanced education.

{"title_page": "Homo reciprocans", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n'''''Homo reciprocans''''', or '''reciprocating human''', is the concept in some [[economic theories]] of humans as cooperative actors who are motivated by improving their environment through positive reciprocity (rewarding other individuals) or negative reciprocity (punishing other individuals), even in situations without foreseeable benefit for themselves.\n\nThis concept stands in contrast to the idea of ''[[homo economicus]]'', which states the opposite theory that human beings are exclusively motivated by self-interest. However, the two ideas can be reconciled if we assume that utility functions of the ''homo economicus'' can have parameters that are dependent to the perceived utility of other agents (such as one's spouse or children).\n\n==Kropotkin==\nRussian theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote about the concept of \"mutual aid\" in the early part of the 20th century. \n\n== Examples ==\nThe ''homo reciprocans'' concept states that human being players interact with a propensity to cooperate. They will compromise in order to achieve a balance between what is best for them and what is best for the environment they are a part of.  ''Homo reciprocans'' players, however, also are motivated by justification. If a second player is perceived as having done something wrong or insulting, the first player is willing to \"take a hit\", even with no foreseeable benefits, in order for the second player to suffer.\n\nA common example of this interaction is the haggler and shopkeeper.  If the haggler wants a deal and the shopkeeper wants a sale, the haggler must carefully choose a price for the shopkeeper to consider.  The shopkeeper will consider a lower price (or a price in between) based on the benefit of selling a product.

However, the two ideas can be reconciled if we assume that utility functions of the ''homo economicus'' can have parameters that are dependent to the perceived utility of other agents (such as one's spouse or children).\n\n==Kropotkin==\nRussian theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote about the concept of \"mutual aid\" in the early part of the 20th century. \n\n== Examples ==\nThe ''homo reciprocans'' concept states that human being players interact with a propensity to cooperate. They will compromise in order to achieve a balance between what is best for them and what is best for the environment they are a part of.  ''Homo reciprocans'' players, however, also are motivated by justification. If a second player is perceived as having done something wrong or insulting, the first player is willing to \"take a hit\", even with no foreseeable benefits, in order for the second player to suffer.\n\nA common example of this interaction is the haggler and shopkeeper.  If the haggler wants a deal and the shopkeeper wants a sale, the haggler must carefully choose a price for the shopkeeper to consider.  The shopkeeper will consider a lower price (or a price in between) based on the benefit of selling a product.  If the haggler's offer is a [[low-ball]], which may be offensive to the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper may refuse simply on the grounds that he is offended, and will knowingly and purposely lose the sale.\n\n== Positive and negative reciprocity ==\nReciprocal players are willing to reward behaviour that is just or fair, and to punish unjust or unfair behaviour.
