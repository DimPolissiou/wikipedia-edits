The act removed ''de facto'' discrimination against [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asians]], and other non-[[Northwestern Europe|Northwestern European]] ethnic groups from [[Immigration to the United States|American immigration policy]].\n\nLargely to restrict immigration from [[Asia]], [[Southern Europe]], and [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] had permanently established the National Origins Formula as the basis of U.S. immigration policy.

With the support of the Johnson administration, Senator [[Philip Hart]] and Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]] introduced a bill to repeal the formula. The bill received wide support from both northern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of Congress, but strong opposition from [[Southern Democrats]] who viewed it as a threat to [[White Americans|white-majority demographics]] in the United States. Johnson signed the Hart\u2013Celler Act into law on October 3, 1965.

The act maintained per-country and total immigration limits, but included a provision exempting immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from numerical restrictions. The act also set a numerical limit on immigration from the [[Western Hemisphere]] for the first time in U.S. history. Though proponents of the bill had argued that it would not have a major effect on the total level of immigration or the demographic mix of the United States, the act greatly increased the total number of immigrants coming to the United States, as well as the share of immigrants coming to the United States from Asia and [[Africa]].\n\n==Background==\n\nThe Hart\u2013Celler Act of 1965 marked a radical break from U.S. immigration policies of the past. Since Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to \"white persons\" in 1790, laws restricted immigration from  Asia and Africa, and gave preference to northern and western Europeans over southern and [[Eastern Europeans]].<ref name=\"Create diversity\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/u-s-immigration-before-1965|title=U.S. Immigration Before 1965|access-date=2016-09-03}}</ref> Limiting immigration of non-northern Europeans, according to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, was \"to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\".<ref name=\"homogeneity\"/> German praise for America's institutional racism appeared throughout the early 1930s, influencing race-based citizenship laws, [[anti-miscegenation laws]], and immigration laws.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=James Q.|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37\u201343}}</ref> In establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany in 1925, [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote of his admiration for America's immigration laws:\n{{quote|The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/american-laws-against-coloreds-influenced-nazi-racial-planners/ \"American laws against 'coloreds' influenced Nazi racial planners\"].

Abroad, former military allies and new independent nations aimed to delegitimize discriminatory immigration, naturalization and regulations through international organizations like the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/geopolitical-origins-us-immigration-act-1965\n| title = The Geopolitical Origins of the U.S. Immigration Acts of 1965\n| website = migrationpolicy.org\n| access-date = 2016-03-01\n| date = February 4, 2015\n}}</ref> In the United States, the national-based formula had been under scrutiny for a number of years.

This meant that it eliminated national origin, race, and ancestry as basis for immigration.\n* It created a seven-category preference system, which gave priority to relatives of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents and to professionals and other individuals with specialized skills.\n* Immediate relatives and \"special immigrants\" were not subject to numerical restrictions. Some of the \"special immigrants\" include ministers, former employees of the U.S. government, foreign medical graduates, among others.\n* For the first time, immigration from the Western Hemisphere was limited.\n* It added a labor certification requirement, which dictated that the Secretary of Labor needed to certify labor shortages.\n* Refugees were given the seventh and last category preference with the possibility of adjusting their status. However, refugees could enter the United States through other means as well, like those seeking temporary asylum.\n\n==Wages under Foreign Certification==\nAs per the rules under the Immigration and Nationality Act, U.S. organizations are permitted to employ foreign workers either temporarily or permanently to fulfill certain types of job requirements. The [[Employment and Training Administration]] under the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] is the body that usually provides certification to employers allowing them to hire foreign workers in order to bridge qualified and skilled labor gaps in certain business areas. Employers must confirm that they are unable to hire American workers willing to perform the job for wages paid by employers for the same occupation in the intended area of employment. However, some unique rules are applied to each category of visas. They are as follows:\n\n*H-1B and H-1B1 Specialty (Professional) Workers should have a pay, as per the prevailing wage \u2013 an average wage that is paid to a person employed in the same occupation in the area of employment; or that the employer pays its workers the actual wage paid to people having similar skills and qualifications.\n*H-2A Agricultural Workers should have the highest pay in accordance to the (a) Adverse Effect Wage Rate, (b) the present rate for a particular crop or area, or (c) the state or federal minimum wage. The law also stipulates requirements like employer-sponsored meals and transportation of the employees as well as restrictions on deducting from the workers' wages.\n*H-2B Non-agricultural Workers should receive a pay that is in accordance with the prevailing wage (mean wage paid to a worker employed in a similar occupation in the concerned area of employment).\n*D-1 Crewmembers (longshore work) should be paid the current wage (mean wage paid to a person employed in a similar occupation in the respective area of employment).\n*Permanent Employment of Aliens should be employed after the employer has agreed to provide and pay as per the prevailing wage trends and that it should be decided on the basis of one of the many alternatives provisioned under the said Act. This rule has to be followed the moment the Alien has been granted with permanent residency or the Alien has been admitted in the United States so as to take the required position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/compliance/topics/wages-foreign-workers.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925145002/http://www.dol.gov/compliance/topics/wages-foreign-workers.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-09-25 |title=Wages under Foreign Labor Certification |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative history==\n[[File:Immigration Bill Signing - A1421-33a - 10-03-1965.jpg|thumb|President [[Lyndon B.

The act removed ''de facto'' discrimination against [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asians]], and other non-[[Northwestern Europe|Northwestern European]] ethnic groups from [[Immigration to the United States|American immigration policy]].\n\nLargely to restrict immigration from [[Asia]], [[Southern Europe]], and [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] had permanently established the National Origins Formula as the basis of U.S. immigration policy. By limiting immigration of non-Northern Europeans, according to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian the purpose of the 1924 act was \"to preserve the ideal of American [Northwestern European] homogeneity\".<ref name=\"homogeneity\">{{cite news| url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act | work=U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian | title=The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) | accessdate=2019-05-15}}</ref> During the 1960s, at the height of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the National Origins Formula increasingly came under attack for being [[Racism in the United States|racially discriminatory]]. With the support of the Johnson administration, Senator [[Philip Hart]] and Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]] introduced a bill to repeal the formula. The bill received wide support from both northern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of Congress, but strong opposition from [[Southern Democrats]] who viewed it as a threat to [[White Americans|white-majority demographics]] in the United States. Johnson signed the Hart\u2013Celler Act into law on October 3, 1965.

The act maintained per-country and total immigration limits, but included a provision exempting immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from numerical restrictions. The act also set a numerical limit on immigration from the [[Western Hemisphere]] for the first time in U.S. history. Though proponents of the bill had argued that it would not have a major effect on the total level of immigration or the demographic mix of the United States, the act greatly increased the total number of immigrants coming to the United States, as well as the share of immigrants coming to the United States from Asia and [[Africa]].\n\n==Background==\n\nThe Hart\u2013Celler Act of 1965 marked a radical break from U.S. immigration policies of the past. Since Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to \"white persons\" in 1790, laws restricted immigration from  Asia and Africa, and gave preference to northern and western Europeans over southern and [[Eastern Europeans]].<ref name=\"Create diversity\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/u-s-immigration-before-1965|title=U.S. Immigration Before 1965|access-date=2016-09-03}}</ref> Limiting immigration of non-northern Europeans, according to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, was \"to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\".<ref name=\"homogeneity\"/> German praise for America's institutional racism appeared throughout the early 1930s, influencing race-based citizenship laws, [[anti-miscegenation laws]], and immigration laws.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=James Q.|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37\u201343}}</ref> In establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany in 1925, [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote of his admiration for America's immigration laws:\n{{quote|The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/american-laws-against-coloreds-influenced-nazi-racial-planners/ \"American laws against 'coloreds' influenced Nazi racial planners\"].

Abroad, former military allies and new independent nations aimed to delegitimize discriminatory immigration, naturalization and regulations through international organizations like the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/geopolitical-origins-us-immigration-act-1965\n| title = The Geopolitical Origins of the U.S. Immigration Acts of 1965\n| website = migrationpolicy.org\n| access-date = 2016-03-01\n| date = February 4, 2015\n}}</ref> In the United States, the national-based formula had been under scrutiny for a number of years.

This meant that it eliminated national origin, race, and ancestry as basis for immigration.\n* It created a seven-category preference system, which gave priority to relatives of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents and to professionals and other individuals with specialized skills.\n* Immediate relatives and \"special immigrants\" were not subject to numerical restrictions. Some of the \"special immigrants\" include ministers, former employees of the U.S. government, foreign medical graduates, among others.\n* For the first time, immigration from the Western Hemisphere was limited.\n* It added a labor certification requirement, which dictated that the Secretary of Labor needed to certify labor shortages.\n* Refugees were given the seventh and last category preference with the possibility of adjusting their status. However, refugees could enter the United States through other means as well, like those seeking temporary asylum.\n\n==Wages under Foreign Certification==\nAs per the rules under the Immigration and Nationality Act, U.S. organizations are permitted to employ foreign workers either temporarily or permanently to fulfill certain types of job requirements. The [[Employment and Training Administration]] under the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] is the body that usually provides certification to employers allowing them to hire foreign workers in order to bridge qualified and skilled labor gaps in certain business areas. Employers must confirm that they are unable to hire American workers willing to perform the job for wages paid by employers for the same occupation in the intended area of employment. However, some unique rules are applied to each category of visas. They are as follows:\n\n*H-1B and H-1B1 Specialty (Professional) Workers should have a pay, as per the prevailing wage \u2013 an average wage that is paid to a person employed in the same occupation in the area of employment; or that the employer pays its workers the actual wage paid to people having similar skills and qualifications.\n*H-2A Agricultural Workers should have the highest pay in accordance to the (a) Adverse Effect Wage Rate, (b) the present rate for a particular crop or area, or (c) the state or federal minimum wage. The law also stipulates requirements like employer-sponsored meals and transportation of the employees as well as restrictions on deducting from the workers' wages.\n*H-2B Non-agricultural Workers should receive a pay that is in accordance with the prevailing wage (mean wage paid to a worker employed in a similar occupation in the concerned area of employment).\n*D-1 Crewmembers (longshore work) should be paid the current wage (mean wage paid to a person employed in a similar occupation in the respective area of employment).\n*Permanent Employment of Aliens should be employed after the employer has agreed to provide and pay as per the prevailing wage trends and that it should be decided on the basis of one of the many alternatives provisioned under the said Act. This rule has to be followed the moment the Alien has been granted with permanent residency or the Alien has been admitted in the United States so as to take the required position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/compliance/topics/wages-foreign-workers.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925145002/http://www.dol.gov/compliance/topics/wages-foreign-workers.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-09-25 |title=Wages under Foreign Labor Certification |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative history==\n[[File:Immigration Bill Signing - A1421-33a - 10-03-1965.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|President [[Lyndon B.

She was active between 1936 and 1963. A member of the Golden Age and Post-War periods of surrealism, she is mostly recognized for her artistic works, which typically contain themes of an architectural nature.\n\n==Biography==\nSage was born in [[Albany, New York]], into a wealthy family that had made its money in the timber industry.<ref>\u201cSage, Kay Linn, June 25, 1898-Jan. 8, 1963.\u201d 1980, pp. Notable American Women: The Modern Period.</ref> Her father, [[Henry M.

Sage had an elder sister, Anne Erskine Sage.<ref>Suther, Judith D. ''A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1997, p.1</ref>\n\n===Early life===\nAnne Wheeler Ward Sage left her husband and older daughter soon after Kay's birth to live and travel in Europe with Kay as her companion. She and Henry Sage divorced in 1908, but Henry Sage continued to support his ex-wife and younger daughter, and Katherine visited him and his new wife in Albany from time to time and wrote him frequent letters.<ref>Suther pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n[[File:Danger, Construction Ahead.jpg|thumb|Asymmetrically placed large foreground forms emphasize distance in ''Danger, Construction Ahead'' of 1940.<ref>Surrealism and Women; Mary Ann Caws, Rudolf E.

No reason, no purpose, nothing.\"<ref>Sage, ''China Eggs,'' p. 103, cited in Suther p. 51.</ref> Her husband was content with their lifestyle, but Sage was not: as she wrote in her autobiography, ''China Eggs,'' \"Some sort of inner sense in me was reserving my potentialities for something better and more constructive.\"<ref>Sage, ''China Eggs,'' p. 131, cited in Suther p. 50.</ref>\n\n===Surrealism and Tanguy===\n[[File:Margin of Silence.jpg|thumb|left|In ''Margin of Silence'' of 1942, forms are figurative, static, and draped.<ref>''Albany Institute of History & Art: 200 Years of Collecting''; SUNY Press, January 1, 1998 \"She began to use forms covered by rigid draperies, sometimes suggesting figurative shapes beneath, as in ''Margin of Silence'' 1942, also owned by the AIHA.

In ''A House of Her Own,'' her 1997 biography of Sage, Judith Suther describes these works as \"experimental abstract compositions.\"<ref>Suther pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nSage moved to Paris in March 1937 and rented a luxurious apartment there.<ref>Suther pp. 59\u201360.</ref> In early 1938 she saw the International Surrealist Exhibit at Galerie Beaux-Arts, 299 pieces by 60 artists from 14 countries.<ref>Suther pp. 60\u201361.</ref> She was especially struck by the paintings of Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]], which featured what Magdalena Holzhey, in a book devoted to de Chirico, calls \"empty squares and receding depths, shadowy arcades and soaring towers.\"<ref>Holzhey, Magdalena. ''Giorgio de Chirico 1888\u20131978: The Modern Myth.'' Cologne: Taschen, 2005, p. 18.</ref> Sage bought one of de Chirico's paintings, ''La Surprise,'' and kept it all her life.<ref>Suther p. 62.</ref>\n\nThis exposure to [[Surrealism]] inspired Sage to begin painting in earnest. She exhibited six of her new oils in the Salon des Surind\u00e9pendants show at the Porte de Versailles in the fall of 1938. These semiabstract paintings, including ''Afterwards'' and ''The World Is Blue,'' borrowed motifs and styles from de Chirico and the Surrealists but showed hints of Sage's own future work as well.<ref>Suther pp. 63\u201364.</ref> Art historian Whitney Chadwick states that Sage's paintings were \"imbued with an aura of purified form and a sense of motionlessness and impending doom found nowhere else in Surrealism.\"<ref>Chadwick p. 166.</ref> Around this time the artist began signing her works \"Kay Sage.\"<ref>Suther p. 68.</ref>\n\nSeveral stories are told about Sage's meeting with her future husband, Surrealist artist [[Yves Tanguy]]. One came from Greek poet [[Nicolas Calas]], who recalled that he and Tanguy accompanied Surrealist leader [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] to the Surind\u00e9pendants exhibit and were impressed enough by Sage's paintings to seek her out. Calas claimed that Breton  was sure that the paintings must have been made by a man.<ref>Chadwick p. 60.</ref>\n\nTanguy at the time was married to Jeannette Ducroq,<ref>Suther p. 75.</ref> but they were separated, and he and Sage immediately fell in love. Breton and most of the other Surrealists were much less welcoming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/kunsthalle-schirn-surrealist-women-1779669|title=Surrealism Was a Decidedly Feminine Movement.

Most of Sage's paintings lack recognizable human beings,\"</ref>]]\nThe relationship between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art. At the same parties during which he banged his head against those of other men, Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife. Sage, according to friends' accounts, made no response to her husband's aggression except to try to persuade him to go home.<ref>Suther pp. 129\u2013130.</ref> Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage's painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her.<ref>Suther p. 131.</ref> The couple must have shared different feelings in private, however, because all accounts agree that Sage was devastated by Tanguy's death. \"Yves was my only friend who understood everything,\" she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, an old friend of Tanguy's, about a month after Tanguy's fatal stroke.<ref>Letter from Kay Sage to Jehan Mayoux, February 5, 1955, AAA no. 2887 (\"Stephen Robeson Miller Research Papers about Kay Sage, 1898\u20131983\"), cited in Suther, pp. 161\u2013162.</ref>\n\nSage did fewer new paintings after Tanguy died, partly because of her [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and partly because of her decreasing eyesight due to [[cataracts]].<ref>Suther pp. 196\u2013197.</ref> Instead, she devoted her time to two projects: preserving Tanguy's reputation through retrospective shows and a complete catalogue of his work, and writing poetry, mostly in the slangy French she had learned in her youth and spoken with Tanguy.<ref>Suther p. 177.</ref> With the help of longtime friend Marcel Duhamel\u2014and her own subsidies to cover most of the printing costs\u2014Sage arranged for a book of this poetry, ''Demain, Monsieur Silber,'' to be published in France in June 1957.<ref>Suther pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> Around 1955 she also wrote a partial autobiography, ''China Eggs,'' which covered her life up to about the time she left San Faustino, but she never tried to publish it.<ref>Tessier p. 618</ref>\n\nOne of the chief paintings in a show of 13 of Sage's oils at the Viviano Gallery in November 1958 was called ''The Answer Is No.''<ref>Suther pp. 197,199.</ref> This seems to have reflected Sage's own state of mind. She filed her will in Waterbury in December 1958, and on April 28\u201329, 1959, a few weeks after she completed a massive catalogue of Tanguy's paintings, she attempted to end her life with an overdose of sleeping pills. A housekeeper found her, however, and she was revived.<ref>Suther p. 207.</ref>\n\nSage seemed to rally for a while after her suicide attempt.

One of her biographers, Judith Suther, writes: \n:I call Kay Sage a Surrealist because her painting resonates with the unsettling paradoxes and hallucinatory qualities prized by Andr\u00e9 Breton and his group. . . . More fundamentally, I call Sage a Surrealist because her allegiance to the Surrealist identity lies at the heart of her self-image as an artist.<ref>Suther p. xv.</ref>\n\nCritics during Sage's lifetime frequently compared her work to that of Tanguy, who was better known, and usually assumed that, when their work had features in common, those features must have originated with him.<ref>Suther p. 157.</ref> More recent feminist scholars have stated that the influence more likely was mutual\u2014what Judith Suther calls \"a constant, usually unconscious interchange.\"<ref>Suther pp. 232\u2013233.</ref> Suther and others also point out differences between the two artists: for example, the large architectural constructions that dominate Sage's paintings are quite unlike the smaller biomorphic or metallic forms that people associate with Tanguy's landscapes.\n\nBoth Suther<ref>Suther pp. xvi\u2013xvii.</ref> and R\u00e9gine Tessier, the latter in a sketch of Sage in ''Notable American Women: The Modern Period,''<ref>Tessier p. 619.</ref> note key features of Sage's mature work. Most of Sage's paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that might or might not be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (''Le Passage,'' one of Sage's last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even ''Small Portrait,'' thought by many to be a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as \"reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm\".<ref>Tessier p. 619.</ref> Critics frequently called Sage's work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.<ref>Suther pp. 139\u2013140.</ref>\n\nSage almost never commented on what her paintings represented or how their seemingly ominous mood should be interpreted. One exception was her statement to a ''Time'' magazine critic that ''The Instant,'' a painting that appeared in her 1950 show at the Catherine Viviano gallery, was \"a sort of showing of what's inside\u2014things half mechanical, half alive.\"<ref>''Time,'' March 13, 1950, cited in Suther p. 134.</ref>\n\n===Artworks===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*''A Little Later'' (1938)\n*''My Room Has Two Doors'' (1939)\n*''This Morning (painting)|This Morning'' (1939)\n*''Lost Record'' (1940)\n*''Danger, Construction Ahead'' (1940)\n*''White Silence'' (1941)\n*''Margin of Silence'' (1942)\n*''The Fourteen Daggers'' (1942)\n*''At The Appointed Time'' (1942)\n*''The Hidden Letter'' (1943)\n*''From Another Approach'' (1944)\n*''I Saw Three Cities'' (1944)\n*''In the 3rd Sleep'' (1944)\n*''The Upper Side of the Sky'' (1944)\n*''All Soundings Are Referred to High Water'' (1947)\n*''Ring of Iron, Ring of Wool'' (1947)\n*''The Unicorns Came Down From the Sea'' (1947)\n*''The Instant'' (1949)\n*''The Morning Myth'' (1950)\n*''Small Portrait'' (1950)\n*''Men Working'' (1951)\n*''Tomorrow for Example'' (1951)\n*''Unusual Thursday'' (1951)\n*''[[On the Contrary]]'' (1952)\n*''Third Paragraph'' (1953)\n*''No Passing'' (1954)\n*''Hyphen'' (1954)\n*''A Bird in the Room'' (1955)\n*''Tomorrow is Never'' (1955)\n*''Le Passage'' (1956)\n*''The Answer Is No'' (1958)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Exhibitions===\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*1936, Galleria del Milione, Milan, Italy (six oils) (actually a three-person exhibition: see S.

First listed in Books in Print in 1995 as \"date not set\" with a Boston, Massachusetts, publisher (Nelmar Press), this book was eventually published by the Gallery of Surrealism, New York, to coincide with the Sage and Tanguy exhibition at the Katonah Museum of Art, Katonah, New York, cited above, of which Miller was curator.  Miller included with the plays an edited and revised version of his 1983 one hundred page Archives of American Art chronology on microfilm reel nos. 2886-2888 which extensively incorporated quotations from his interviews and correspondence with people who knew Sage and which forms part of the collection named by the AAA \"The Stephen Robeson Miller Research Papers about Kay Sage, 1898\u20131983\".  Additionally, included for each year in the Chronology, is the source for each quotation/entry and a list of the titles of the works she had executed during that year, thereby making it a catalogue raisonne of Sage's Surrealist works without illustrations (see below).\n*Miller, Stephen Robeson.  \"Illustrated Catalogue Raisonne of the Surrealist Art of Kay Sage\" on microfilm at the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., 1983, in which the works appear chronologically.

(Stephen Robeson Miller regrets that in his Chronology in the Kay Sage Catalogue Raisonne, published in 2018, there was not time before the book went to press to include the following correction: Sage saw her first Tanguy painting Je vous attends (I await you), 1934, at the Galerie Charpentier in Paris in January 1935, not at the same gallery during the summer of 1936.  Proof of this information is the checklist of the exhibition called \"Le Temps Present: Peinture, Sculpture, Gravure: 1er Exposition de 1935\" held from January 10\u201328 at the Galerie Charpentier, Paris, with Tanguy's painting listed as number 232, courtesy of the Pierre Matisse Foundation, New York).\n*Rosenberg, Karen. \"''A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist.''\" ''Women's Review of Books,'' v. 15 i. 6 (March 1998), p.&nbsp;4 ff.  \n*Suther, Judith D.

A member of the Golden Age and Post-War periods of surrealism, she is mostly recognized for her artistic works, which typically contain themes of an architectural nature.\n\n==Biography==\nSage was born in [[Albany, New York]], into a wealthy family that had made its money in the timber industry. Her father, [[Henry M. Sage]], was a state assemblyman the year after her birth and later was a five-term state senator. Her mother was Anne Wheeler (Ward) Sage. Sage had an elder sister, Anne Erskine Sage.<ref>Suther, Judith D. ''A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist.''

She exhibited six of her new oils in the Salon des Surind\u00e9pendants show at the Porte de Versailles in the fall of 1938. These semiabstract paintings, including ''Afterwards'' and ''The World Is Blue,'' borrowed motifs and styles from de Chirico and the Surrealists but showed hints of Sage's own future work as well.<ref>Suther pp. 63\u201364.</ref> Art historian Whitney Chadwick states that Sage's paintings were \"imbued with an aura of purified form and a sense of motionlessness and impending doom found nowhere else in Surrealism.\"<ref>Chadwick p. 166.</ref> Around this time the artist began signing her works \"Kay Sage.\"<ref>Suther p. 68.</ref>\n\nSeveral stories are told about Sage's meeting with her future husband, Surrealist artist [[Yves Tanguy]]. One came from Greek poet [[Nicolas Calas]], who recalled that he and Tanguy accompanied Surrealist leader [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] to the Surind\u00e9pendants exhibit and were impressed enough by Sage's paintings to seek her out. Calas claimed that Breton  was sure that the paintings must have been made by a man.<ref>Chadwick p. 60.</ref>\n\nTanguy at the time was married to Jeannette Ducroq,<ref>Suther p. 75.</ref> but they were separated, and he and Sage immediately fell in love.

Most of Sage's paintings lack recognizable human beings,\"</ref>]]\nThe relationship between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art. At the same parties during which he banged his head against those of other men, Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife. Sage, according to friends' accounts, made no response to her husband's aggression except to try to persuade him to go home.<ref>Suther pp. 129\u2013130.</ref> Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage's painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her.<ref>Suther p. 131.</ref> The couple must have shared different feelings in private, however, because all accounts agree that Sage was devastated by Tanguy's death. \"Yves was my only friend who understood everything,\" she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, an old friend of Tanguy's, about a month after Tanguy's fatal stroke.<ref>Letter from Kay Sage to Jehan Mayoux, February 5, 1955, AAA no. 2887 (\"Stephen Robeson Miller Research Papers about Kay Sage, 1898\u20131983\"), cited in Suther, pp. 161\u2013162.</ref>\n\nSage did fewer new paintings after Tanguy died, partly because of her [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and partly because of her decreasing eyesight due to [[cataracts]].<ref>Suther pp. 196\u2013197.</ref> Instead, she devoted her time to two projects: preserving Tanguy's reputation through retrospective shows and a complete catalogue of his work, and writing poetry, mostly in the slangy French she had learned in her youth and spoken with Tanguy.<ref>Suther p. 177.</ref> With the help of longtime friend Marcel Duhamel\u2014and her own subsidies to cover most of the printing costs\u2014Sage arranged for a book of this poetry, ''Demain, Monsieur Silber,'' to be published in France in June 1957.<ref>Suther pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> Around 1955 she also wrote a partial autobiography, ''China Eggs,'' which covered her life up to about the time she left San Faustino, but she never tried to publish it.<ref>Tessier p. 618</ref>\n\nOne of the chief paintings in a show of 13 of Sage's oils at the Viviano Gallery in November 1958 was called ''The Answer Is No.''<ref>Suther pp. 197,199.</ref> This seems to have reflected Sage's own state of mind. She filed her will in Waterbury in December 1958, and on April 28\u201329, 1959, a few weeks after she completed a massive catalogue of Tanguy's paintings, she attempted to end her life with an overdose of sleeping pills. A housekeeper found her, however, and she was revived.<ref>Suther p. 207.</ref>\n\nSage seemed to rally for a while after her suicide attempt. In 1959 and 1960 she underwent operations to remove her cataracts, which she had formerly refused to do.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lanthony, Philippe.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/369143469|title=Art & ophthalmology : the impact of eye diseases on painters|date=2009|publisher=Weyenborgh Publications|isbn=978-90-6299-460-1|oclc=369143469}}</ref> Unfortunately, the surgeries were painful and had only limited success,<ref>Suther p. 209.</ref> and by this time she was suffering from other health problems as well, including some that may have resulted from her years of heavy smoking and drinking.<ref>Suther pp. 210\u2013211.</ref> During 1960 and 1961, as a substitute for painting, she made small sculptures of wire, stones, bullets, and other unusual materials.

One of her biographers, Judith Suther, writes: \n:I call Kay Sage a Surrealist because her painting resonates with the unsettling paradoxes and hallucinatory qualities prized by Andr\u00e9 Breton and his group. . . . More fundamentally, I call Sage a Surrealist because her allegiance to the Surrealist identity lies at the heart of her self-image as an artist.<ref>Suther p. xv.</ref>\n\nCritics during Sage's lifetime frequently compared her work to that of Tanguy, who was better known, and usually assumed that, when their work had features in common, those features must have originated with him.<ref>Suther p. 157.</ref> More recent feminist scholars have stated that the influence more likely was mutual\u2014what Judith Suther calls \"a constant, usually unconscious interchange.\"<ref>Suther pp. 232\u2013233.</ref> Suther and others also point out differences between the two artists: for example, the large architectural constructions that dominate Sage's paintings are quite unlike the smaller biomorphic or metallic forms that people associate with Tanguy's landscapes.\n\nBoth Suther<ref>Suther pp. xvi\u2013xvii.</ref> and R\u00e9gine Tessier, the latter in a sketch of Sage in ''Notable American Women: The Modern Period,''<ref>Tessier p. 619.</ref> note key features of Sage's mature work. Most of Sage's paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that might or might not be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (''Le Passage,'' one of Sage's last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even ''Small Portrait,'' thought by many to be a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as \"reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm\".<ref>Tessier p. 619.</ref> Critics frequently called Sage's work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.<ref>Suther pp. 139\u2013140.</ref>\n\nSage almost never commented on what her paintings represented or how their seemingly ominous mood should be interpreted. One exception was her statement to a ''Time'' magazine critic that ''The Instant,'' a painting that appeared in her 1950 show at the Catherine Viviano gallery, was \"a sort of showing of what's inside\u2014things half mechanical, half alive.\"<ref>''Time,'' March 13, 1950, cited in Suther p. 134.</ref>\n\n===Artworks===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*''A Little Later'' (1938)\n*''My Room Has Two Doors'' (1939)\n*''This Morning (painting)|This Morning'' (1939)\n*''Lost Record'' (1940)\n*''Danger, Construction Ahead'' (1940)\n*''White Silence'' (1941)\n*''Margin of Silence'' (1942)\n*''The Fourteen Daggers'' (1942)\n*''At The Appointed Time'' (1942)\n*''The Hidden Letter'' (1943)\n*''From Another Approach'' (1944)\n*''I Saw Three Cities'' (1944)\n*''In the 3rd Sleep'' (1944)\n*''The Upper Side of the Sky'' (1944)\n*''All Soundings Are Referred to High Water'' (1947)\n*''Ring of Iron, Ring of Wool'' (1947)\n*''The Unicorns Came Down From the Sea'' (1947)\n*''The Instant'' (1949)\n*''The Morning Myth'' (1950)\n*''Small Portrait'' (1950)\n*''Men Working'' (1951)\n*''Tomorrow for Example'' (1951)\n*''Unusual Thursday'' (1951)\n*''[[On the Contrary]]'' (1952)\n*''Third Paragraph'' (1953)\n*''No Passing'' (1954)\n*''Hyphen'' (1954)\n*''A Bird in the Room'' (1955)\n*''Tomorrow is Never'' (1955)\n*''Le Passage'' (1956)\n*''The Answer Is No'' (1958)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Exhibitions===\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*1936, Galleria del Milione, Milan, Italy (six oils) (actually a three-person exhibition: see S.

Their style is colloquial, their wit sharp and often directed at herself.

Miller included with the plays an edited and revised version of his 1983 one hundred page Archives of American Art chronology on microfilm reel nos. 2886-2888 which extensively incorporated quotations from his interviews and correspondence with people who knew Sage and which forms part of the collection named by the AAA \"The Stephen Robeson Miller Research Papers about Kay Sage, 1898\u20131983\".  Additionally, included for each year in the Chronology, is the source for each quotation/entry and a list of the titles of the works she had executed during that year, thereby making it a catalogue raisonne of Sage's Surrealist works without illustrations (see below).\n*Miller, Stephen Robeson.  \"Illustrated Catalogue Raisonne of the Surrealist Art of Kay Sage\" on microfilm at the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., 1983, in which the works appear chronologically.
