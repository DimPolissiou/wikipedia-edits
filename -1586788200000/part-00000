Mowbray played for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].\n\nHe began his coaching career with Ipswich Town and took his first managerial job at [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], where he won the [[Scottish Football Writers' Association]] Manager of the Year award in his first season. He moved on to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 2006, where he won the [[Football League Championship]] in 2008, but then suffered relegation from the [[Premier League]] the following year.

In 1991 after 348 appearances for ''Boro'', Mowbray moved to Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for \u00a31 million.\n\n===Celtic===\nDuring his playing career with Celtic, Mowbray's wife Bernadette, a native of [[Renfrewshire]], died of breast cancer.

In 1991 after 348 appearances for ''Boro'', Mowbray moved to Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for \u00a31 million.\n\n===Celtic===\nDuring his playing career with Celtic, Mowbray's wife Bernadette, a native of [[Renfrewshire]], died of breast cancer. The episode is recalled in Mowbray's book, \"Kissed by an Angel.\"  It is often asserted that the \"huddle\" which Celtic players still perform before each match was arranged as a tribute to Bernadette.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/2006/10/14/shaped-by-passion-and-grief-65233-17940375|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720194704/http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/2006/10/14/shaped-by-passion-and-grief-65233-17940375|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 July 2012|title=Shaped by passion and grief|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|last=Jawad|first=Hyder|date=14 October 2006|accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref> However, it was merely suggested by Mowbray on a pre-season tour of Germany to bring the squad together at a time of uncertainty. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Ipswich Town===\nHe later moved on to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where he played for five years, becoming the team captain.
