Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

Jarvis, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P) established Sturgeon Creek Post as a [[Fortification|fort]] on the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name=\":1\" /> The post was soon renamed \"Fort (on the) Saskatchewan\", and it became a key northern police garrison. The community was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1899, a [[town]] in 1904, and a [[city]] in 1985.<ref name=\"AMACityProfiles\" />\n=== Arrival of the railway ===\n[[File:CNR Station Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=CN Station in Fort Saskatchewan.|left|thumb|300px|Historic [[Fort Saskatchewan station|Fort Saskatchewan railway station]]]]\nPrior to the arrival of the railway, people travelling to and from Edmonton had to traverse a dirt trail that wound around woods and swamps.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The introduction of full-time staff has reduced response times from up to 15 minutes, to 105 seconds.  New sleeping quarters were constructed at the fire station to accommodate the full-time staff. The city purchased property for a second fire station in 2017, reflecting the increase in call volumes coming from its newer neighbourhoods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/second-fire-station-coming-to-fort|title=Second fire station coming to Fort|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nFort Saskatchewan was also home to Canada's longest serving firefighter: Walter Thomas (1922-2017).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/walter-thomas-passed-away-at-95|title=Firefighting \"legend\" Walter Thomas passes away at 95|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Walter joined the department on May 1, 1947, and served until May 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/fort-firefighter-retiring-after-storied-70-years-of-service|title=Fort firefighter retiring after storied 70 years of service|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> a few months before he passed away.

Garbage is collected bi-weekly, organics are collected weekly or bi-weekly depending on the time of year, and recycling is collected weekly. All three waste streams are collected by a contracted company. Blue bins were used for recycling in the pilot program, but the city reverted to blue bags when launching the new waste system city-wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/spring-changes-coming-for-waste-collection-in-fort|title=Spring changes coming for the Fort's waste collection|last=Evans|first=Tim|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> This was because objects could get jammed in the blue bins, and crews could not easily tell if the loads inside blue bins were contaminated like they could with blue bags. Prior to the introduction of this system, the municipality contracted out collection of garbage and recycling only; recycling was collected in blue bags, but garbage cans were not regulated by the city. \n \n== Government ==\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville 2017.svg|thumb|253x253px|A map showing the provincial riding of Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville as of 2017]]\nFort Saskatchewan is directly governed by a city council consisting of one mayor and six councillors.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]].

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The Antares rocket was built and processed in the Horizontal Integration Facility over the course of six months. The rocket was rolled out to MARS Pad 0A where it was originally planned to launch 9 February 2020 but was scrubbed and delayed due to inclement weather and an issue with a regulator at the launch pad. The mission launched successfully on the 15 February 2020 at 20:21:01 UTC with no delay and no apparent problems. The Cygnus spacecraft arrived at the space station on 18 February 2020 at 09:05 UTC. Expedition 62 astronaut Andrew Morgan grappled the spacecraft using the station's robotic arm. After Cygnus capture, ground controllers commanded the station's arm to rotate and install Cygnus on the Earth-facing port of the station's Unity module at 11:16 UTC. The Cygnus spacecraft is scheduled to remain at the space station until 11 May 2020.
