These informal chat alphabets were originally used primarily by [[youth in the Arab world|youth]] in the [[Arab world]] in very informal settings\u2014especially for communicating over the [[Internet]] or for sending [[SMS|messages]] via [[Mobile phone|cellular phones]]\u2014though use is not necessarily restricted by age anymore and these chat alphabets have been used in other media such as [[advertising]].<ref name=\"Yaghan\" /><ref name=\"PalfreymanKhalil\" />\n\nThese chat alphabets differ from more formal and academic [[Romanization of Arabic|Arabic transliteration]] systems, in that they use [[Arabic numerals|numerals]] and [[multigraph (orthography)|multigraph]]s instead of diacritics for letters such as [[Qoph|q\u0101f]] ([[Qoph|\u0642]]) or [[\u1e0c\u0101d]] ([[\u1e0c\u0101d|\u0636]]) that do not exist in the basic Latin script ([[ASCII]]), and in that what is being transcribed is an informal [[Varieties of Arabic|dialect]] and not [[Standard Arabic]].<ref name=\"PalfreymanKhalil\" /> These Arabic chat alphabets also differ from each other, as each is influenced by the particular phonology of the [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialect]] being transcribed and the [[orthography]] of the dominant European language in the area\u2014typically the language of the former colonists, and typically either [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]].\n\nBecause of their widespread use, including in public advertisements by large multinational companies, large players in the online industry like [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] have introduced tools that convert text written in Arabish to Arabic ([[Google Translate]] and [[Microsoft Translator]]). Add-ons for Mozilla Firefox and Chrome also exist (Panlatin<ref>{{cite web|url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/panlatin/|title=Panlatin|website=Firefox Add-ons}}</ref> and ARABEASY Keyboard <ref>{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arabeasy-keyboard-type-ar/makncdgkhgjppmehkcgncbikakkdhndp?hl=en-US|title=ARABEASY Keyboard type Arabic in English IME|website=Chrome Web Store}}</ref>). The Arabic chat alphabet is never used in formal settings and is rarely, if ever, used for long communications.<ref name=Yaghan /> There for this language makes no sense\n\n== History ==\nDuring the last decades of the 20th century, Western text-based communication technologies, such as [[Text messaging|mobile phone text messaging]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[bulletin board system]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[instant messaging]] became increasingly prevalent in the [[Arab world]]. Most of these technologies originally permitted the use of the Latin script only, and some still lack support for displaying [[Arabic script]]. As a result, Arabic-speaking users frequently transliterate Arabic text into Latin script when using these technologies to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alwatannews.net/article/752201/Opinion/%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%8A!|title=\u0644\u0646\u0647\u062c\u0631 \u0644\u063a\u0629 \"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0632\u064a\"!|last=\u062c\u0646\u0627\u062d\u064a|first=\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0649 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641|date=2018-01-06|website=Watan|language=Arabic|access-date=2019-07-22}}</ref>\n\nTo handle those Arabic letters that do not have an approximate [[Phonetics|phonetic]] equivalent in the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral \"3\" is used to represent the Arabic letter {{angbr|{{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}}}} (''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfayn}}'')\u2014note the choice of a visually similar character, with the numeral resembling a mirrored version of the Arabic letter. Many users of mobile phones and computers use Arabish even though their system is capable of displaying Arabic script. This may be due to a lack of an appropriate [[Arabic keyboard|keyboard layout for Arabic]], or because users are already more familiar with the [[QWERTY]] or [[AZERTY]] [[keyboard layout]].\n\nOnline [[communication]] systems, such as IRC, bulletin board systems, and [[blog]]s, are often run on systems or over protocols that do not support [[code page]]s or alternate character sets. Thus, the Arabic chat alphabet has become commonplace. It can be seen even in [[domain name]]s, like [[Qal3ah]].\n\n== Comparison table ==\nBecause of the informal nature of this system, there is no single \"correct\" or \"official\" usage. There may be some overlap in the way various letters are transliterated.\n\nMost of the characters in the system make use of the Latin character (as used in English and French) that best approximates phonetically the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (for example, {{lang|ar|[[\u0628]]}} corresponds to ''b''). [[Varieties of Arabic|Regional variations]] in the pronunciation of an Arabic letter can also produce some variation in its transliteration (e.g. {{lang|ar|[[\ufe9d]]}} might be transliterated as ''j'' by a speaker of the [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine dialect]], or as ''g'' by a speaker of the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]]).<ref name=\"Egyptian Romanized Arabic\"/>\n\nThose letters that do not have a close phonetic approximation in the Latin script are often expressed using numerals or other characters, so that the numeral graphically approximates the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (e.g. {{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}} is represented using the numeral ''3'' because the latter looks like a vertical [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of the former).\n\nSince many letters are distinguished from others solely by a dot above or below the main portion of the character, the transliterations of these letters frequently use the same letter or number with an [[apostrophe]] added before or after (e.g. '''3'' is used to represent {{lang|ar|[[\u063a]]}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Add-ons for Mozilla Firefox and Chrome also exist (Panlatin<ref>{{cite web|url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/panlatin/|title=Panlatin|website=Firefox Add-ons}}</ref> and ARABEASY Keyboard <ref>{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arabeasy-keyboard-type-ar/makncdgkhgjppmehkcgncbikakkdhndp?hl=en-US|title=ARABEASY Keyboard type Arabic in English IME|website=Chrome Web Store}}</ref>). The Arabic chat alphabet is never used in formal settings and is rarely, if ever, used for long communications.<ref name=Yaghan />\n\n== History ==\nDuring the last decades of the 20th century, Western text-based communication technologies, such as [[Text messaging|mobile phone text messaging]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[bulletin board system]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[instant messaging]] became increasingly prevalent in the [[Arab world]]. Most of these technologies originally permitted the use of the Latin script only, and some still lack support for displaying [[Arabic script]]. As a result, Arabic-speaking users frequently transliterate Arabic text into Latin script when using these technologies to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alwatannews.net/article/752201/Opinion/%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%8A!|title=\u0644\u0646\u0647\u062c\u0631 \u0644\u063a\u0629 \"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0632\u064a\"!|last=\u062c\u0646\u0627\u062d\u064a|first=\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0649 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641|date=2018-01-06|website=Watan|language=Arabic|access-date=2019-07-22}}</ref>\n\nTo handle those Arabic letters that do not have an approximate [[Phonetics|phonetic]] equivalent in the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral \"3\" is used to represent the Arabic letter {{angbr|{{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}}}} (''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfayn}}'')\u2014note the choice of a visually similar character, with the numeral resembling a mirrored version of the Arabic letter. Many users of mobile phones and computers use Arabish even though their system is capable of displaying Arabic script. This may be due to a lack of an appropriate [[Arabic keyboard|keyboard layout for Arabic]], or because users are already more familiar with the [[QWERTY]] or [[AZERTY]] [[keyboard layout]].\n\nOnline [[communication]] systems, such as IRC, bulletin board systems, and [[blog]]s, are often run on systems or over protocols that do not support [[code page]]s or alternate character sets. Thus, the Arabic chat alphabet has become commonplace. It can be seen even in [[domain name]]s, like [[Qal3ah]].\n\n== Comparison table ==\nBecause of the informal nature of this system, there is no single \"correct\" or \"official\" usage. There may be some overlap in the way various letters are transliterated.\n\nMost of the characters in the system make use of the Latin character (as used in English and French) that best approximates phonetically the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (for example, {{lang|ar|[[\u0628]]}} corresponds to ''b''). [[Varieties of Arabic|Regional variations]] in the pronunciation of an Arabic letter can also produce some variation in its transliteration (e.g. {{lang|ar|[[\ufe9d]]}} might be transliterated as ''j'' by a speaker of the [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine dialect]], or as ''g'' by a speaker of the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]]).<ref name=\"Egyptian Romanized Arabic\"/>\n\nThose letters that do not have a close phonetic approximation in the Latin script are often expressed using numerals or other characters, so that the numeral graphically approximates the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (e.g. {{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}} is represented using the numeral ''3'' because the latter looks like a vertical [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of the former).\n\nSince many letters are distinguished from others solely by a dot above or below the main portion of the character, the transliterations of these letters frequently use the same letter or number with an [[apostrophe]] added before or after (e.g. '''3'' is used to represent {{lang|ar|[[\u063a]]}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

As was the case in other parts of the region, [[English language|English]] became the primary European language in Egypt as a result of [[History of Egypt under the British|British colonialism]] in the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/egyptian-independence-1919-22/|title=Egyptian Independence: 1919-22|website=ICNC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the letter [[Qoph|q\u0101f]] ([[Qoph|\u0642]]) is usually pronounced as a [[glottal stop]], like a [[Hamza]] ([[Hamza|\u0621]]) in Metropolitan (Cairene) Egyptian Arabic\u2014unlike [[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]] in which it represents a [[voiceless uvular stop]].

The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba.

After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

women consistently since [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

However, ''Honey to the B'' found limited success in other territories, such as Australia, where it debuted and peaked at number  31 despite the success of \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\", and in the US, it almost went completely unnoticed, peaking at number  17 on the Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/honey-to-the-b-mw0000664131/awards|title=Honey to the Bee - Billie|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1998 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, Piper was nominated for Best New Act (for which she came second, it being won by [[B*Witched]]) and won Princess of Pop (she was the first to win this award).

She then started to tour and release in Asia. The singles and the album were released during mid- to late 1999. In August of that year, the follow-up to \"Because We Want To\" was released in Japan, a single comprising \"Girlfriend\" and \"She Wants You\" combined.

She waited until September to release \"[[Something Deep Inside]]\", which reached number four, but her success waned. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, ''[[Walk of Life (album)|Walk of Life]]'', which reached #14 in the UK Album Chart, but quickly fell off the charts and was certified silver in the UK. The album only charted in two other countries: New Zealand, where it reached #17 only, and Australia, where it was a minor success and peaked at #23. In Piper's autobiography, she states that the album was a \"commercial bomb\". The song \"Walk of Life\", the final single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn February 2001, Piper appeared in court to testify against a woman named Juliet Peters. Peters was charged with, and eventually convicted of, stalking as well as making numerous threats against Piper and members of her family.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1321339/Billie-Piper-needs-head-cut-off-said-telephone-threats.html |title=Billie Piper 'needs head cut off', said telephone threats |date=6 February 2001 |last=Demetriou |first=Danielle |accessdate=28 June 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}</ref> Peters received psychiatric treatment as part of her sentence. According to her autobiography, Piper was reluctant about the court case, but was pushed by her parents and her label. She also stated in the book that this was why \"The Tide Is High\" was not released as a single, writing: \"The court case succeeded in doing what I alone could not {{ndash}} cutting the ties.

However, ''Honey to the B'' found limited success in other territories, such as Australia, where it debuted and peaked at number  31 despite the success of \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\", and in the US, it almost went completely unnoticed, peaking at number  17 on the Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/honey-to-the-b-mw0000664131/awards|title=Honey to the Bee - Billie|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1998 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, Piper was nominated for Best New Act (for which she came second, it being won by [[B*Witched]]) and won Princess of Pop (she was the first to win this award). She then released \"[[She Wants You#Billie version|She Wants You]]\" as the third single from the album. The song reached number three. \"Honey to the Bee\" was released as the fourth single from the album; like the previous single, it reached number three. <!--note: the album is ''Honey to the B'', but the song is \"Honey to the Bee.\"-->At the same time, \"She Wants You\" was released in the US, reaching number  9 on the \"Hot Club Dance Play\" chart.\n\nIn 1999, Piper was nominated for two [[BRIT Awards]] and won two awards at the 1999 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, although she was reduced to tears at the latter ceremony after being booed by fans of [[Ritchie Neville]], whom she was dating at the time. She then started to tour and release in Asia. The singles and the album were released during mid- to late 1999. In August of that year, the follow-up to \"Because We Want To\" was released in Japan, a single comprising \"Girlfriend\" and \"She Wants You\" combined. She recorded a song for ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie]]'' titled \"[[Billie Piper discography#Other appearances|Makin' My Way (Any Way That I Can)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pokemon-the-first-movie-mw0000254801|title= Pokemon: The First Movie > Overview|accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n====''Walk of Life''====\n[[File:Billie Piper (16) edited.jpg|thumb|Piper in 2004]]\nDuring that time, Piper recorded her second album. She decided to release further records under her full name of Billie Piper. She returned to the Singles Chart in May 2000 with her third number-one single \"[[Day & Night (song)|Day & Night]]\". She waited until September to release \"[[Something Deep Inside]]\", which reached number four, but her success waned. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, ''[[Walk of Life (album)|Walk of Life]]'', which reached #14 in the UK Album Chart, but quickly fell off the charts and was certified silver in the UK. The album only charted in two other countries: New Zealand, where it reached #17 only, and Australia, where it was a minor success and peaked at #23. In Piper's autobiography, she states that the album was a \"commercial bomb\". The song \"Walk of Life\", the final single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn February 2001, Piper appeared in court to testify against a woman named Juliet Peters. Peters was charged with, and eventually convicted of, stalking as well as making numerous threats against Piper and members of her family.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1321339/Billie-Piper-needs-head-cut-off-said-telephone-threats.html |title=Billie Piper 'needs head cut off', said telephone threats |date=6 February 2001 |last=Demetriou |first=Danielle |accessdate=28 June 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}</ref> Peters received psychiatric treatment as part of her sentence.
