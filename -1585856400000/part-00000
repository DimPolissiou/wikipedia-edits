It states that: \"[A man] shall not lie with another man as [he would] with a woman, it is a \u05ea\u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d4 ''toeba'' (\"abomination\")\" ([[Leviticus]] 18:22). (Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation is the [[death penalty]], although in practice [[rabbi]]nic Judaism no longer believes it has the authority to implement death penalties.)\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] views homosexual acts as sinful. In recent years, there has been approaches claiming only the sexual anal act is forbidden and considered abomination by the [[Torah]], while the sexual orientation and even other sexual activities are not considered a sin. [[Conservative Judaism]] has engaged in an in-depth study of homosexuality since the 1990s with various rabbis presenting a wide array of [[responsa]] (papers with legal arguments) for communal consideration. The official position of the movement is to welcome homosexual Jews into their [[synagogue]]s, and also campaign against any discrimination in [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] and public society, but also to uphold a ban on anal sex as a religious requirement.\n\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] in [[North America]] and [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|Liberal Judaism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] view homosexuality to be acceptable on the same basis as [[heterosexuality]]. Progressive Jewish authorities believe either that traditional laws against homosexuality are no longer binding or that they are subject to changes that reflect a new understanding of human sexuality. Some of these authorities rely on modern biblical scholarship suggesting that the prohibition in the Torah was intended to ban coercive or ritualized homosexual sex, such as those practices ascribed to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Canaan]]ite [[fertility cult]]s and [[sacred prostitution|temple prostitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/219_liberals_recognise_c.htm|title=Liberals recognise committed same-sex partnerships|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xOmU5q1x8HsC&lpg=PP1&dq=judaism%20homosexual&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Wrestling with God and Men: Homosexuality in the Jewish Tradition|last=Greenberg|first=Steven|date=23 February 2004|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299190934|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Christianity====\n{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality}}\n\n[[Christian denominations]] hold a variety of views on the issue of [[homosexual]] activity, ranging from outright condemnation to complete acceptance.

It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.' They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved. \n\n'''2358''' The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition. \n\n'''2359''' Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sixth commandment|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite the beliefs of the Catholic Church and homosexuality, there have been thousands of cases of priests who have sexually assaulted both boy and girl minors, mostly the young boys. These cases didn't start to get media awareness until the 1990s. The cases spread from former Popes, Priests, and Clergymen.

In Sikhism, the soul is seen as genderless, and the outward appearance of human beings (man, woman) is a temporary state. [[Same-sex marriage]] advocates refer to this fact.<ref name=\"Naad 33\"/>\n\n'''In Sikh Scripture'''\n\nThe Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, is the highest authority in the Sikhism, it is seen as the 11th and eternal Guru. It serves as a guide to Sikhs on how to live positive lives, and details what behavior is expected of all Sikhs. It is seemingly silent on the subject of homosexuality; however, married life is encouraged time and again in Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Whenever marriage is mentioned, it is always in reference to a man and a woman. Some Sikhs believe that Guru Granth Sahib Ji is the complete guide to life, and if a marriage between two of the same sexes is not mentioned, it is therefore not right. The counterargument to this is that man and woman are only mentioned in this way to give light to the relationship of the soul and the soul force as being one. This denies gender and sex as an issue. Thus, Sikhism is more concerned with ones attainment of enlightenment rather than habitual desires such as sexuality. True love is attained through the Guru and no man speaks on behalf of the Guru as the Granth is open to interpretation and misrepresentation.<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Homosexuality_and_Sikhism|title=Homosexuality and Sikhism - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|language=en|access-date=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are five vices (habitual desires) outlined in the Guru Granth Sahib that one should try to control. One of these vices is lust, and some Sikhs believe that homosexual thoughts and behaviour are just manifestations of lust. However, Sikhs that are more accepting of homosexuality claim that this is equally applicable to heterosexuals. These same Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak's emphasis on universal equality and brotherhood is fundamentally in support of the human rights of homosexuals.<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\"/>\n\nViews on homosexuality tend not to be a primary concern in Sikh teachings, as the universal goal of a Sikh is to have no hate or animosity to any person, regardless of race, caste, color, creed, gender, or sex<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\"/>\n\nThe Guru's silence on homosexuality has led to a history of ambivalence on the topic.<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\"/>\n\n===Zoroastrianism===\n{{Rquote|left| The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is a man that is a Daeva [demon]; this man is a worshipper of the Daevas, a male paramour of the Daevas|[[Vendidad]]}}\n\nThe [[Vendidad]], one of the later [[Zoroastrian]] texts composed in the Artificial Young [[Avestan language]], has not been dated precisely.

It states that: \"[A man] shall not lie with another man as [he would] with a woman, it is a \u05ea\u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d4 ''toeba'' (\"abomination\")\" ([[Leviticus]] 18:22). (Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation is the [[death penalty]], although in practice [[rabbi]]nic Judaism no longer believes it has the authority to implement death penalties.)\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] views homosexual acts as sinful. In recent years, there has been approaches claiming only the sexual anal act is forbidden and considered abomination by the [[Torah]], while the sexual orientation and even other sexual activities are not considered a sin. [[Conservative Judaism]] has engaged in an in-depth study of homosexuality since the 1990s with various rabbis presenting a wide array of [[responsa]] (papers with legal arguments) for communal consideration. The official position of the movement is to welcome homosexual Jews into their [[synagogue]]s, and also campaign against any discrimination in [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] and public society, but also to uphold a ban on anal sex as a religious requirement.\n\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] in [[North America]] and [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|Liberal Judaism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] view homosexuality to be acceptable on the same basis as [[heterosexuality]]. Progressive Jewish authorities believe either that traditional laws against homosexuality are no longer binding or that they are subject to changes that reflect a new understanding of human sexuality. Some of these authorities rely on modern biblical scholarship suggesting that the prohibition in the Torah was intended to ban coercive or ritualized homosexual sex, such as those practices ascribed to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Canaan]]ite [[fertility cult]]s and [[sacred prostitution|temple prostitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/219_liberals_recognise_c.htm|title=Liberals recognise committed same-sex partnerships|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xOmU5q1x8HsC&lpg=PP1&dq=judaism%20homosexual&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Wrestling with God and Men: Homosexuality in the Jewish Tradition|last=Greenberg|first=Steven|date=23 February 2004|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299190934|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Christianity====\n{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality}}\n\n[[Christian denominations]] hold a variety of views on the issue of [[homosexual]] activity, ranging from outright condemnation to complete acceptance.

It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.' They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved. \n\n'''2358''' The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition. \n\n'''2359''' Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sixth commandment|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite the beliefs of the Catholic Church and homosexuality, there have been thousands of cases of priests who have sexually assaulted both boy and girl minors, mostly the young boys. These cases didn't start to get media awareness until the 1990s. The cases spread from former Popes, Priests, and Clergymen.

In Sikhism, the soul is seen as genderless, and the outward appearance of human beings (man, woman) is a temporary state. [[Same-sex marriage]] advocates refer to this fact.<ref name=\"Naad 33\"/>\n\n'''In Sikh Scripture'''\n\nThe Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, is the highest authority in the Sikhism, it is seen as the 11th and eternal Guru. It serves as a guide to Sikhs on how to live positive lives, and details what behavior is expected of all Sikhs. It is seemingly silent on the subject of homosexuality; however, married life is encouraged time and again in Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Whenever marriage is mentioned, it is always in reference to a man and a woman. Some Sikhs believe that Guru Granth Sahib Ji is the complete guide to life, and if a marriage between two of the same sexes is not mentioned, it is therefore not right. The counterargument to this is that man and woman are only mentioned in this way to give light to the relationship of the soul and the soul force as being one. This denies gender and sex as an issue. Thus, Sikhism is more concerned with ones attainment of enlightenment rather than habitual desires such as sexuality. True love is attained through the Guru and no man speaks on behalf of the Guru as the Granth is open to interpretation and misrepresentation.<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Homosexuality_and_Sikhism|title=Homosexuality and Sikhism - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|language=en|access-date=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are five vices (habitual desires) outlined in the Guru Granth Sahib that one should try to control. One of these vices is lust, and some Sikhs believe that homosexual thoughts and behaviour are just manifestations of lust. However, Sikhs that are more accepting of homosexuality claim that this is equally applicable to heterosexuals. These same Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak's emphasis on universal equality and brotherhood is fundamentally in support of the human rights of homosexuals.<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\"/>\n\nViews on homosexuality tend not to be a primary concern in Sikh teachings, as the universal goal of a Sikh is to have no hate or animosity to any person, regardless of race, caste, color, creed, gender, or sex<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\"/>\n\nThe Guru's silence on homosexuality has led to a history of ambivalence on the topic.<ref name=\"sikhiwiki.org\"/>\n\n===Zoroastrianism===\n{{Rquote|left| The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is a man that is a Daeva [demon]; this man is a worshipper of the Daevas, a male paramour of the Daevas|[[Vendidad]]}}\n\nThe [[Vendidad]], one of the later [[Zoroastrian]] texts composed in the Artificial Young [[Avestan language]], has not been dated precisely.

He is best known for being the commander of dive bomber squadron of carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]'' during the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] and the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]. He survived the war and later served in [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]].\n\n==Early career==\nSadamu Takahashi enrolled in the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1930 and graduated from 61st class in November 1933. In April 1935, he was commission as [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] and in November he was selected for a navy pilot training program at [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS). After completion of the course, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in December 1936 and was then assigned as to [[\u014cmura, Nagasaki|\u014cmura]] NAS on [[Kyushu]], where he received an advanced training on dive bombing. In 1937, he was transferred to [[China]] and assigned to 12th Air Group, where he participated in several aerial operations during [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], including around [[Shanghai]] and [[Nanjing]]. In December, he was recalled to Japan to serve as an instructor at Kasumigaura NAS.\n\nIn November 1938, Takahashi was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] and was transferred to ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d|Ry\u016bj\u014d]]'' in December, where he was appointed flight division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) in the dive bomber squadron. In October 1939, he was reassigned to 14th Air Group and participated in several operations in [[Southern China]]. In November 1940, he became one of the flight division leaders of [[Tsukuba]] Air Group.\n\n==Pacific War==\nIn the beginning of 1942, he was assigned to the 31st Air Group as a dive bomber squadron leader. In February, his squadron operated from [[Nichols Field]] in the [[Philippines]] and participated in the attacks on the US troops on the [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan]] and [[Battle of Corregidor|Corregidor]]. In June, he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]'' and became its group commander ([[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]) as well as its dive bomber squadron leader.\n\nIn late August 1942, Lieutenant Takahashi participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. He led 27 [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers in the second strike wave against [[United States Navy]] (USN) fleet. His strike was escorted by nine [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters led by Lieutenant [[Ayao Shirane]]. They however could not locate the enemy carriers since his radio failed to receive the report on their updated position. Some of the D3A dive bombers in his group did receive the radio message, however they assumed that Takahashi received it too and knew where to go. Nevertheless, carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' was badly damaged by the first wave strike under the command of [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Mamoru Seki]]. He learned about the missed opportunity to finish off ''Enterprise'' only after he landed back on ''Zuikaku'' that evening.\n\nIn late October 1942, Lieutenant Takahashi participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], where he led 21 Aichi D3A dive bombers in the first strike wave against USN carrier, which was under the overall command of Lieutenant Commander [[Shigeharu Murata]]. Escort was provided by A6M Zero fighters that were led by Lieutenant Saneyasu Hidaka from [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuih\u014d'']] and Lieutenant Ayao Shirane from ''Zuikaku''. During the attack, his D3A was intercepted by enemy Combat Air Patrol of [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters. He was able to shake them off but his aircraft was seriously damaged and therefore he could not perform a dive bombing attack on the carrier. Still, he managed to return to the IJN fleet and later landed on the water near a friendly oiler. Nevertheless, the strikes crippled carrier ''[[USS Hornet (CV-8)|Hornet]]'' and badly damaged ''Enterprise'', however many experienced pilot leaders perished in the attack; including Lieutenant Commanders Shigeharu Murata and Mamoru Seki.\n\nAfterwards, Lieutenant Takahashi and his dive bomber squadron were transferred to [[Rabaul]] and participated in [[Operation I-Go]]. He survived the war and later served in [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] from 1954 to 1970.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = \u6c5f\u9593 | first = \u4fdd\n | year = 1991\n | title = \u6025\u964d\u4e0b\u7206\u6483\u968a\u2015\u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u8ecd\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30c0\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc (in Japanese)\n | publisher = \u4eca\u65e5\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u793e\n | isbn = 4875651384\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Takahashi, Sadamu}}\n[[Category:1909 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:2015 deaths]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2019}}\n{{One source|date=October 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= Sadamu Takahashi\n|birth_date={{Birth date|df=y|1912|12|}}\n|death_date={{death date|df=y|2015|12|25}}\n|birth_place=[[Matsuyama]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place=\n|image=Sadamu_Takahashi_b.jpg\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Commander]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12th Air Group<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d|Ry\u016bj\u014d]]''<br/>14th Air Group<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Philippines campaign (1941\u20131942)|Invasion of Philippines]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]<br/>[[Operation I-Go]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{nihongo|'''Sadamu Takahashi'''|\u9ad8\u6a4b \u5b9a|Takahashi Sadamu|}} was a [[dive bomber]] pilot [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]]. He is best known for being the commander of dive bomber squadron of carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]'' during the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] and the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]. He survived the war and later served in [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]].\n\n==Early career==\nSadamu Takahashi enrolled in the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1930 and graduated from 61st class in November 1933. In April 1935, he was commission as [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] and in November he was selected for a navy pilot training program at [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS). After completion of the course, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in December 1936 and was then assigned as to [[\u014cmura, Nagasaki|\u014cmura]] NAS on [[Kyushu]], where he received an advanced training on dive bombing. In 1937, he was transferred to [[China]] and assigned to 12th Air Group, where he participated in several aerial operations during [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], including around [[Shanghai]] and [[Nanjing]]. In December, he was recalled to Japan to serve as an instructor at Kasumigaura NAS.\n\nIn November 1938, Takahashi was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] and was transferred to ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d|Ry\u016bj\u014d]]'' in December, where he was appointed flight division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) in the dive bomber squadron. In October 1939, he was reassigned to 14th Air Group and participated in several operations in [[Southern China]]. In November 1940, he became one of the flight division leaders of [[Tsukuba]] Air Group.\n\n==Pacific War==\nIn the beginning of 1942, he was assigned to the 31st Air Group as a dive bomber squadron leader. In February, his squadron operated from [[Nichols Field]] in the [[Philippines]] and participated in the attacks on the US troops on the [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan]] and [[Battle of Corregidor|Corregidor]]. In June, he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]'' and became its group commander ([[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]) as well as its dive bomber squadron leader.\n\nIn late August 1942, Lieutenant Takahashi participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. He led 27 [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers in the second strike wave against [[United States Navy]] (USN) fleet. His strike was escorted by nine [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters led by Lieutenant [[Ayao Shirane]]. They however could not locate the enemy carriers since his radio failed to receive the report on their updated position. Some of the D3A dive bombers in his group did receive the radio message, however they assumed that Takahashi received it too and knew where to go.
