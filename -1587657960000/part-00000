Tigers also attack humans in a case of \"mistaken identity\" (for example, if a human is crouching while collecting firewood, or cutting grass) and sometimes when a tourist gets too close. Some also recommend not riding a bicycle, or running in a region where tigers live, in order to not provoke their chase. Peter Byrne {{who|date=September 2019}} wrote about an Indian postman who was working on foot for many years without any problems with resident tigers, but was chased by a tiger soon after he started riding a bicycle for his work.<ref>Byrne, Peter. (2002) Shikari Sahib. Pilgrims Publishing. Pg. 291&ndash;292</ref> While on average there are approximately 85 or fewer people killed and injured by tigers each year, India has seen sharper increases in tiger attacks, as was the case in 2014 and 2015 due to urban expansion into the tiger\u2019s natural habitat and the outlawing of tiger killing.<ref>Https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/01/over-1000-people-killed-india-humans-wildlife-territories-meet</ref> Many human killings and injuries are due to incidents at zoos, or to the man-eating tigers in India.\n\nIn some cases, tigers will change their natural diet to become man-eaters. This is usually due to a tiger being incapacitated by a gunshot wound or [[porcupine]] quills, or some other factors, such as health issues and disabilities. In such cases, the animal's inability to take traditional prey forces it to stalk humans, which are less appetizing but much easier to chase, overpower and kill; this was the case with the [[Champawat tigress|man-eating tigress of Champawat]], which was believed to have begun eating villagers at least partially in response to crippling tooth injuries.<ref name=me /> As tigers in Asia often live in close proximity to humans, tigers have killed more people than any other big cat. Between 1876 and 1912, tigers killed 33,247 people in [[British India]].<ref>Compiled from official British records available at the [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/statistics/ Digital South Asia Library] (University of Chicago and the Center for Research Libraries).<br />'''1.''' \"[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/digbooks/digpager.html?BOOKID=Statistics_1867&object=133 Number of persons and cattle killed in British India by wild beasts and snakes]\", ''Statistical abstract relating to British India from 1867\u201368 to 1876\u201377'', (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office): p. 132, 1878, retrieved 30 March 2013.<br />\n'''2.''' \"[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/digbooks/digpager.html?BOOKID=Statistics_1876&object=241 Number of persons and cattle killed in British India by wild beasts and snakes]\", ''Statistical abstract relating to British India from 1876\u201377 to 1885\u201386'', (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office): p. 240, 1887, retrieved 30 March 2013.<br />\n'''3.''' \"[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/digbooks/digpager.html?BOOKID=Statistics_1885&object=274 Number of persons and cattle killed in British India by wild beasts and snakes]\", ''Statistical abstract relating to British India from 1885\u201386 to 1894\u201395'', (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office): p. 268, 1896, retrieved 30 March 2013.<br />\n'''4.''' \"[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/digbooks/digpager.html?BOOKID=statistical_1894&object=248 Number of persons and cattle killed in British India by wild animals and snakes]\", ''Statistical abstract relating to British India from 1894\u201395 to 1903\u201304'', (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office): p. 238, 1905, retrieved 30 March 2013.<br />\n'''5.''' \"[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/digbooks/digpager.html?BOOKID=statistical_1903&object=250 Number of persons and cattle killed in British India by wild animals and snakes]\", ''Statistical abstract relating to British India from 1903\u201304 to 1912\u201313'', (London: His Majesty's Stationery Office): p. 240, 1915, retrieved 30 March 2013.</ref>\n\nMan-eaters have been a recurrent problem in India, especially in [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Division|Garhwal]] and the [[Sundarbans]] mangrove swamps of [[Bengal]]. There, some healthy tigers have been known to hunt humans. Even though tigers usually avoid [[elephants]], they have been known to jump on an elephant's back and severely injure the [[mahout]] riding on the elephant's back. Kesri Singh mentioned a case when a fatally wounded tiger attacked and killed the hunter who wounded it while the hunter was on the back of an elephant. Most man-eating tigers are eventually captured, shot or poisoned.<ref>Singh, Kesri. (1959) The tiger of Rajasthan. Hale</ref>\n\nDuring war, tigers may acquire a taste for human flesh from the consumption of corpses which have lain unburied, and go on to attack soldiers; this happened during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[World War II|Second World]] Wars.<ref name=me/> Tigers will stalk groups of people bending down while working in a field or cutting grass, but will lose interest as soon as the people stand upright.  Consequently, it has been hypothesized that some attacks are a simple case of mistaken identity.<ref name=me/>\n\nTigers typically surprise victims from the side or from behind: either approaching upwind or lying in wait downwind. Tigers rarely press an attack if they are seen before their ambush is mounted.<ref name=\"Perry\">{{cite book | author = Perry, Richard | title = The World of the Tiger | year = 1965 | page = 260 | id = ASIN: B0007DU2IU|nopp=yes}}</ref>\n\n[[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]] once commented on man-eating tigers;\n\n{{quote|\"It is extraordinary how very cautious every man-eater becomes by practice, whether a tiger or panther and cowardly too. Invariably, it will only attack a solitary person, and that too, after prolonged and painstaking stalking, having assured itself that no other human being is in the immediate vicinity... These animals seem also to possess an astute sixth sense and be able to differentiate between an unarmed human being and an armed man deliberately pursuing them, for in most cases, only when cornered will they venture to attack the latter, while they go out of their way to stalk and attack the unarmed man.<ref name=\"KA\">[[Tiger of Segur|The Man-Eater of Segur]]\", from ''Nine Man-Eaters and One Rogue'', Kenneth Anderson, Allen & Unwin, 1954</ref>\n}}\n\nTigers are sometimes intimidated from attacking humans, especially if they are unfamiliar with people. Tigers, even established man-eating tigers will seldom enter human settlements, usually sticking to village outskirts.<ref name=me>{{cite web|url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/maneating3.html |title=Man-eaters. The tiger and lion, attacks on humans |publisher=Lairweb.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2018-07-24}}</ref> Nevertheless, attacks in human villages do occur.<ref name=me/>\n\nMost tigers will only attack a human if they cannot physically satisfy their needs otherwise. Tigers are typically wary of humans and usually show no preference for human meat. Although humans are relatively easy prey, they are not a desired source of food. Thus, most man-eating tigers are old, infirm, or have missing teeth, and choose human victims out of desperation. In one case, a post-mortem examination of a killed tigress revealed two broken [[canine teeth]], four missing [[incisors]] and a loose [[upper molars|upper molar]], handicaps which would make capturing stronger prey extremely difficult. Only upon reaching this stage did she attack a workman.<ref name=me/>\n\nIn some cases, rather than being predatory, tiger attacks on humans seem to be territorial in nature. In at least one case, a tigress with cubs killed eight people entering her territory without consuming them at all.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ethirajan, A. |year=2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16925673 |title=Rogue tigress 'terrorises Bangladesh villagers' |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Tiger attacks in the Sundarbans==\n{{Main|Tiger attacks in the Sundarbans}}\nThe Bengal tigers of the [[Sundarbans]] (translation: 'beautiful forest'), bordering India and Bangladesh, used to regularly kill fifty or sixty people a year.

She was finally tracked down and killed in 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betabunny.com/predators/predators_beasts.htm |title=Predators: Beasts |publisher=Betabunny.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-24}}</ref>  She was known to enter villages, even during daylight, roaring and causing people to flee in panic to their huts.<ref name=lion>{{Cite web |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Interspecies-Conflict-3754/Lion-vs-Tiger-16.htm |title=Interspecies Conflict: Lion vs Tiger |access-date=22 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503113535/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Interspecies-Conflict-3754/Lion-vs-Tiger-16.htm |archive-date=3 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Champawat Tiger was found and killed by [[Jim Corbett]] after he followed the trail of blood the tigress left behind after killing her last victim, a 16-year-old girl.<ref name=lion/> Later examination of the tigress showed the upper and lower canine teeth on the right side of her mouth were broken, the upper one in half, the lower one right down to the bone. This permanent injury, Corbett claimed, \"had prevented her from killing her natural prey, and had been the cause of her becoming a man-eater.\"<ref name=me/>\n\n===The Tiger of Segur===\n[[File:Man-eater of Segur.jpg|thumb|Body of the Tiger of Segur, killed by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]] on the banks of the Segur River]]\nThe [[Tiger of Segur]] was a young [[man-eater|man-eating]] male [[Bengal tiger]] who killed five people in the [[Nilgiri Hills]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] state in [[South India]]. Though originating in the District of [[Malabar District]] and [[Wayanad District]] below the south-western face of the [[Nilgiris (mountains)|Blue Mountains]], the tiger later shifted its hunting grounds to [[Gudalur (Nilgiris district)|Gudalur]] and between the [[Sigur Plateau]] and [[S\u00e1lim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History|Anaikatty]] in [[Coimbatore district]]. It was killed by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]] on the banks of the Segur River, [[circa]] 1954. Anderson later wrote that the tiger had a disability preventing it from hunting its natural prey.<ref name=\"KA\"/>\n\n===Tigers of Chowgarh===\nThe [[Tigers of Chowgarh]] were a pair of man-eating Bengal tigers, consisting of an old tigress and her sub-adult cub, which for over a five-year period killed a reported 64 people in eastern [[Kumaon Division]] of [[Uttarakhand]] in [[Northern India]] over an area spanning {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2}}. The figures however are uncertain, as the natives of the areas the tigers frequented claimed double that number, and they do not take into account victims who survived direct attacks but died subsequently. Both tigers were killed by Jim Corbett.\n\n===Thak man-eater===\nThe [[Thak man-eater]] was a tigress from Eastern [[Kumaon division]], who killed only four human victims, but was the last hunt of the hunter, conservationist and author [[Jim Corbett]]. Corbett called her up and killed her during late twilight, after he lost all other means to track her down. Postmortem revealed that this tigress had two old gunshot wounds, one of which had become septic. This, according to Corbett, forced her to turn from a normal predator hunting natural prey to a man-eater.\n\n==.\n\n===Man-eater of Bhimashankar===\n\nA story was discovered by [[Pune]]-based author Sureshchandra Warghade when he ran into an old villager in the [[Bhimashankar]] forest which lies near Pune. The villager explained to the author how a man-eating tiger terrorized the entire Bhimashakar area during a span of two years in the 1940s. He was a police constable in that area and he had been responsible for dealing with the formalities surrounding the deaths (missing person reports and death certificates) and other jobs such as helping the hunting parties. During this time the tiger supposedly killed more than 100 people, but it was apparently very careful to avoid discovery; only 2 bodies were ever found. Several hunting parties were organized, but the only one to succeed was an [[Ambegaon]]-based hunter named Ismail. During his first attempt, Ismail had a direct confrontation with the tiger and was almost killed. He later called [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]]. They returned and eliminated the man-eater. The tiger predominately killed the villagers who slept outside the huts.\n\nThe authenticity of the story told by the villager was confirmed when Warghade examined official reports, including a certificate given by the British authorities for killing the man-eating tiger.<ref>Bhimanshankarcha Narbhakshak (Maneater of Bhimashankar) - A [[Marathi language|Marathi]] book by Author Sureshchandra Warghade</ref>\n\n===Tara of the Dudhwa National Park===\nWhile the Sundarbans are particularly well known for tiger attacks, [[Dudhwa National Park]] also had several man-eaters in the late 1970s. The first death was on 2 March 1978, closely followed by 3 further kills.\n\nThe population demanded action from authorities. The locals wanted the man-eater shot or poisoned. The killings continued, each one making headlines.  Officials soon started to believe that the likely culprit was a tigress called Tara. Conservationist [[Billy Arjan Singh]] had taken the British-born cat from Twycross Zoo and raised her in India, with the goal of releasing her back into the wild. His experiments had also been carried out on leopards with some success.\n\nExperts felt that Tara would not have the required skills and correct hunting techniques to survive in the wild and controversy surrounded the project. She also associated men with providing food and comfort, which increased the likelihood that she would approach villages.\n\nOfficials later became convinced that Tara had taken to easier prey and become a man-eater. A total of 24 people were killed before the tigress was shot. Singh also joined the hunt with the intent of identifying the man-eater, but firm confirmation of the identity of the tiger was never found.\n\nThe debate over the tiger's identity has continued in the years since the attacks. Singh's supporters continue to claim that the tiger was not Tara, and the conservationist has produced evidence to that effect. However, officials maintain that the tiger was definitely Tara.<ref name=me/>\n\nOther man-eaters from [[Dudhwa National Park]] have existed,<ref name=me/> but this tiger was potentially the first captive-bred tiger to be trained and released into the wild. This controversy cast doubt on the success of Singh's rewilding project.\n\nProblems at Dudhwa have been minor in the past few years. Occasional tiger attacks still occur, but these are no higher than at other wildlife reserves. On average, two villagers are attacked at Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve each year. These attacks generally occur during the monsoon season when the locals enter the reserve to collect grass.<ref name=me/>\n\n===Tigress of Moradabad===\nIn February 2014, reports emerged that a tigress had killed 7 people near the [[Jim Corbett National Park]]. The tigress was later called the man-eater of Moradabad, because it was hunting in the [[Bijnor]] and [[Moradabad]] region.

For example, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn on the back of the head by the villagers in 1986 in the Sundarbans, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. This had temporarily decreased the number of attacks, but only for a short while before the tigers figured out it was not the front of the human being so the villagers no longer wore them for protection. All other means to prevent tiger attacks, such as providing the tigers with more prey by releasing captive bred pigs to the reserve's buffer zones, or placing electrified human dummies to teach tigers to associate attacking people with electric shock, did not work as well and tiger attacks continue. Many measures were thus discontinued due to lack of success.<ref>{{cite book|author=Montgomery, Sy|year=2009|title=Spell of the Tiger: The Man-Eaters of Sundarbans|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spelloftigermane00mont/page/37 37\u201338]|isbn=0395641691|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spelloftigermane00mont/page/37}}</ref>\n\n==In captivity==\n{{prose|section|date=February 2019}}\n{{see also|San Francisco Zoo tiger attacks}}\nTiger attacks have also happened in zoos and as exotic pets.

Tigers also attack humans in a case of \"mistaken identity\" (for example, if a human is crouching while collecting firewood, or cutting grass) and sometimes when a tourist gets too close. Some also recommend not riding a bicycle, or running in a region where tigers live, in order to not provoke their chase. Peter Byrne {{who|date=September 2019}} wrote about an Indian postman who was working on foot for many years without any problems with resident tigers, but was chased by a tiger soon after he started riding a bicycle for his work.<ref>Byrne, Peter. (2002) Shikari Sahib. Pilgrims Publishing. Pg. 291&ndash;292</ref> While on average there are approximately 85 or fewer people killed and injured by tigers each year, India has seen sharper increases in tiger attacks, as was the case in 2014 and 2015 due to urban expansion into the tiger\u2019s natural habitat and the outlawing of tiger killing.<ref>Https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/01/over-1000-people-killed-india-humans-wildlife-territories-meet</ref> Many human killings and injuries are due to incidents at zoos, or to the man-eating tigers in India.\n\nIn some cases, tigers will change their natural diet to become man-eaters. This is usually due to a tiger being incapacitated by a gunshot wound or [[porcupine]] quills, or some other factors, such as health issues and disabilities. In such cases, the animal's inability to take traditional prey forces it to stalk humans, which are less appetizing but much easier to chase, overpower and kill; this was the case with the [[Champawat tigress|man-eating tigress of Champawat]], which was believed to have begun eating villagers at least partially in response to crippling tooth injuries.<ref name=me /> As tigers in Asia often live in close proximity to humans, tigers have killed more people than any other big cat.

She was finally tracked down and killed in 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betabunny.com/predators/predators_beasts.htm |title=Predators: Beasts |publisher=Betabunny.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-24}}</ref>  She was known to enter villages, even during daylight, roaring and causing people to flee in panic to their huts.<ref name=lion>{{Cite web |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Interspecies-Conflict-3754/Lion-vs-Tiger-16.htm |title=Interspecies Conflict: Lion vs Tiger |access-date=22 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503113535/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Interspecies-Conflict-3754/Lion-vs-Tiger-16.htm |archive-date=3 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Champawat Tiger was found and killed by [[Jim Corbett]] after he followed the trail of blood the tigress left behind after killing her last victim, a 16-year-old girl.<ref name=lion/> Later examination of the tigress showed the upper and lower canine teeth on the right side of her mouth were broken, the upper one in half, the lower one right down to the bone. This permanent injury, Corbett claimed, \"had prevented her from killing her natural prey, and had been the cause of her becoming a man-eater.\"<ref name=me/>\n\n===The Tiger of Segur===\n[[File:Man-eater of Segur.jpg|thumb|Body of the Tiger of Segur, killed by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]] on the banks of the Segur River]]\nThe [[Tiger of Segur]] was a young [[man-eater|man-eating]] male [[Bengal tiger]] who killed five people in the [[Nilgiri Hills]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] state in [[South India]]. Though originating in the District of [[Malabar District]] and [[Wayanad District]] below the south-western face of the [[Nilgiris (mountains)|Blue Mountains]], the tiger later shifted its hunting grounds to [[Gudalur (Nilgiris district)|Gudalur]] and between the [[Sigur Plateau]] and [[S\u00e1lim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History|Anaikatty]] in [[Coimbatore district]]. It was killed by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]] on the banks of the Segur River, [[circa]] 1954. Anderson later wrote that the tiger had a disability preventing it from hunting its natural prey.<ref name=\"KA\"/>\n\n===Tigers of Chowgarh===\nThe [[Tigers of Chowgarh]] were a pair of man-eating Bengal tigers, consisting of an old tigress and her sub-adult cub, which for over a five-year period killed a reported 64 people in eastern [[Kumaon Division]] of [[Uttarakhand]] in [[Northern India]] over an area spanning {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2}}. The figures however are uncertain, as the natives of the areas the tigers frequented claimed double that number, and they do not take into account victims who survived direct attacks but died subsequently. Both tigers were killed by Jim Corbett.\n\n===Thak man-eater===\nThe [[Thak man-eater]] was a tigress from Eastern [[Kumaon division]], who killed only four human victims, but was the last hunt of the hunter, conservationist and author [[Jim Corbett]]. Corbett called her up and killed her during late twilight, after he lost all other means to track her down. Postmortem revealed that this tigress had two old gunshot wounds, one of which had become septic. This, according to Corbett, forced her to turn from a normal predator hunting natural prey to a man-eater.\n\n===Tiger of Mundachipallam===\nThe [[Tiger of Mundachipallam]] was a male Bengal tiger, which in the 1950s killed seven people in the vicinity of the village of Pennagram, four miles (6&nbsp;km) from the [[Hogenakkal Falls]] in [[Dharmapuri district]]  of Tamil Nadu. Unlike the Champawat man-eater, the Mundachipallam tiger had no known infirmities preventing it from hunting its natural prey. Its first three victims were killed in unprovoked attacks, while the subsequent victims were devoured. The Mundachipallam tiger was later killed by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]].\n\n===Man-eater of Bhimashankar===\n\nA story was discovered by [[Pune]]-based author Sureshchandra Warghade when he ran into an old villager in the [[Bhimashankar]] forest which lies near Pune. The villager explained to the author how a man-eating tiger terrorized the entire Bhimashakar area during a span of two years in the 1940s. He was a police constable in that area and he had been responsible for dealing with the formalities surrounding the deaths (missing person reports and death certificates) and other jobs such as helping the hunting parties. During this time the tiger supposedly killed more than 100 people, but it was apparently very careful to avoid discovery; only 2 bodies were ever found. Several hunting parties were organized, but the only one to succeed was an [[Ambegaon]]-based hunter named Ismail. During his first attempt, Ismail had a direct confrontation with the tiger and was almost killed. He later called [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]]. They returned and eliminated the man-eater. The tiger predominately killed the villagers who slept outside the huts.\n\nThe authenticity of the story told by the villager was confirmed when Warghade examined official reports, including a certificate given by the British authorities for killing the man-eating tiger.<ref>Bhimanshankarcha Narbhakshak (Maneater of Bhimashankar) - A [[Marathi language|Marathi]] book by Author Sureshchandra Warghade</ref>\n\n===Tara of the Dudhwa National Park===\nWhile the Sundarbans are particularly well known for tiger attacks, [[Dudhwa National Park]] also had several man-eaters in the late 1970s. The first death was on 2 March 1978, closely followed by 3 further kills.\n\nThe population demanded action from authorities. The locals wanted the man-eater shot or poisoned. The killings continued, each one making headlines.  Officials soon started to believe that the likely culprit was a tigress called Tara. Conservationist [[Billy Arjan Singh]] had taken the British-born cat from Twycross Zoo and raised her in India, with the goal of releasing her back into the wild. His experiments had also been carried out on leopards with some success.\n\nExperts felt that Tara would not have the required skills and correct hunting techniques to survive in the wild and controversy surrounded the project. She also associated men with providing food and comfort, which increased the likelihood that she would approach villages.\n\nOfficials later became convinced that Tara had taken to easier prey and become a man-eater. A total of 24 people were killed before the tigress was shot. Singh also joined the hunt with the intent of identifying the man-eater, but firm confirmation of the identity of the tiger was never found.\n\nThe debate over the tiger's identity has continued in the years since the attacks. Singh's supporters continue to claim that the tiger was not Tara, and the conservationist has produced evidence to that effect. However, officials maintain that the tiger was definitely Tara.<ref name=me/>\n\nOther man-eaters from [[Dudhwa National Park]] have existed,<ref name=me/> but this tiger was potentially the first captive-bred tiger to be trained and released into the wild. This controversy cast doubt on the success of Singh's rewilding project.\n\nProblems at Dudhwa have been minor in the past few years. Occasional tiger attacks still occur, but these are no higher than at other wildlife reserves. On average, two villagers are attacked at Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve each year. These attacks generally occur during the monsoon season when the locals enter the reserve to collect grass.<ref name=me/>\n\n===Tigress of Moradabad===\nIn February 2014, reports emerged that a tigress had killed 7 people near the [[Jim Corbett National Park]]. The tigress was later called the man-eater of Moradabad, because it was hunting in the [[Bijnor]] and [[Moradabad]] region. The tigress could not be traced by about 50 [[camera trap]]s and an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]].<ref name=SpyDrone>{{cite news|title=Spy drones couldn't catch Bijnor's maneater tigress|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bijnor-tigress-bijnor-maneater-man-eating-tigress-uttar-pradesh-governments-uttarakhand-governments-uav/1/346836.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=Deadliest.>{{cite news|title=Hunting for India's deadliest man-eating tiger|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-26334587|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=26 February 2014}}</ref> In August 2014, it was reported that tigress had stopped killing humans.

For example, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn on the back of the head by the villagers in 1986 in the Sundarbans, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. This had temporarily decreased the number of attacks, but only for a short while before the tigers figured out it was not the front of the human being so the villagers no longer wore them for protection. All other means to prevent tiger attacks, such as providing the tigers with more prey by releasing captive bred pigs to the reserve's buffer zones, or placing electrified human dummies to teach tigers to associate attacking people with electric shock, did not work as well and tiger attacks continue. Many measures were thus discontinued due to lack of success.<ref>{{cite book|author=Montgomery, Sy|year=2009|title=Spell of the Tiger: The Man-Eaters of Sundarbans|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spelloftigermane00mont/page/37 37\u201338]|isbn=0395641691|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spelloftigermane00mont/page/37}}</ref>\n\n==In captivity==\n{{prose|section|date=February 2019}}\n{{see also|San Francisco Zoo tiger attacks}}\nTiger attacks have also happened in zoos and as exotic pets.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.

This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D.

Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1986) [1981].

Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House.</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226181509}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tebble|first1=Adam|last2=Meadowcroft|first2=John|title=F.A.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]].

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger. ISBN 9780582500150.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''. Washington: Pergamon-Brassey's.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (September 1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. ISBN 9780812004038.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.

This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. ISBN 9780140806229.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

ISBN 9780415919678.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited.

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

While still based on the basic design dating from for the 1980 model year, the 1992 F-Series brought a number of minor changes to the exterior and interior (where most enthusiasts consider this a facelift for the [[Ford F-Series seventh generation|same existing truck that first appeared in 1979 as a 1980 model]] instead of a redesign). This is the last generation of the F-Series that was produced as a complete range of trucks from a half-ton pickup to a medium-duty [[Truck classification#Class 6|Class 6]] truck. As this generation was replaced during the 1997\u20131998 model years, the larger models of the F-Series (F-250 and above) were split from the F-150; these became the [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks, related to the latter with a few powertrain components.\n\n==Design history==\n[[File:1994 Ford F-150 Flareside.JPG|thumb|left|alt=1994 F-150 Flareside with an extended cab|1994 F150 FlareSide SuperCab]]\nIn the interest of aerodynamics, the lines of the hood, front fenders, and grille were rounded off for 1992. Along with the larger grille, the headlights were enlarged (with the turn signals again moving below). Inside, the interior was updated with a redesigned dashboard along with new seats. Extended-cab (SuperCab) models received larger rear side windows. A notable change included the reintroduction of the Flareside bed that returned for production since 1987. Instead of the previous classic-style bed, the Flareside bed was now a narrow-body version of the dual rear-wheel bed; the rear fenders were repositioned to fit the width of the cab.\n\nThe 1994 models brought a slightly updated dashboard and the addition of a standard driver's-side [[airbag]] on F-150s and light-duty F-250s only, [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp .28CHMSL.29|center high mount stop lamp]] (CHMSL), brake-shift interlock, and CFC-free air conditioning. New options for 1994 included [[remote keyless entry]] with alarm, a [[car audio|compact disc player]] fitted into the regular stereo system, and a [[power seat|power driver's seat]]; an [[Rear-view mirror#Automatic dimming|electrochromic inside rear view mirror]] was also offered for 1994 and 1995 as part of a luxury light package.\n\nFord trailed their rival [[General Motors]] in combined truck sales for much of the ninth generation, though sales steadily rose each year. 500,000 F-Series trucks were sold in 1992, but this rose to nearly 800,000 by 1996. Meaning that Ford had overtaken the combined Truck sales of [[Chevrolet]] and [[GMC Truck|GMC]] for the first time in a decade.\nIn the second half of 1997 The F-250 HD (Heavy Duty) was in the same series as the F-350.\n\n==Trim==\n*Custom (1992\u20131993) Included: Cargo box light, tinted glass, argent grille, steel wheels with hubcaps, color-keyed floormats, an AM radio with digital clock and two speakers, vinyl bench seat, and voltmeter, oil pressure and temperature gauges. \n*XL (1992-1997): Added: Black rub strip, chrome grille, deep-dish aluminum wheels, carpeted map pockets, an AM/FM stereo with digital clock and two speakers, and a cloth and vinyl bench seat. \n*XLT (1992-1997): Added: argent steel wheels, air conditioning, a cloth bench seat, and a rear bench on the SuperCab only. \n*Nite (1990-1992): Added: cloth flight bench with power lumbar, sliding rear window, aluminum deep dish wheels.\n*SVT Lightning (1993\u20131995) Added (from XLT trim): 5-spoke aluminum rims, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player, digital clock and four speakers, power windows and locks, and air conditioning.\n*Eddie Bauer (1995\u20131996, F-150, only)\n*4x4 Offroad (1992-1997)\n\nThe monochromatic \"Nite\" package introduced in 1990 continued, but was dropped at the end of the 1992 model year.  As before, it featured an all-black exterior with either a pink or blue/purple stripe and \"Nite\" decal on the sides of the cargo box.\n\nFor 1993 the Custom model was dropped, as the XL became the new base model. Following the lead of the [[Ford Aerostar|Aerostar]], [[Ford Bronco]], and [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], the ''Eddie Bauer'' trim line \u2014 featuring plusher trim and increased standard features \u2014 was reintroduced for 1995. Also in 1993, the ''SVT Lightning'' was introduced, slotting itself in between the Chevrolet 454SS and GMC Syclone. [[Ford SVT|Ford Special Vehicles Team]] upgraded the Lightning from the regular F-series with heavy-duty suspension and brakes.  Powertrain upgrades came from heavy-duty trucks, with a 240&nbsp;hp version of the 5.8L V8 and the E4OD overdrive transmission normally paired with the 7.3L diesel and 460 7.5L V8s.\n\nThe 4wd F150 continued the use of the [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44 Twin-Traction Beam axle from the 80\u201391 trucks, and the Ford 8.8\" Rear Straight axle. The 4wd F250 carried the Dana 50 Twin Traction Beam axle, the Sterling 10.25 from the previous generation for the rear; full float on heavy duty 3/4 ton trucks and the 4wd F350 used the [[Dana 60]] Straight Axle front, and the Sterling 10.25\" rear Straight axle.\n\n==Models==\nNinth-generation Ford F-Series models are:\n* '''F-150''': 1/2 ton (6,250&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-250''' : 1992\u20131996 3/4 ton (8,800&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-250 HD''': 1996\u20131997 Heavy Duty 3/4 ton (8,800 [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-350''' : 1 ton  (10,000&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-Super Duty''' (chassis cab model only): 1 1/2 ton and greater (16,000&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n\nThe F-150, F-250, F-250 HD, F-350, and F-Super Duty were available in many different configurations from chassis cab base models, up to XLT trimmed models with their chrome and plush seating. The trucks came with a variety of gas and diesel engines. The F-150 could be had with one of 3 gas engines, the 4.9L (300 cid) I6, the 5.0L (302 cid) V8, and the 5.8L (351 cid) V8. The same gas engine options were also available for the heavy duty trucks along with the 7.5L (460 cid), or you could opt for the 7.3L (444 cid) diesel. \n\nThe first version was the 7.3L IDI (Indirect Injected) V8 (1992 - 1993.5), which was produced by [[Navistar International]]. In 1993.5-1994.5 a turbocharged 7.3L IDI V8 with stronger internals was offered as emissions, power, and torque demands were increasing. In the second half of 1994, the new Direct Injected 7.3L Power Stroke V8 Turbodiesel replaced the 7.3L IDI V8. Also built by International Harvester, and used in [[International Trucks]], known as the T444 E Engine. \n\nThe F-250 HD was available from 1996 to 1997, and differed from the earlier F-250 in the trim that was on it, and it also had a transmission cooler like the later [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks, it also received a heavier rear axle, and heavier springs and shocks. Because of these changes in design, service technicians started to refer to the first PowerStrokes as an OBS or Old Body Style to avoid confusion from the similar Super Duty 7.3 Power Stroke parts. As part of the 4x4 off-road package, they were available with several skid plates underneath. After 1997, the heavier-duty models were split from the Ford F-150. These line of trucks were called the 1999 [[Ford Super Duty]]. The F-150 could be had with either short (6.5') or long (8') beds with either regular or extended cab. The F-250 and F-350 trucks were only available with long beds (8&nbsp;ft.) except in 1996 and 1997, the F-250 HD could be had in an extended cab/short bed or crew cab/short bed model. The crew cab short bed and extended cab short bed trucks are very rare, as they were only produced for a little over a year. \nThe F-Series production rolled off the assembly line in December 1997 and the Ford Super Duty was introduced as a replacement.\n\n==Medium-Duty F-Series==\n{{See also|Ford F-series (medium duty truck)}}\n[[File:Ford F heavy duty.JPG|thumb|left|1994\u20131998 F600/F700 cargo truck]]\n\nFor the 1994.5 model year, the exterior of the medium-duty F-Series was changed for the first time since 1979. Available only as a tilting cowl, the new hood featured a much larger grille. Instead of being mounted on the fenders, the turn signals were now mounted beside the headlights. Instead of the model designation, the cowl badge was replaced by an \"F-Series\" one. Inside, the interior was largely carried over from 1980.\n\nWhile still available with a [[Ford 385 engine|7.0L gasoline V8]], many medium-duty F-Series were diesel-powered. Instead of the Navistar T444E V8 engine seen in the F-250/F-350, the medium-duty models offered two inline-6 engines (the [[Caterpillar 3126]] and the Cummins 6BT/ISB). In 1999, these trucks were discontinued, along with the [[Ford B-Series|B-Series]] bus chassis; while the bus chassis was not replaced, Ford re-entered the medium-duty truck market with the [[Ford F-650|Ford F-650/750]]. Built in a joint venture with Navistar, they were integrated into the Super Duty lineup.\n{{-}}\n\n==Variants==\n\n===SVT Lightning===\nThe '''SVT Lightning''' is a [[sport car|sports]]/performance version of the F-150, released by Ford's [[Ford SVT|SVT]] (Special Vehicle Team) division.\n[[File:1993FordLightning.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Ford SVT Lightning]]\n\nFord introduced the Lightning in 1992 to compete with primarily the [[Chevrolet C/K#454 SS|Chevrolet 454 SS]], in an effort to enhance the sporty, personal-use image of the Ford F-Series pickup.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This initial Lightning featured performance handling developed by world-champion driver [[Jackie Stewart]]. The Lightning was powered by a special {{convert|240|hp||0|abbr=on}} version of the {{convert|351|in3|L|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} V8 engine. The Lightning shared its basic platform structure with the regular F-150, but modifications were made to many vehicle systems.  To enhance the Lightning chassis, the thicker frame rails from the 4-wheel drive F-250 were used to increase rigidity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The stock Lightning was capable of achieving 0.88 g lateral acceleration, yet it retained almost all the hauling and trailering capabilities of the parent F-Series. A {{convert|351|in3|L|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} ''[[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Windsor]]'' V8 producing {{convert|240|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|ft\u00b7lbf|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque replaced the standard F-150 engine. The engine was based on an existing block, but Ford engineers fitted it with high flow rate \"GT40\" heads and used [[hypereutectic pistons]] to increase response, output and durability.  The engine was also fitted with stainless steel \"shorty\" headers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAn upgraded Ford E4OD [[automatic transmission]] was the only available transmission. An aluminum [[driveshaft]] connected it to 4.10:1 rear limited slip gears.  The suspension had front and rear anti-rollbars and a special leaf, in the rear, tipped with a rubber snubber, that acted as a ladder bar and controlled rear wheel hop during hard acceleration.  Special 17\" aluminum wheels with [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk tires, Lightning badging, a front air dam with [[fog lamp]]s, a {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer and a special [[intake manifold]] all differentiated the Lightning from normal F-150s. Bucket seats with electrically-adjustable side bolsters and [[lumbar]] supports were part of the package. Suspension modifications provided a 1&nbsp;in front and 2.5&nbsp;in rear drop in ride height.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe 1993 Lightning, launched on 15 December 1992 by Ford President Ed Hagenlocker, received more than 150 favorable articles in America's newspapers, magazines, and television outlets, and helped Ford retain leadership in the personal-use truck market.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Three-time World Champion driver [[Jackie Stewart]] was highly involved in fine-tuning of the Lightning's handling. \n\n{| class=wikitable\n!Model Year!!Engine!!Power!!Torque!!Black Trucks!!Red Trucks!!White Trucks!!Total Production\n|- align=center\n|1993||rowspan=3|5.8&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Windsor]]'' [[fuel injection|FI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||rowspan=3|240&nbsp;hp (179&nbsp;kW)||rowspan=3|340&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (461&nbsp;N\u00b7m)||align=right|2,691||align=right|2,585||align=right|N/A||align=right|5,276\n|- align=center\n|1994||align=right|1,382||align=right|1,165||align=right|1,460||align=right|4,007\n|- align=center\n|1995||align=right|824||align=right|695||align=right|761||align=right|2,280\n|- align=right\n!colspan=7|Total\n|11,563\n|}\n\n==Powertrain==\nThe 1992 redesign left the powertrain lineup from the previous generation; the gasoline lineup of the 4.9L Inline-6, 5.0L and 5.8L [[Ford small block engine|Windsor V8s]], and the 7.5L Big Block V8 were all carried over. A 1993 model year option, the 7.3L International [[International Harvester IDI#7.3L|IDI]] diesel V8 gained a turbocharger for the first time. The 1994 model year engine lineup received a retune to increase output. During the 1994 model year, the IDI diesel V8 was replaced by the [[Navistar T444E engine|T444E]] V8. Dubbed the [[Ford Power Stroke engine|Powerstroke]] by Ford, the new diesel was again supplied by [[Navistar International]].  Despite sharing identical displacement with its IDI predecessor, the turbocharged Powerstroke/T444E was an all-new design with direct fuel injection. \n\nOne thing worth noting is that the 7.3 Powerstroke was the second diesel motor with electronic fuel injection to be put into a light duty truck. The GM 6.5L TurboDiesel with the Stanadyne DS-4 injection pump was the first, appearing in 1992. The Dodge Ram did not offer EFI in its diesel engines until 1998.\n\nAs before, the 5.0L V8 was not offered above 8500 GVWR and the F-Superduty was 7.5 and diesel only. The diesels and 7.5 were above 8500 GVWR only (F250HD and heavier.) The  5.8 also could have a GVWR of above 8500. The 4.9 was available in the F350 through 1996 as a delete option. The ninth generation was the last to offer the venerable [[Ford_small_block_engine#302|pushrod 5.0L engine]].<ref>http://www.f150hub.com/specs/302.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1991 to 1997. While still based on the basic design dating from for the 1980 model year, the 1992 F-Series brought a number of minor changes to the exterior and interior (where most enthusiasts consider this a facelift for the [[Ford F-Series seventh generation|same existing truck that first appeared in 1979 as a 1980 model]] instead of a redesign). This is the last generation of the F-Series that was produced as a complete range of trucks from a half-ton pickup to a medium-duty [[Truck classification#Class 6|Class 6]] truck. As this generation was replaced during the 1997\u20131998 model years, the larger models of the F-Series (F-250 and above) were split from the F-150; these became the [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks, related to the latter with a few powertrain components.\n\n==Design history==\n[[File:1994 Ford F-150 Flareside.JPG|thumb|left|alt=1994 F-150 Flareside with an extended cab|1994 F150 FlareSide SuperCab]]\nIn the interest of aerodynamics, the lines of the hood, front fenders, and grille were rounded off for 1992. Along with the larger grille, the headlights were enlarged (with the turn signals again moving below). Inside, the interior was updated with a redesigned dashboard along with new seats. Extended-cab (SuperCab) models received larger rear side windows. A notable change included the reintroduction of the Flareside bed that returned for production since 1987. Instead of the previous classic-style bed, the Flareside bed was now a narrow-body version of the dual rear-wheel bed; the rear fenders were repositioned to fit the width of the cab.\n\nThe 1994 models brought a slightly updated dashboard and the addition of a standard driver's-side [[airbag]] on F-150s and light-duty F-250s only, [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp .28CHMSL.29|center high mount stop lamp]] (CHMSL), brake-shift interlock, and CFC-free air conditioning. New options for 1994 included [[remote keyless entry]] with alarm, a [[car audio|compact disc player]] fitted into the regular stereo system, and a [[power seat|power driver's seat]]; an [[Rear-view mirror#Automatic dimming|electrochromic inside rear view mirror]] was also offered for 1994 and 1995 as part of a luxury light package.\n\nFord trailed their rival [[General Motors]] in combined truck sales for much of the ninth generation, though sales steadily rose each year. 500,000 F-Series trucks were sold in 1992, but this rose to nearly 800,000 by 1996. Meaning that Ford had overtaken the combined Truck sales of [[Chevrolet]] and [[GMC Truck|GMC]] for the first time in a decade.\nIn the second half of 1997 The F-250 HD (Heavy Duty) was in the same series as the F-350.\n\n==Trim==\n*Custom (1992\u20131993) Included: Cargo box light, tinted glass, argent grille, steel wheels with hubcaps, color-keyed floormats, an AM radio with digital clock and two speakers, vinyl bench seat, and voltmeter, oil pressure and temperature gauges. \n*XL (1992-1997): Added: Black rub strip, chrome grille, deep-dish aluminum wheels, carpeted map pockets, an AM/FM stereo with digital clock and two speakers, and a cloth and vinyl bench seat. \n*XLT (1992-1997): Added: argent steel wheels, air conditioning, a cloth bench seat, and a rear bench on the SuperCab only. \n*Nite (1990-1992): Added: cloth flight bench with power lumbar, sliding rear window, aluminum deep dish wheels.\n*SVT Lightning (1993\u20131995) Added (from XLT trim): 5-spoke aluminum rims, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player, digital clock and four speakers, power windows and locks, and air conditioning.\n*Eddie Bauer (1995\u20131996, F-150, only)\n*4x4 Offroad (1992-1997)\n\nThe monochromatic \"Nite\" package introduced in 1990 continued, but was dropped at the end of the 1992 model year.  As before, it featured an all-black exterior with either a pink or blue/purple stripe and \"Nite\" decal on the sides of the cargo box.\n\nFor 1993 the Custom model was dropped, as the XL became the new base model. Following the lead of the [[Ford Aerostar|Aerostar]], [[Ford Bronco]], and [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], the ''Eddie Bauer'' trim line \u2014 featuring plusher trim and increased standard features \u2014 was reintroduced for 1995. Also in 1993, the ''SVT Lightning'' was introduced, slotting itself in between the Chevrolet 454SS and GMC Syclone. [[Ford SVT|Ford Special Vehicles Team]] upgraded the Lightning from the regular F-series with heavy-duty suspension and brakes.  Powertrain upgrades came from heavy-duty trucks, with a 240&nbsp;hp version of the 5.8L V8 and the E4OD overdrive transmission normally paired with the 7.3L diesel and 460 7.5L V8s.\n\nThe 4wd F150 continued the use of the [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44 Twin-Traction Beam axle from the 80\u201391 trucks, and the Ford 8.8\" Rear Straight axle. The 4wd F250 carried the Dana 50 Twin Traction Beam axle, the Sterling 10.25 from the previous generation for the rear; full float on heavy duty 3/4 ton trucks and the 4wd F350 used the [[Dana 60]] Straight Axle front, and the Sterling 10.25\" rear Straight axle.\n\n==Models==\nNinth-generation Ford F-Series models are:\n* '''F-150''': 1/2 ton (6,250&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-250''' : 1992\u20131996 3/4 ton (8,800&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-250 HD''': 1996\u20131997 Heavy Duty 3/4 ton (8,800 [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-350''' : 1 ton  (10,000&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-Super Duty''' (chassis cab model only): 1 1/2 ton and greater (16,000&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n\nThe F-150, F-250, F-250 HD, F-350, and F-Super Duty were available in many different configurations from chassis cab base models, up to XLT trimmed models with their chrome and plush seating. The trucks came with a variety of gas and diesel engines. The F-150 could be had with one of 3 gas engines, the 4.9L (300 cid) I6, the 5.0L (302 cid) V8, and the 5.8L (351 cid) V8. The same gas engine options were also available for the heavy duty trucks along with the 7.5L (460 cid), or you could opt for the 7.3L (444 cid) diesel. \n\nThe first version was the 7.3L IDI (Indirect Injected) V8 (1992 - 1993.5), which was produced by [[Navistar International]]. In 1993.5-1994.5 a turbocharged 7.3L IDI V8 with stronger internals was offered as emissions, power, and torque demands were increasing. In the second half of 1994, the new Direct Injected 7.3L Power Stroke V8 Turbodiesel replaced the 7.3L IDI V8. Also built by International Harvester, and used in [[International Trucks]], known as the T444 E Engine. \n\nThe F-250 HD was available from 1996 to 1997, and differed from the earlier F-250 in the trim that was on it, and it also had a transmission cooler like the later [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks, it also received a heavier rear axle, and heavier springs and shocks. Because of these changes in design, service technicians started to refer to the first PowerStrokes as an OBS or Old Body Style to avoid confusion from the similar Super Duty 7.3 Power Stroke parts. As part of the 4x4 off-road package, they were available with several skid plates underneath. After 1997, the heavier-duty models were split from the Ford F-150. These line of trucks were called the 1999 [[Ford Super Duty]]. The F-150 could be had with either short (6.5') or long (8') beds with either regular or extended cab. The F-250 and F-350 trucks were only available with long beds (8&nbsp;ft.) except in 1996 and 1997, the F-250 HD could be had in an extended cab/short bed or crew cab/short bed model. The crew cab short bed and extended cab short bed trucks are very rare, as they were only produced for a little over a year. \nThe F-Series production rolled off the assembly line in December 1997 and the Ford Super Duty was introduced as a replacement.\n\n==Medium-Duty F-Series==\n{{See also|Ford F-series (medium duty truck)}}\n[[File:Ford F heavy duty.JPG|thumb|left|1994\u20131998 F600/F700 cargo truck]]\n\nFor the 1994.5 model year, the exterior of the medium-duty F-Series was changed for the first time since 1979. Available only as a tilting cowl, the new hood featured a much larger grille. Instead of being mounted on the fenders, the turn signals were now mounted beside the headlights. Instead of the model designation, the cowl badge was replaced by an \"F-Series\" one. Inside, the interior was largely carried over from 1980.\n\nWhile still available with a [[Ford 385 engine|7.0L gasoline V8]], many medium-duty F-Series were diesel-powered. Instead of the Navistar T444E V8 engine seen in the F-250/F-350, the medium-duty models offered two inline-6 engines (the [[Caterpillar 3126]] and the Cummins 6BT/ISB). In 1999, these trucks were discontinued, along with the [[Ford B-Series|B-Series]] bus chassis; while the bus chassis was not replaced, Ford re-entered the medium-duty truck market with the [[Ford F-650|Ford F-650/750]]. Built in a joint venture with Navistar, they were integrated into the Super Duty lineup.\n{{-}}\n\n==Variants==\n\n===SVT Lightning===\nThe '''SVT Lightning''' is a [[sport car|sports]]/performance version of the F-150, released by Ford's [[Ford SVT|SVT]] (Special Vehicle Team) division.\n[[File:1993FordLightning.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Ford SVT Lightning]]\n\nFord introduced the Lightning in 1992 to compete with primarily the [[Chevrolet C/K#454 SS|Chevrolet 454 SS]], in an effort to enhance the sporty, personal-use image of the Ford F-Series pickup.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This initial Lightning featured performance handling developed by world-champion driver [[Jackie Stewart]]. The Lightning was powered by a special {{convert|240|hp||0|abbr=on}} version of the {{convert|351|in3|L|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} V8 engine. The Lightning shared its basic platform structure with the regular F-150, but modifications were made to many vehicle systems.  To enhance the Lightning chassis, the thicker frame rails from the 4-wheel drive F-250 were used to increase rigidity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The stock Lightning was capable of achieving 0.88 g lateral acceleration, yet it retained almost all the hauling and trailering capabilities of the parent F-Series. A {{convert|351|in3|L|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} ''[[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Windsor]]'' V8 producing {{convert|240|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|ft\u00b7lbf|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque replaced the standard F-150 engine. The engine was based on an existing block, but Ford engineers fitted it with high flow rate \"GT40\" heads and used [[hypereutectic pistons]] to increase response, output and durability.  The engine was also fitted with stainless steel \"shorty\" headers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAn upgraded Ford E4OD [[automatic transmission]] was the only available transmission. An aluminum [[driveshaft]] connected it to 4.10:1 rear limited slip gears.  The suspension had front and rear anti-rollbars and a special leaf, in the rear, tipped with a rubber snubber, that acted as a ladder bar and controlled rear wheel hop during hard acceleration.  Special 17\" aluminum wheels with [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk tires, Lightning badging, a front air dam with [[fog lamp]]s, a {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer and a special [[intake manifold]] all differentiated the Lightning from normal F-150s. Bucket seats with electrically-adjustable side bolsters and [[lumbar]] supports were part of the package. Suspension modifications provided a 1&nbsp;in front and 2.5&nbsp;in rear drop in ride height.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe 1993 Lightning, launched on 15 December 1992 by Ford President Ed Hagenlocker, received more than 150 favorable articles in America's newspapers, magazines, and television outlets, and helped Ford retain leadership in the personal-use truck market.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Three-time World Champion driver [[Jackie Stewart]] was highly involved in fine-tuning of the Lightning's handling. \n\n{| class=wikitable\n!Model Year!!Engine!!Power!!Torque!!Black Trucks!!Red Trucks!!White Trucks!!Total Production\n|- align=center\n|1993||rowspan=3|5.8&nbsp;L ''[[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Windsor]]'' [[fuel injection|FI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||rowspan=3|240&nbsp;hp (179&nbsp;kW)||rowspan=3|340&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (461&nbsp;N\u00b7m)||align=right|2,691||align=right|2,585||align=right|N/A||align=right|5,276\n|- align=center\n|1994||align=right|1,382||align=right|1,165||align=right|1,460||align=right|4,007\n|- align=center\n|1995||align=right|824||align=right|695||align=right|761||align=right|2,280\n|- align=right\n!colspan=7|Total\n|11,563\n|}\n\n==Powertrain==\nThe 1992 redesign left the powertrain lineup from the previous generation; the gasoline lineup of the 4.9L Inline-6, 5.0L and 5.8L [[Ford small block engine|Windsor V8s]], and the 7.5L Big Block V8 were all carried over. A 1993 model year option, the 7.3L International [[International Harvester IDI#7.3L|IDI]] diesel V8 gained a turbocharger for the first time. The 1994 model year engine lineup received a retune to increase output. During the 1994 model year, the IDI diesel V8 was replaced by the [[Navistar T444E engine|T444E]] V8. Dubbed the [[Ford Power Stroke engine|Powerstroke]] by Ford, the new diesel was again supplied by [[Navistar International]].  Despite sharing identical displacement with its IDI predecessor, the turbocharged Powerstroke/T444E was an all-new design with direct fuel injection. \n\nOne thing worth noting is that the 7.3 Powerstroke was the second diesel motor with electronic fuel injection to be put into a light duty truck. The GM 6.5L TurboDiesel with the Stanadyne DS-4 injection pump was the first, appearing in 1992. The Dodge Ram did not offer EFI in its diesel engines until 1998.\n\nAs before, the 5.0L V8 was not offered above 8500 GVWR and the F-Superduty was 7.5 and diesel only. The diesels and 7.5 were above 8500 GVWR only (F250HD and heavier.) The  5.8 also could have a GVWR of above 8500. The 4.9 was available in the F350 through 1996 as a delete option.

G2A.COM's target demographic was young gamers with a lack of disposable income for video game purchases, so Go2Arena's objective became to sell video games at the lowest price possible. At that time, Bartosz Skwarczek approached many large developers at various events such as [[Gamescom]], [[E3]] and [[G-Star]] hoping to secure partnership deals in order to become an official seller of their games. Due to a lack of interest from developers, as well as fluctuations in market trends, the company's business model changed from retailer to marketplace.<ref name=\"g2a-history\">{{cite web|access-date=8 January 2016|date=3 January 2016|title=The Early History of G2A|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-early-history-of-g2a-563085251.html|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, G2A launched G2A Direct, a partnership program for video game developers and publishers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/g2a-direct|title=G2A Direct signs up \u201cover 50\u201d developers in four months, including Hi-Rez and SuperHOT|website=PCGamesN|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> Its distinctive feature is the possibility for developers to earn on each third-party sale of their products on G2A Marketplace. According to the company's representative, this is something \"no one has done before.\" Joining the program is free of charge, and the revenue split is competitive among other video game stores and marketplaces.\n\nSales numbers in 2016 showed the platform had processed 22 million transactions throughout the entire G2A ecosystem, which is valued at $313 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbrp.pl/a/zachowalismy-energie-start-upu-w-duzej-firmie/D10Kntp71M|title=Zachowali\u015bmy energi\u0119 start-upu w du\u017cej firmie|last=Ro\u017cek|first=Dawid|date=August 2017|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, a new product category was introduced to G2A Marketplace \u2013 electronics and merchandise tailored to gamers.

Due to a lack of interest from developers, as well as fluctuations in market trends, the company's business model changed from retailer to marketplace.<ref name=\"g2a-history\">{{cite web|access-date=8 January 2016|date=3 January 2016|title=The Early History of G2A|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-early-history-of-g2a-563085251.html|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, G2A launched G2A Direct, a partnership program for video game developers and publishers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/g2a-direct|title=G2A Direct signs up \u201cover 50\u201d developers in four months, including Hi-Rez and SuperHOT|website=PCGamesN|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> Its distinctive feature is the possibility for developers to earn on each third-party sale of their products on G2A Marketplace.

While the 1980 cab and chassis was carried over to the new model, the 1987 model was more streamlined, and maintenance items were made simpler. The exterior was facelifted with new composite headlamps, a more aerodynamic front end, and circular fenders. Inside, the interior was given a complete redesign.  Rear [[antilock brakes]] were now standard, the first pickup truck to boast this.  For the first time, all models were produced with straight-sided Styleside beds; the Flareside bed was discontinued except for a small number of early 1987 models using leftover 1986 beds with new circular fenders. In 1991 Ford premiered the 9th gen tail lights (the white reverse light was decreased in size) on the last year of the 8th generation.\n\n==Trims==\n[[File:F250 utility service truck.jpeg|thumb|Ford F-250 Utility service truck]]\n*Custom - Included: Vinyl upholstery, black steering wheel, chrome front bumper, black grille, hubcaps, foldaway mirrors, and an electronic AM radio with digital clock and two speakers.\n*XL - Added: Cloth and vinyl upholstery, swingaway mirrors, front bumper rub strip, color-keyed floor mat, a door trim panel with map pocket, and a color-keyed headliner.\n*XLT Lariat - Added: Cloth upholstery, chrome grille, sport wheel covers, tinted glass, carpeting, and leather wrapped steering wheel.\n*Nite (1992)\n\nFor 1992, a \"Nite\" trim package was introduced. It included all blacked-out exterior trim, either a pink or blue/purple stripe, and a \"Nite\" decal on the sides of the cargo box.\n\n== Models ==\n[[File:UHI DC5692.JPG|thumb|Ford F-350 [[U-Haul]] truck in [[Hampton, VA]].]]\n\nEighth-generation Ford F-Series models are:\n* '''F-150''': 1/2 ton (6,250&nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)\n* '''F-250''': light-duty 3/4 ton (7,700&nbsp;lb GVWR max)\n* '''F-250HD''': 3/4 ton (8,800&nbsp;lb GVWR max)\n* '''F-350''': 1 ton (10,000&nbsp;lb GVWR max)\n* '''F-Super Duty''': Class 4 truck (14,500&nbsp;lb GVWR max)\n\nThe new-for-1987 F-Super Duty was essentially a [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4 truck]] built as a chassis cab, with an aftermarket bed (specific to its future use) added after the truck was built. The F-Super Duty came with dual fuel tanks with a dash-mounted toggle switch to switch between each tank, while using only a single fuel gauge. It came with a [[Power take-off|PTO]] used to power attachments, such as winches or a dump bed, directly from the transmission. F-Super Duty models were rated at about {{convert|15000|lb|abbr=on}} [[GVWR]] and came with either the standard 7.5&nbsp;L (460&nbsp;CID) gas V8 or the optional 7.3&nbsp;L (444&nbsp;CID) diesel V8. All wheels were 10-lug with dual wheels in the rear. This model should not be confused with the later [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] commercial line of trucks starting with the 1999 model year.\n\n==Powertrain and chassis==\nIn a move to further update the F-Series engine lineup, the 4.9&nbsp;L inline-6 was converted to fuel injection for 1987. A year later, Ford became the first pickup truck manufacturer to sell a fully non-carbureted engine lineup as the 5.8&nbsp;L V8 and 7.5&nbsp;L V8 also gained [[fuel injection]](the 5.0&nbsp;L V8 had gained fuel injection as an option for 1985 and was made standard in 1986). For 1988, the diesel V8 from International (Navistar) was enlarged to from 420 to 444 cubic inches (6.9 to 7.3 L); this allowed for an increase to {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|365|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nWhile the dated 3-speed column-mounted manual transmission was discontinued, much of the rest of the transmission lineup carried over from the 1980-1986 trucks. In 1988, the five-speed ZF S5-42 replaced the Borg-Warner T19 in F-250 and F-350 models. For the F-150 and light-duty F-250, the heavier-duty Borg-Warner T18 4-speed manual remained available, while the Mazda-built [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual was added to the model lineup for 4.9&nbsp;L inline-6 and 5.0&nbsp;L V8-equipped models.\n\nFour-wheel-drive improvements included the addition of automatic locking hubs for the F-150 in 1989. Models with the 5.0L V8 also had an option of a \"Touch Drive\" electronic transfer case.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nFrom 1980 through 1996, Ford offered a four-wheel-drive swing arm independent front suspension called [[Twin Traction Beam]] (TTB). Based on its two-wheel-drive twin I-beam suspension from 1965, Ford mounted a [[Dana 44]] differential in the driver-side (front) axle beam and transmitted torque to the passenger-side wheel with a double U-jointed axleshaft. Radius arms and coil springs were still used on the F-150, while the four-wheel-drive F-250 and F-350 got leaf springs. The F-250 received TTB [[Dana 50]] axles, and the F-350 a solid [[Dana 60]] axle.\n\n'''Engines:'''\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 88%;\"\n|-\n! Name !! Production !!

In 1988, the five-speed ZF S5-42 replaced the Borg-Warner T19 in F-250 and F-350 models. For the F-150 and light-duty F-250, the heavier-duty Borg-Warner T18 4-speed manual remained available, while the Mazda-built [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual was added to the model lineup for 4.9&nbsp;L inline-6 and 5.0&nbsp;L V8-equipped models.\n\nFour-wheel-drive improvements included the addition of automatic locking hubs for the F-150 in 1989. Models with the 5.0L V8 also had an option of a \"Touch Drive\" electronic transfer case.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nFrom 1980 through 1996, Ford offered a four-wheel-drive swing arm independent front suspension called [[Twin Traction Beam]] (TTB). Based on its two-wheel-drive twin I-beam suspension from 1965, Ford mounted a [[Dana 44]] differential in the driver-side (front) axle beam and transmitted torque to the passenger-side wheel with a double U-jointed axleshaft. Radius arms and coil springs were still used on the F-150, while the four-wheel-drive F-250 and F-350 got leaf springs. The F-250 received TTB [[Dana 50]] axles, and the F-350 a solid [[Dana 60]] axle.\n\n'''Engines:'''\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 88%;\"\n|-\n! Name !! Production !!

Weekday circulation during fall and spring semesters is 20,000; copies are distributed free at more than 250 locations throughout [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign\u2013Urbana]].\n\nThe paper is published by [[Illini Media]] Company (IMC), a not-for-profit corporation which owns several other student-run media outlets,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://illinimedia.com/|title=Home|work=Illini Media|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}</ref> and also operates [[WPGU-FM|WPGU]] 107.1 FM,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wpgu.com/|title=WPGU 107.1 - Champaign's Alternative|website=WPGU 107.1|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> a student-run commercial radio station. While the IMC has no official ties to the university, university professors and others in the academic community serve on its board of directors. The newspaper\u2019s staff has both full-time professionals and students.\n\nThe paper is published daily online and two days a week in print as a broadsheet.\n\n==Staff==\nThe editorial, business and production departments are staffed by students who are enrolled in a wide variety of degree programs, not just journalism. Several full-time professionals, including the newspaper\u2019s publisher and the advertising and circulation managers, are employees of IMC. Some students are paid for their jobs in reporting, editing, production and advertising, but some of the students work for free, as well.\n\nThe ''Daily Illini'' staff completely changes once per year, known as \"turnover\" in the DI offices. \"Turnover\" means the current group of editors (editor-in-chief, news editors, sports editors, opinions editors and features editors, among others) finish their tenure at the ''DI'' in their current editing position, and a new group of editors fills these positions. The new editor-in-chief is chosen by some members of the IMC, and then the editor-in-chief chooses all of the other editors that will work under him/her.\n\nAt the beginning of each fall and spring semester, the ''DI'' hires new reporters and staff members. All University of Illinois students, regardless of major, are encouraged to apply.\n\n==Awards==\nThe ''DI'' regularly receives first-place awards from the Associated College Press, Society of Professional Journalists, Illinois College Press Association, and Columbia Scholastic Press Association.\n\nIn February 2010, the ''Daily Illini'' was awarded the General Excellence award by the Illinois Collegiate Press Association. Their website, www.dailyillini.com has been named the best college newspaper website in the state for the past four years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219141644/http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html |archivedate=2006-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, the ''Daily Illini'' was awarded best newspaper and third best online newspaper in the nation by the [[Associated Collegiate Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyillini.com/news/2017/10/29/daily-illini-wins-best-show-national-conference/|title=The Daily Illini wins Best of Show at national conference {{!}} The Daily Illini|last=Report|first=The Daily Illini Staff|website=dailyillini.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, the ''Daily Illini'' was awarded second in General Excellence by the Illinois College Press Association under the leadership of Editor-in-Chief Lillian Barkley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyillini.com/news/2018/02/17/the-daily-illini-wins-2nd-place-in-general-excellence-at-icpa/|title=The Daily Illini wins second place in general excellence at ICPA {{!}} The Daily Illini|last=Liu|first=Karen|website=dailyillini.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> The newspaper also won best online newspaper by the Illinois College Press Association<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyillini.com/news/2018/02/17/the-daily-illini-wins-2nd-place-in-general-excellence-at-icpa/|title=The Daily Illini wins second place in general excellence at ICPA {{!}} The Daily Illini|last=Liu|first=Karen|website=dailyillini.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> and by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spj5conference.com/|title=SPJ Region 5 Conference|website=SPJ Region 5 Conference|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> under the leadership of Managing Editor for Online Jacob Singleton.\n\n==Offices==\nThe newspaper\u2019s office is located at 512 E.

Weekday circulation during fall and spring semesters is 20,000; copies are distributed free at more than 250 locations throughout [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign\u2013Urbana]].\n\nThe paper is published by [[Illini Media]] Company, a not-for-profit corporation which owns several other student-run media outlets,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://illinimedia.com/|title=Home|work=Illini Media|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}</ref> and also operates [[WPGU-FM|WPGU]] 107.1 FM,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wpgu.com/|title=WPGU 107.1 - Champaign's Alternative|website=WPGU 107.1|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> a student-run commercial radio station. While the IMC has no official ties to the university, university professors and others in the academic community serve on its board of directors. The newspaper\u2019s staff has both full-time professionals and students.\n\nThe paper is published daily online and two days a week in print as a broadsheet.\n\n==Staff==\nThe editorial, business and production departments are staffed by students who are enrolled in a wide variety of degree programs, not just journalism. Several full-time professionals, including the newspaper\u2019s publisher and the advertising and circulation managers, are employees of IMC. Some students are paid for their jobs in reporting, editing, production and advertising, but some of the students work for free, as well.\n\n''The Daily Illini'' staff completely changes once per year, known as \"turnover\" in the DI offices. \"Turnover\" means the current group of editors (editor-in-chief, news editors, sports editors, opinions editors and features editors, among others) finish their tenure at the ''DI'' in their current editing position, and a new group of editors fills these positions. The new editor-in-chief is chosen by some members of the IMC, and then the editor-in-chief chooses all of the other editors that will work under him/her.\n\nAt the beginning of each fall and spring semester, the ''DI'' hires new reporters and staff members. All University of Illinois students, regardless of major, are encouraged to apply.\n\n==Awards==\nThe ''DI'' regularly receives first-place awards from the Associated College Press, Society of Professional Journalists, Illinois College Press Association, and Columbia Scholastic Press Association.\n\nIn February 2010, ''The Daily Illini'' was awarded the General Excellence award by the Illinois Collegiate Press Association. Their website, www.dailyillini.com has been named the best college newspaper website in the state for the past four years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219141644/http://www.illinimedia.com/DI/DI.html |archivedate=2006-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, ''The Daily Illini'' was awarded best newspaper and third best online newspaper in the nation by the [[Associated Collegiate Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyillini.com/news/2017/10/29/daily-illini-wins-best-show-national-conference/|title=The Daily Illini wins Best of Show at national conference {{!}} The Daily Illini|last=Report|first=The Daily Illini Staff|website=dailyillini.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, ''The Daily Illini'' was awarded second in General Excellence by the Illinois College Press Association under the leadership of Editor-in-Chief Lillian Barkley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyillini.com/news/2018/02/17/the-daily-illini-wins-2nd-place-in-general-excellence-at-icpa/|title=The Daily Illini wins second place in general excellence at ICPA {{!}} The Daily Illini|last=Liu|first=Karen|website=dailyillini.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> The newspaper also won best online newspaper by the Illinois College Press Association<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyillini.com/news/2018/02/17/the-daily-illini-wins-2nd-place-in-general-excellence-at-icpa/|title=The Daily Illini wins second place in general excellence at ICPA {{!}} The Daily Illini|last=Liu|first=Karen|website=dailyillini.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> and by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spj5conference.com/|title=SPJ Region 5 Conference|website=SPJ Region 5 Conference|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> under the leadership of Managing Editor for Online Jacob Singleton.\n\n==Offices==\nThe newspaper\u2019s office is located at 512 E.

{"title_page": "Rate (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Rate (disambiguation){{!}}Rate}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}\nFollow my mom [[mathematics]], a '''rate''' is the [[ratio]] between two related [[quantity|quantities]] in different units.<ref>See Webster's new international dictionary of the English language, second edition, unabridged.  Merriam Webster Co. 2016. p.2065 definition 3.\nwhile this definition doesn't say \"related\" and while the ratio of two non-related quantities is technically a ratio, such a ratio has little (if any meaning).  For example, what would be the utility of finding the ratio of such unrelated numbers as ratio of the weight of ones residence to an integer selected at random between -10<sup>\u22129</sup> and +10<sup>9</sup>?</ref>  If the denominator of the ratio is expressed as a single unit of one of these quantities, and if it is assumed that this quantity can be changed systematically (i.e., is an [[independent variable]]), then the numerator of the ratio expresses the corresponding ''rate of change'' in the other [[dependent variable|(dependent)]] variable.  \n\npeyton is goated\", such as [[speed]], [[heart rate]] and [[flux]]. Ratios that have a non-time denominator include [[exchange rate]]s, [[literacy rate]]s and [[electric field]] (in volts/meter).\n\nIn describing the units of a rate, the word \"per\" is used to separate the units of the two measurements used to calculate the rate (for example a [[heart rate]] is expressed \"beats per minute\"). A rate defined using two numbers of the same [[Units of measurement|units]] (such as [[tax rate]]s) or counts (such as [[literacy rate]]) will result in a [[dimensionless quantity]], which can be expressed as a [[percentage]] (for example, the global [[literacy rate]] in 1998 was 80%) or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or as a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]].\n\nOften ''rate'' is a synonym of [[rhythm]] or [[frequency]], a count per second (i.e., [[Hertz]]); e.g., [[radio frequencies]] or [[heart rate]] or [[sample rate]].\n\n==Introduction==\n\nRates and ratios often vary with time, location, particular element (or subset) of a set of objects, etc.  Thus they are often [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical functions]].  For example, velocity v (distance tracity on segment i (v is a function of index i).  Here each segment i, of the trip is a subset of the trip route.\n\nA rate (or ratio) may often be thought of as an output-input ratio,  [[benefit-cost ratio]], all considered in the broad sense.

For example, in finance, one could define i by assigning consecutive integers to companies, to political subdivisions (such as states), to different investments, etc.  The reason for using indices i, is so a set of ratios (i=0,N) can be used in an equation so as to calculate a function of the rates such as an average of a set of ratios.  For example, the average velocity found from the set of v<sub>i</sub>'s mentioned above.  Finding averages may involve using weighted averages and possibly using the [[Harmonic mean]].\n\nA ratio r=a/b has both a numerator a and a denominator b. a and/or b may be a [[real number]] or [[integer]].  The inverse of a ratio r is 1/r  = b/a.\n\nRates occur in many areas of real life. For example:\n''How fast are you driving?'' Miles per hour is a rate.

Merriam Webster Co. 2016. p.2065 definition 3.\nwhile this definition doesn't say \"related\" and while the ratio of two non-related quantities is technically a ratio, such a ratio has little (if any meaning).  For example, what would be the utility of finding the ratio of such unrelated numbers as ratio of the weight of ones residence to an integer selected at random between -10<sup>\u22129</sup> and +10<sup>9</sup>?</ref>  If the denominator of the ratio is expressed as a single unit of one of these quantities, and if it is assumed that this quantity can be changed systematically (i.e., is an [[independent variable]]), then the numerator of the ratio expresses the corresponding ''rate of change'' in the other [[dependent variable|(dependent)]] variable.  \n\npeyton is goated\", such as [[speed]], [[heart rate]] and [[flux]]. Ratios that have a non-time denominator include [[exchange rate]]s, [[literacy rate]]s and [[electric field]] (in volts/meter).\n\nIn describing the units of a rate, the word \"per\" is used to separate the units of the two measurements used to calculate the rate (for example a [[heart rate]] is expressed \"beats per minute\"). A rate defined using two numbers of the same [[Units of measurement|units]] (such as [[tax rate]]s) or counts (such as [[literacy rate]]) will result in a [[dimensionless quantity]], which can be expressed as a [[percentage]] (for example, the global [[literacy rate]] in 1998 was 80%) or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or as a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]].\n\nOften ''rate'' is a synonym of [[rhythm]] or [[frequency]], a count per second (i.e., [[Hertz]]); e.g., [[radio frequencies]] or [[heart rate]] or [[sample rate]].\n\n==Introduction==\n\nRates and ratios often vary with time, location, particular element (or subset) of a set of objects, etc.  Thus they are often [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical functions]].  For example, velocity v (distance tracity on segment i (v is a function of index i).  Here each segment i, of the trip is a subset of the trip route.\n\nA rate (or ratio) may often be thought of as an output-input ratio,  [[benefit-cost ratio]], all considered in the broad sense.
