All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, as well as an eventual total of 23 out of the 89 occupants of the Boeing. [[Rescue workers]] were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. Neither of the front exits was usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the [[overwing exits]]. However, only one of the overwing exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to [[asphyxiation]] in the post-crash fire.\n\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of [[situational awareness]] by the local controller, and inadequate oversight of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />{{Rp|vi,76}} The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX.\n\n==Accident details==\n\n===Aircraft and crew===\n[[USAir]] Flight 1493 was a scheduled service from [[Syracuse, New York]] making stops at [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Columbus, Ohio]], and Los Angeles (LAX), before continuing to San Francisco.<ref name=AAR91-08>{{cite book |url=https://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR9108.pdf |title=Aviation Accident Report: Runway Collision of USAir Flight 1493, Boeing 737 and Skywest Flight 5569 Fairchild Metroliner, Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California, February 1, 1991 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-91/08 |date=October 22, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1}} On February 1, 1991, Flight 1493 was operated using a [[Boeing 737-300]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|388US}}''); after a crew change in Washington,<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|1}} it was under the command of [[pilot in command|Captain]] Colin Shaw, 48, a highly experienced pilot with approximately 16,300 total flight hours (including more than 4,300 hours on the Boeing 737), and [[copilot|First Officer]] David Kelly, 32, who had approximately 4,300 total flight hours, including 982 hours on the Boeing 737.<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|82}} Flying into LAX, the aircraft had a total of 89 people on board (83 passengers, 4 flight attendants, and the 2 pilots).{{efn|name=\"count discrepancy footnote\"}}\n\nOn February 1, 1991, [[SkyWest Airlines]] Flight 5569 was operated using a twin-engine [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner|Fairchild Metroliner]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|683AV}}'').

The local controller then cleared the USAir flight to land on 24L, even though the SkyWest Metroliner was still holding in takeoff position on the runway.\n\nWith this activity ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting they were ready for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The [[flight progress strip]] for this flight had not yet been given to the local controller by the [[clearance delivery]] controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.\n\nThe USAir plane touched down near the runway threshold. Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, but it was too late. The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, crushing it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded to skid down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest on the far side of the taxiway against a closed fire station building where it eventually caught fire.<ref name=airdisastercom/> Large debris from the Metroliner \u2013 including its tail, wings, and right engine \u2013 were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station.\n\nThe accident was witnessed from a plane carrying the [[Vancouver Canucks]], who were arriving for an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey game against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].<ref name=\"canucks\">{{cite news |title=Flights, Fate and Football: Remembering Flight 180 |publisher=Canadian Football League |url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |last=Beamish |first=Mike |date=December 9, 2006 |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222522/http://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe captain of that charter aircraft, having just landed, powered up the engines to get away from the fireball of the accident.<ref name=\"canucks\"/> The team was unsure if the USAir 737 was going to stop before it collided with their plane.<ref name=\"latimescancuks\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-04/sports/sp-447_1_vancouver-canucks |title=Canucks Had Close-Up View of Fatal Airline Crash at LAX |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Springer |first=Steve |date=February 4, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The Canucks were shaken by the experience and lost to the Kings by a score of 9\u20131, their worst loss of the [[1990\u201391 Vancouver Canucks season|1990\u201391]] season.<ref name=\"canucks\"/>\n\n==Fatalities and injuries==\n[[Image:USAir1493SeatingChart.svg|thumb|right|Seating chart of US Airways Flight 1493 from the NTSB, revealing locations of passengers, lack of injury, the severity of injuries, and deaths.]]\n\nThe 35 dead included all 12 people (10 passengers and both crew members) on SkyWest 5569, and 23 of the 89 aboard the USAir 1493 (21 passengers, Captain Shaw, and one flight attendant).

[[Billionaire]] businessman [[David H. Koch]] was among the survivors.\n\nThe majority of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those seated in the front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries.  Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The majority of the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door.  The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft.  Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seatback of the exit window seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.<ref name=AAR91-08/>\n\nFrom the location of the bodies, only two victims on USAir 1493 were found in their seats, while authorities believe that 17 had unbuckled their seat belts and died from [[smoke inhalation]] while making their way to the exits.

She said she originally thought the landing USAir plane had been hit by a bomb, then \"realized something went wrong... I went to the supervisor and I said, 'I think this (the SkyWest plane) is what USAir hit.'\"  She testified that rooftop lights in her line of sight caused glare in the tower, making it difficult to see small planes at the intersection where the SkyWest plane was positioned. Just before the accident, she confused the Skywest plane with another commuter airliner that was on a taxiway near the end of the runway. Making matters more difficult, the ground radar at LAX was not working on the day of the accident.<ref name=controller>{{cite news |last1=Malnic |first1=Eric |last2=Connell |first2=Rich |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-08/news/mn-1325_1_runway-collision |title=Controller Says Her Error Caused Runway Collision |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 8, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Stein|first=Mark|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-02-09-mn-656-story.html|title=Controller Was Stricken by Grief, Tears After Crash : Disaster: Co-workers spent hours after the accident counseling her and hid her from publicity for days.|date=1991-02-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2020-03-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed that the cockpit crew of the landing USAir jet could not see the commuter plane, which blended in with other airport lights.<ref name=towertapes>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-03-26/news/1991085042_1_skywest-plane-down-the-runway |title=FAA releases tower tapes of the crash on L.A. runway |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |last=Carroll |first=James R. |date=March 26, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The NTSB cited LAX's procedures which placed much of the responsibility for runways on the local controllers, which directly led to the loss of situational awareness by the local controller. The NTSB also noted that during the previous performance review a supervisor had noted four deficiencies in the local controller who ultimately worked the accident aircraft. These deficiencies were not addressed prior to the accident, and two of the deficiencies were apparent in the accident sequence\u2014her loss of situational awareness and aircraft misidentification.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed a failing system in the air and ground traffic control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning at the time of the incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the local controller did not support the local controller's workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff.  All these issues were rectified at LAX following this incident.\n\nAt the time of the accident, air traffic controllers at LAX used all four runways (North Complex runways 24L and 24R, South Complex runways 25L and 25R) for mixed takeoffs and landings. One of the NTSB recommendations was that the runways be segregated with only landings or departures taking place on an individual runway. This recommendation was implemented, but not until after another incident, when on August 19, 2004, a [[Boeing 747]] landing on 24L passed only {{convert|200|ft|m}} above a 737 holding on the same runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20040830X01323&ntsbno=LAX04IA302&akey=1|title=Aircraft Incident Report, B737 and B744 runway incursion, Los Angeles CA, August 19, 2004|date=August 19, 2004|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|id=LAX04IA302}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nLAX now prioritizes use of the outboard runways (24R and 25L) for landings and the inboard runways (24L and 25R) for takeoffs, though mixed operations may occur in certain situations. Additionally, a new control tower was built at LAX, in a more central location, significantly taller and with a better vantage point, allowing visibility of all runways and critical taxiways at the airport.\n\nBefore this accident, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a ruling that required airlines to upgrade the flammability standards of materials on board, but the USAir plane had been built before the effective date of those requirements and had not yet been modernized. It was scheduled to be upgraded within the next year.

The SkyWest flight was told to taxi into takeoff position while the USAir flight was landing on the same [[runway]].\n\nUpon landing, the 737 collided with the twin-engine turboprop, continued down the runway with the turboprop crushed beneath it, exited the runway, and caught fire. All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, as well as an eventual total of 23 out of the 89 occupants of the Boeing. [[Rescue workers]] were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. Neither of the front exits was usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the [[overwing exits]]. However, only one of the overwing exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to [[asphyxiation]] in the post-crash fire.\n\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of [[situational awareness]] by the local controller, and inadequate oversight of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />{{Rp|vi,76}} The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX.\n\n==Accident details==\n\n===Aircraft and crew===\n[[USAir]] Flight 1493 was a scheduled service from [[Syracuse, New York]] making stops at [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Columbus, Ohio]], and Los Angeles (LAX), before continuing to San Francisco.<ref name=AAR91-08>{{cite book |url=https://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR9108.pdf |title=Aviation Accident Report: Runway Collision of USAir Flight 1493, Boeing 737 and Skywest Flight 5569 Fairchild Metroliner, Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California, February 1, 1991 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-91/08 |date=October 22, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1}} On February 1, 1991, Flight 1493 was operated using a [[Boeing 737-300]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|388US}}''); after a crew change in Washington,<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|1}} it was under the command of [[pilot in command|Captain]] Colin Shaw, 48, a highly experienced pilot with approximately 16,300 total flight hours (including more than 4,300 hours on the Boeing 737), and [[copilot|First Officer]] David Kelly, 32, who had approximately 4,300 total flight hours, including 982 hours on the Boeing 737.<ref name=AAR91-08/>{{rp|82}} Flying into LAX, the aircraft had a total of 89 people on board (83 passengers, 4 flight attendants, and the 2 pilots).{{efn|name=\"count discrepancy footnote\"}}\n\nOn February 1, 1991, [[SkyWest Airlines]] Flight 5569 was operated using a twin-engine [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner|Fairchild Metroliner]] ([[Aircraft registration|registration]]  ''{{Airreg|N|683AV}}'').

The local controller then cleared the USAir flight to land on 24L, even though the SkyWest Metroliner was still holding in takeoff position on the runway.\n\nWith this activity ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting they were ready for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The [[flight progress strip]] for this flight had not yet been given to the local controller by the [[clearance delivery]] controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.\n\nThe USAir plane touched down near the runway threshold. Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, but it was too late. The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, crushing it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded to skid down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest on the far side of the taxiway against a closed fire station building where it eventually caught fire.<ref name=airdisastercom/> Large debris from the Metroliner \u2013 including its tail, wings, and right engine \u2013 were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station.\n\nThe accident was witnessed from a plane carrying the [[Vancouver Canucks]], who were arriving for an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey game against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].<ref name=\"canucks\">{{cite news |title=Flights, Fate and Football: Remembering Flight 180 |publisher=Canadian Football League |url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |last=Beamish |first=Mike |date=December 9, 2006 |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222522/http://www.cfl.ca/article/flights__fate_and_football__remembering_flight_180 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe captain of that charter aircraft, having just landed, powered up the engines to get away from the fireball of the accident.<ref name=\"canucks\"/> The team was unsure if the USAir 737 was going to stop before it collided with their plane.<ref name=\"latimescancuks\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-04/sports/sp-447_1_vancouver-canucks |title=Canucks Had Close-Up View of Fatal Airline Crash at LAX |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Springer |first=Steve |date=February 4, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The Canucks were shaken by the experience and lost to the Kings by a score of 9\u20131, their worst loss of the [[1990\u201391 Vancouver Canucks season|1990\u201391]] season.<ref name=\"canucks\"/>\n\n==Fatalities and injuries==\n[[Image:USAir1493SeatingChart.svg|thumb|right|Seating chart of US Airways Flight 1493 from the NTSB, revealing locations of passengers, lack of injury, the severity of injuries, and deaths.]]\n\nThe 35 dead included all 12 people (10 passengers and both crew members) on SkyWest 5569, and 23 of the 89 aboard the USAir 1493 (21 passengers, Captain Shaw, and one flight attendant).

[[Billionaire]] businessman [[David H. Koch]] was among the survivors.\n\nThe majority of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those seated in the front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries.  Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The majority of the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door.  The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft.  Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seatback of the exit window seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.<ref name=AAR91-08/>\n\nFrom the location of the bodies, only two victims on USAir 1493 were found in their seats, while authorities believe that 17 had unbuckled their seat belts and died from [[smoke inhalation]] while making their way to the exits.

She said she originally thought the landing USAir plane had been hit by a bomb, then \"realized something went wrong... I went to the supervisor and I said, 'I think this (the SkyWest plane) is what USAir hit.'\"  She testified that rooftop lights in her line of sight caused glare in the tower, making it difficult to see small planes at the intersection where the SkyWest plane was positioned. Just before the accident, she confused the Skywest plane with another commuter airliner that was on a taxiway near the end of the runway. Making matters more difficult, the ground radar at LAX was not working on the day of the accident.<ref name=controller>{{cite news |last1=Malnic |first1=Eric |last2=Connell |first2=Rich |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-08/news/mn-1325_1_runway-collision |title=Controller Says Her Error Caused Runway Collision |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 8, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Stein|first=Mark|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-02-09-mn-656-story.html|title=Controller Was Stricken by Grief, Tears After Crash : Disaster: Co-workers spent hours after the accident counseling her and hid her from publicity for days.|date=1991-02-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2020-03-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed that the cockpit crew of the landing USAir jet could not see the commuter plane, which blended in with other airport lights.<ref name=towertapes>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-03-26/news/1991085042_1_skywest-plane-down-the-runway |title=FAA releases tower tapes of the crash on L.A. runway |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |last=Carroll |first=James R. |date=March 26, 1991 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The NTSB cited LAX's procedures which placed much of the responsibility for runways on the local controllers, which directly led to the loss of situational awareness by the local controller. The NTSB also noted that during the previous performance review a supervisor had noted four deficiencies in the local controller who ultimately worked the accident aircraft. These deficiencies were not addressed prior to the accident, and two of the deficiencies were apparent in the accident sequence\u2014her loss of situational awareness and aircraft misidentification.<ref name=\"AAR91-08\" />\n\nThe NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed a failing system in the air and ground traffic control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning at the time of the incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the local controller did not support the local controller's workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff.  All these issues were rectified at LAX following this incident.\n\nAt the time of the accident, air traffic controllers at LAX used all four runways (North Complex runways 24L and 24R, South Complex runways 25L and 25R) for mixed takeoffs and landings. One of the NTSB recommendations was that the runways be segregated with only landings or departures taking place on an individual runway. This recommendation was implemented, but not until after another incident, when on August 19, 2004, a [[Boeing 747]] landing on 24L passed only {{convert|200|ft|m}} above a 737 holding on the same runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20040830X01323&ntsbno=LAX04IA302&akey=1|title=Aircraft Incident Report, B737 and B744 runway incursion, Los Angeles CA, August 19, 2004|date=August 19, 2004|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|id=LAX04IA302}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nLAX now prioritizes use of the outboard runways (24R and 25L) for landings and the inboard runways (24L and 25R) for takeoffs, though mixed operations may occur in certain situations. Additionally, a new control tower was built at LAX, in a more central location, significantly taller and with a better vantage point, allowing visibility of all runways and critical taxiways at the airport.\n\nBefore this accident, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a ruling that required airlines to upgrade the flammability standards of materials on board, but the USAir plane had been built before the effective date of those requirements and had not yet been modernized. It was scheduled to be upgraded within the next year.
