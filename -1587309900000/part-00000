Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local [[Claire's]] to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part,<ref name=CBR/> [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. When she began her work on that series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]] to work the production's long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of that show, jokingly said that she would sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku.<ref name=\"Megafest\"/>\n\nAfter completing high school, Dushku returned to acting with the role of [[Faith Lehane]] in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', a [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|Slayer]] much more troubled than the main character, [[Buffy Summers]]. Though initially planned as a five-episode role, the character became so popular that she stayed on for the whole third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four, after which the remainder of her original story arc played out as part of the first season of the ''Buffy'' spin-off series ''Angel''. Repentant and rededicated, Faith returned as a heroine in other episodes of ''Angel'' and in the last five episodes of ''Buffy''. \n\nAs an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from legions of prisoners. She said:\n\n<blockquote>I've been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and [[death row]]. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything \u2013 disgusting things that you don't even want to know about.

She was chosen in a five-month search for the lead role of Alice in the film ''[[That Night]]''. In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in ''[[This Boy's Life (film)|This Boy's Life]]'', a role that she said opened a lot of doors.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The following year, she played the teenage daughter of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] in ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elizapatriciadushku.com/bio|title=Eliza Dushku|website=Elizapatriciadushku.com|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref> She had parts as [[Paul Reiser]]'s daughter in ''[[Bye Bye Love (film)|Bye Bye Love]]'', as Cindy Johnson in ''[[Race the Sun]]'', and in the television movie ''Journey''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEUr55E10v4|title=Journey Trailer 1995|author=Video Detective|date=November 11, 2014|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref> and the short film ''Fishing with George''.\n\n====''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''====\nDushku planned to attend [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, where her mother taught,<ref name=\"Megafest\"/><ref name=CBR>Tramountaanas, George A. (March 29, 2014). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=51822 \"ECCC: Eliza Dushku Talks 'Buffy,' 'Dollhouse' and Going Back to College\"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].</ref> but her agent asked her to submit a videotape audition for a show starring another of his clients, [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]. After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local [[Claire's]] to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part,<ref name=CBR/> [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. When she began her work on that series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]] to work the production's long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of that show, jokingly said that she would sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku.<ref name=\"Megafest\"/>\n\nAfter completing high school, Dushku returned to acting with the role of [[Faith Lehane]] in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', a [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|Slayer]] much more troubled than the main character, [[Buffy Summers]]. Though initially planned as a five-episode role, the character became so popular that she stayed on for the whole third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four, after which the remainder of her original story arc played out as part of the first season of the ''Buffy'' spin-off series ''Angel''. Repentant and rededicated, Faith returned as a heroine in other episodes of ''Angel'' and in the last five episodes of ''Buffy''. \n\nAs an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from legions of prisoners. She said:\n\n<blockquote>I've been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and [[death row]]. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything \u2013 disgusting things that you don't even want to know about. And they send me pictures \u2013 \"Oh, here's a picture of me before I was incarcerated!\" \u2013 and there's some guy sat on the sofa with a bottle of beer and a moustache, and a big gut. It's so creepy.

After having a grant pulled out from under her, Tru is forced to take a job at a local morgue, where she discovers her power to \"re-live\" the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' about Faith. \n\nShe has had many roles as a \"bad girl\" in movies and relishes the opportunities. In an interview with ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, \"It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't have to deal with the consequences, because it's only acting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=4046&src=fc|title=Faith No More|last=Young|first=Paul|work=Maxim|date=May 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180956/http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=4046&src=fc|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nDushku starred in an [[Off-Broadway]] production titled ''[[Dog Sees God]]'' from December 2005, playing \"Van's sister\", a character paralleled with [[Lucy Van Pelt]] from the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip on which the play production is based. {{confusing|sentence|date=March 2020}}She quit in February 2006 along with other members of the cast amid rumors of abuse by the producer, which were later dismissed\n\nShe played the lead character on ''Nurses'', a hospital comedy-drama for Fox.

The national parks of [[Scotland]] and those of [[England and Wales]] are governed by separate legislation: the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]] in Scotland and the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] for England and Wales.  For the latter, the [[Environment Act 1995]] defines the role of national parks as being: ''to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks.'' and ''to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public.'' The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the [[National Trust]]. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the [[Sandford Principle]]. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx Natural England - National Parks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518030735/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx |date=2012-05-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Legal designation==\nNational parks were first designated under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], and in England and Wales any new national park is designated under this Act, and must be confirmed by the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 [[Kinder Scout]] mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 [[white paper]] on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949|National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act]].<ref name=\"NP history\">[http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm History of the National Parks - National Parks official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421112821/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm |date=2013-04-21 }}</ref>\n\nIn England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks in the United Kingdom may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals.<ref name=\"Dartmoor\"/>\n\n==Origins and growth==\nThe first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the [[Peak District]], was designated in April 1951 under the [[Clement Attlee]] led [[Labour Government 1945\u20131951|Labour administration]], eight months before the end of King [[George VI]]'s reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated.<ref name=\"NP history\"/> The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own [[Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988|Act of Parliament in 1988]] gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]], and from this two Scottish national parks, the [[Cairngorms National Park|Cairngorms]] and [[Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park|Loch Lomond and The Trossachs]], were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the [[Association of National Park Authorities]].\n\nOf the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen [[Ceremonial counties of England|English counties]] and cover 9.3% of England,<ref name=\"fact\"/> with no national park in the southern [[English Midlands|Midlands]]. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land.<ref name=\"fact\"/> The [[Cairngorms National Park]] at {{convert|4,528|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is the largest of the national parks. Outside the Scottish Highlands, the largest is the [[Lake District National Park]] at {{convert|2,292|km2|mi2}}; the largest National Park in England and second largest in the United Kingdom. [[Snowdonia National Park]], at {{convert|2,142|km2|mi2}}, is Wales' largest national park and the third largest in the United Kingdom. The smallest national park in England and Wales, and in the United Kingdom, is [[The Broads]] at {{convert|303|km2|mi2}}.

The national parks of [[Scotland]] and those of [[England and Wales]] are governed by separate legislation: the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]] in Scotland and the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] for England and Wales.  For the latter, the [[Environment Act 1995]] defines the role of national parks as being: ''to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks.'' and ''to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public.'' The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the [[National Trust]]. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the [[Sandford Principle]]. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx Natural England - National Parks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518030735/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx |date=2012-05-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Legal designation==\nNational parks were first designated under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], and in England and Wales any new national park is designated under this Act, and must be confirmed by the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 [[Kinder Scout]] mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 [[white paper]] on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949|National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act]].<ref name=\"NP history\">[http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm History of the National Parks - National Parks official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421112821/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm |date=2013-04-21 }}</ref>\n\nIn England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks in the United Kingdom may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals.<ref name=\"Dartmoor\"/>\n\n==Origins and growth==\nThe first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the [[Peak District]], was designated in April 1951 under the [[Clement Attlee]] led [[Labour Government 1945\u20131951|Labour administration]], eight months before the end of King [[George VI]]'s reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated.<ref name=\"NP history\"/> The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own [[Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988|Act of Parliament in 1988]] gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]], and from this two Scottish national parks, the [[Cairngorms National Park|Cairngorms]] and [[Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park|Loch Lomond and The Trossachs]], were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the [[Association of National Park Authorities]].\n\nOf the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen [[Ceremonial counties of England|English counties]] and cover 9.3% of England,<ref name=\"fact\"/> with no national park in the southern [[English Midlands|Midlands]]. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land.<ref name=\"fact\"/> The [[Cairngorms National Park]] at {{convert|4,528|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is the largest of the national parks.

He worked as a carpenter for the [[Welsh National Opera]], and was the Property Master at the [[Alexandra Theatre (Birmingham)|Alexandra Theatre]] in [[Birmingham]].\n\nIn 1970 at the age of 22, he was accepted into London's [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]] (RADA) - the alma mater of actors such as [[John Gielgud]], [[Glenda Jackson]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]], but later expressed little interest in pursuing the classical route.<ref name=Wolf>Matt Wolf, 'Ben Cross Builds Stage Career Playing Americans', ''The Associated Press'' (11 May 1985).</ref>\nHe also appeared as a [[CI5]] agent in an episode of The Professionals ('Black Out' S4E2)\n\nAfter graduation from RADA, Cross performed in several stage plays at [[Duke's Playhouse]] where he was seen in ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]].'' He then joined the [[Prospect Theatre Company]] and played roles in ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', and ''[[Royal Hunt of the Sun]]''. Cross also joined the cast of the immensely popular musical ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' and played leading roles in [[Sir Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', ''Mind Your Head'', and the musical ''[[Irma La Douce]]'' \u2013 all at [[Leicester]]'s [[Haymarket Theatre (Leicester)|Haymarket Theatre]].\n\nCross's first big screen film appearance came in 1976 when he went on location to [[Deventer]], [[Netherlands]], to play Trooper Binns in [[Joseph E. Levine]]'s [[World War II]] epic ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' which starred an international cast, including [[Dirk Bogarde]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Michael Caine]] and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]].\n\nIn 1977, Cross became a member of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and performed in the premier of ''Privates on Parade'' as \"Kevin Cartwright\" and played Rover in a revival of a Restoration play titled ''Wild Oats''. Cross's path to international stardom began in 1978 with his performance in the play ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', in which he played Billy Flynn, the slick lawyer of murderess Roxie Hart.\n\n==1980s\u20131990s==\n\nDuring Cross's performance in ''Chicago'', he was recognised and recommended for a leading role in the multiple [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. For their performances in the film, Cross and his co-star [[Ian Charleson]] both won \"Most Promising Artiste of 1981\" awards from the Variety Club Awards in February 1982.<ref>Clark, Al and James Park. ''The Film Year Book 1983''. Grove, 1983. p. 156.</ref>\n\nCross's starring role in ''Chariots of Fire'' has been credited with continuing a transatlantic trend in elegant young English actors that had been set by [[Jeremy Irons]] in ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'', and was followed by [[Rupert Everett]] in ''[[Dance with a Stranger]]'', [[Rupert Graves]] in ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room With a View]]'', and [[Hugh Grant]] in ''[[Maurice (film)|Maurice]]''.<ref>Ina Warren, Canadian Press, 'Young English actor puts accent on talent' (''The Toronto Star'' (1 September 1987, E1).</ref>\n\nCross followed up ''Chariots of Fire'' with performances as a [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician, Dr Andrew Manson, struggling with the politics of the British medical system during the 1920s, in ''[[The Citadel (1983 miniseries)|The Citadel]]'', a 10-part [[BBC]] dramatisation of [[A.J. Cronin]]'s novel, and as Ashton (Ash) Pelham-Martyn, a British cavalry officer torn between two cultures in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] miniseries ''[[The Far Pavilions#Film, TV and theatrical adaptations|The Far Pavilions]]''.\n\nIn 1982, the U.S. union [[Actors' Equity]], in a landmark reversal of a previous ruling, allowed Cross to appear in [[John Guare]]'s [[off-Broadway]] play ''Lydie Breeze''. The decision was tied to a joint effort by Actors' Equity, the League of New York Theatres and the British union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] to allow British and U.S. actors unrestricted opportunities to work in both countries.<ref>'Actors Equity, in reversal of previous ruling, allows British actor Ben Cross to appear in Off-Broadway production Lydie Breeze', ''The New York Times'' (14 January 1982), p.24</ref> The agreement eventually led to regular equal exchange agreements for equivalent acting jobs between [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]].<ref>Jeremy Gerard, '2 Actors' Unions Wage Trans-Atlantic Battle', ''The New York Times'' (25 June 1987)</ref>\n\nDuring the 1984 [[Summer Olympic Games]], Cross appeared in a commercial for [[American Express]] ('Don't leave home without it') with the 87-year-old [[Jackson Scholz]], a sprinter for the 1924 American Olympic team whose character was featured in the film ''Chariots of Fire''. When Cross says something about beating Scholz, the latter remarks, \"''You'' didn't beat me!\" with mock indignation. Proving he is 'still pretty fast', Scholz beats Cross to the draw in picking up the tab with his credit card.\n\nHe subsequently replaced [[James Garner]] as the featured actor endorsing the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Spectra camera in 1986. Cross was also featured in ''[[GQ Magazine]]'' as one of the annual \"Manstyle\" winners in January, 1985 followed by a featured photo shoot in March, 1985.\n\nIn 1985, he played Barney Greenwald in a hit revival of [[Herman Wouk]]'s courtroom drama ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]], London.\n\nIn a 1985 interview the actor admitted he preferred American roles because of their emotionalism, saying of English acting: 'Over here, people hide behind mannerism and technique and don't come up with any soul. American actors are much freer with the emotions. It's pretty hard in Europe not to have experience of Americans because we're exposed to a lot of American product.'<ref name=Wolf/> Cross also said that he was sympathetic to the American dream of success: 'I am ambitious. There's no point of being ashamed of the fact that one has ambitions. Despite what a lot of people think in our profession, you can have ambitions and still turn in good work and still earn a living. There's no clash there.'<ref name=Wolf/> Cross expressed the hope that his reputation would 'span the Atlantic,' and that those in the industry would not ignore him because he did not live in [[Los Angeles]] or [[New York City]]. 'A prospective director would have to convince me that I could bring something new, fresh and exciting to a classical part that hundreds of other people have played,' he said.<ref name=Wolf/>\n\nOver the years, Cross has played [[Iraq]]i pilot Munir Redfa blackmailed into flying a MiG from Iraq to [[Israel]] in the 1988 [[HBO]] spy film ''[[Steal the Sky]]'', and in Ian Sharp's 1989 NBC-TV miniseries, ''Twist of Fate'', a German [[Nazi]] [[SS]] colonel and [[war criminal]] Helmut von Schraeder, who has his face and voice surgically changed to pose as a [[Jew]] in a concentration camp to avoid post-war capture and war crime punishment by the approaching [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], then after his liberation at the war's end by twist of fate becomes a [[Zionist]] and ends up becoming one of the [[state of Israel]]'s founders and military generals, a vampire in the 1989 [[USA Network]] film ''Nightlife'', another [[vampire]], [[Barnabas Collins]], in the 1991 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] miniseries remake of the cult classic TV soap opera, ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', Sir Harold Pearson in the 1994 [[Italy|Italian]] production \"Caro Dolce Amore (Honey Sweet Love)\", [[Solomon]] in the 1997 [[Trimark Pictures]] production [[Solomon]] and [[Captain Nemo]] in the 1997 [[CBS]] film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.\n\n==2000 to present==\nCross played Ikey Solomon in the [[Australia]]n production ''[[The Potato Factory]]'' in 2000.

I'm sure he was too busy to watch the whole of ''Species'', but when we were on the set, he mentioned to me that there was one particular shot in it where I turned to the camera, and in that moment, it came to him how perfect it would be for me to play Sarek.'<ref name=\"STMAG\">Star Trek Official Movie Magazine: Issue Number 145</ref> In order to prepare for the role, Cross drew on his experience as a parent as well as Sarek's previous on-screen appearances. Having been present when his daughter was born, he was able to 'call on all sorts of things' in the scene where Amanda has baby Spock, a scene which did not make it into the theatrical cut of the film.<ref name=\"STMAG\"/> While he found the emotionless trait of a Vulcan a challenge to play, he found the father/son relationship between Sarek and Spock easier to play. 'As Sarek, I had to be true to the Vulcan cultural ethic, which in the beginning, I found very difficult. I got a lot of help with that from J.J. Dealing with the adult Spock (played by [[Zachary Quinto]]) was a much more mature relationship, and I found the father/son aspect one of the easier things to play.'<ref name=\"STMAG\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Cross was cast as Rabbit, the main antagonist on the Cinemax original series ''[[Banshee (TV series)|Banshee]]''. Rabbit is \"a ruthless Ukrainian gangster who has been hunting down two of his former top thieves for 15 years.\"<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/star-trek-ben-cross-cinemax-banshee-alan-ball-306406 'Star Trek's' Ben Cross Joins Alan Ball's Cinemax Drama 'Banshee' | Hollywoodreporter.com]</ref>\n\n==Other professions==\nCross is a director, writer and musician. He has written music, screenplays and articles for [[English language|English-language]] publications and has written the lyrics for an album with [[Bulgaria]]n singer Vasil Petrov, which was released in late 2007. He sang two Sinatra songs with Petrov in the Apollonia Festival at the [[Black Sea]] in September 2007.\n\nAmong his works is the musical ''Rage'' about [[Ruth Ellis]], which was performed in the London area. He starred in it and played the part of the hangman.\n\nCross's first single as a lyricist was released by [[Polydor Records]] in the late 1970s and was titled ''Mickey Moonshine''. The nom de guerre for the performance had occurred to Ben when he recalled an earlier involvement with the music industry as a session singer for Decca between 1972 and 1974. At this time, he had recorded a song called 'Name it, You Got it', which achieved some play on the British [[Northern soul]] scene. Other works include ''The Best We\u2019ve Ever Had'' and ''Nearly Midnight'', both written by Cross and directed by his son Theo.\n\nIn addition, the original soundtrack for ''Nearly Midnight'' was written, produced and performed by his daughter Lauren. These works were performed in [[Edinburgh]] in 2002 and 2003 respectively.

He worked as a carpenter for the [[Welsh National Opera]], and was the Property Master at the [[Alexandra Theatre (Birmingham)|Alexandra Theatre]] in [[Birmingham]].\n\nIn 1970 at the age of 22, he was accepted into London's [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]] (RADA) - the alma mater of actors such as [[John Gielgud]], [[Glenda Jackson]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]], but later expressed little interest in pursuing the classical route.<ref name=Wolf>Matt Wolf, 'Ben Cross Builds Stage Career Playing Americans', ''The Associated Press'' (11 May 1985).</ref>\nHe also appeared as a [[CI5]] agent in an episode of The Professionals ('Black Out' S4E2)\n\nAfter graduation from RADA, Cross performed in several stage plays at [[Duke's Playhouse]] where he was seen in ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]].'' He then joined the [[Prospect Theatre Company]] and played roles in ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', and ''[[Royal Hunt of the Sun]]''. Cross also joined the cast of the immensely popular musical ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' and played leading roles in [[Sir Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', ''Mind Your Head'', and the musical ''[[Irma La Douce]]'' \u2013 all at [[Leicester]]'s [[Haymarket Theatre (Leicester)|Haymarket Theatre]].\n\nCross's first big screen film appearance came in 1976 when he went on location to [[Deventer]], [[Netherlands]], to play Trooper Binns in [[Joseph E. Levine]]'s [[World War II]] epic ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' which starred an international cast, including [[Dirk Bogarde]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Michael Caine]] and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]].\n\nIn 1977, Cross became a member of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and performed in the premier of ''Privates on Parade'' as \"Kevin Cartwright\" and played Rover in a revival of a Restoration play titled ''Wild Oats''. Cross's path to international stardom began in 1978 with his performance in the play ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', in which he played Billy Flynn, the slick lawyer of murderess Roxie Hart.\n\n==1980s\u20131990s==\n\nDuring Cross's performance in ''Chicago'', he was recognised and recommended for a leading role in the multiple [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. For their performances in the film, Cross and his co-star [[Ian Charleson]] both won \"Most Promising Artiste of 1981\" awards from the Variety Club Awards in February 1982.<ref>Clark, Al and James Park. ''The Film Year Book 1983''. Grove, 1983. p. 156.</ref>\n\nCross's starring role in ''Chariots of Fire'' has been credited with continuing a transatlantic trend in elegant young English actors that had been set by [[Jeremy Irons]] in ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'', and was followed by [[Rupert Everett]] in ''[[Dance with a Stranger]]'', [[Rupert Graves]] in ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room With a View]]'', and [[Hugh Grant]] in ''[[Maurice (film)|Maurice]]''.<ref>Ina Warren, Canadian Press, 'Young English actor puts accent on talent' (''The Toronto Star'' (1 September 1987, E1).</ref>\n\nCross followed up ''Chariots of Fire'' with performances as a [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician, Dr Andrew Manson, struggling with the politics of the British medical system during the 1920s, in ''[[The Citadel (1983 miniseries)|The Citadel]]'', a 10-part [[BBC]] dramatisation of [[A.J. Cronin]]'s novel, and as Ashton (Ash) Pelham-Martyn, a British cavalry officer torn between two cultures in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] miniseries ''[[The Far Pavilions#Film, TV and theatrical adaptations|The Far Pavilions]]''.\n\nIn 1982, the U.S. union [[Actors' Equity]], in a landmark reversal of a previous ruling, allowed Cross to appear in [[John Guare]]'s [[off-Broadway]] play ''Lydie Breeze''. The decision was tied to a joint effort by Actors' Equity, the League of New York Theatres and the British union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] to allow British and U.S. actors unrestricted opportunities to work in both countries.<ref>'Actors Equity, in reversal of previous ruling, allows British actor Ben Cross to appear in Off-Broadway production Lydie Breeze', ''The New York Times'' (14 January 1982), p.24</ref> The agreement eventually led to regular equal exchange agreements for equivalent acting jobs between [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]].<ref>Jeremy Gerard, '2 Actors' Unions Wage Trans-Atlantic Battle', ''The New York Times'' (25 June 1987)</ref>\n\nDuring the 1984 [[Summer Olympic Games]], Cross appeared in a commercial for [[American Express]] ('Don't leave home without it') with the 87-year-old [[Jackson Scholz]], a sprinter for the 1924 American Olympic team whose character was featured in the film ''Chariots of Fire''. When Cross says something about beating Scholz, the latter remarks, \"''You'' didn't beat me!\" with mock indignation. Proving he is 'still pretty fast', Scholz beats Cross to the draw in picking up the tab with his credit card.\n\nHe subsequently replaced [[James Garner]] as the featured actor endorsing the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Spectra camera in 1986. Cross was also featured in ''[[GQ Magazine]]'' as one of the annual \"Manstyle\" winners in January, 1985 followed by a featured photo shoot in March, 1985.\n\nIn 1985, he played Barney Greenwald in a hit revival of [[Herman Wouk]]'s courtroom drama ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]], London.\n\nIn a 1985 interview the actor admitted he preferred American roles because of their emotionalism, saying of English acting: 'Over here, people hide behind mannerism and technique and don't come up with any soul. American actors are much freer with the emotions. It's pretty hard in Europe not to have experience of Americans because we're exposed to a lot of American product.'<ref name=Wolf/> Cross also said that he was sympathetic to the American dream of success: 'I am ambitious. There's no point of being ashamed of the fact that one has ambitions. Despite what a lot of people think in our profession, you can have ambitions and still turn in good work and still earn a living. There's no clash there.'<ref name=Wolf/> Cross expressed the hope that his reputation would 'span the Atlantic,' and that those in the industry would not ignore him because he did not live in [[Los Angeles]] or [[New York City]]. 'A prospective director would have to convince me that I could bring something new, fresh and exciting to a classical part that hundreds of other people have played,' he said.<ref name=Wolf/>\n\nOver the years, Cross has played [[Iraq]]i pilot Munir Redfa blackmailed into flying a MiG from Iraq to [[Israel]] in the 1988 [[HBO]] spy film ''[[Steal the Sky]]'', and in Ian Sharp's 1989 NBC-TV miniseries, ''Twist of Fate'', a German [[Nazi]] [[SS]] colonel and [[war criminal]] Helmut von Schraeder, who has his face and voice surgically changed to pose as a [[Jew]] in a concentration camp to avoid post-war capture and war crime punishment by the approaching [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], then after his liberation at the war's end by twist of fate becomes a [[Zionist]] and ends up becoming one of the [[state of Israel]]'s founders and military generals, a vampire in the 1989 [[USA Network]] film ''Nightlife'', another [[vampire]], [[Barnabas Collins]], in the 1991 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] miniseries remake of the cult classic TV soap opera, ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', Sir Harold Pearson in the 1994 [[Italy|Italian]] production \"Caro Dolce Amore (Honey Sweet Love)\", [[Solomon]] in the 1997 [[Trimark Pictures]] production [[Solomon]] and [[Captain Nemo]] in the 1997 [[CBS]] film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.\n\n==2000 to present==\nCross played Ikey Solomon in the [[Australia]]n production ''[[The Potato Factory]]'' in 2000. In 2005, Cross, an anti-death penalty campaigner, starred as a death-row prisoner in Bruce Graham's play ''[[Coyote on a Fence]]'', at the [[Duchess Theatre]].<ref>'Critic's pick; Theatre', ''The Times'' (24 April 2004), p. 39.</ref> He played [[Rudolf Hess]] in the 2006 [[BBC]] production ''[[Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial]]''.\n\nIn November 2007, Cross was cast in the role of [[Sarek]], in the then-new ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film directed and produced by [[J.J.

I'm sure he was too busy to watch the whole of ''Species'', but when we were on the set, he mentioned to me that there was one particular shot in it where I turned to the camera, and in that moment, it came to him how perfect it would be for me to play Sarek.'<ref name=\"STMAG\">Star Trek Official Movie Magazine: Issue Number 145</ref> In order to prepare for the role, Cross drew on his experience as a parent as well as Sarek's previous on-screen appearances. Having been present when his daughter was born, he was able to 'call on all sorts of things' in the scene where Amanda has baby Spock, a scene which did not make it into the theatrical cut of the film.<ref name=\"STMAG\"/> While he found the emotionless trait of a Vulcan a challenge to play, he found the father/son relationship between Sarek and Spock easier to play. 'As Sarek, I had to be true to the Vulcan cultural ethic, which in the beginning, I found very difficult. I got a lot of help with that from J.J. Dealing with the adult Spock (played by [[Zachary Quinto]]) was a much more mature relationship, and I found the father/son aspect one of the easier things to play.'<ref name=\"STMAG\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Cross was cast as Rabbit, the main antagonist on the Cinemax original series ''[[Banshee (TV series)|Banshee]]''. Rabbit is \"a ruthless Ukrainian gangster who has been hunting down two of his former top thieves for 15 years.\"<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/star-trek-ben-cross-cinemax-banshee-alan-ball-306406 'Star Trek's' Ben Cross Joins Alan Ball's Cinemax Drama 'Banshee' | Hollywoodreporter.com]</ref>\n\n==Other professions==\nCross is a director, writer and musician. He has written music, screenplays and articles for [[English language|English-language]] publications and has written the lyrics for an album with [[Bulgaria]]n singer Vasil Petrov, which was released in late 2007. He sang two Sinatra songs with Petrov in the Apollonia Festival at the [[Black Sea]] in September 2007.\n\nAmong his works is the musical ''Rage'' about [[Ruth Ellis]], which was performed in the London area. He starred in it and played the part of the hangman.\n\nCross's first single as a lyricist was released by [[Polydor Records]] in the late 1970s and was titled ''Mickey Moonshine''. The nom de guerre for the performance had occurred to Ben when he recalled an earlier involvement with the music industry as a session singer for Decca between 1972 and 1974. At this time, he had recorded a song called 'Name it, You Got it', which achieved some play on the British [[Northern soul]] scene. Other works include ''The Best We\u2019ve Ever Had'' and ''Nearly Midnight'', both written by Cross and directed by his son Theo.\n\nIn addition, the original soundtrack for ''Nearly Midnight'' was written, produced and performed by his daughter Lauren. These works were performed in [[Edinburgh]] in 2002 and 2003 respectively. ''Square One'', directed by Cross, was performed at the [[Etcetera Theatre]] in London in 2004.\n\n==Personal life==\nCross has lived in London, [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], southern [[Spain]], [[Vienna]], and most recently,{{When|date=January 2013}} [[Sofia, Bulgaria|Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]].\n\nHe has been married three times: first to Penny, from 1977 to 1992, with whom he has two children; then to Michelle until 2005, and on 18 August 2018 wearing Bulgarian folk dress, a traditional wedding in front of many thousands spectators during the folklore festival in Zheravna, Bulgaria to the Bulgarian Deyana.

It was founded in 1998, in Tranaquepe, [[Chile]], and is responsible for land occupation in the zones of  [[Tir\u00faa]], [[Contulmo]], [[Ca\u00f1ete, Chile|Ca\u00f1ete]] and Temucuicui. Protesters from Mapuche communities have used these tactics against multinational forestry corporations and private individuals.\n\nSeveral of its members have been judged under [[anti-terrorist law]]s left from the [[Chile under Pinochet|Pinochet era]] because of their violent behaviors. CAM arose from the [[Mapuche conflict]] that was revitalized in the late 1990s with the rise of ecologism, and the revindication of [[indigenismo]] by politicians of the [[Concertaci\u00f3n]]. The land rights claimed by CAM can in many cases be traced back to the [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda]] in the 1870s and 1880s a period during which many Chileans and foreign settlers acquired lands in Araucan\u00eda.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1996, some Mapuche communities formed the Lafkenche Territorial Coordinator. In 1998, the conflict of Traigu\u00e9n arose followed by the later realization of a meeting of communities and a [[Guillat\u00fan]]. In this meeting the communities in conflict of Arauco and Lumaco participated, the Mapuche Coordinator of Santiago and the Mapuche Organization Meli Wixan Mapu of Santiago. Leaders from communities of Collipulli also joined. During this meeting, the idea of a new meeting in Tranaquepe was raised, only with the Mapuche communities in conflict. In a moment of the meeting, the idea of forming the Coordinadora that they named \"Mapuche Coordinator of Communities in Conflict Arauco Malleco\" arose. \n\nThe first attack perpetrated by the group was the 1st of December 1997, when in the area of Lumaco, three trucks belonging to the company Forestal Arauco were intercepted by community members who would later be known as members of the CAM.This action created a new subjectivity in the Mapuche militancy, modifying its way of doing politics, detonating in a conflict against the security forces. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nodo50.org/weftun/publicacion/kom2.htm#2|title=kom2|website=www.nodo50.org|access-date=2019-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pairic\u00e1n Padilla|first=Fernando|last2=\u00c1lvarez Vallejos|first2=Rolando|date=2011|title=La Nueva Guerra de Arauco: la Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco y los nuevos movimientos de resistencia mapuche en el Chile de la Concertaci\u00f3n (1997-2009)|url=http://www.redalyc.org/resumen.oa?id=360133450004|journal=Revista Izquierdas|issue=10}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian [[Jorge Pinto Rodr\u00edguez]], the organization is the entity that up to 2017 has led the most violent mobilization of the Mapuche people: \"He has claimed the figure of the warrior or weichafe -in [[Mapuche language|Mapudungun]]-,\" he said.
