David becomes popular, which makes Saul fear him and plot his death. David and Saul's daughter [[Michal]] wish to marry, and Saul asks for a dowry of one hundred foreskins of the Philistines. David delivers two hundred, and becomes the king's son-in-law (1 Samuel 18). Saul again wishes David dead, but they are reconciled by Saul's son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].\n\nWar comes again, David is victorious. Saul again wants to kill David, and he flees with help from his wife. Saul searches for him and slays the inhabitants of the city [[Nob, Israel|Nob]] for aiding David (1 Samuel 22). David defeats the Philistines at [[Keilah]], then flees the city pursued by Saul (1 Samuel 22). David and Saul reconcile. David seeks refuge with [[Achish]], king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], and claims he is raiding Judah but is actually raiding and killing in other places (1 Samuel 27). The Philistines begins a war against Saul. David's wives [[Ahinoam]] and [[Abigail]] are taken in a raid on [[Ziklag]], but he rescue them (1 Samuel 30). The men of Israel flee before the Philistines, and three of Saul's sons are slain. Saul asks his armour-bearer to kill him, but is refused, so he takes his own life. The armour-bearer also takes his own life. Saul's body is beheaded and fastened to a city-wall by the victorious Philistines, but it is retaken by inhabitants of [[Jabesh-Gilead]] (1 Samuel 31).\n\nA man tells David of Saul's death and that he himself killed Saul. David has him killed (2 Samuel 1). A long war starts between David and Saul's son [[Ish-bosheth]] (2 Samuel 3). David demands and is granted the return of his first wife Michal, despite the public grief of her new husband [[Palti, son of Laish|Palti]]. Two men assassinate Ish-bosheth, and David has them killed (2 Samuel 4). David wars victoriously with the Philistines. While transporting the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a man called [[Uzzah]] carelessly touches it and is killed by God (2 Samuel 6).\n\nDavid defeats and plunder several enemies, and \"executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.\" (2 Samuel 8). [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|The children of Ammon]] mistreat David's emissaries, and is defeated by his army (2 Samuel 10).\n\nIn order to make [[Bathsheba]] his wife, David successfully plots the death of [[Uriah the Hittite|her husband]]. This displeases God, and David is told that \"the sword shall never depart from thy house.\" God kills David's and Bathsheba's child, that was conceived during her previous marriage. She then gives birth to [[Solomon]].  David conquers and plunders the city [[Rabbah]] (2 Samuel 11-12).\n\nDavid's son [[Amnon]] rapes his half-sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]]. [[Absalom]], her full brother, in return has him killed (2 Samuel 13). Absalom conspires and revolts against David. Absalom is finally defeated and dies in the [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim]], and David mourns him (2 Samuel 15-19). [[Sheba son of Bichri]] revolts, but is ultimately beheaded (2 Samuel 20).\n\nIn 2 Samuel 21, David has seven of Sauls sons and grandsons killed, including \"the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul\", though he spares Sauls grandson [[Mephibosheth]].

And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|32\u201333}}  Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes:  \"It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded.  Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|27}}\n\n[[Regina Schwartz]] is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote:  \"The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the \"Old Testament,\" vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the \"New Testament,\" vast numbers are colonized (converted).  The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude).<ref name=\"Regina Schwartz\">{{cite book | last =Schwartz | first =Regina | title = The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism | url =https://archive.org/details/curseofcainviole00schw | url-access =registration | publisher = the University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Ill | year = 1997 }}</ref>{{rp|18\u201319}} Near the end of her book, she wrote:  \"My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity.

The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity\u2014the one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so.<ref name=geller>{{cite book|last1=Geller|first1=Stephen A.|title=Sacred enigmas : literary religion in the Hebrew Bible|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0415127714|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>{{rp|32-22}}  Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the [[Day of Atonement]] when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness.  In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of [[Nadab and Abihu]] when God refused their \"strange offering\" and consumed them with fire.<ref name=geller/>{{rp|32-22}} One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in [[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]: \"Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies\u2019 straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets.

That is the center of Christian faith. All the rest turns on this. A curious consequence of this confession is that simply because Christians are Christians they inevitably adopt some specific posture toward the Jewish people, a posture that is always theological and practical at once....The question, then, has never been whether Christians should speak and act with reference to the Jewish people. Rather, the question has been how they should do so, and how what they would say and do would affect the existence of the Jewish people. For most of the past two millennia, the church's posture toward the Jewish people has come to expression in the teaching known as supersessionism, also known as the theology of displacement.... In the early nineteenth century, some progressive Christian theologians carried the idea of supersessionism to a new level. According to them, the God of Jesus Christ was not revealed by the Hebrew Bible at all, and therefore had never entered into a special relationship with the Jewish people in the first place.}}</ref>\n\n==Sociological reflections and responses==\n\nJo\u017ee Kra\u0161ovec described the [[ancient near east]]ern (ANE) context in which the stories and text of the Hebrew Bible originated, in which gods were identified with peoples, and the flourishing or destruction of a people were a reflection of the power of its god or gods; while the ancient Israelites conceived of its deity as one person in contrast to the polytheistic conception of its neighbors, it remained like other ANE peoples in considering itself as a whole in relationship with its god.

And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|32\u201333}}  Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes:  \"It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded.  Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations.\"<ref name=Collins/>{{rp|27}}\n\n[[Regina Schwartz]] is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote:  \"The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the \"Old Testament,\" vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the \"New Testament,\" vast numbers are colonized (converted).  The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude).<ref name=\"Regina Schwartz\">{{cite book | last =Schwartz | first =Regina | title = The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism | url =https://archive.org/details/curseofcainviole00schw | url-access =registration | publisher = the University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Ill | year = 1997 }}</ref>{{rp|18\u201319}} Near the end of her book, she wrote:  \"My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity.

The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity\u2014the one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so.<ref name=geller>{{cite book|last1=Geller|first1=Stephen A.|title=Sacred enigmas : literary religion in the Hebrew Bible|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0415127714|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>{{rp|32-22}}  Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the [[Day of Atonement]] when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness.  In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of [[Nadab and Abihu]] when God refused their \"strange offering\" and consumed them with fire.<ref name=geller/>{{rp|32-22}} One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in [[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]: \"Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning.

The issue of religious violence in canonical gospel, epistle, Apocalypse, and Acts alike has been underscrutinized in general, and\u2014rather more inexplicably\u2014neglected even in studies devoted specifically to violence \"in the Bible.\" For example, a recent edition of Religious Studies News, an Internet journal of the Society of Biblical Literature, advertises itself as a feature on violence in the Bible, yet articles focus with virtual singularity on Hebrew Bible texts and Hebrew Bible atrocities.... But by raising questions only about Hebrew texts, this issue performs a sort of violence of its own\u2014the \"real\" problem lies in the \"Jewish\" texts, not in the Christian Testament....More troubling than studies of violence in the Bible that ignore the New Testament are those that lift up the New Testament as somehow containing the antidote for Old Testament violence.

That is the center of Christian faith. All the rest turns on this. A curious consequence of this confession is that simply because Christians are Christians they inevitably adopt some specific posture toward the Jewish people, a posture that is always theological and practical at once....The question, then, has never been whether Christians should speak and act with reference to the Jewish people. Rather, the question has been how they should do so, and how what they would say and do would affect the existence of the Jewish people. For most of the past two millennia, the church's posture toward the Jewish people has come to expression in the teaching known as supersessionism, also known as the theology of displacement.... In the early nineteenth century, some progressive Christian theologians carried the idea of supersessionism to a new level. According to them, the God of Jesus Christ was not revealed by the Hebrew Bible at all, and therefore had never entered into a special relationship with the Jewish people in the first place.}}</ref>\n\n==Sociological reflections and responses==\n\nJo\u017ee Kra\u0161ovec described the [[ancient near east]]ern (ANE) context in which the stories and text of the Hebrew Bible originated, in which gods were identified with peoples, and the flourishing or destruction of a people were a reflection of the power of its god or gods; while the ancient Israelites conceived of its deity as one person in contrast to the polytheistic conception of its neighbors, it remained like other ANE peoples in considering itself as a whole in relationship with its god.

Fourth, genocide and mass slaughter follow in the Book of Joshua.  These highly dubious traditions of the Bible have been kept before subsequent generations of Jews and Christians in their prayers\u2026.

In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, there is a dominant strand that sees God as ethnocentric and militaristic.

Later in the days of the Israelite kingdoms, they are urged to show no pity, but to massacre their enemies\u2026.

It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God.  Here, for example, is [[Shlomo Aviner]], a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim \u2026 movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites.  There is only one catch.  The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'.

In the 1950s, Reverend Father [[Patrick Peyton|Fr. Patrick Peyton]], CSC came to the Philippines upon the invitation of the Dominican Fathers, or [[Order of Preachers]], to conduct and speak on his worldwide efforts to promote the praying of the Family Rosary all over the world. Father Peyton was warmly welcomed in the Philippines and from thereon, his mission has grown and expanded all over the country. Father Peyton died in 1992, but his mission in the Philippines continues to date with programs airing in various radio and television networks.\n\n==History==\n===Distant collaborations===\nThe promotion of the Family Rosary through the use of mass media was intensely pursued by Father Peyton in the United States in the late 1940s, viewed by many as an important step of healing families whose loved ones were lost in the intense fighting during the Second World War. In 1947, Father Peyton with the volunteer help from Hollywood's named stars, dramatizations of family life centered on praying the Rosary were being aired on the United States radio network, Mutual Broadcasting System.\n\nIn 1947, a [[Jesuit]] priest, Rev. Father [[James B. Reuter]], SJ who was in the United States submitted a radio drama play to Father Peyton and was used on the \"Family Theater\" programs that was aired on Mutual Broadcasting System. Father Reuter, a priest who was assigned to the Philippines before the Second World War and was among those severely treated while in Japanese prison camp returned to Manila in 1948.\n\nFather Reuter launched a Philippine version of the \"Family Theater\" on radio station KZPI (now known as [[DWIZ]]) with named Filipino actors and actresses voicing the radio drama scripts that Father Peyton used in the United States. The program would air every Sunday evening when every family member was at home.\n\nWith the advent of television in the Philippines, \"Family Theater\" on television were among the first programs that aired on the country's first television station, DZAQ owned by the Alto Broadcasting System, co-owned by a retired American war veteran communications engineer [[James Lindenberg]] and [[Antonio Quirino]], brother of the incumbent Philippine president of that time, [[Elpidio Quirino]].\n\nFather Peyton first got to visit the Philippines in 1953, a few years since his mission was introduced to the Philippines by Father Reuter, his efforts to promote the praying of the Family Rosary have started to take roots in the Philippines and by the time he even started some of his famous Rosary rallies in the country, Father Peyton was already a household name in radio and television.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Eugenio Lopez, Sr.|Eugenio Lopez]]'s Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) acquired Alto Broadcasting System to establish what would be the most important television network in the Philippines all throughout the 1960s. [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] brought in \"Family Theater\" into its prime time programming in the 1960s.\n\nNamed Filipino actors and actresses including unknown ones who would later become entertainment icons worked with Father Reuter's \"Family Theater\" productions for free. At first \"Family Theater\" was airing for free on Channel 3 (later Channel 2 in 1969) of ABS-CBN but later the group was asked to bring advertising into the network, and when the call was made, people continued to donate to keep the program airing.\n\nFilipino named celebrities Vic Diaz, Celia Diaz-Laurel, Barbara Perez, Vic Silayan, Pancho Magalona, Tita Duran, Jaime Zobel de Ayala, Zenaida Amador, Baby Barredo, Noel Trinidad, Subas Herrero, Robert Arevalo, Cristina Ponce-Enrile, Patsy Monzon were among those who appeared on Family Theater. Jaime Zobel de Ayala would later become chairman of a Filipino banking, real estate and telecommunications holding company, Ayala group. Zeneida Amador and Baby Barredo would later establish the country's highly respected theater group, [[Repertory Philippines.]]\n\n===The Blanket of Darkness===\n[[Image:family theater philippines.gif|200px|thumb|right|Scene from Family Theater in the Philippines with a young Filipino business industrialist [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala]] as lead actor.]]\n\nIn 1972, Former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared Martial Law and all forms of media were silenced. ABS-CBN was shut down under the Marcos regime and all \"Family Theater\" programs both on television and radio ceased to broadcast.\n\nOn December 8, 1985, Father Peyton led a very successful Marian Rally at Rizal Park. Amidst the political turmoil affecting the country at that time, the call to prayer and world peace brought more than a million Filipinos before the Quirino Grandstand. The rally, with the support of Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]], consecrated the Philippines to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Filipinos were incensed with prayers and strengthened faith, later to serve as the inspiration to peacefully overthrow the Marcos dictatorship two months later.\n\nIn 1985, months before the Marian Rally, Father Peyton would kindly seek permission to promote the scheduled rally on various media outlets in the Philippines who were all subject to censorship or were under the control of Marcos cronies. Father Peyton would finally appear on the government television station, Maharlika Broadcasting System Channel 4 for a series of talks on the Marian Rally and the importance of prayers. This television appearance would later result in the newer incarnation of Father Peyton's mission in Philippine broadcast history a year later.\n\nWith the peaceful overthrow of Marcos in 1986, with a renewed faith spreading like wildfire in the Philippines, seeing millions of Filipinos muzzling the guns of soldiers loyal to Marcos by flowers and Rosaries and with a new president, [[Corazon Aquino]] leading a nation in praying the Rosary, the mission of Father Peyton started to bloom again in the Philippines. When ABS-CBN reopened after six months, Father Reuter revived \"Family Theater\" under a new title \"Ang Pamilya Ko,\" (My Family) but it would only run on ABS-CBN for thirteen weeks until it was canceled.\n\n===From drama to magazine talk show===\nWith democracy restored in the Philippines and there was an intense feel of faith in the air, Father Peyton saw the possibilities of developing a different type of program for the Philippines. After the poor reception to the timely wholesome family-centered drama program \"Ang Pamilya Ko\" on ABS-CBN, Father Peyton started launching his one-hour once a week magazine talk show program.\n\n\"Family Rosary Crusade,\" was premiered on March 7, 1987 for the relaunch of ABS-CBN as The Star Network.\n\nEvery Saturday morning, Father Peyton would be on ABS-CBN to start the program with the praying of the Rosary. He would be later joined by a long-time advertising practitioner, Rosita \"Babs\" Hontiveros or \"Tita Babs\" (Auntie Babs) as the co-host. For almost five years, the program continued to air until the death of Father Peyton in June 1992.\n\n===FRC after the death of Father Peyton===\nDespite the death of Father Peyton in 1992, the weekly television program \"Family Rosary Crusade,\" continues to air on ABS-CBN with Babs Hontiveros as main host with Father James Reuter, SJ. Behind the scenes, a group of media volunteers continue to lend a hand in continuing with the mission of Father Peyton, utilizing mass media as a handy tool for evangelization and the promotion of the praying of the Family Rosary.\n\nFamily Rosary Crusade was being run by Gennie Q. Jota who served as Executive Director and ably recruited volunteers to write, contribute almost anything to keep the program running. Veteran sound engineer, Beda Orquejo who was met by Father Peyton at the old government television network under Marcos' time left his regular work with the network to serve as all-around technical person. Orquejo would serve as director, cameraman and editor of the weekly episodes of Family Rosary Crusade.\n\nSeveral television networks also sought programs of Family Rosary Crusade, aired for with free airtime and without advertisements. From 1992 up to 2002, Family Rosary Crusade had almost 40 hours of free airtime to fill for television networks like People's Television (PTV), Radio Philippines Network (RPN), Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC), Rajah Broadcasting (RJTV). Family Rosary Crusade's locally produced programs and a library of films produced by Family Theater in the United States aired throughout this period.\n\nIn 1992, the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC) resumed its broadcast operations after it was shut down by martial law in 1972. The television network became a semi-official carrier for Family Rosary Crusade. The network utilized as part of its station identification at the top of every hour a plug wherein the Blessed Virgin Mary speaking before Filipinos appealing to pray the Rosary and with the closing standard slogan, \"[[The family that prays together stays together]].\" The plug ran on ABC from the reopening to the relaunching as Iba Tayo in 2004 after businessman Tonyboy Cojuangco purchased the network.\n\nWith more airtime, means more original programs to produce and this called in for more volunteers.\n\nMrs. Jota and Beda Orquejo recruited several personalities to appear on Family Rosary Crusade. Dominican priest Father Larry Faraon, OP joined Family Rosary Crusade as a younger voice for inspiration for the younger audience. Younger hosts would join Father Larry, Loudette Zaragosa Banson who appeared on Father Reuter's drama programs will be joined by radio drama personality Bernard Factor-Ca\u00f1aberal as the two main hosts of the magazine talk show Family Rosary Crusade. Inspirational motivator Claudine Zialcita would later join the three other hosts to become the news reader for a segment called, \"Religious Update.\"\n\nFather James Reuter, SJ will have his own daily program on ABC called, \"Three Minutes a Day\" that aired at 3:00 pm for three minutes. Father Reuter would reflect on the day's Gospel reading.\n\nWhen ABS-CBN launched a sister station [[Studio 23]] in 1996, the program aired in every weekday morning for 30 minutes just before the simulcast of [[MTV Asia]] and later [[Myx]]. ABS-CBN's flagship Channel 2 would continue to air it until 2003 when Studio 23 continues to air the program, airing at 7:00 am every Sunday. The program continues with its magazine type programming with talks and discussions related to themes of the Catholic Church with sole host Bernard Ca\u00f1aberal and supported by Claudine Zialcita, Ces Datu and guest priest [[Gospel]] homilist.\n\nIn March 2010, Family Rosary Crusade gets a new National Director, a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross from the South Asia province, Reverend Father Roque D'Acosta, CSC, formerly a Spiritual Director for the FRC for two years. The Family Rosary Crusade also left its 50-year office in Pope Pius XII Catholic Center in the [[Archdiocese of Manila]] and moved to a formation house/television studio in Loyola Heights, Quezon City within the recently created [[Diocese of Cubao]]. The new office serves as its studios and production facilities and formation house for future members of the mission of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] in the Philippines.\n\nOn January 19, 2014, after [[Studio 23]] reformatted as [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], Family Rosary Crusade continues to air every Saturday Morning at 5:00 AM.\n\nOn November 18, 2018, Family Rosary Crusade aired its last episode on National TV. Due to S+A's daily sports programs, Family Rosary Crusade is no longer to air their episodes and lost its go signal to air. But they are still premiering their episodes through social media on [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]]. Later On April 26, 2020 the Family Rosary Crusade returns to air on National TV after 1 year hiatus and currently broadcast on ABS-CBN 2 PTV 4 5 and IBC 13.\n\n==Current programming==\nOn the 21st anniversary of the program incarnation of Family Rosary Crusade on television, long-time guest host Rev. Fr. Erick Santos, of the Archdiocese of Manila and parish priest of the Shrine of the Child Jesus in the poor district of Tondo in Manila joins the FRC program as its main host on March 14, 2010 replacing long-time host Bernard Ca\u00f1aberal.\n\nThe program continues with its magazine type programming with talks and discussions related to themes of the Catholic Church.\n\n==Hosts==\n[[Image:Fr erick santos family rosary crusade.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rev.

In the 1950s, Reverend Father [[Patrick Peyton|Fr. Patrick Peyton]], CSC came to the Philippines upon the invitation of the Dominican Fathers, or [[Order of Preachers]], to conduct and speak on his worldwide efforts to promote the praying of the Family Rosary all over the world. Father Peyton was warmly welcomed in the Philippines and from thereon, his mission has grown and expanded all over the country. Father Peyton died in 1992, but his mission in the Philippines continues to date with programs airing in various radio and television networks.\n\n==History==\n===Distant collaborations===\nThe promotion of the Family Rosary through the use of mass media was intensely pursued by Father Peyton in the United States in the late 1940s, viewed by many as an important step of healing families whose loved ones were lost in the intense fighting during the Second World War. In 1947, Father Peyton with the volunteer help from Hollywood's named stars, dramatizations of family life centered on praying the Rosary were being aired on the United States radio network, Mutual Broadcasting System.\n\nIn 1947, a [[Jesuit]] priest, Rev. Father [[James B. Reuter]], SJ who was in the United States submitted a radio drama play to Father Peyton and was used on the \"Family Theater\" programs that was aired on Mutual Broadcasting System. Father Reuter, a priest who was assigned to the Philippines before the Second World War and was among those severely treated while in Japanese prison camp returned to Manila in 1948.\n\nFather Reuter launched a Philippine version of the \"Family Theater\" on radio station KZPI (now known as [[DWIZ]]) with named Filipino actors and actresses voicing the radio drama scripts that Father Peyton used in the United States. The program would air every Sunday evening when every family member was at home.\n\nWith the advent of television in the Philippines, \"Family Theater\" on television were among the first programs that aired on the country's first television station, DZAQ owned by the Alto Broadcasting System, co-owned by a retired American war veteran communications engineer [[James Lindenberg]] and [[Antonio Quirino]], brother of the incumbent Philippine president of that time, [[Elpidio Quirino]].\n\nFather Peyton first got to visit the Philippines in 1953, a few years since his mission was introduced to the Philippines by Father Reuter, his efforts to promote the praying of the Family Rosary have started to take roots in the Philippines and by the time he even started some of his famous Rosary rallies in the country, Father Peyton was already a household name in radio and television.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Eugenio Lopez, Sr.|Eugenio Lopez]]'s Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) acquired Alto Broadcasting System to establish what would be the most important television network in the Philippines all throughout the 1960s. [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] brought in \"Family Theater\" into its prime time programming in the 1960s.\n\nNamed Filipino actors and actresses including unknown ones who would later become entertainment icons worked with Father Reuter's \"Family Theater\" productions for free. At first \"Family Theater\" was airing for free on Channel 3 (later Channel 2 in 1969) of ABS-CBN but later the group was asked to bring advertising into the network, and when the call was made, people continued to donate to keep the program airing.\n\nFilipino named celebrities Vic Diaz, Celia Diaz-Laurel, Barbara Perez, Vic Silayan, Pancho Magalona, Tita Duran, Jaime Zobel de Ayala, Zenaida Amador, Baby Barredo, Noel Trinidad, Subas Herrero, Robert Arevalo, Cristina Ponce-Enrile, Patsy Monzon were among those who appeared on Family Theater. Jaime Zobel de Ayala would later become chairman of a Filipino banking, real estate and telecommunications holding company, Ayala group. Zeneida Amador and Baby Barredo would later establish the country's highly respected theater group, [[Repertory Philippines.]]\n\n===The Blanket of Darkness===\n[[Image:family theater philippines.gif|200px|thumb|right|Scene from Family Theater in the Philippines with a young Filipino business industrialist [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala]] as lead actor.]]\n\nIn 1972, Former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared Martial Law and all forms of media were silenced. ABS-CBN was shut down under the Marcos regime and all \"Family Theater\" programs both on television and radio ceased to broadcast.\n\nOn December 8, 1985, Father Peyton led a very successful Marian Rally at Rizal Park. Amidst the political turmoil affecting the country at that time, the call to prayer and world peace brought more than a million Filipinos before the Quirino Grandstand. The rally, with the support of Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]], consecrated the Philippines to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Filipinos were incensed with prayers and strengthened faith, later to serve as the inspiration to peacefully overthrow the Marcos dictatorship two months later.\n\nIn 1985, months before the Marian Rally, Father Peyton would kindly seek permission to promote the scheduled rally on various media outlets in the Philippines who were all subject to censorship or were under the control of Marcos cronies. Father Peyton would finally appear on the government television station, Maharlika Broadcasting System Channel 4 for a series of talks on the Marian Rally and the importance of prayers. This television appearance would later result in the newer incarnation of Father Peyton's mission in Philippine broadcast history a year later.\n\nWith the peaceful overthrow of Marcos in 1986, with a renewed faith spreading like wildfire in the Philippines, seeing millions of Filipinos muzzling the guns of soldiers loyal to Marcos by flowers and Rosaries and with a new president, [[Corazon Aquino]] leading a nation in praying the Rosary, the mission of Father Peyton started to bloom again in the Philippines. When ABS-CBN reopened after six months, Father Reuter revived \"Family Theater\" under a new title \"Ang Pamilya Ko,\" (My Family) but it would only run on ABS-CBN for thirteen weeks until it was canceled.\n\n===From drama to magazine talk show===\nWith democracy restored in the Philippines and there was an intense feel of faith in the air, Father Peyton saw the possibilities of developing a different type of program for the Philippines. After the poor reception to the timely wholesome family-centered drama program \"Ang Pamilya Ko\" on ABS-CBN, Father Peyton started launching his one-hour once a week magazine talk show program.\n\n\"Family Rosary Crusade,\" was premiered on March 7, 1987 for the relaunch of ABS-CBN as The Star Network.\n\nEvery Saturday morning, Father Peyton would be on ABS-CBN to start the program with the praying of the Rosary. He would be later joined by a long-time advertising practitioner, Rosita \"Babs\" Hontiveros or \"Tita Babs\" (Auntie Babs) as the co-host. For almost five years, the program continued to air until the death of Father Peyton in June 1992.\n\n===FRC after the death of Father Peyton===\nDespite the death of Father Peyton in 1992, the weekly television program \"Family Rosary Crusade,\" continues to air on ABS-CBN with Babs Hontiveros as main host with Father James Reuter, SJ.

In addition to three British Royal Charters issued for [[East Jersey]], [[West Jersey]] and united New Jersey while they were still colonies, the state has been governed by three constitutions. The first was issued on July 2, 1776, shortly before New Jersey ratified the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the second was issued in 1844. The current document was issued in 1947 and has been amended several times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/stile-is-sweeney-reshaping-jersey-s-bedrock-1.1526981|title=North Jersey|author=|date=|website=North Jersey|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe state constitution reinforces the basic rights found in the [[United States Constitution]], but also contains several unique provisions, such as regulations governing the operation of casinos.

The first was the [[Concession and Agreement]], which was written in 1665 by the colony's proprietors [[Lord John Berkeley]] and [[Sir George Carteret]], and included a provision granting religious freedom. After Berkeley and Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers, the colony was split into [[West Jersey|West]] and [[East Jersey]]. Each had its own constitution: the [[History of the New Jersey State Constitution#West Jersey Constitution|West Jersey Constitution]] (1681) and the [[History of the New Jersey State Constitution#East Jersey Constitution|East Jersey Constitution]] (1683).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj08.htm|title=Province of West New-Jersey, in America, The 25th of the Ninth Month Called November|accessdate=2006-12-17|author=Avalon Project|publisher=Yale Law School|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102120721/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj08.htm|archive-date=2007-01-02|url-status=dead}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj10.htm|title=The Fundamental Constitutions for the Province of East New Jersey in America, Anno Domini 1683|accessdate=2006-12-17|author=Avalon Project|publisher=Yale Law School|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205053838/http://yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj10.htm|archive-date=2006-12-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The two were reunited in 1702 by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nNew Jersey's first state constitution was adopted on July 2, 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] was underway and [[George Washington]] had recently been defeated in [[New York (state)|New York]], putting [[New Jersey]] in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective was to provide a basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.state.nj.us/njfacts/njdoc10.htm|title=The New Jersey Constitution of 1776| accessdate=2006-12-17 }}</ref>\n\nAmong other provisions, it granted unmarried women and blacks who met property requirements the [[suffrage|right to vote]]. It did not specify an amendment procedure and had to be replaced entirely in a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].\n\nThe [[1844 New Jersey Constitution|succeeding constitution]], adopted on June 29, 1844, restricted suffrage to white males. It [[separation of powers|separated the government's powers]] into judicial, legislative, and executive branches and granted the people (as opposed to the legislature) the ability to elect a governor. It also formally limited state debt, a predecessor of many contemporary \"debt ceiling\" clauses.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.state.nj.us/hangout_nj/government.html|accessdate=2006-11-14|title= State Government - State Constitution}}</ref> The constitution was amended in 1875,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.camlaw.rutgers.edu/statecon/njtaxconvpapers/report4.pdf|title= The New Jersey State Constitution and Taxing, Spending, and Borrowing|accessdate=2006-11-14 |author1=Williams, Robert F.  |author2=Tarr, G.

The rights discussed in this Article largely mirror the [[Constitution of the United States]]. Such rights include [[freedom of speech]], a [[speedy trial|speedy]] and [[public trial]], and religious freedom.<ref>Article I, Section I; first entry, Paragraph 6; second entry, Paragraph 9; third entry, Paragraphs 3 and 4</ref> Article I also contains a [[Victims' Rights Amendment|Victims' Bill of Rights]].<ref>Article I, Section I, Paragraph 22</ref> The article is a de facto enumeration of the rights of the common man; ''Article I, Section I, Paragraph 21'' deliberately states: \n\n{{quote|21. This enumeration of rights shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the people. }}\n\nThis Article is similar to the U.S. Constitution's enumeration of rights. Similar to the [[Bill of Rights (United States)|U.S. Bill of Rights]], the document also still has \"holdover\" rights, or rights left over from fear of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. These passages still do guarantee important rights to New Jerseyans, but violations are not necessarily common. Such rights include:\n\n{{quote|11. No person shall, after acquittal, be tried for the same offense. All persons shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for capital offenses when the proof is evident or presumption great...\n16. No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner; nor in time of war, except in a manner prescribed by law.}}\n\n=== \"Elections and Suffrage\" ===\n[[File:NJ 109th congressional districts shaded by party.png|thumb|right|The New Jersey Districts as of 2001.]]\nArticle II lays out dates for elections of the [[Governor]], the [[Lieutenant Governor]], and members of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].<ref>Article II, Section I, Paragraphs 1 to 3</ref> It establishes the qualifications necessary for voting and states the right of suffrage may be removed from certain convicted criminals. The process of absentee balloting is instituted, as well as the structure of voting by people currently in [[military]] service. The [[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]] is established, and the distribution of selection of its 13 members is discussed, who are to represent the \"geographic, ethnic and racial diversity\" of the state.<ref>Article II, Section II</ref> The method of appointment of New Jersey Redistricting Commission members ensures the minority party which lost the general election prior to the census will have the upper hand in redistricting the state. Along with the other 12 appointed members, there is one \"independent\" member, who is to not have held office within the past five years. He is chosen by the other twelve members, yet is automatically the chairman of the Commission. On the occasion that the twelve members may not reach a decision, the Commission picks two (which assumes there are two dominant parties which have their favorites) and sends them to the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]. A majority of the court (4 of 7) then picks the one that \"by education and occupational experience, by prior public service in government or otherwise, and by demonstrated ability to represent the best interest of the people of this State.\"\n\n=== \"Distribution of the Powers of Government\" ===\nThe sole content of Article III is the statement regarding [[separation of powers]]. The three branches ([[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Judiciary|judicial]], and [[Legislature|legislative]]) are created and defined. No individual can be affiliated with more than one unless the Constitution explicitly allows it.<ref>Article III</ref> Before the constitution was amended, a vacancy in the [[Governor of New Jersey]] would be filled by the president of the [[New Jersey Senate]], who would retain their Senate seat.\n\n=== \"Legislative\" ===\nArticle IV establishes the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[New Jersey Legislature]], composed of 40 in the Senate and 80 in the General Assembly, and their apportionment amongst the state.<ref>Article IV, Section II</ref> The [[New Jersey Apportionment Commission|Apportionment Commission]] is created within the Legislature to modify the proration of legislative districts on a rolling basis, following every [[United States Census]].  It also creates the requirements for office, and the roles of the Senate and General Assembly. This includes the judging of elections, the selection of officers, a journal of proceedings, and the inability to adjourn for a period of greater than three days without the consent of the other house. This article also allows the Legislature to appoint commissions, committees, and other bodies to help perform the functions of the Legislature. Regulations regarding members of the Legislature, including singularity of employment. This is the law that no senator or member of the General Assembly can hold any other Federal or State position, and also cannot be a judge. Further topics are discussed, including bills, agencies, subdivisions, and emergencies. A negative [[enumeration]] of legislative powers is included within the article. Among this list of powers denied are granting divorces, gambling (with obvious exceptions), and passing [[Omnibus bill|omnibus]] acts.<ref>Article IV, Section VII</ref> Although the phrase ''omnibus acts'' is never formally used in this document, the actual wording skirts around the phrase:\n\n{{quote|...to avoid improper influences which may result from intermixing in one and the same act such things as have no proper relation to each other... }}\n\nFinally, an [[oath]]/[[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] is included that is required by members and officers of the Legislature before the person enters upon his/her duties.\n\n=== \"Executive\" ===\n[[File:ChrisChristie2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chris Christie]], the former governor of the state of [[New Jersey]]]]\nArticle V enacts the executive branch.<ref>Article V, Section I, Paragraph 1.</ref> It also sets out the terms of office for the governor and lieutenant governor, the [[Order of succession|succession]] of future governors, and the process of gubernatorial elections. The Governor is given total authority over [[clemency]] except in cases of [[impeachment]]. This is to bar him from pardon in his own impeachment, or disturbing cases of treason. His clemency powers extend to the ability to suspend and remit fines and forfeitures. The system of granting parole is provided by law. The \"militia\" is created, or what is now the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. Regulation regarding nominations and appointments of generals and flag offices is described. The executive and administrative offices, departments, and instrumentalities of the State government are placed under the supervision of the Governor. The Governor has the ability to appoint the [[Secretary of State of New Jersey|Secretary of State]] and the [[New Jersey Attorney General|Attorney General]] with the consent of the [[New Jersey Senate]], though he also can appoint the Lieutenant Governor to serve as Secretary of State without consent of the Senate.<ref>Article IV, Section IV, Paragraph 3.</ref> He can also start inquiries into the conduct of officers and employees.\n\n=== \"Judicial\" ===\nArticle VI creates the [[Judicial]] branch, and permits the establishment, alteration, and abolishment of any court other than the [[Supreme Court of New Jersey]].<ref>Article VI, Sections I and II</ref>  Under the State Constitution, \"'judicial power shall be vested in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, County Courts and inferior courts of limited jurisdiction.'\"<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 4:1-1</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court is New Jersey's appellate court of last resort.<ref name=\"auto\">Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2-2</ref>  \"By constitutional mandate, the Court consists of a Chief Justice and six associate justices, with five members constituting a quorum.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Article VI, Section II, Paragraph 3 provides that, \"The Supreme Court makes its own rules governing the administration of all State courts 'and, subject to law, the practice and procedure of all such courts.'\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe State Constitution renders the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division]] the intermediate appellate court, and \"[a]ppeals may be taken to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court from the law and chancery divisions of the Superior Court and in such other causes as may be provided by law.\"<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 7:1-1</ref>\n\n\"The trial divisions of the Superior Court are the principal trial courts of New Jersey.  They are located within the State's various judicial geographic units, called 'vicinages,' R. 1:33-2(a), and are organized into two basic divisions: the Chancery Division and the Law Division\" of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]].<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:3-1</ref>\n\nThe Governor's power to appoint and nominate the judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts, with the consent of the Senate, is established. He may also nominate and appoint, with the consent of the Senate, judges of the inferior courts whose jurisdiction is only within one municipality. The term of office of Justices and Judges, including their retirement ages and pensions, is stated. Impeachment of Justices and Judges is also legalized, and their inabiling of powers until acquitted.<ref>Article VI, Section V, Paragraph 4</ref> During their term, the judges are restricted to one public office and may not practice law outside the state government. The powers of the [[Chief Justice]] of the Supreme Court are enumerated. Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed.\n\n=== \"Public Officers and Employees\" ===\nArticle VII involves the public officers and employees, including appointment/nomination, compensation, promotions, affirmations, and powers. The role of officers in the state government is discussed. Before the officer enters the duties of office, the officer must subscribe an [[oath]].<ref>Article VII, Section I, Paragraph 1</ref> Appointments for officers are based upon merit, fitness, and [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s. Fees are paid to the [[New Jersey Department of the Treasury|New Jersey State Treasury]]. The term of office for an officer commences on the day of the date of their commissions. The [[New Jersey State Auditor|Auditor]], who has a term of five years, is to be appointed by the [[New Jersey Senate]] and [[New Jersey General Assembly]]. The rest of the section details the duties of the State Auditor and the nomination/appointment of county [[prosecutor]]s, county clerks, [[probate court|surrogate]]s, and [[sheriff]]s. County prosecutors are nominated and appointed by the Governor. The term of office for county clerks and surrogates is five years, and for sheriffs three years. [[Impeachment]] and the process by which impeachment occurs are discussed:<ref>Article VII, Section III</ref>\n\nA state officer may be impeached while in office or for two years after leaving office.<ref>Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 1.</ref> The impeachment process is similar to that of the Federal level: an absolute majority in the lower house (the General Assembly) against the employee causes a trial to take place in the upper house (the State Senate) with the Chief Justice presiding. Unlike the Federal process, the oath necessary to participate in the impeachment sessions is specified and requires the senators to \"truly and impartially\" address the charge as a reminder that they are exercising more judicial functions. \u2154 of the votes, or 27 votes, are needed to convict, but the President of the Senate is excluded from the trial, so the required percentage is slightly higher than \u2154 of 40.<ref>Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 2</ref> The maximum penalty is removal from office with disqualification to hold further state office. However, the impeachment does not count towards the restriction on [[double jeopardy]]; after being convicted by the senate, a person could then be tried by the judiciary and punished further.<ref>Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 3</ref> If this crime was listed according to Article II, Section I, Item 7, the offender can be [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]].\n\n=== \"Taxation and Finance\" ===\nIn Article VIII, taxation is created. It states the Legislature's duty to create laws \"to provide the value of land\" and the uniformity of these rules.<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 1, (b)</ref> Taxing of lands of agriculture is discussed, as well as taxation regulations regarding the re-use of agricultural land for different purposes. Tax exemption is legalized,<ref name=\"auto1\">Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 2</ref> including the continued tax exemptions carried over from the previous constitution. Alteration or repeal of tax exemption is allowed, provided that the real or personal property is not used for \"religious, educational, charitable or cemetery purposes, as defined by law, and owned by any corporation or association organized and conducted exclusively for one or more of such purposes and not operating for profit.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Tax exemptions regarding the [[honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] and exemptions for [[old age|senior citizens]] who live in apartments and may/may not be disabled are discussed. Pensions, disability, and [[Railroad Retirement Board|retirement programs for federal railroad workers]], or any state employees are described. Surviving spouses of deceased citizens, besides exceptions, are entitled to tax deductions. This article also restricts any citizen from receiving more than one tax deduction. The Legislature's right to instantiating a homestead statue is discussed.<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 5</ref> General laws enacted by legislature which permit municipalities to grant tax exemptions on buildings in [[blight]]ed urban areas are legalized, with exceptions relating to the deduction's permanence. Income taxes are banned<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 7</ref> unless the revenue is placed into a specific perpetual fund, or if the taxer is receiving payments from the Federal Railroad Retirement Act, or similar.\n\nThe credit of the state is barred from being publicly or privately loaned.<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 1</ref> Any fiscal year plan which creates more than one percent debt and/or liabilities is banned.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The voting on such plans in public elections is banned, as well as the creation of debt or liabilities \"for purposes of war, or to repel invasion, or to suppress insurrection or to meet an emergency caused by disaster or act of God.\" Taxation of motor vehicle fuel, and the funds the moneys are deposited in are discussed; the appropriation of moneys from the [[sales tax|Sales]] and [[use tax|Use]] Tax Act are defined. A council of local mandates is created, and regulation regarding the appointment of the members for this body. Some moneys from the [[Corporate tax|Corporate Business Tax Act]]  are directed to the General Fund. The appropriation of moneys to the remediation of hazardous discharges and buildings that hold hazardous substances or public water supplies are discussed. A General Fund is created, as well as the distribution of moneys into and from it. The \"clearance, replanning, development or redevelopment of blighted areas\" is made a public and state duty.<ref>Article VIII, Section III, Paragraph 1</ref> The redevelopment of any of these properties is permitted to be completed by municipal, public, or private corporations. The continuing of appropriation of moneys to the corporation that completes the redevelopment after its completion is banned. A free public school system is created, as well as a busing system.<ref>{Article VIII, Section IV</ref> The appropriation of moneys into the public school system fund is legalized. The lands that are tidal or were within forty years ago are protected from [[riparian]] claims.\n\n=== \"Amendments\" ===\nArticle IX involves amendments to the New Jersey state constitution. A potential amendment is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly.<ref>Article IX, Section I, Paragraphs 1 and 2</ref> The amendment is voted upon by both of the houses. If it gathers at least three-fifths of both the Senate and the General Assembly, the amendment is to be submitted to be voted upon by the people of New Jersey. If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote.\n\nIt also explains how the amendments are submitted to the people, i.e., all amendments are to be voted upon separately.<ref>Article IX, Section I, Paragraphs 4 and 5</ref>\n\n=== \"General Provisions\" ===\nArticle X contains involves miscellaneous final addenda.\n\nParagraph 1 states that \"the [[Seals of the U.S. states|seal of the State]] shall be kept by the Governor, or person administering the office of Governor, and used by him officially, and shall be called the [[Seal of New Jersey|Great Seal of the State of New Jersey]].\" The seal's design and the state flag are not mentioned.\n\nParagraph 2 provides for the salutation and protocol of giving grants and [[Commission (document)|commissions]].\n\nParagraph 3 states that \"All [[writ]]s shall be in the name of the State. All [[indictment]]s shall conclude: \"against the [[Queen's peace|peace of this State]], the government and dignity of the same.\"\n\nParagraph 4 provides for a rule of construction that words such as \"person\" and [[Gender-specific pronoun|all pronouns]] include both sexes.\n\nParagraph 5 provides that the [[effective date]] of the Constitution is January 1, 1948, \"except as herein otherwise provided.\"\n\n=== \"Schedule\" ===\nArticle XI, the schedule, is the list of amendments to the Constitution in order of their addition. Sections I through IV, were adopted with the rest of the constitution. They lay out the process of supersession. The others were adopted as individual amendments.{{refn|''Article XI, Section V, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 added effective December 8, 1966. This section is a complete add-on. Article XI, Section VI, added effective December 7, 1978. The constitution states that they are adding a whole section more clearly here. Article XI, Section VII added effective January 17, 2006. Again, this one is clearly written so the reader knows the amendment was for a whole section.''|group=Note}} The Article orders the Legislature to pass all laws necessary for the activation of the new constitution.<ref>Article X, Section I, Paragraph 2</ref> Existing instruments of government, contracts, officers, and judgments are continued unless they are expired, superseded, altered, or repealed. This is to prevent application as an ''ex post facto'' law or violation of the [[Contract Clause]], both prohibited by the [[United States Constitution]]. The new legislature members are elected, and the process of election, term, and rotation are created.  The members may be appointed to offices of government, likely new ones created at the behest of Article XI, Section I, Paragraph 2.\n\nThe remaining sections are the amendments. For reasons unknown, this constitution has never been directly updated since its adoption. The amendments are enumerated in this Article. Essentially, this section of the article records the development of the constitution through amendments. Such amendments include the abolishment of the [[New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals]] and [[Court of equity|Chancery]],<ref>Article X, Section IV, Paragraph 3</ref> transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts, such as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]].\n\nThe requirement of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that the apportionment of all state legislatures be by population is stated. It mainly consists of an interim list of districts and the number of Senators they can elect until the next [[United States Census]] comes around and is received by the Governor. It also contains provisions for apportioning ten districts of the lower house. If it is deadlocked, the Chief Justice of the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] will appoint an 11th and then the vote is by absolute majority. It was passed on election day, 1966, but was first applied on January 17, 2006. This was superseded in 1995 by Article II, Section II.  It took effect on December 7, 1978. Section VII, the final section of this constitution, was passed in a referendum on November 8, 2005, and takes full effect at [[noon]], January 19, 2010, following the transfer of power to the next executive.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nThe New Jersey State Constitution has been criticized, mainly for its disorganized succession plan, <!--That's the weasel sentence. It's better than \"always been criticized.\"-->as seen following  [[Jim McGreevey]]'s [[resignation]].  Senate President [[Richard Codey]] assumed command, and since he legally held both positions, he temporarily had more power than any other governor in the country, being the head of both Executive and Legislative branches. An amendment was later passed to prevent the possibility of Executive and Legislative conflation in the future.<ref>{{cite web| title=New Jersey succession plan concentrates power| url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=15746|last = Murphy|first = Kathleen|date= August 23, 2004 |accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref>  The constitution has also been denounced for its unorganized composition.

The first was issued on July 2, 1776, shortly before New Jersey ratified the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the second was issued in 1844. The current document was issued in 1947 and has been amended several times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/stile-is-sweeney-reshaping-jersey-s-bedrock-1.1526981|title=North Jersey|author=|date=|website=North Jersey|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe state constitution reinforces the basic rights found in the [[United States Constitution]], but also contains several unique provisions, such as regulations governing the operation of casinos.

The first was the [[Concession and Agreement]], which was written in 1665 by the colony's proprietors [[Lord John Berkeley]] and [[Sir George Carteret]], and included a provision granting religious freedom. After Berkeley and Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers, the colony was split into [[West Jersey|West]] and [[East Jersey]]. Each had its own constitution: the [[History of the New Jersey State Constitution#West Jersey Constitution|West Jersey Constitution]] (1681) and the [[History of the New Jersey State Constitution#East Jersey Constitution|East Jersey Constitution]] (1683).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj08.htm|title=Province of West New-Jersey, in America, The 25th of the Ninth Month Called November|accessdate=2006-12-17|author=Avalon Project|publisher=Yale Law School|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102120721/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj08.htm|archive-date=2007-01-02|url-status=dead}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj10.htm|title=The Fundamental Constitutions for the Province of East New Jersey in America, Anno Domini 1683|accessdate=2006-12-17|author=Avalon Project|publisher=Yale Law School|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205053838/http://yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/nj10.htm|archive-date=2006-12-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The two were reunited in 1702 by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nNew Jersey's first state constitution was adopted on July 2, 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] was underway and [[George Washington]] had recently been defeated in [[New York (state)|New York]], putting [[New Jersey]] in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective was to provide a basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.state.nj.us/njfacts/njdoc10.htm|title=The New Jersey Constitution of 1776| accessdate=2006-12-17 }}</ref>\n\nAmong other provisions, it granted unmarried women and blacks who met property requirements the [[suffrage|right to vote]]. It did not specify an amendment procedure and had to be replaced entirely in a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].\n\nThe [[1844 New Jersey Constitution|succeeding constitution]], adopted on June 29, 1844, restricted suffrage to white males. It [[separation of powers|separated the government's powers]] into judicial, legislative, and executive branches and granted the people (as opposed to the legislature) the ability to elect a governor.

The rights discussed in this Article largely mirror the [[Constitution of the United States]]. Such rights include [[freedom of speech]], a [[speedy trial|speedy]] and [[public trial]], and religious freedom.<ref>Article I, Section I; first entry, Paragraph 6; second entry, Paragraph 9; third entry, Paragraphs 3 and 4</ref> Article I also contains a [[Victims' Rights Amendment|Victims' Bill of Rights]].<ref>Article I, Section I, Paragraph 22</ref> The article is a de facto enumeration of the rights of the common man; ''Article I, Section I, Paragraph 21'' deliberately states: \n\n{{quote|21. This enumeration of rights shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the people. }}\n\nThis Article is similar to the U.S. Constitution's enumeration of rights. Similar to the [[Bill of Rights (United States)|U.S. Bill of Rights]], the document also still has \"holdover\" rights, or rights left over from fear of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. These passages still do guarantee important rights to New Jerseyans, but violations are not necessarily common. Such rights include:\n\n{{quote|11.

No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner; nor in time of war, except in a manner prescribed by law.}}\n\n=== \"Elections and Suffrage\" ===\n[[File:NJ 109th congressional districts shaded by party.png|thumb|right|The New Jersey Districts as of 2001.]]\nArticle II lays out dates for elections of the [[Governor]], the [[Lieutenant Governor]], and members of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].<ref>Article II, Section I, Paragraphs 1 to 3</ref> It establishes the qualifications necessary for voting and states the right of suffrage may be removed from certain convicted criminals. The process of absentee balloting is instituted, as well as the structure of voting by people currently in [[military]] service. The [[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]] is established, and the distribution of selection of its 13 members is discussed, who are to represent the \"geographic, ethnic and racial diversity\" of the state.<ref>Article II, Section II</ref> The method of appointment of New Jersey Redistricting Commission members ensures the minority party which lost the general election prior to the census will have the upper hand in redistricting the state. Along with the other 12 appointed members, there is one \"independent\" member, who is to not have held office within the past five years. He is chosen by the other twelve members, yet is automatically the chairman of the Commission. On the occasion that the twelve members may not reach a decision, the Commission picks two (which assumes there are two dominant parties which have their favorites) and sends them to the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]. A majority of the court (4 of 7) then picks the one that \"by education and occupational experience, by prior public service in government or otherwise, and by demonstrated ability to represent the best interest of the people of this State.\"\n\n=== \"Distribution of the Powers of Government\" ===\nThe sole content of Article III is the statement regarding [[separation of powers]]. The three branches ([[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Judiciary|judicial]], and [[Legislature|legislative]]) are created and defined. No individual can be affiliated with more than one unless the Constitution explicitly allows it.<ref>Article III</ref> Before the constitution was amended, a vacancy in the [[Governor of New Jersey]] would be filled by the president of the [[New Jersey Senate]], who would retain their Senate seat.\n\n=== \"Legislative\" ===\nArticle IV establishes the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[New Jersey Legislature]], composed of 40 in the Senate and 80 in the General Assembly, and their apportionment amongst the state.<ref>Article IV, Section II</ref> The [[New Jersey Apportionment Commission|Apportionment Commission]] is created within the Legislature to modify the proration of legislative districts on a rolling basis, following every [[United States Census]].  It also creates the requirements for office, and the roles of the Senate and General Assembly. This includes the judging of elections, the selection of officers, a journal of proceedings, and the inability to adjourn for a period of greater than three days without the consent of the other house. This article also allows the Legislature to appoint commissions, committees, and other bodies to help perform the functions of the Legislature. Regulations regarding members of the Legislature, including singularity of employment. This is the law that no senator or member of the General Assembly can hold any other Federal or State position, and also cannot be a judge. Further topics are discussed, including bills, agencies, subdivisions, and emergencies. A negative [[enumeration]] of legislative powers is included within the article. Among this list of powers denied are granting divorces, gambling (with obvious exceptions), and passing [[Omnibus bill|omnibus]] acts.<ref>Article IV, Section VII</ref> Although the phrase ''omnibus acts'' is never formally used in this document, the actual wording skirts around the phrase:\n\n{{quote|...to avoid improper influences which may result from intermixing in one and the same act such things as have no proper relation to each other... }}\n\nFinally, an [[oath]]/[[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] is included that is required by members and officers of the Legislature before the person enters upon his/her duties.\n\n=== \"Executive\" ===\n[[File:ChrisChristie2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chris Christie]], the former governor of the state of [[New Jersey]]]]\nArticle V enacts the executive branch.<ref>Article V, Section I, Paragraph 1.</ref> It also sets out the terms of office for the governor and lieutenant governor, the [[Order of succession|succession]] of future governors, and the process of gubernatorial elections. The Governor is given total authority over [[clemency]] except in cases of [[impeachment]]. This is to bar him from pardon in his own impeachment, or disturbing cases of treason. His clemency powers extend to the ability to suspend and remit fines and forfeitures. The system of granting parole is provided by law. The \"militia\" is created, or what is now the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. Regulation regarding nominations and appointments of generals and flag offices is described. The executive and administrative offices, departments, and instrumentalities of the State government are placed under the supervision of the Governor. The Governor has the ability to appoint the [[Secretary of State of New Jersey|Secretary of State]] and the [[New Jersey Attorney General|Attorney General]] with the consent of the [[New Jersey Senate]], though he also can appoint the Lieutenant Governor to serve as Secretary of State without consent of the Senate.<ref>Article IV, Section IV, Paragraph 3.</ref> He can also start inquiries into the conduct of officers and employees.\n\n=== \"Judicial\" ===\nArticle VI creates the [[Judicial]] branch, and permits the establishment, alteration, and abolishment of any court other than the [[Supreme Court of New Jersey]].<ref>Article VI, Sections I and II</ref>  Under the State Constitution, \"'judicial power shall be vested in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, County Courts and inferior courts of limited jurisdiction.'\"<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 4:1-1</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court is New Jersey's appellate court of last resort.<ref name=\"auto\">Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2-2</ref>  \"By constitutional mandate, the Court consists of a Chief Justice and six associate justices, with five members constituting a quorum.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Article VI, Section II, Paragraph 3 provides that, \"The Supreme Court makes its own rules governing the administration of all State courts 'and, subject to law, the practice and procedure of all such courts.'\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe State Constitution renders the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division]] the intermediate appellate court, and \"[a]ppeals may be taken to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court from the law and chancery divisions of the Superior Court and in such other causes as may be provided by law.\"<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 7:1-1</ref>\n\n\"The trial divisions of the Superior Court are the principal trial courts of New Jersey.  They are located within the State's various judicial geographic units, called 'vicinages,' R. 1:33-2(a), and are organized into two basic divisions: the Chancery Division and the Law Division\" of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]].<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:3-1</ref>\n\nThe Governor's power to appoint and nominate the judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts, with the consent of the Senate, is established. He may also nominate and appoint, with the consent of the Senate, judges of the inferior courts whose jurisdiction is only within one municipality. The term of office of Justices and Judges, including their retirement ages and pensions, is stated. Impeachment of Justices and Judges is also legalized, and their inabiling of powers until acquitted.<ref>Article VI, Section V, Paragraph 4</ref> During their term, the judges are restricted to one public office and may not practice law outside the state government. The powers of the [[Chief Justice]] of the Supreme Court are enumerated. Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed.\n\n=== \"Public Officers and Employees\" ===\nArticle VII involves the public officers and employees, including appointment/nomination, compensation, promotions, affirmations, and powers. The role of officers in the state government is discussed. Before the officer enters the duties of office, the officer must subscribe an [[oath]].<ref>Article VII, Section I, Paragraph 1</ref> Appointments for officers are based upon merit, fitness, and [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s. Fees are paid to the [[New Jersey Department of the Treasury|New Jersey State Treasury]]. The term of office for an officer commences on the day of the date of their commissions. The [[New Jersey State Auditor|Auditor]], who has a term of five years, is to be appointed by the [[New Jersey Senate]] and [[New Jersey General Assembly]]. The rest of the section details the duties of the State Auditor and the nomination/appointment of county [[prosecutor]]s, county clerks, [[probate court|surrogate]]s, and [[sheriff]]s. County prosecutors are nominated and appointed by the Governor. The term of office for county clerks and surrogates is five years, and for sheriffs three years. [[Impeachment]] and the process by which impeachment occurs are discussed:<ref>Article VII, Section III</ref>\n\nA state officer may be impeached while in office or for two years after leaving office.<ref>Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 1.</ref> The impeachment process is similar to that of the Federal level: an absolute majority in the lower house (the General Assembly) against the employee causes a trial to take place in the upper house (the State Senate) with the Chief Justice presiding. Unlike the Federal process, the oath necessary to participate in the impeachment sessions is specified and requires the senators to \"truly and impartially\" address the charge as a reminder that they are exercising more judicial functions. \u2154 of the votes, or 27 votes, are needed to convict, but the President of the Senate is excluded from the trial, so the required percentage is slightly higher than \u2154 of 40.<ref>Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 2</ref> The maximum penalty is removal from office with disqualification to hold further state office. However, the impeachment does not count towards the restriction on [[double jeopardy]]; after being convicted by the senate, a person could then be tried by the judiciary and punished further.<ref>Article VII, Section III, Paragraph 3</ref> If this crime was listed according to Article II, Section I, Item 7, the offender can be [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]].\n\n=== \"Taxation and Finance\" ===\nIn Article VIII, taxation is created. It states the Legislature's duty to create laws \"to provide the value of land\" and the uniformity of these rules.<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 1, (b)</ref> Taxing of lands of agriculture is discussed, as well as taxation regulations regarding the re-use of agricultural land for different purposes. Tax exemption is legalized,<ref name=\"auto1\">Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 2</ref> including the continued tax exemptions carried over from the previous constitution. Alteration or repeal of tax exemption is allowed, provided that the real or personal property is not used for \"religious, educational, charitable or cemetery purposes, as defined by law, and owned by any corporation or association organized and conducted exclusively for one or more of such purposes and not operating for profit.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Tax exemptions regarding the [[honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] and exemptions for [[old age|senior citizens]] who live in apartments and may/may not be disabled are discussed. Pensions, disability, and [[Railroad Retirement Board|retirement programs for federal railroad workers]], or any state employees are described. Surviving spouses of deceased citizens, besides exceptions, are entitled to tax deductions. This article also restricts any citizen from receiving more than one tax deduction. The Legislature's right to instantiating a homestead statue is discussed.<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 5</ref> General laws enacted by legislature which permit municipalities to grant tax exemptions on buildings in [[blight]]ed urban areas are legalized, with exceptions relating to the deduction's permanence. Income taxes are banned<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 7</ref> unless the revenue is placed into a specific perpetual fund, or if the taxer is receiving payments from the Federal Railroad Retirement Act, or similar.\n\nThe credit of the state is barred from being publicly or privately loaned.<ref>Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 1</ref> Any fiscal year plan which creates more than one percent debt and/or liabilities is banned.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The voting on such plans in public elections is banned, as well as the creation of debt or liabilities \"for purposes of war, or to repel invasion, or to suppress insurrection or to meet an emergency caused by disaster or act of God.\" Taxation of motor vehicle fuel, and the funds the moneys are deposited in are discussed; the appropriation of moneys from the [[sales tax|Sales]] and [[use tax|Use]] Tax Act are defined. A council of local mandates is created, and regulation regarding the appointment of the members for this body. Some moneys from the [[Corporate tax|Corporate Business Tax Act]]  are directed to the General Fund. The appropriation of moneys to the remediation of hazardous discharges and buildings that hold hazardous substances or public water supplies are discussed. A General Fund is created, as well as the distribution of moneys into and from it. The \"clearance, replanning, development or redevelopment of blighted areas\" is made a public and state duty.<ref>Article VIII, Section III, Paragraph 1</ref> The redevelopment of any of these properties is permitted to be completed by municipal, public, or private corporations. The continuing of appropriation of moneys to the corporation that completes the redevelopment after its completion is banned. A free public school system is created, as well as a busing system.<ref>{Article VIII, Section IV</ref> The appropriation of moneys into the public school system fund is legalized. The lands that are tidal or were within forty years ago are protected from [[riparian]] claims.\n\n=== \"Amendments\" ===\nArticle IX involves amendments to the New Jersey state constitution. A potential amendment is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly.<ref>Article IX, Section I, Paragraphs 1 and 2</ref> The amendment is voted upon by both of the houses. If it gathers at least three-fifths of both the Senate and the General Assembly, the amendment is to be submitted to be voted upon by the people of New Jersey. If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote.\n\nIt also explains how the amendments are submitted to the people, i.e., all amendments are to be voted upon separately.<ref>Article IX, Section I, Paragraphs 4 and 5</ref>\n\n=== \"General Provisions\" ===\nArticle X contains involves miscellaneous final addenda.\n\nParagraph 1 states that \"the [[Seals of the U.S. states|seal of the State]] shall be kept by the Governor, or person administering the office of Governor, and used by him officially, and shall be called the [[Seal of New Jersey|Great Seal of the State of New Jersey]].\" The seal's design and the state flag are not mentioned.\n\nParagraph 2 provides for the salutation and protocol of giving grants and [[Commission (document)|commissions]].\n\nParagraph 3 states that \"All [[writ]]s shall be in the name of the State. All [[indictment]]s shall conclude: \"against the [[Queen's peace|peace of this State]], the government and dignity of the same.\"\n\nParagraph 4 provides for a rule of construction that words such as \"person\" and [[Gender-specific pronoun|all pronouns]] include both sexes.\n\nParagraph 5 provides that the [[effective date]] of the Constitution is January 1, 1948, \"except as herein otherwise provided.\"\n\n=== \"Schedule\" ===\nArticle XI, the schedule, is the list of amendments to the Constitution in order of their addition. Sections I through IV, were adopted with the rest of the constitution. They lay out the process of supersession. The others were adopted as individual amendments.{{refn|''Article XI, Section V, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 added effective December 8, 1966. This section is a complete add-on. Article XI, Section VI, added effective December 7, 1978. The constitution states that they are adding a whole section more clearly here. Article XI, Section VII added effective January 17, 2006. Again, this one is clearly written so the reader knows the amendment was for a whole section.''|group=Note}} The Article orders the Legislature to pass all laws necessary for the activation of the new constitution.<ref>Article X, Section I, Paragraph 2</ref> Existing instruments of government, contracts, officers, and judgments are continued unless they are expired, superseded, altered, or repealed. This is to prevent application as an ''ex post facto'' law or violation of the [[Contract Clause]], both prohibited by the [[United States Constitution]]. The new legislature members are elected, and the process of election, term, and rotation are created.  The members may be appointed to offices of government, likely new ones created at the behest of Article XI, Section I, Paragraph 2.\n\nThe remaining sections are the amendments. For reasons unknown, this constitution has never been directly updated since its adoption. The amendments are enumerated in this Article. Essentially, this section of the article records the development of the constitution through amendments. Such amendments include the abolishment of the [[New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals]] and [[Court of equity|Chancery]],<ref>Article X, Section IV, Paragraph 3</ref> transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts, such as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]].\n\nThe requirement of the [[United States Supreme Court|Federal Supreme Court]] that the apportionment of all state legislatures be by population is stated. It mainly consists of an interim list of districts and the number of Senators they can elect until the next [[United States Census]] comes around and is received by the Governor. It also contains provisions for apportioning ten districts of the lower house. If it is deadlocked, the Chief Justice of the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] will appoint an 11th and then the vote is by absolute majority. It was passed on election day, 1966, but was first applied on January 17, 2006. This was superseded in 1995 by Article II, Section II.  It took effect on December 7, 1978. Section VII, the final section of this constitution, was passed in a referendum on November 8, 2005, and takes full effect at [[noon]], January 19, 2010, following the transfer of power to the next executive.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nThe New Jersey State Constitution has been criticized, mainly for its disorganized succession plan, <!--That's the weasel sentence. It's better than \"always been criticized.\"-->as seen following  [[Jim McGreevey]]'s [[resignation]].  Senate President [[Richard Codey]] assumed command, and since he legally held both positions, he temporarily had more power than any other governor in the country, being the head of both Executive and Legislative branches. An amendment was later passed to prevent the possibility of Executive and Legislative conflation in the future.<ref>{{cite web| title=New Jersey succession plan concentrates power| url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=15746|last = Murphy|first = Kathleen|date= August 23, 2004 |accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref>  The constitution has also been denounced for its unorganized composition.
