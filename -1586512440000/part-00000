'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize

or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/>

fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017

with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.<ref name=LBDACareMeds>{{cite web |url=

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.<ref name=Boot2013/><ref name=LBDAEarlyCare>{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |''APOE'' gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in AD.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/> Falls\u2014caused by many factors including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and frailness\u2014increase [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name= Taylor2020/> [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most

Today, Ethel includes Camp Branch, Freeze Fork (town and stream), Rockcamp Branch, Rockhouse Branch (now Georges Creek), Mash Branch (formerly Wanda), and Bearwallow Branch (formerly Red Campbell). It is situated at the base of Blair Mountain.\n\n==History==\n\nIn the 1890s, land speculators James L. Caldwell, a banker from Huntington, C.W. Campbell, an attorney from Huntington, and John Q. Dickinson, a banker from Charleston, acquired many acres of land on Dingess Run and Rum Creek. The trio procured some of Logan County's finest coal lands with six accessible seams of coal: the Lewis-Stockton or Five Block, the Chilton, the Winifrede, the Coalburg, the Cedar Grove or Island Creek, and the Number 2 Gas or Eagle Seam. They formed the Dingess-Rum Coal Company in June of 1903 to administer their lands, which totaled over 26,000 acres. They surveyed a railroad bed up Dingess Run and laid the cross-ties, leaving only the rails to be laid by the C&O Railroad, which occurred by late 1906. From there, the railroad extended up Right Fork and Left Fork (Ethel Hollow). At the juncture of the two forks, the company town of Ethel, named for the daughter or wife of an early coal operator, was established around 1907.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethel Coal Company: Supply Building |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/wv/wv0300/wv0351/data/wv0351data.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Ethel Coal Company===\n\nEthel Coal Company, formed in 1906, operated No. 1 and No. 2 mines from 1907 to 1916 in Ethel Hollow.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Keystone Coal Buyers Catalog, 1921-1962 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/wv/wv0300/wv0351/data/wv0351data.pdf}}</ref> Between 1907 and 1916, the company constructed dwelling houses in Ethel Hollow. The company built the Ethel No. 1 Company Store; its ruins are visible today. During this time, about 1914, Italian stonemasons constructed the Ethel Coal Company Supply Building, one of the town's few remaining landmarks. Ethel Coal Company employed 184 men in 1915; nearly half of the labor force was immigrants, with the largest group being from Hungary. Italians were also employed and 1/6 of the work force were African-Americans. Ethel Coal Company operated No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 in 1917.\n\n===Logan Coal Company===\n\nLogan Coal Company operated Logan No. 1 from 1908 to 1916. Logan No. 1 employed fewer immigrants; in 1911 and 1912, no immigrants were employed at the Logan No. 1 mine. In 1916, Ethel Coal Company took over the lease of the Logan Coal Company and its Logan No. 1 mine, which was located at the mouth of Ethel Hollow.\n\n===Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company===\n\nCleveland Cliffs Iron Company took over the lease of Ethel Coal Company and operated Ethel No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 (the latter located at the mouth of Ethel Hollow) from 1918 to 1929. It was the only out-of-state coal company to operate at Ethel and it was the most efficient: in 1925, it produced 525,628 tons with only 224 men (2,346 tons per man). The Great Depression essentially shut down all of its operations. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Keystone Coal Buyers Catalog, 1921-1962 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/wv/wv0300/wv0351/data/wv0351data.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Blair Mountain===\n\nEthel, situated at the base of Blair Mountain played a role in the story of the [[Battle of Blair Mountain]]. Logan County Sheriff Don Chafin set up field posts at various points along the defensive line, including one post at Cleveland Cliffs Company Store No. 2 at the mouth of Ethel Hollow. On August 27, 1921, a force of over 200 state police troopers and deputies under the command of Captain J.R. Brockus set out from the Ethel post for Beech Creek on the union side of Spruce Fork Ridge in order to serve warrants on certain union leaders. The route was likely either up the Left Fork of Dingess Run (Ethel Hollow) to Pine Fork and then along Spruce Fork Ridge to Beech Creek (in which case Brockus would have passed the Ethel Coal Company Supply Building) or up the Right Fork of Dingess Run, then up the graded road to Blair Mountain northward along Spruce Fork Ridge and down Beech Creek.\n\nOn August 28, 1921, State Police private George Duling was shot in the Club House near the Ethel Coal Company Supply Building. John L. Rice, an employee of the Logan Mining Company, shot officer Duling in the head while he sat on the Club House porch. Sheriff Don Chafin arrested Rice but determined the killing to have been an accident.\n\nThe supply building served as a staging area for defensive forces in the battle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Supply Building |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/wv/wv0300/wv0351/data/wv0351data.pdf |website=Historical American Engineering Record: Ethel Coal Company: Supply Building}}</ref>\n\n===1920s===\n\nIn 1923, Ethel was populated by 2000 residents, featured a Methodist Episcopal church, and was accessed by the Dingess Run Branch of the C&O Railroad.

No. 2 mine was reopened in 1935 and operated until 1941. The combined production of No. 1 and 2 mines reached 408,857 tons in 1941 (983 tons per man), well below what was accomplished by Cleveland Cliffs. During the 1933-1941 period, several structures were demolished, such as the No. 1 mining plant, the No. 1 mine tipple, and the No. 1 powerhouse. In 1941, Chilton Block Coal Company went into bankruptcy.\n\n===Chilton Coal Company and A.T. Massey Coal Company, Inc.===\n\nA.J. McCalla, a Charleston banker who was named receiver for Chilton Block, managed the company's affairs until 1944 when he formed the Chilton Coal Company to manage the mine. He likewise managed Ethel Chilton Mines, Inc., organized in 1942, to operate the No. 1 mine. This latter company absorbed Chilton Coal Company in 1946. McCalla directed this company until 1949 when A.T. Massey Coal Company, Inc. became the exclusive sales agency for Ethel Chilton Mines. Massey handled the product until 1962 when the mines closed. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Keystone Coal Buyers Catalog, 1921-1962}}</ref>\n\n===Recent Decades===\n\nIn 1962, C.F. Colley, who had served as store manager for Ethel Chilton Mines, Inc. since 1951, leased a small parcel from the Dingess-Rum Coal Company that included the Ethel Coal Company Supply Building. He operated Colley Equipment Company, which bought used mine equipment and machinery, reconditioned it in the stone building, then resold it. He leased the building until 1986. In 1987, Cook Electric Maintenance Company leased the building for two years.\n\n==Today==\n\nOnly a few structures remain from Ethel's earlier days, namely the Ethel Coal Company Supply Building and ruins of Ethel No. 1 Company Store. Ethel Post Office is located near the mouth of Bearwallow Branch. Bearwallow Trailhead, opened in 2000 as part of the Hatfield-McCoy ATV Trail, is located in the headwaters of Bearwallow Branch.\n\n==Notable Residents==\n\nJohn C.

The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

The constitution of [[Namibia]] defines the role of the military as ''\"defending the territory and national interests.\"''\n\nNamibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), military wing of the [[South West African People's Organization]], and the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) \u2013 a security arm of the former South African administration.

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].
