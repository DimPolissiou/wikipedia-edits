He attended [[Framlingham College]] in Suffolk for secondary education and the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] for post-secondary education. He articled to [[John Shewell Corder]] from 1892 to 1895 and was his assistant from 1895 to 1898. He was the assistant to Francis William Tasker in 1898, [[James Ransome]] from 1899 to 1900 and to Charles Barry Edward from 1901 to 1907.

Turner passed away from a heart attack on August 13, 1943, two years after he retired from being director at McGill's School of Architecture.<ref name=Schoenauer />\n\n==Teaching career==\nTurner emigrated to Canada in 1906, and joined the [[McGill School of Architecture]]'s faculty in 1910, where he first taught a lecture on Building Construction. He soon began to also teach Materials of Construction, Professional Practice and Specifications, and was appointed Professor in 1933. In addition to teaching at the School of Architecture, Turner was appointed Special Lecturer on Library Buildings in 1926 in the McGill Library School, which he continued to hold until after his retirement from the architecture school. In 1939, he succeeded [[Ramsay Traquair (architect)|Ramsay Traquair]] as the director of the School of Architecture, a position he held for only two years until 1941.<ref name=Highlights>{{cite web| url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school|title=Highlights of the School's History|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> During these two years, however, he accomplished a great deal at the School. Turner became director at a time when student enrollment was very low, in the wake of the [[Great Depression in Canada]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Enrollment was so low that the Principal of McGill at the time, [[Lewis Williams Douglas]] considered phasing out architectural education at McGill. As director, Turner, along with his Executive Secretary, [[John Bland (architect)|John Bland]], fought the threat of the School's closing and gathered the support of several distinguished architects in Montreal, ultimately convincing the Principal not to close the School. He created an advisory committee on the School of Architecture in 1939, with E.I. Barott, [[Harold Lea Fetherstonhaugh]] and J.C. McDougal representing the profession, and he and [[Percy Nobbs]] representing the School.<ref name=Schoenauer />\n\nTurner also opened the door to co-ed education at the School of Architecture, which had not yet been done at any department within the [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]] at McGill. In 1943, two years after Turner retired as director, [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]] became the School's first female graduate and the first female graduate from the Faculty of Engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/about-us/our-history/1900-1950|title=1900-1950|publisher=McGill University Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Turner's health was quite frail by the time he became director of the School, and in the following year it had deteriorated so much that he entrusted the directorship to his Executive Secretary, John Bland, who became the new director in 1941, though they continued to work together for the remainder of that year. Two years after his retirement, Turner passed away from a heart attack.<ref name=Schoenauer /> The Philip J. Turner Prize was established in his memory at the School, and is presented to the student with the highest standing in the studio course, Design and Construction 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/scholarships|title=Scholarships, fellowships, prizes and fees|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Architectural career==\nTurner designed many types of buildings throughout his career, ranging from residences to churches, toward the end of his career. He began an independent practice in Stowmarket, Suffolk in 1900, and again in 1908 in Montreal, Quebec. Much of his architectural work between 1900 and his death in 1943 was through his own practice, however he worked in partnership with William Edward Carless from 1913 to 1915, as well as with S.H.

He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Senior Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.<ref name=Schoenauer />\n\n==Personal life and education==\nPhilip Turner was born in [[Stowmarket]], [[Suffolk]] in 1876 to a large family of many sisters and brothers. He attended [[Framlingham College]] in Suffolk for secondary education and the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] for post-secondary education. He articled to [[John Shewell Corder]] from 1892 to 1895 and was his assistant from 1895 to 1898. He was the assistant to Francis William Tasker in 1898, [[James Ransome]] from 1899 to 1900 and to Charles Barry Edward from 1901 to 1907.

Turner passed away from a heart attack on August 13, 1943, two years after he retired from being director at McGill's School of Architecture.<ref name=Schoenauer />\n\n==Teaching career==\nTurner emigrated to Canada in 1906, and joined the [[McGill School of Architecture]]'s faculty in 1910, where he first taught a lecture on Building Construction. He soon began to also teach Materials of Construction, Professional Practice and Specifications, and was appointed Professor in 1933. In addition to teaching at the School of Architecture, Turner was appointed Special Lecturer on Library Buildings in 1926 in the McGill Library School, which he continued to hold until after his retirement from the architecture school. In 1939, he succeeded [[Ramsay Traquair (architect)|Ramsay Traquair]] as the director of the School of Architecture, a position he held for only two years until 1941.<ref name=Highlights>{{cite web| url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school|title=Highlights of the School's History|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> During these two years, however, he accomplished a great deal at the School. Turner became director at a time when student enrollment was very low, in the wake of the [[Great Depression in Canada]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Enrollment was so low that the Principal of McGill at the time, [[Lewis Williams Douglas]] considered phasing out architectural education at McGill. As director, Turner, along with his Executive Secretary, [[John Bland (architect)|John Bland]], fought the threat of the School's closing and gathered the support of several distinguished architects in Montreal, ultimately convincing the Principal not to close the School. He created an advisory committee on the School of Architecture in 1939, with E.I. Barott, [[Harold Lea Fetherstonhaugh]] and J.C. McDougal representing the profession, and he and [[Percy Nobbs]] representing the School.<ref name=Schoenauer />\n\nTurner also opened the door to co-ed education at the School of Architecture, which had not yet been done at any department within the [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]] at McGill. In 1943, two years after Turner retired as director, [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]] became the School's first female graduate and the first female graduate from the Faculty of Engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/about-us/our-history/1900-1950|title=1900-1950|publisher=McGill University Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Turner's health was quite frail by the time he became director of the School, and in the following year it had deteriorated so much that he entrusted the directorship to his Executive Secretary, John Bland, who became the new director in 1941, though they continued to work together for the remainder of that year. Two years after his retirement, Turner passed away from a heart attack.<ref name=Schoenauer /> The Philip J. Turner Prize was established in his memory at the School, and is presented to the student with the highest standing in the studio course, Design and Construction 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/scholarships|title=Scholarships, fellowships, prizes and fees|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Architectural career==\nTurner designed many types of buildings throughout his career, ranging from residences to churches, toward the end of his career. He began an independent practice in Stowmarket, Suffolk in 1900, and again in 1908 in Montreal, Quebec. Much of his architectural work between 1900 and his death in 1943 was through his own practice, however he worked in partnership with William Edward Carless from 1913 to 1915, as well as with S.H.

He also composed several works and made transcriptions for viola and viola d'amore.\n\nWaefelghem was educated at the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royal in Bruges and then studied [[violin]] with [[Lambert Joseph Meerts]] at the [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussels)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]] in [[Brussels]].  After finding success as a violinist in Germany and at the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Opera House]] in [[Budapest]], he moved to Paris in 1863 to pursue a career as a performer on [[viola]] and viola d'amore.  He played in the orchestra of the [[Paris Opera]] in 1868 and also in the [[Pasdeloup Orchestra]].  Waefelghem was Examiner of the Viola at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] before [[Th\u00e9ophile Laforge]] was appointed the first Professor of Viola in 1894.  His reputation as a gifted violist quickly spread and, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), he traveled to [[London]] where he played in the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]] orchestra and at chamber concerts of the Musical Union with [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Leopold Auer]], [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], [[Camillo Sivori]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], and others.  From 1875 he was the violist of the Quatuor Marsick, along with [[Guillaume R\u00e9my]], [[Jules Delsart]] and founder [[Martin Pierre Marsick]], one of the best and most famous string quartets in Paris of the time.<ref>[http://armand.marsick.pagesperso-orange.fr/martin6.htm Martin Pierre Marsick (page 6)] Retrieved 6 September 2010. {{in lang|fr}}</ref> He also a member of the Quatuor Geloso<ref>Stowell, Robin: \"From Chamber to Concert Hall, France and Belgium\", ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet]]'', p. 52. Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref> and of [[Ovide Musin]]'s quartet with Metzger and Vander Gucht.  Waefelghem was the principal violist with the [[Orchestre Lamoureux]] from 1881 to 1895.\n\nIn 1895 Waefelghem, along with colleagues [[Laurent Grillet]] ([[hurdy-gurdy]]), [[Louis Di\u00e9mer]] ([[harpsichord]]) and [[Jules Delsart]] ([[viola da gamba]]), founded the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Instruments Anciens''.

He also composed several works and made transcriptions for viola and viola d'amore.\n\nWaefelghem was educated at the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royal in Bruges and then studied [[violin]] with [[Lambert Joseph Meerts]] at the [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussels)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]] in [[Brussels]].  After finding success as a violinist in Germany and at the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Opera House]] in [[Budapest]], he moved to Paris in 1863 to pursue a career as a performer on [[viola]] and viola d'amore.  He played in the orchestra of the [[Paris Opera]] in 1868 and also in the [[Pasdeloup Orchestra]].  Waefelghem was Examiner of the Viola at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] before [[Th\u00e9ophile Laforge]] was appointed the first Professor of Viola in 1894.  His reputation as a gifted violist quickly spread and, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), he traveled to [[London]] where he played in the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]] orchestra and at chamber concerts of the Musical Union with [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Leopold Auer]], [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], [[Camillo Sivori]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], and others.  From 1875 he was the violist of the Quatuor Marsick, along with [[Guillaume R\u00e9my]], [[Jules Delsart]] and founder [[Martin Pierre Marsick]], one of the best and most famous string quartets in Paris of the time.<ref>[http://armand.marsick.pagesperso-orange.fr/martin6.htm Martin Pierre Marsick (page 6)] Retrieved 6 September 2010. {{in lang|fr}}</ref> He also a member of the Quatuor Geloso<ref>Stowell, Robin: \"From Chamber to Concert Hall, France and Belgium\", ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet]]'', p. 52.

Waefelghem was the principal violist with the [[Orchestre Lamoureux]] from 1881 to 1895.\n\nIn 1895 Waefelghem, along with colleagues [[Laurent Grillet]] ([[hurdy-gurdy]]), [[Louis Di\u00e9mer]] ([[harpsichord]]) and [[Jules Delsart]] ([[viola da gamba]]), founded the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Instruments Anciens''.

To this plant Nuttall \"doubtfully attaches the name\" ''Taxus montana'', somewhat of a [[nomen nudum]], because Nuttall never actually described the plant besides quoting a summary description from Torrey's letter to him. Nuttall is doubtful about the [[taxon]], because according to him it seems \"scarcely distinct\" from [[Taxus brevifolia|''T. brevifolia'']] of the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Nuttall1849/> Following the publication of this work, however, he was attributed as the author of this scientific name.<ref name=Henkel1865/><ref name=INPI4/> By 1865 this name was misapplied to ''Torreya taxifolia'' under the name ''Torreya montana''. Henkel and Hochstetter synonymised this taxon with ''T. taxifolia'' in their work mentioned above.<ref name=Henkel1865/> According to the [[Index Kewensis]] this was in error; the name ''Taxus montana'' had actually already been given to a species, now ''[[Prumnopitys montana]]'', described (validated, in fact) in 1806 by [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow]] from specimens collected by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]] on their famous scientific exploration of the Americas, and Nuttall had in fact referred to Willdenow's species.<ref name=INPI4/> [[John Nelson (horticulturist)|John Nelson]], in his more utilitarian as opposed to scientific 1866 horticultural handbook of firs and pines for growing in Britain, introduced the name ''Foetataxus montana'' to write about ''Torreya taxifolia'', apparently unaware of the German publication the previous year.<ref name=Nelson1866/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ipni.org/n/262075-1 |title=''Foetataxus montana'' |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2020 |website=International Plant Names Index |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> In fact, all these sources were wrong, for Nuttall states that he found a newer specimen of Croom's, of the same taxon, in the Herbarium of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] labelled as ''Taxus floridana''!<ref name=Nuttall1849/> Despite that the original synonymy with ''T. floridana'', all these names are still maintained in the synonymy of ''Torreya taxifolia'' in some modern databases as of 2020.<ref name=PoWO/>\n\nThe [[University of North Carolina]] Herbarium has a single specimen, originally from the Jesup Herbarium of [[Dartmouth College]], sent hither by Croom from the \"Apalache River\" in 1833.

He also mentions the seed, covered in the aril, are approximately the size of a [[nutmeg]].<ref name=Nuttall1849/> In 1865 the German botanists Henkel and Hochstetter note that the Americans called the tree \"stinking cedar\" and \"wild nutmeg\". They mention that the name \"nutmeg\" is derived from the bone-hard shelled and acorn-sized seeds, which are covered in an aril somewhat similar to that of true nutmeg. They also describe that when the leaves are crushed they exude a pungent and disagreeable odour, which is why the local Americans used the name \"stinking cedar\". They themselves call the plant \"''Torrey's Nuss-Eibe''\", which translates as \"Torrey's nut-yew\" in English.<ref name=Henkel1865/> According to the gardening writer Nelson in 1866, ''Torreya'' species in general were known as \"stinking cedars\" or \"stinking nutmegs\" by the locals, though he himself recommended the name \"strong-odoured yew\" as preferred for British use. This specific species was called \"stinking cedar\" by the Americans according to him, although he recommended the name \"mountain yew\" for Britain -this is a calque of the (incorrect) Latin name he was using, he was apparently unaware of the fact that this species grows almost at sea level and nowhere near any mountains!<ref name=Nelson1866/> In fact, of all species of ''Torreya'', it is only the species which is never found in mountainous areas.\n\n[[Image:T taxifolia.jpg|thumb|Seed cone]]\n\nAlthough the [[vernacular name]] '''Florida torreya''' was formally recommended by most conservation works and internet databases,<ref name=FlorPlAtl/><ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=FNA/><ref name=Coile1998/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> this was changed to '''Florida nutmeg''' in the late 2010s.<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=PLANTS/> Other names for this tree are '''savin''',<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> '''polecat wood''',<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> '''yew-leaved torreya''',<ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=Nuttall1849/> '''foetid yew''',<ref name=Alfieri1987/> '''stinking cedar''',<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=USBG>{{cite web |url=https://m.usbg.gov/plants/stinking-cedar |title=Stinking cedar |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=United States Botanic Garden |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> '''mountain yew''' (Britain)<ref name=Nelson1866/> or '''stinking yew'''{{cn|date=March 2020}} (applied to the Californian species ''[[Torreya californica]]'').<ref name=Nelson1866/>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:The North American sylva (Pl.

She made this suggestion based on the fact that this species is rare, that it grew well in the cooler temperatures of [[North Carolina]], and her belief that the species was only found on the east bank of the Apalachicola and was unable to disperse to the west bank with the animals she thought might be the main dispersal agents today, squirrels. She theorised than during the [[Eemian|last interglacial]] (the geologically short periods between [[ice age]]s) and the proceeding ones, the species grew further north. According to her theories, because there might have been an unknown and now extinct animal in the past which was better suited to eat and defecate the seeds, or otherwise move the seeds, the species was now \"stuck\" behind the Apalachicola which served as a refuge habitat for a [[Relict (biology)|relict population]] during the long periods of glacial conditions which characterised the [[Pleistocene]]. She further supposed that because the arils contain [[terpene]]s which are usually toxic for mammals, and the seed's shell is so thin that mammal molars would crush the seeds, that the purported extinct animal might not be a mammal and instead suggested some unknown species of large [[tortoise]] as the extinct ecological partner.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n==Uses==\nIt is has been far too rare to harvest commercially since the 1950s, but it has a beautiful, yellow-coloured, close-grained wood.

In this era it was also recommended as making excellent posts for fencing, not being liable to attack by insects.<ref name=Nuttall1849/>\n\nWhen the trunks are damaged, the trees yield a small quantity of pasty, viscous, blood-red [[turpentine]], which can be dissolved in alcohol, but has a very powerful and unpleasant odour.<ref name=Nuttall1849/> \n\n===Cultivation===\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted outside of its native range as an ornamental, and is found in private gardens, [[arboretum|arboreta]] and botanical gardens.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/>\n\nIt was first imported to grow in Europe in 1840.

T. Nieland in 1938, although he never wrote a formal paper about it. In the same year Kurz made a detailed study of the ecology of species and mentioned that there was no danger to the species vanishing from its habitat if lumbering would cease.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> In 1954 Kurz and R. K. Godfrey surveyed the population and noticed no symptoms of decline.

In a 1967 article S. A. Alfieri Jr. ''et al''. of the [[Florida Department of Agriculture]] presented their research of the phenomenon. The disease presents itself as a small, yellowish spot on the needles (leaves) -one or more per leaf, which soon spreads throughout the leaf until it dies, turns brown and falls off. Subsequently the disease spreads into the twig, and all of the needles fall off, leaving only a tuft of new growth at the tip. The disease spreads in stages, first affecting portions, later the entire tree. Severely infected trees eventually loose most of their needles and twigs. Fungal fruiting structures grow on wholly necrotic tissue on the underside of the leaves, twigs and buds. In some cases, the stems of affected or dead trees also showed fungal [[canker]]. Young seedlings are also affected, but less severely than older trees. Trees growing in the shade are more affected than those in full sunlight.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> \n\nIn 1985 the [[phytopathologist]] Nabih Elias El-Gholl, also of the Florida Department of Agriculture, was able to prove that there were at least two pathogens involved; the leaf-spot disease presented as light greyish-green spots, which later became tan-coloured, and were up to 8.4mm long and as wide as the needle, with brown, irregularly-shaped, 2.4mm long \u00d7 2mm wide, necrotic centres and were able to infect the plants in the absence of wounds within three days of inoculation. Initially only a few spots, maximally four, developed per plant. After some two weeks the infected needles died and fell off -by this time the undersides had developed spore structures,<ref name=El-Gholl1985>{{cite journal |last=El-Gholl |first=Nabih Elias |date=1985 |title=''Fusarium lateritium'' Causing Needle Spots on ''Torreya taxifolia'' in Florida |url=https://www.apsnet.org/publications/PlantDisease/BackIssues/Documents/1985Abstracts/PD_69_905a.htm |journal=Plant Disease |volume=69 |pages=905 |doi=10.1094/PD-69-905a |access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> which were primarily found along the two grey bands of stomata, but may also occur on the twigs.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nThe canker disease presents as elongated [[fusiform]] swellings on the stems which eventually may break open. They are often found at the base of the trees.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nIn 1993 Schwartz, who has spent much of his career researching the conservation of this species, and Sharon M. Hermann, reported on the progression of the disease. They monitored a census population of some 100 trees for four years, in this time 10% died, mostly the smaller individuals. Most plants consisted of multi-stemmed, regenerating stumps; the mean length of the longest stems were less than one meter. Less than half of the plants showed any growth in length during these four years, and 32% lost their primary stem, which meant the mean size of individuals within the population was decreasing. Death was not strongly related to specific location or if the plants showed disease symptoms, although stem mortality was higher with trees showing a higher severity of foliar pathogens.<ref name=Schwartz1993/> In 2000 Schwartz ''et al''. reported that despite Godfrey and Kurz's 1962 prediction, a small population size, continued population losses, and no known seed production for decades, extinction of ''T. taxifolia'' had not yet occurred, and although the population would likely steadily decline, it was unlikely to go extinct within the next 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\n===Status===\nThis was one of the first federally listed {{C|Endangered flora of the United States|endangered plant species in the United States}} in 1984 (Federal Register 1/23/84).<ref name=FNA/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=USFWS1984/> It is one of only two species of conifer protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref name=Earle2020/> It was listed as \"[[threatened species|threatened]]\" within the state of Florida by 1987 (Florida Statutes Section 581.185),<ref name=Alfieri1987/> again in 1994 by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,<ref name=Esser1993/> and in 1998 the status in Florida was changed to \"[[endangered]]\".<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Coile1998/> In 2002 it was added to the list of \"endangered\" plants of Georgia.<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> It has been a \"[[critically endangered]]\" species on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 1998, in 2000 this was said to be due to estimated 98% decline in mature individuals since the early 1950s.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=iucn2000/>\n\n===Population===\nIn 2000 Schwartz and colleagues calculated that before the start of the decline, the original population of ''T. taxifolia'' may have been 300,000 between 650,000 plants, with 357,500 individual trees being the preferred estimate, based on a historic abundance of 14.2% of dominant ravine trees in 1914, or 30 trees/ha, and a historic distribution of some {{convert|203|km2|acres}}.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> Only 27 trees were counted in Georgia in 1981.<ref name=iucn2000/> In 1993 Schwartz estimated that there were only 1500 trees in the wild.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Schwartz1993/> Based on the extrapolation of a survey of five stands of the 2000 survey, attenuated with assumptions that these stands were the most dense, Schwartz ''et al''. calculated the population in its native habitat to be between 500 and 4,000 individuals, with none capable of reproduction. The most likely population was calculated to be 1,361 individuals, not including the population west of the Apalachicola. Using their estimate of the pre-decline population, they thus calculated a minimum 98.5% decline in population over the last 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> The [[IUCN]] estimated that the population is 999 mature individuals in its native habitat (although, confusingly, it also states the population to consist of between 500 and 600 trees elsewhere in the assessment), of which less than ten were known to produce male or female cones.<ref name=iucn2010/> It stated that the population continued to decrease,<ref name=iucn2010/> although the decline may be reversible should the causes of infection be better understood.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> IUCN population viability analyses indicate that [[extinction]] within its native range is inevitable.<ref name=iucn2010/>\n\nThe IUCN stated the total [[extent of occurrence]] is estimated to be about {{convert|200|km2|acres}},<ref name=iucn2010/> this is the same as the historical distribution.

Maclay Gardens State Park]] in Tallahassee.<ref name=Alfieri1987/> \n\nAccording to one older theory logging of shade trees may stress individuals of this species, which does not like being suddenly exposed to full sunlight, conducing infection.<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/>\n\nAnother threat to the population is destruction by [[White-tailed deer|deer]].<ref name=iucn2010/> Deer preferentially select young trees of this species to rub their new antlers on, sometimes killing them. Feral pigs may also uproot and destroy seedlings.<ref name=Esser1993/> Another possible cause of the historical decline may be changes in the environment due to fire suppression, and changes in water tables linked to the construction of dams.<ref name=iucn2010/> Specifically, many trees were killed when the land was flooded<ref name=Esser1993/> in the construction of the [[Jim Woodruff Dam]] impounding [[Lake Seminole]].<ref name=USBG/>\n\nAccording to one writer, the population of the species may have been impacted by postglacial [[global warming]], as it may possibly be better adapted to the cooler climate found in Florida during the last [[ice age]]. It may not have been able to move north due to poor dispersal abilities. This is based on the fact that the introduced population on the Biltmore estate in North Carolina appears to be doing fine, and is even reproducing naturally -squirrels plant the seeds in the flower beds and these germinate.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n===Actions===\n[[Fungicide]] treatment with [[Maneb]] has been shown to be remarkably effective, with plants showing renewed growth afterwards with little to no fungal infection. It has been applied since 1967,<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/> but as of 1987 it is not specifically labelled for use in ''Torreya''.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nA theory perhaps first put forward in 1990 by Greg Seamon, land manager at the [[Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve]], was that ''Torreya taxifolia'' may be somehow suffering from the suppression of fire in the upland longleaf pine-wiregrass sandhill ecosystems. However, after regular fires were again instituted in the 1990s in the preserve, this appeared not to have an effect, with the species experiencing an increased three percent annual mortality at the turn of the century.<ref name=Vaughan2001/>\n\nTwo years after declaring the species an endangered species, in 1986, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] published a recovery plan. The chief tactic was to produce a genetically diverse collection of trees for reproduction and reintroduction into the wild. Other priorities were to protect the habitat of remaining populations, and to study the disease and methods of [[Plant propagation|propagation]].<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/>\n\nPlants in general attract very little funding compared to [[vertebrate]]s, this tree is no different. The US federal government spent only $1,500 on conservation of the species in 1993, placing it 884th out of 926 endangered species. Schwartz ''et al''. stated that recovery is possible, but this will require a greater level of commitment and a dedicated increase in funding.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nSmall experiments by Schwartz and Hermann in the 1990s found that planting cuttings in the native habitat is possible. Schwartz ''et al''. recommended population augmentation by planting volunteers isolated by more than 100m from extant stands to reduce chance of contamination.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted for conservation purposes outside of its native range.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> Plants outside of its historic native distribution are undamaged by fungal disease and produce viable seed.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> In Tallahassee for example, not far from the native range, a number of large trees had been grown for almost a century in the Alfred B.

She theorised than during the [[Eemian|last interglacial]] (the geologically short periods between [[ice age]]s) and the proceeding ones, the species grew further north. According to her theories, because there might have been an unknown and now extinct animal in the past which was better suited to eat and defecate the seeds, or otherwise move the seeds, the species was now \"stuck\" behind the Apalachicola which served as a refuge habitat for a [[Relict (biology)|relict population]] during the long periods of glacial conditions which characterised the [[Pleistocene]]. She further supposed that because the arils contain [[terpene]]s which are usually toxic for mammals, and the seed's shell is so thin that mammal molars would crush the seeds, that the purported extinct animal might not be a mammal and instead suggested some unknown species of large [[tortoise]] as the extinct ecological partner.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n==Uses==\nIt is has been far too rare to harvest commercially since the 1950s, but it has a beautiful, yellow-coloured, close-grained wood. The timber is lightweight, hard, strong and highly durable.<ref name=Esser1993/> In the 19th century, the tree was harvested for wood that was used as fence posts,<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> shingles,<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> cabinets,<ref name=Esser1993/> [[Christmas tree]]s,<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Esser1993/> firewood,<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> and as a fuel for riverboats on the [[Apalachicola River]].<ref name=iucn2010/> Fences made of this wood in the 1910s were still good in the 1970s.<ref name=Esser1993/> In the 1830s it was locally abundant enough for the trees to be harvested to be sawn into planks, which were much used in the construction of the village of [[Aspalaga Landing]]. In this era it was also recommended as making excellent posts for fencing, not being liable to attack by insects.<ref name=Nuttall1849/>\n\nWhen the trunks are damaged, the trees yield a small quantity of pasty, viscous, blood-red [[turpentine]], which can be dissolved in alcohol, but has a very powerful and unpleasant odour.<ref name=Nuttall1849/> \n\n===Cultivation===\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted outside of its native range as an ornamental, and is found in private gardens, [[arboretum|arboreta]] and botanical gardens.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/>\n\nIt was first imported to grow in Europe in 1840. Large trees were to be found in [[Germany]] by the 1860s.<ref name=Henkel1865/> It is tolerably hardy, but grows very slowly in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and as such was only recommended for collectors.<ref name=Nelson1866/>\n\nIt has occasionally been planted as a landscape tree around [[Tallahassee]], and one such specimen in [[Lee, Florida]] has achieved {{convert|30|ft}}.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> Some large specimens are grown elsewhere in botanical gardens. The [[champion tree]] of the species is in a private garden in [[Norlina, North Carolina]], having a height of {{convert|45|ft}}, a trunk diameter of {{convert|88|cm}} [[Diameter at breast height|dbh]] and a canopy width of {{convert|40|ft}} in 1996.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> It has been said to endure winter temperatures of {{convert|-31|C}} in North Carolina without much problem.<ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n===Propagation===\nCuttings of ''Torreya'' shoot-tips often show fungal contamination. Experimental studies with weekly sprayed applications of a combinations of [[Systemic pesticide|systemic]] [[fungicide]]s, such as [[thiophanate-methyl]] combined with [[zinc]] and [[Maneb]] or [[thiabendazole]], were able to eliminate the fungi from stock plants after four weeks, although these preparations were not US government approved as of 1987.<ref name=Alfieri1987/> \n\nTissue culture methods of propagation were being investigated as of 1987.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe first person to notice that the trees were dying was the forester L. T. Nieland in 1938, although he never wrote a formal paper about it. In the same year Kurz made a detailed study of the ecology of species and mentioned that there was no danger to the species vanishing from its habitat if lumbering would cease.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> In 1954 Kurz and R. K. Godfrey surveyed the population and noticed no symptoms of decline. However, in 1962 Godfrey and Kurz, having surveyed the species again, reported that the natural stands of this species, which was historically never widely distributed, were dying off and extinction seemed assured, if not already accomplished.<ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=GodfreyKurz1962>{{cite journal |last=Godfrey |first=R. K. |last2=Kurz |first2=H. |date=1962 |title=The Florida Torreya destined for extinction |url= |journal=Science |volume=136 |pages=900-902 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> By 1962, only non-reproductive sprouts regrowing from the top-killed stumps remained in the wild,<ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=GodfreyKurz1962/> a situation which has persisted throughout the 20th century.<ref name=FNA/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> They attributed this to deforestation due to the lumber trade.<ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=GodfreyKurz1962/> However, samples of the afflicted trees were sent to the [[University of Florida]], where Erdman West suggested the decline appeared due to a fungal blight of some kind. In a 1967 article S. A. Alfieri Jr. ''et al''. of the [[Florida Department of Agriculture]] presented their research of the phenomenon. The disease presents itself as a small, yellowish spot on the needles (leaves) -one or more per leaf, which soon spreads throughout the leaf until it dies, turns brown and falls off. Subsequently the disease spreads into the twig, and all of the needles fall off, leaving only a tuft of new growth at the tip. The disease spreads in stages, first affecting portions, later the entire tree. Severely infected trees eventually loose most of their needles and twigs. Fungal fruiting structures grow on wholly necrotic tissue on the underside of the leaves, twigs and buds. In some cases, the stems of affected or dead trees also showed fungal [[canker]]. Young seedlings are also affected, but less severely than older trees. Trees growing in the shade are more affected than those in full sunlight.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> \n\nIn 1985 the [[phytopathologist]] Nabih Elias El-Gholl, also of the Florida Department of Agriculture, was able to prove that there were at least two pathogens involved; the leaf-spot disease presented as light greyish-green spots, which later became tan-coloured, and were up to 8.4mm long and as wide as the needle, with brown, irregularly-shaped, 2.4mm long \u00d7 2mm wide, necrotic centres and were able to infect the plants in the absence of wounds within three days of inoculation. Initially only a few spots, maximally four, developed per plant. After some two weeks the infected needles died and fell off -by this time the undersides had developed spore structures,<ref name=El-Gholl1985>{{cite journal |last=El-Gholl |first=Nabih Elias |date=1985 |title=''Fusarium lateritium'' Causing Needle Spots on ''Torreya taxifolia'' in Florida |url=https://www.apsnet.org/publications/PlantDisease/BackIssues/Documents/1985Abstracts/PD_69_905a.htm |journal=Plant Disease |volume=69 |pages=905 |doi=10.1094/PD-69-905a |access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> which were primarily found along the two grey bands of stomata, but may also occur on the twigs.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nThe canker disease presents as elongated [[fusiform]] swellings on the stems which eventually may break open. They are often found at the base of the trees.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nIn 1993 Schwartz, who has spent much of his career researching the conservation of this species, and Sharon M. Hermann, reported on the progression of the disease. They monitored a census population of some 100 trees for four years, in this time 10% died, mostly the smaller individuals. Most plants consisted of multi-stemmed, regenerating stumps; the mean length of the longest stems were less than one meter. Less than half of the plants showed any growth in length during these four years, and 32% lost their primary stem, which meant the mean size of individuals within the population was decreasing. Death was not strongly related to specific location or if the plants showed disease symptoms, although stem mortality was higher with trees showing a higher severity of foliar pathogens.<ref name=Schwartz1993/> In 2000 Schwartz ''et al''. reported that despite Godfrey and Kurz's 1962 prediction, a small population size, continued population losses, and no known seed production for decades, extinction of ''T. taxifolia'' had not yet occurred, and although the population would likely steadily decline, it was unlikely to go extinct within the next 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\n===Status===\nThis was one of the first federally listed {{C|Endangered flora of the United States|endangered plant species in the United States}} in 1984 (Federal Register 1/23/84).<ref name=FNA/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref name=USFWS1984/> It is one of only two species of conifer protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]].<ref name=Earle2020/> It was listed as \"[[threatened species|threatened]]\" within the state of Florida by 1987 (Florida Statutes Section 581.185),<ref name=Alfieri1987/> again in 1994 by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,<ref name=Esser1993/> and in 1998 the status in Florida was changed to \"[[endangered]]\".<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Coile1998/> In 2002 it was added to the list of \"endangered\" plants of Georgia.<ref name=PLANTS/><ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/> It has been a \"[[critically endangered]]\" species on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 1998, in 2000 this was said to be due to estimated 98% decline in mature individuals since the early 1950s.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=iucn2000/>\n\n===Population===\nIn 2000 Schwartz and colleagues calculated that before the start of the decline, the original population of ''T. taxifolia'' may have been 300,000 between 650,000 plants, with 357,500 individual trees being the preferred estimate, based on a historic abundance of 14.2% of dominant ravine trees in 1914, or 30 trees/ha, and a historic distribution of some {{convert|203|km2|acres}}.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> Only 27 trees were counted in Georgia in 1981.<ref name=iucn2000/> In 1993 Schwartz estimated that there were only 1500 trees in the wild.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Schwartz1993/> Based on the extrapolation of a survey of five stands of the 2000 survey, attenuated with assumptions that these stands were the most dense, Schwartz ''et al''. calculated the population in its native habitat to be between 500 and 4,000 individuals, with none capable of reproduction. The most likely population was calculated to be 1,361 individuals, not including the population west of the Apalachicola. Using their estimate of the pre-decline population, they thus calculated a minimum 98.5% decline in population over the last 50 years.<ref name=Schwartz2000/> The [[IUCN]] estimated that the population is 999 mature individuals in its native habitat (although, confusingly, it also states the population to consist of between 500 and 600 trees elsewhere in the assessment), of which less than ten were known to produce male or female cones.<ref name=iucn2010/> It stated that the population continued to decrease,<ref name=iucn2010/> although the decline may be reversible should the causes of infection be better understood.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> IUCN population viability analyses indicate that [[extinction]] within its native range is inevitable.<ref name=iucn2010/>\n\nThe IUCN stated the total [[extent of occurrence]] is estimated to be about {{convert|200|km2|acres}},<ref name=iucn2010/> this is the same as the historical distribution. Schwartz states that these has been no logging in its habitat since the 1950s and that this species has experienced no [[habitat loss]]: the vast majority of the original ravine forest habitat remains.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\n===Threats===\nThe most significant current threat to the species is the continued reproductive failure associated with [[fungal]] pathogens.<ref name=iucn2010/><ref name=Smith2010/> Individuals do not reach reproductive size before being top-killed.<ref name=iucn2010/> Almost no plants are able to reach a reproductive size, and where seeds do form, these are soft, crumbly and not viable.<ref name=Esser1993/> Up to ten species of fungi have been found growing in infected ''Torreya taxifolia''.<ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=Alfieri1987/><ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date= |title=''Fusarium torreyae'' sp nov., a pathogen causing canker disease of Florida torreya (''Torreya taxifolia''), a critically endangered conifer restricted to northern Florida and southwestern Georgia |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232705140 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nAlfieri ''et al''. were able to [[Isolate (biology)|isolate]] five species of fungi in 1967 from the stems and leaves, but failed to isolate any of the fungi from the cankered stems on the media they were using, [[potato dextrose agar]]. They reported that the disease appeared to implicate species tentatively identified as ''[[Physalospora]]'' and ''[[Macrophoma]]'', but also isolated the fungi ''[[Rhizoctonia solani]]'', ''[[Sclerotium rolfsii]]'' and a ''[[Sphaeropsis]]'' species from the infected tissue.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> They attempted to reproduce the infections by spraying the isolates, as well as pulverised [[Plant litter|stem and leaf litter]], on seedlings grown in greenhouses from unaffected ornamental trees in local parks, but their experiments failed to induce the disease in their seedlings.<ref name=Alfieri1967/> Nonetheless reports from 1975 and 1988 continued to identify the responsible fungi as these previous two species.<ref name=Esser1993/> In 1985 El-Gholl was finally able to prove [[Koch's postulates]] with ''[[Gibberella baccata]]'' (as ''[[Fusarium lateritium]]'', an [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]] isolate) as the agent responsible for the leaf spot pathogen, but he was unable to replicate the disease causing the stem cankers.<ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=El-Gholl1985/><ref name=MycoBank>{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/Biolomics.aspx?Table=Mycobank&Rec=34922&Fields=All |title=''Gibberella baccata'' |last=Bensch |first=K. |date=2020 |website=MycoBank |publisher=International Mycological Association (IMA) and the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> In 1987 Alfieri ''et al''. reported on experiments with this fungus, as well as another two more species isolated from the infected plants, ''[[Xylocoremium flabelliforme]]'' (the anamorph state of ''[[Xylaria cubensis]]'') and the ''Macrophoma'' which they had re-identified as a ''[[Phyllosticta]]'' species, the anamorph form of ''[[Guignardia]]''. They were able to reproduce El-Gholl's results, but again failed to identify the canker producing agent, the other two isolates proved not to cause any disease.<ref name=Smith2010/><ref name=Alfieri1987/> In a 1996 article Lee ''et al''. mentioned that the [[endophyte]] they were studying, ''[[Pestalotiopsis microspora]]'' might be the cause of the decline of the species, because a strain they isolated produced a hitherto unknown [[cytotoxin]] they named \"[[torreyanic acid]]\", a [[dimeric]] [[quinone]].<ref name=Lee1996>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Julie Chu-Li |last2=Strobel |first2=Gary A. |last3=Lobkovsky |first3=Emil |last4=Clardy |first4=Jon |date=17 May 1996 |title=Torreyanic Acid: A Selectively Cytotoxic Quinone Dimer from the Endophytic Fungus ''Pestalotiopsis microspora'' |journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry |volume=61 |issue=10 |pages=3232\u20133233 |doi=10.1021/jo960471x}}</ref> ''P. microspora'' is a usually [[Commensalism|commensal]] fungus commonly found within the tissues of many plant species, and is only rarely a pathogen -in these cases it is an [[Opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogen]].<ref name=Smith2010/> However, recent research has identified a previously unknown species of ''[[Fusarium]]'' may be the cause.<ref name=iucn2010/> \n\nBy 1987 the canker disease had spread to plants cultivated outside the native range such as in the [[University of Florida]] campus in [[Gainesville]] and in the [[Alfred B. Maclay Gardens State Park]] in Tallahassee.<ref name=Alfieri1987/> \n\nAccording to one older theory logging of shade trees may stress individuals of this species, which does not like being suddenly exposed to full sunlight, conducing infection.<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/><ref name=Smith2010/>\n\nAnother threat to the population is destruction by [[White-tailed deer|deer]].<ref name=iucn2010/> Deer preferentially select young trees of this species to rub their new antlers on, sometimes killing them. Feral pigs may also uproot and destroy seedlings.<ref name=Esser1993/> Another possible cause of the historical decline may be changes in the environment due to fire suppression, and changes in water tables linked to the construction of dams.<ref name=iucn2010/> Specifically, many trees were killed when the land was flooded<ref name=Esser1993/> in the construction of the [[Jim Woodruff Dam]] impounding [[Lake Seminole]].<ref name=USBG/>\n\nAccording to one writer, the population of the species may have been impacted by postglacial [[global warming]], as it may possibly be better adapted to the cooler climate found in Florida during the last [[ice age]]. It may not have been able to move north due to poor dispersal abilities. This is based on the fact that the introduced population on the Biltmore estate in North Carolina appears to be doing fine, and is even reproducing naturally -squirrels plant the seeds in the flower beds and these germinate.<ref name=Barlow2001/>\n\n===Actions===\n[[Fungicide]] treatment with [[Maneb]] has been shown to be remarkably effective, with plants showing renewed growth afterwards with little to no fungal infection. It has been applied since 1967,<ref name=Esser1993/><ref name=Alfieri1967/> but as of 1987 it is not specifically labelled for use in ''Torreya''.<ref name=Alfieri1987/>\n\nA theory perhaps first put forward in 1990 by Greg Seamon, land manager at the [[Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve]], was that ''Torreya taxifolia'' may be somehow suffering from the suppression of fire in the upland longleaf pine-wiregrass sandhill ecosystems. However, after regular fires were again instituted in the 1990s in the preserve, this appeared not to have an effect, with the species experiencing an increased three percent annual mortality at the turn of the century.<ref name=Vaughan2001/>\n\nTwo years after declaring the species an endangered species, in 1986, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] published a recovery plan. The chief tactic was to produce a genetically diverse collection of trees for reproduction and reintroduction into the wild. Other priorities were to protect the habitat of remaining populations, and to study the disease and methods of [[Plant propagation|propagation]].<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/>\n\nPlants in general attract very little funding compared to [[vertebrate]]s, this tree is no different. The US federal government spent only $1,500 on conservation of the species in 1993, placing it 884th out of 926 endangered species. Schwartz ''et al''. stated that recovery is possible, but this will require a greater level of commitment and a dedicated increase in funding.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nSmall experiments by Schwartz and Hermann in the 1990s found that planting cuttings in the native habitat is possible. Schwartz ''et al''. recommended population augmentation by planting volunteers isolated by more than 100m from extant stands to reduce chance of contamination.<ref name=Schwartz2000/>\n\nThe tree is well-represented in cultivation, and is widely planted for conservation purposes outside of its native range.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/> Plants outside of its historic native distribution are undamaged by fungal disease and produce viable seed.<ref name=Kadis2008CenPlCon/><ref name=Earle2020/><ref name=Schwartz2000/> In Tallahassee for example, not far from the native range, a number of large trees had been grown for almost a century in the Alfred B.

[[Dr. Owen Hunt]], [[Kevin McKidd]], approaches Dr. [[Cristina Yang]], [[Sandra Oh]], and asks her to move in with him. She willingly agrees but warns that she is a bit drunk and her judgement is impaired. [[Dr. Meredith Grey]], [[Ellen Pompeo]] thinks that there is something going on between Owen and [[Dr. Teddy Altman]], [[Kim Raver]]. One of the surgical residents, Dr. Reed Adamson, played by [[Nora Zehetner]], wants to sleep with plastic surgeon [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Dr. Mark Sloan]], [[Eric Dane]]. She approaches him at the party and they begin talking. [[Dr. Miranda Bailey]], [[Chandra Wilson]], with her boyfriend Dr. Ben Warren, [[Jason George]], sets rules for how they are to act around each other at work. She does not believe in PDA in the workplace and does not want everyone to know they are in a relationship. Teddy is coming home and walks in on her nonexclusive boyfriend Mark sleeping with Reed.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631568/synopsis?ref_=tt_stry_pl</ref> \n\nThe next day, an elderly woman named Betty, played by [[Marion Ross]] is brought into the [[Emergency Room]] and is in need of surgery on her arm for broken bones she received from a car accident. Across the ER, an older man named Henry is brought in for abdominal injuries he received from passing out. The doctors diagnose him with an irregular heart rhythm. Henry recognizes Betty from across the room. They are old friends who have not seen each other in many years. They begin to talk and reminisce, but have to part to get tests done. Bailey is acting extra cheerful and Derek and Mark notice this in the elevator. She is humming a song and being very friendly. After she leaves, Ben enters humming the same song. He, too, is very happy. Derek and Mark infer that they are dating and had spent the night together. [[Dr. Alex Karev]], [[Justin Chambers]], treats a young patient named Hayley, played by [[Demi Lovato]]; she was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. Her parents brought her in because she was trying to claw her eyes out. When she heard that she is being committed to the psychiatric center, she yells \"I'm not crazy\" and threatens to kill herself with a syringe.<ref>http://vitemo.com/tv/greys-anatomy-season-6-episode-22-recap-and-review-shiny-happy-people.html</ref> Karev calms her down by agreeing to run more tests on her. Another patient, named Amber, is in the hospital to get hair restoration surgery. She received severe wounds from a car fire and has half of her head and face burned. Betty and Henry tell their doctors about their past together. Betty was best friends with Henry's fianc\u00e9. They were in love, but could not be together because of the scandal it would cause.\n\nHayley gets more tests done to determine if she really is schizophrenic; Karev thinks that she was misdiagnosed. Later, [[Dr. Lexie Grey]], [[Chyler Leigh]] asks Karev if they are a couple and he says they are. Meredith warns Christina about her suspicions of Owen and Teddy. This causes Christina to question her relationship with Owen and makes her mad at Meredith for \"planting a seed of doubt\".<ref>http://vitemo.com/tv/greys-anatomy-season-6-episode-22-recap-and-review-shiny-happy-people/page-2.html</ref> At lunch, Lexie helps Karev find a book that will help diagnose Hayley. He then runs a final test on her, which proves him right. Hayley is not schizophrenic. She has a small hole in her inner ear that causes her to be overly sensitive to sound; she can hear everything going on inside her body. \n\nBailey sees Ben who seems to be flirting with a nurse. She is very upset and leaves without giving him a chance to explain himself. The burn victim, Amanda, has an infection in her hand, which means she has to get three fingers cut off, resulting in the postponing of her hair restoration surgery. This upsets her but her good friend Trish, who also is a burn victim, tries to comfort her. Betty and Henry are put in the same room so that they can continue talking and catching up. Henry asks Betty to move in with him but she says she got over him and moved on with her life. \nAmanda is in her surgery and Mark decides to go on with the hair restoration surgery because her infection looks contained. After her surgery, Amanda is upset about the scar the hair restoration surgery left and Trish tells her to be happy that she is alive. Amanda yells at Trish for not letting her feel sad about her situation. Trish has an outburst that shows how she is just bitter about her own situation as Amanda is.<ref>http://vitemo.com/tv/greys-anatomy-season-6-episode-22-recap-and-review-shiny-happy-people/page-2.html</ref> Lexie admits to [[Dr. Callie Torres]], [[Sara Ramirez]] during surgery that she is jealous that Reed slept with Mark even though she says she is over him. \n\nMeredith yells at Owen and says Christina loves him and she hates him. She says she knows he tried to get Teddy fired and she thinks it is because he has feelings for her. She demands that he tells Christina. Callie tells Mark that he should talk to Lexie because she knows they are still in love with each other. Owen brings Christina to the stair well and tells her about Teddy. Christina asks what is going on between them. He says he doesn't know and doesn't have to explain himself. He says Teddy is a trigger for his [[PTSD]]. A pager goes off and reveals that Teddy was in the stair well and heard everything they said. Henry is in cardiac arrest and Betty is very scared for him. They bring him back and right away, Betty agrees to move in with him. He then proposes to her. Hayley wakes up after surgery and is excited to hear normally again. \nBailey yells at Ben for flirting with the nurse. He explains that the nurse is mean to everyone but because he flirts, she is nice to him and it makes his life easier. He says he uses his good flirting on Bailey because he really cares for her. She says she does not have time to play games because she has a child, a full time job, and is going through a divorce. He reassures her that his feelings are real and he is not playing games. Mark tells Lexie that he is still in love with her. She says, \"I have a boyfriend\" and he replies, \"I'm just saying, you could have a husband\". <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631568/synopsis?ref_=tt_stry_pl/</ref> Callie and Dr. [[Arizona Robbins]], [[Jessica Capshaw]] start kissing in the elevator even though they are separated and have not talked in a while.

The theme was thought to be about \"happiness\" and it evolved to how difficult it is to actually find happiness, \"how we all try to be happy, constantly searching for it, faking it even, just in case it actually decides to show up.\" During their writing session, Clack and Nowalk thought of having a scene involving Alex Karev and Lexie leaving the party to \"make whoopie\" but that got cut.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clack|first=Zoanne|title=Zoanne Clack (with Pete Nowalk and Shonda Rhimes) on \"Shiny Happy People\"...|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/05/zoanne-clack-with-pete-nowalk-and-shonda-rhimes-on-shiny-happy-people.html|work=Grey Matter|publisher=American Broadcasting Company|accessdate=August 29, 2012|date=May 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens at a party for the Chief of surgery, [[Dr. Derek Shepherd]], played by [[Patrick Dempsey]]. [[Dr. Owen Hunt]], [[Kevin McKidd]], approaches Dr. [[Cristina Yang]], [[Sandra Oh]], and asks her to move in with him. She willingly agrees but warns that she is a bit drunk and her judgement is impaired. [[Dr. Meredith Grey]], [[Ellen Pompeo]] thinks that there is something going on between Owen and [[Dr. Teddy Altman]], [[Kim Raver]]. One of the surgical residents, Dr. Reed Adamson, played by [[Nora Zehetner]], wants to sleep with plastic surgeon [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Dr. Mark Sloan]], [[Eric Dane]]. She approaches him at the party and they begin talking. [[Dr. Miranda Bailey]], [[Chandra Wilson]], with her boyfriend Dr. Ben Warren, [[Jason George]], sets rules for how they are to act around each other at work. She does not believe in PDA in the workplace and does not want everyone to know they are in a relationship. Teddy is coming home and walks in on her nonexclusive boyfriend Mark sleeping with Reed.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631568/synopsis?ref_=tt_stry_pl</ref> \n\nThe next day, an elderly woman named Betty, played by [[Marion Ross]] is brought into the [[Emergency Room]] and is in need of surgery on her arm for broken bones she received from a car accident. Across the ER, an older man named Henry is brought in for abdominal injuries he received from passing out. The doctors diagnose him with an irregular heart rhythm. Henry recognizes Betty from across the room. They are old friends who have not seen each other in many years. They begin to talk and reminisce, but have to part to get tests done. Bailey is acting extra cheerful and Derek and Mark notice this in the elevator. She is humming a song and being very friendly. After she leaves, Ben enters humming the same song. He, too, is very happy. Derek and Mark infer that they are dating and had spent the night together. [[Dr. Alex Karev]], [[Justin Chambers]], treats a young patient named Hayley, played by [[Demi Lovato]]; she was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. Her parents brought her in because she was trying to claw her eyes out. When she heard that she is being committed to the psychiatric center, she yells \"I'm not crazy\" and threatens to kill herself with a syringe.<ref>http://vitemo.com/tv/greys-anatomy-season-6-episode-22-recap-and-review-shiny-happy-people.html</ref> Karev calms her down by agreeing to run more tests on her. Another patient, named Amber, is in the hospital to get hair restoration surgery. She received severe wounds from a car fire and has half of her head and face burned. Betty and Henry tell their doctors about their past together. Betty was best friends with Henry's fianc\u00e9. They were in love, but could not be together because of the scandal it would cause.\n\nHayley gets more tests done to determine if she really is schizophrenic; Karev thinks that she was misdiagnosed. Later, [[Dr. Lexie Grey]], [[Chyler Leigh]] asks Karev if they are a couple and he says they are. Meredith warns Christina about her suspicions of Owen and Teddy. This causes Christina to question her relationship with Owen and makes her mad at Meredith for \"planting a seed of doubt\".<ref>http://vitemo.com/tv/greys-anatomy-season-6-episode-22-recap-and-review-shiny-happy-people/page-2.html</ref> At lunch, Lexie helps Karev find a book that will help diagnose Hayley. He then runs a final test on her, which proves him right. Hayley is not schizophrenic. She has a small hole in her inner ear that causes her to be overly sensitive to sound; she can hear everything going on inside her body. \n\nBailey sees Ben who seems to be flirting with a nurse. She is very upset and leaves without giving him a chance to explain himself. The burn victim, Amanda, has an infection in her hand, which means she has to get three fingers cut off, resulting in the postponing of her hair restoration surgery. This upsets her but her good friend Trish, who also is a burn victim, tries to comfort her. Betty and Henry are put in the same room so that they can continue talking and catching up. Henry asks Betty to move in with him but she says she got over him and moved on with her life. \nAmanda is in her surgery and Mark decides to go on with the hair restoration surgery because her infection looks contained. After her surgery, Amanda is upset about the scar the hair restoration surgery left and Trish tells her to be happy that she is alive. Amanda yells at Trish for not letting her feel sad about her situation. Trish has an outburst that shows how she is just bitter about her own situation as Amanda is.<ref>http://vitemo.com/tv/greys-anatomy-season-6-episode-22-recap-and-review-shiny-happy-people/page-2.html</ref> Lexie admits to [[Dr. Callie Torres]], [[Sara Ramirez]] during surgery that she is jealous that Reed slept with Mark even though she says she is over him. \n\nMeredith yells at Owen and says Christina loves him and she hates him. She says she knows he tried to get Teddy fired and she thinks it is because he has feelings for her. She demands that he tells Christina. Callie tells Mark that he should talk to Lexie because she knows they are still in love with each other. Owen brings Christina to the stair well and tells her about Teddy. Christina asks what is going on between them. He says he doesn't know and doesn't have to explain himself. He says Teddy is a trigger for his [[PTSD]]. A pager goes off and reveals that Teddy was in the stair well and heard everything they said. Henry is in cardiac arrest and Betty is very scared for him. They bring him back and right away, Betty agrees to move in with him. He then proposes to her. Hayley wakes up after surgery and is excited to hear normally again. \nBailey yells at Ben for flirting with the nurse. He explains that the nurse is mean to everyone but because he flirts, she is nice to him and it makes his life easier. He says he uses his good flirting on Bailey because he really cares for her. She says she does not have time to play games because she has a child, a full time job, and is going through a divorce. He reassures her that his feelings are real and he is not playing games. Mark tells Lexie that he is still in love with her. She says, \"I have a boyfriend\" and he replies, \"I'm just saying, you could have a husband\". <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631568/synopsis?ref_=tt_stry_pl/</ref> Callie and Dr. [[Arizona Robbins]], [[Jessica Capshaw]] start kissing in the elevator even though they are separated and have not talked in a while. That night, Christina tells Meredith that she is not moving in with Owen and Meredith says Christina gets her own room in the house she and Derek are building in the woods.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631568/synopsis?ref_=ttpl_pl_syn</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{imdb episode|1631568|Shiny Happy People}}\n* {{TV.com episode|greys-anatomy/shiny-happy-people-1339315/|Shiny Happy People}}\n\n{{Grey's Anatomy episodes|6}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Shiny Happy People (''Grey's Anatomy'')}}\n\n[[Category:2010 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 6) episodes]]\n[[Category:2010 television episodes]]\n", "name_user": "BrownHairedGirl", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing fromCategory:2010 television episodesusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_Happy_People_(Grey%27s_Anatomy)"}
