Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  Lt. Thomas C.

His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and made contact.  The Admiral tasked Lt.

Turner also requested formation of a \"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]].  It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt.

Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

From \"A\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. At those commands new Seabees will go through four-weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills. ECS is also required for those who report to a unit in the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]]. ECS is basic combat-training in: map reading, combat first aid, conducting recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent learning basic marksmanship and qualifying with a [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]] or [[M16 rifle#M16A3|M16A3]] rifle and the [[Beretta M9|M9 service pistol]]. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|MK 19]] 40mm grenade launcher, the [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] .50-caliber machine gun, or the [[M240 machine gun]]. Many reserve units still field the [[M60 machine gun]]. Until 2012, Seabees wore the [[U.S. Woodland]] camouflage uniform or the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the last U.S. military to do so, but have transitioned to the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW).

For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.  It was instituted by Rear Admiral Eugene J. Peltier CEC and has been given annually since 1960. He is a former head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (1959\u20131962).\n* WWII U.S.N.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

[[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]], commander V Amphibious Corps had ordered a review to get a grip on the problem.  VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  Lt. Thomas C.

His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and made contact.  The Admiral tasked Lt. Crist to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  Lt. Crist started by getting men from CB 10.  By December 1, 1943 he had close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted at [[Waipio]] Amphibious Operating Base on Oahu.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>\n\nIn November the Navy had a hard lesson with underwater obstructions, coral, and tides at [[invasion of Tarawa|Tarawa]].

Turner also requested formation of a \"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]].  It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt. Crist was briefly the first training officer until when he was made Commander of UDT 3.  When UDT 3 returned from Leyte in November 1944 the team became the training instructors of the school and Lt. Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW). It was created in 1993 for both officers and enlisted personnel.  Only members attached to a qualifying NCF unit are eligible for the SCW pin. The qualifying units include: NMCBs, ACBs, NCF Support Units (NCFSU), UCTs, and NCRs.\n[[File:Fleet Marine Force insignia authorized for US Naval personnel.jpg|350px|right|thumb|Fleet Marine Force insignia authorized for US Naval personnel: Officer, Enlisted, and Chaplain]]\n\nThe [[Fleet Marine Force Insignia]] or Fleet Marine Force pin (FMF pin), are for issue to those USN officers and enlisted trained and qualified to support the U. S. Marine Corps. Those Seabees assigned with the Fleet Marine Force can earn the FMF pin.  The FMF pin comes in three classes : enlisted, officer, and chaplain. For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.  It was instituted by Rear Admiral Eugene J. Peltier CEC and has been given annually since 1960. He is a former head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (1959\u20131962).\n* WWII U.S.N.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.  A barges measures 97'x35'.<ref>Doctor Lykes, Marad, U.S. Dept of Transportation, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC [https://www.marad.dot.gov/sh/ShipHistory/Detail/5566]</ref>  A barge carrier also has storage tanks of nearly 36000 m\u00b3(9,510,194 gal.) volume built in its sides and double hull, allowing it to be used also as a tanker.

The capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].\nAfter the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.\n\nModern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.<ref name=\"McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67\u201383|doi=10.2307/530562|jstor=530562}}</ref>\n\nThe empire continued to grow with no end in sight.

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up.

Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica. In the battle of Tarapac\u00e1 on 7 January 1842, Peruvian militias formed by the commander Juan Buend\u00eda defeated a detachment led by Bolivian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, who died in the confrontation. Bolivian troops left Tacna, Arica and Tarapac\u00e1 in February 1842, retreating towards Moquegua and Puno.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Albarrac\u00edn: La portentosa Heroicidad|last=Cavagnaro Orellana|first=Luis|publisher=Archivo Regional de Tacna|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The battles of Motoni and&nbsp; Orurillo forced the withdrawal of Bolivian forces occupying Peruvian territory and exposed Bolivia to the threat of counter-invasion. The Treaty of Puno was signed on 7 June 1842, ending the war. However, the climate of tension between Lima and La Paz would continue until 1847, when the signing of a Peace and Trade Treaty became effective.\n\nThe estimated population of the main three cities in 1843 was La Paz 300,000, Cochabamba 250,000 and Potosi 200,000.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol III'', London, Charles Knight, 1847, p.528.</ref>\n\nA period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened Bolivia.

The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guapor\u00e9 River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].\n*The second is the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandior\u00e9 Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.\n*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km\u00b2|sqmi}}/13% of the territory).

Presidents [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] (1982\u201385) and [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985\u201389) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005.\n\nBolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. On 11 November 2019, all senior governmental positions were vacated following a coup that forced [[Evo Morales' resignation|the resignation of Evo Morales and his government]].

The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name=\"presidencia.gob.bo\"/>\n\nThe ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]].

The capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]].

Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens.

In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.<ref name=\"McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67\u201383|doi=10.2307/530562|jstor=530562}}</ref>\n\nThe empire continued to grow with no end in sight.

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up.

That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.\n\nBolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].

Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica.

The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.\n\nBetween January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices.

A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time.

On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.\n\nThe country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June.

The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guapor\u00e9 River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].\n*The second is the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandior\u00e9 Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.\n*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km\u00b2|sqmi}}/13% of the territory). The ''[[Altiplano]]'' has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the Andean mountains.

Presidents [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] (1982\u201385) and [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985\u201389) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005.\n\nBolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. On 11 November 2019, all senior governmental positions were vacated following a coup that forced [[Evo Morales' resignation|the resignation of Evo Morales and his government]].

The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name=\"presidencia.gob.bo\"/>\n\nThe ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]].

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n!

E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare: /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non-compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold; for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories is stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, ''xi\u02bc'' nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix /-xi\u02bc/) and non-''xi\u02bc'' nouns. ''Xi\u02bc'' nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n!

E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare: /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non-compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold; for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories is stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, xi\u02bc nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi\u02bc) and non-xi\u02bc nouns. Xi\u02bc nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

Since the 1960s, the city has seen considerable expansion and its various suburbs are linked by a system of [[parkway]]s.\n[[File:Peterborough Parkways.PNG|thumb|alt=A Map with the various parkways highlighted|Peterborough's Parkways]]Despite its large-scale growth, Peterborough has the fastest peak and off-peak travel times for a city of its size in the United Kingdom, due to the construction of the parkways. The [[Local Transport Plan]] anticipates expenditure totalling around \u00a3180 million for the period up to 2010 on major road schemes to accommodate future development.<ref>[http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page-4536 The Second Local Transport Plan] Peterborough City Council, March 2006</ref>\n\nThe [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1/A1(M)]] broadly follows the path of the historic [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] from London, through Peterborough (Junction 17), continuing north a further 335 miles (539&nbsp;km) to central [[Edinburgh]].\n\n==Numbered Junctions==\n[[File:Peterborough Queensgate Roundabout Sign.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A numbered roundabout sign in [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]].]]\n[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] has so many roundabouts and grade separated junctions within its roads and parkway system that junctions are numbered using the same system as is used to number British motorway and major A road junctions to guide and help drivers. Peterborough is to date the only city within the United Kingdom to use the system in this way and has been using this system since the 1970s.\n\n==Parkways and major roads==\nThe parkways were constructed under guidelines from the [[Peterborough Development Corporation]] as a system of high speed roads to connect the new townships which housed London's post-war [[London overspill|overspill]] population and were mostly built from the early 1970s to the late 1980s\n\nThe majority of Peterborough's parkways are dual carriageways, to accommodate the large quantity of local traffic within the city, and national and regional traffic bypassing it. However, due to their age, many of the parkways do not have hard-shoulders. Most of the parkways that bypass the city have graded [[Roundabout interchange|roundabout junctions]].\n\n===Wittering to Norman Cross===\nThe A1 is located just to the west of Peterborough. The road does not play a major part in Peterborough's road network itself although it is a major route. The road goes past RAF Wittering before meeting the A47 at Wansford on a grade separated junction. The A1 then moves south passing very close to the Nene Valley Railway line before reaching the city section of the A605 at another grade separated junction before reaching the A1139/A605 Oundle Section grade separated junction. This is also where the A1(M) starts and as a motorway the road quickly moves southward to reach the A15 at Norman Cross where the motorway moves out of the Peterborough area.\n\n[[Image:UK road A15.svg|130px]]\n\n=== Glinton to New England (Werrington Parkway)===\nThe Werrington Parkway runs from the south of [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]], where the A15 forks into the Peterborough east bypass and main road into the city centre. The road is dual carriageway from [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]] to the centre of Peterborough. There are no grade separated junctions along its route but does contain a number of smaller roundabouts which give direct and easy access to [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]] and its industrial estates. The Parkway then becomes less and standard dual-carriageway to which speed limits are in place to pass through [[New England, Cambridgeshire|New England]] and its retail park along with a major supermarket just prior to reaching the junction with the [[A47 road|A47]] at a major junction. Because of the speed restrictions along the majority of its route traffic coming into [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] are now encouraged to use the Paston Parkway instead to access the city centre and in the past few years signposts have been changed to reflect this.\n\n=== Glinton to Eye (Paston Parkway/A15 Spur Road)===\nThe Paston Parkway bypasses the eastern edge of Peterborough, terminating at a roundabout with the [[A1139 road|A1139]], where the city bypass becomes the Frank Perkins Parkway. The road starts at the southernmost roundabout of the Glinton and heads eastward as a single carriageway before coming to a roundabout for local traffic. The road then becomes a major dual carriageway, although it has only one grade separated junction (with the A47), with the other junctions being roundabouts. In 2008, Peterborough City Council funded the dualling of the northernmost stretch of the Paston Parkway between two roundabouts east of [[Gunthorpe, Peterborough|Gunthorpe]]. This has significantly reduced congestion, as the route is used as a commuter run between the city's Eastern Industry development in [[Fengate, Peterborough|Fengate]] and settlements north of the city.\n\n=== City Centre===\nThe A15 moves southward as a minor dual carriageway from its junction with the A47 with several more roundabouts lining its route. The road goes past some rail sidings that are rarely used and also goes past a retail shopping area on the site of the city's former Parcel Force depot. After passing the city's Toys R Us store the A15 reaches Queensgate Shopping Centre. The road passes the shopping centre between two of the centre's major Car Parks with a 1980s style footbridge crossing over the top. Two roundabouts are located at either end of the complex. The southern roundabout is a junction with the A1179 and gives access to the city's Bus Station (part of the shopping centre). The A15 then passes through the Westgate shopping area and the city's courts before reaching a roundabout where the dual carriageway part of the road ends.\n\n=== City Centre to Norman Cross===\nThe A15 moves out of Peterborough heading southwards as a single carriageway road going past Peterborough United Football Ground. After some traffic light junctions the A15 goes under the A1139 before coming to a roundabout for a business estate. Then the A15 quickly comes to a second roundabout with the A1260 near to [[Serpentine Green]]. Then the A15 moves into open countryside before touching the outermost part of [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]] where it meets the B1091. The A15 again moves into countryside before reaching the A1(M) at a major junction at [[Norman Cross]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1139.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Eye===\nThe A1139 starts as a single carriageway road at a minor roundabout with the A47 at Eye. After a second small roundabout the road passes through some housing before meeting the A15 on a major roundabout near Paston.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"white\" style=\"color: #black\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Eye'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Leicester]], [[A47 road|A47]]\n|Start\n||[[Wisbech]], [[King's Lynn]] [[A47 road|A47]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|[[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]],<br>Peterborough Road\n|}\n\n=== Frank Perkins Parkway===\n[[Image:Frank Perkins Parkway (A1139), Peterborough - geograph.org.uk - 84269.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Frank Perkins Parkway heading towards [[Newark, Cambridgeshire|Newark]] ]]\nThe [[Frank Perkins (engineer)|Frank Perkins]] Parkway is named after Frank Perkins, local founder of [[Perkins Engines]] and is the main Eastern Bypass for Peterborough. The parkway has access to the Perkins Engines site. The Parkway heads south as a major dual carriageway from a major roundabout with the A15 near Eye and quickly passes its first junction, which is restricted to southbound traffic and the Perkins Factory before reaching to Junction 5 which is a major inlet for city bound traffic. The road then passes over the [[River Nene]] and quickly reaches junction 4 where it meets the A605, which runs parallel to junction 3a and the new Stanground bypass out of Peterborough and the old A605, now the B1092. The Frank Perkins Parkway also becomes the Fletton Parkway here.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Frank Perkins Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sleaford]], [[A15 road|A15]] <br>\n|J8\n|[[Parnwell, Cambridgeshire|Parnwell]], Parnwell Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Newark, Oxney Road\n|J7\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|J6\n|[[Perkins Engines|Perkins Engines Access]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], Boongate\n|J5\n|Newark, Boongate\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|J4\n|[[Stanground]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Fletton Parkway===\nFletton Parkway comprises the entire southern bypass of Peterborough and terminates westbound at the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]. The Fletton Parkway officially starts at junction 4 as a major dual carriageway before which it is named the Frank Perkins Parkway due to them being constructed at different times. The later construction of junction 3A, an access road for the Kingston Park distribution centres large IKEA depot and the new A605 Stanground Bypass, meant a major re-design of junction 4 and a new single carriageway road running parallel with the Fletton Parkway from junctions 3A to 4 providing the only link from junction 4 to the Fletton Parkway.  This follows the closure to traffic of the original junction 4 on slip road and removal of the off slip road on safety grounds. At the same time the original on slip road to the Frank Perkins Parkway which actually joined the Fletton Parkway was closed and a new direct on slip road constructed to the north of junction 4.  The dual carriageway quickly passes over the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] before reaching the grade separated junction (3) with the A1260 which links up with the A15 and the A47. The on slip road then forms a third lane and it moves very quickly to junction two, which is a local access road to the Orton and Hampton townships, before reaching its final junction (1) with the Orton Parkway where it reverts to two lanes before the on slip road again forms a third lane. . The Fletton Parkway then meets the A1, the A1(M) and the A605 at Junction 17.\nWhen first opened in 1976 the Fletton Parkway went from the A1 at Haddon to junction 3 where it joined Peterborough's western and northern bypass roads, the Nene Parkway, Soke Parkway and Paston Parkway.  A single carriageway road, Phorpres Way, running parallel to the future course of the Fletton Parkway providing a link to the A15.  Around 1979 when the eastern bypass, the Frank Perkins Parkway, was completed the Fletton Parkway was extended to junction 4 to join it and complete the ring road\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Fletton Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Northbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Southbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Ikea Distribution Centre, Junction 4 access <br>\n|J3A\n|[[Whittlesey]], [[A605 road|A605]], [[Kingston Park Distribution Centre]],\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Bretton]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 Nene Parkway]]\n|J3\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 The Serpentine]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Malborne]], Malborne Way<br>[[The Ortons|Orton Goldhay]], Goldway Way\n|J2\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], Natures Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Centre]], [[A1139 road (England)|A1139 Orton Parkway]]\n|J1\n|[[Great Haddon]], [[Roxhill Distribution Centre]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Northampton]], [[A605 road|A605]]<br>[[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]\n|Terminus\n|[[Huntingdon]], London, [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]]\n|}\n\n=== Orton Parkway===\nThe Orton Parkway is a short minor dual carriageway, that is officially classed as the A1139, although it is not part of the main road itself. There is one small roundabout which provides local access to Orton Goldhay, [[Orton Southgate]] and [[Orton Brimbles]]. The road also helps to carry traffic to events at the nearby [[East of England Showground]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1179.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Longthorpe Parkway and Thorpe Road===\nThe A1179 is a short major road that is half dual carriageway and half single carriageway. It runs from the A1260 to the A15 near [[Queensgate shopping centre, United Kingdom|Queensgate shopping centre]], passing over a metal arch bridge over the East Coast main line just before its eastern end.\n\n[[Image:UK road A1260.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Nene Parkway===\nThe A1260 is a major road that serves the western side of Peterborough. The road is dual-carriageway from its southern terminus with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] at [[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]] to its northern terminus with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] at [[Longthorpe]]. The road is also known as the \"Nene Parkway\" and serves as major route from getting from the southern end of Peterborough to the Northern end without having to travel into the centre of the city via the [[A15 road (England)|A15]]. The road itself starts at Hampton at a small roundabout with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] where after it goes past [[Serpentine Green]] at another roundabout before it very quickly heads to a major junction where its meets the A1139 (Fletton Parkway).  After that junction the road takes on the form of a major dual-carriageway with its own grade separated junctions where it meets the [[A605]] on a restricted junction before passing over the River Nene before meeting the A1179 (Longthorpe Parkway) on another junction. After that junction the road quickly heads north before coming to a major junction with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] where the road ends on a large roundabout with the A47 passing over on top. In 2008, the city council undertook improvements to the roundabout at the southern terminus of the parkway, increasing the southbound and eastbound approaches to three approach lanes and adding a third lane northbound on the roundabout for traffic using a newly constructed running-lane between junctions 1 and 2, where there are now three lanes northbound. Traffic lights have also been installed. Traffic signals are also planned on the roundabout at the northern terminus of the parkway with the A47 Soke Parkway.\n\n[[Image:UK road A47.svg|130px]]\n\n=== Thorney to Eye===\n\nThe A47 heads west to Peterborough from Wisbech. It bypasses Thorney along a minor dual carriageway. Eye is bypassed by a single carriageway where the A47 meets the [[A16 road (England)|A16]] and then the [[A1139 road|A1139]] at separate roundabouts. The A47 then becomes dual carriageway, passing a large rubbish tip to reach a major junction with the [[A15 road|A15]] at Paston.\n\n=== Soke Parkway (Longthorpe to Wansford)===\n[[Image:A47 at Ailsworth, Peterborough, looking west - geograph.org.uk - 208615.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[A47 road|A47]] Soke Parkway heading towards [[Wansford, Cambridgeshire|Wansford]] ]]\nThe Soke Parkway consists of the entire section of the A47 that runs through Peterborough. As a trunk route, the stretch of road is maintained by the Highways Agency, who have recently undertaken an update of road lighting on the route.  This section of road is called the ''Soke Parkway'' (named after the [[Soke of Peterborough]]). When this was first built, in the mid-1970s, the A47 followed what is now the A1139 ''Paston Parkway''.  Apart from a roundabout on the eastern edge of the city, the parkway is an unbroken major dual carriageway. The road passes over the A15 (Paston Parkway) as a roundabout and than heads westwards passing one grade separated junction with a local road. The road then meets the city section of the A15 on an unusual junction. It crosses the [[East Coast Main Line]] near to a [[Morrisons]] (former [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]]), and Boulevard and Brotherhood retail parks in [[New England, Peterborough|New England]].  After passing the A15 the A47 quickly heads south-westwards, where after passing another grade separated junction for local traffic the road meets the A1260 at [[Longthorpe]]. The Nene Parkway terminates in the Peterborough Longthorpe [[Grade separation|Grade separated junction]] (GSJ) (which opened in December 1987) where it meets the A1260 Nene Parkway. There is a GSJ for [[Bretton, Peterborough|Bretton]] and a [[Sainsbury's]], and it passes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144937/http://www.bwcs.org.uk/ Bretton Woods Community School]. The \u00a31.2m Peterborough [[Westwood, Peterborough|Westwood]] GSJ opened in January 1987. After passing this junction the A47 heads westward into open countryside where it bypasses Castor and Ailsworth before the road becomes a single carriageway before reaching the A1 at Wansford.\n\n[[Image:UK road A605.svg|130px]]\n\n===  Stanground/Kingston Park ===\nThe A605 comes into Peterborough from Whittlesey and comes into the city via the Stanground bypass. Once on the bypass the road heads towards the Kingston Park distribution center and then turns right at the roundabout and continues under the A1139 Fletton Parkway. From there it follows a short piece of single carriageway until it meets up with the Stanground roundabout junction with the A1139 and B1091. From there it continues towards the city and once again under the A1139 and finally meets with the A15 at the Peacock junction just short of the Peterborough United football ground.\n\n===  City Section ===\nThis section of the A605 is now completely isolated from the rest of the other sections of this road. The city section starts at the Town Bridge junction with the A15 near Peterborough United football ground.  The road heads in a westward direction towards the A1 as single carriageway.  The road meets the A1260 at a restricted junction near [[Orton, Peterborough|The Ortons]] with the road passing underneath.  The road than passes into The Ortons, where it provides a lot of local traffic to those who live in those areas. The road passes a couple of roundabouts which allow for local access, and also Ferry Meadows before reaching an industrial estate and Business park, where it meets a spur of the A1139.  The road than passes another small roundabout before reaching the A1.\nTo reach the Peterborough to Elton section of this road you must follow the A1139 spur until the junction with the main A1139 then take a right at the roundabout and follow the signs for the A1/A1(M)/A605 Northampton/Oundle\n\n===  Peterborough to Elton ===\nThe A605 leaves its junction with the A1(M)/A1/A1139 as a major single carriageway by widening to three lanes, before climbing up a hill close to the Peterborough (Morborne) FM & DAB radio transmitter is located. It then moves back to two lanes before moving on to Elton and out of Peterborough.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Stagecoach in Peterborough and Delaine ]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Peterborough}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Peterborough]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2011}}\n{{original research|date=January 2014}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe '''City of [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]]''' in [[East Anglia]] has an extensive and well integrated road network, owing partly to its status as a [[new town]].

The road goes past some rail sidings that are rarely used and also goes past a retail shopping area on the site of the city's former Parcel Force depot. After passing the city's Toys R Us store the A15 reaches Queensgate Shopping Centre. The road passes the shopping centre between two of the centre's major Car Parks with a 1980s style footbridge crossing over the top. Two roundabouts are located at either end of the complex. The southern roundabout is a junction with the A1179 and gives access to the city's Bus Station (part of the shopping centre). The A15 then passes through the Westgate shopping area and the city's courts before reaching a roundabout where the dual carriageway part of the road ends.\n\n=== City Centre to Norman Cross===\nThe A15 moves out of Peterborough heading southwards as a single carriageway road going past Peterborough United Football Ground. After some traffic light junctions the A15 goes under the A1139 before coming to a roundabout for a business estate. Then the A15 quickly comes to a second roundabout with the A1260 near to [[Serpentine Green]]. Then the A15 moves into open countryside before touching the outermost part of [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]] where it meets the B1091. The A15 again moves into countryside before reaching the A1(M) at a major junction at [[Norman Cross]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1139.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Eye===\nThe A1139 starts as a single carriageway road at a minor roundabout with the A47 at Eye. After a second small roundabout the road passes through some housing before meeting the A15 on a major roundabout near Paston.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"white\" style=\"color: #black\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Eye'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Leicester]], [[A47 road|A47]]\n|Start\n||[[Wisbech]], [[King's Lynn]] [[A47 road|A47]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|[[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]],<br>Peterborough Road\n|}\n\n=== Frank Perkins Parkway===\n[[Image:Frank Perkins Parkway (A1139), Peterborough - geograph.org.uk - 84269.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Frank Perkins Parkway heading towards [[Newark, Cambridgeshire|Newark]] ]]\nThe [[Frank Perkins (engineer)|Frank Perkins]] Parkway is named after Frank Perkins, local founder of [[Perkins Engines]] and is the main Eastern Bypass for Peterborough. The parkway has access to the Perkins Engines site. The Parkway heads south as a major dual carriageway from a major roundabout with the A15 near Eye and quickly passes its first junction, which is restricted to southbound traffic and the Perkins Factory before reaching to Junction 5 which is a major inlet for city bound traffic. The road then passes over the [[River Nene]] and quickly reaches junction 4 where it meets the A605, which runs parallel to junction 3a and the new Stanground bypass out of Peterborough and the old A605, now the B1092. The Frank Perkins Parkway also becomes the Fletton Parkway here.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Frank Perkins Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sleaford]], [[A15 road|A15]] <br>\n|J8\n|[[Parnwell, Cambridgeshire|Parnwell]], Parnwell Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Newark, Oxney Road\n|J7\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|J6\n|[[Perkins Engines|Perkins Engines Access]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], Boongate\n|J5\n|Newark, Boongate\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|J4\n|[[Stanground]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Fletton Parkway===\nFletton Parkway comprises the entire southern bypass of Peterborough and terminates westbound at the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]. The Fletton Parkway officially starts at junction 4 as a major dual carriageway before which it is named the Frank Perkins Parkway due to them being constructed at different times. The later construction of junction 3A, an access road for the Kingston Park distribution centres large IKEA depot and the new A605 Stanground Bypass, meant a major re-design of junction 4 and a new single carriageway road running parallel with the Fletton Parkway from junctions 3A to 4 providing the only link from junction 4 to the Fletton Parkway.  This follows the closure to traffic of the original junction 4 on slip road and removal of the off slip road on safety grounds. At the same time the original on slip road to the Frank Perkins Parkway which actually joined the Fletton Parkway was closed and a new direct on slip road constructed to the north of junction 4.  The dual carriageway quickly passes over the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] before reaching the grade separated junction (3) with the A1260 which links up with the A15 and the A47. The on slip road then forms a third lane and it moves very quickly to junction two, which is a local access road to the Orton and Hampton townships, before reaching its final junction (1) with the Orton Parkway where it reverts to two lanes before the on slip road again forms a third lane. . The Fletton Parkway then meets the A1, the A1(M) and the A605 at Junction 17.\nWhen first opened in 1976 the Fletton Parkway went from the A1 at Haddon to junction 3 where it joined Peterborough's western and northern bypass roads, the Nene Parkway, Soke Parkway and Paston Parkway.  A single carriageway road, Phorpres Way, running parallel to the future course of the Fletton Parkway providing a link to the A15.  Around 1979 when the eastern bypass, the Frank Perkins Parkway, was completed the Fletton Parkway was extended to junction 4 to join it and complete the ring road\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Fletton Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Northbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Southbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Ikea Distribution Centre, Junction 4 access <br>\n|J3A\n|[[Whittlesey]], [[A605 road|A605]], [[Kingston Park Distribution Centre]],\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Bretton]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 Nene Parkway]]\n|J3\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 The Serpentine]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Malborne]], Malborne Way<br>[[The Ortons|Orton Goldhay]], Goldway Way\n|J2\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], Natures Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Centre]], [[A1139 road (England)|A1139 Orton Parkway]]\n|J1\n|[[Great Haddon]], [[Roxhill Distribution Centre]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Northampton]], [[A605 road|A605]]<br>[[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]\n|Terminus\n|[[Huntingdon]], London, [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]]\n|}\n\n=== Orton Parkway===\nThe Orton Parkway is a short minor dual carriageway, that is officially classed as the A1139, although it is not part of the main road itself. There is one small roundabout which provides local access to Orton Goldhay, [[Orton Southgate]] and [[Orton Brimbles]]. The road also helps to carry traffic to events at the nearby [[East of England Showground]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1179.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Longthorpe Parkway and Thorpe Road===\nThe A1179 is a short major road that is half dual carriageway and half single carriageway. It runs from the A1260 to the A15 near [[Queensgate shopping centre, United Kingdom|Queensgate shopping centre]], passing over a metal arch bridge over the East Coast main line just before its eastern end.\n\n[[Image:UK road A1260.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Nene Parkway===\nThe A1260 is a major road that serves the western side of Peterborough. The road is dual-carriageway from its southern terminus with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] at [[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]] to its northern terminus with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] at [[Longthorpe]]. The road is also known as the \"Nene Parkway\" and serves as major route from getting from the southern end of Peterborough to the Northern end without having to travel into the centre of the city via the [[A15 road (England)|A15]]. The road itself starts at Hampton at a small roundabout with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] where after it goes past [[Serpentine Green]] at another roundabout before it very quickly heads to a major junction where its meets the A1139 (Fletton Parkway).  After that junction the road takes on the form of a major dual-carriageway with its own grade separated junctions where it meets the [[A605]] on a restricted junction before passing over the River Nene before meeting the A1179 (Longthorpe Parkway) on another junction. After that junction the road quickly heads north before coming to a major junction with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] where the road ends on a large roundabout with the A47 passing over on top. In 2008, the city council undertook improvements to the roundabout at the southern terminus of the parkway, increasing the southbound and eastbound approaches to three approach lanes and adding a third lane northbound on the roundabout for traffic using a newly constructed running-lane between junctions 1 and 2, where there are now three lanes northbound. Traffic lights have also been installed. Traffic signals are also planned on the roundabout at the northern terminus of the parkway with the A47 Soke Parkway.\n\n[[Image:UK road A47.svg|130px]]\n\n=== Thorney to Eye===\n\nThe A47 heads west to Peterborough from Wisbech. It bypasses Thorney along a minor dual carriageway. Eye is bypassed by a single carriageway where the A47 meets the [[A16 road (England)|A16]] and then the [[A1139 road|A1139]] at separate roundabouts. The A47 then becomes dual carriageway, passing a large rubbish tip to reach a major junction with the [[A15 road|A15]] at Paston.\n\n=== Soke Parkway (Longthorpe to Wansford)===\n[[Image:A47 at Ailsworth, Peterborough, looking west - geograph.org.uk - 208615.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[A47 road|A47]] Soke Parkway heading towards [[Wansford, Cambridgeshire|Wansford]] ]]\nThe Soke Parkway consists of the entire section of the A47 that runs through Peterborough. As a trunk route, the stretch of road is maintained by the Highways Agency, who have recently undertaken an update of road lighting on the route.  This section of road is called the ''Soke Parkway'' (named after the [[Soke of Peterborough]]). When this was first built, in the mid-1970s, the A47 followed what is now the A1139 ''Paston Parkway''.  Apart from a roundabout on the eastern edge of the city, the parkway is an unbroken major dual carriageway. The road passes over the A15 (Paston Parkway) as a roundabout and than heads westwards passing one grade separated junction with a local road. The road then meets the city section of the A15 on an unusual junction. It crosses the [[East Coast Main Line]] near to a [[Morrisons]] (former [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]]), and Boulevard and Brotherhood retail parks in [[New England, Peterborough|New England]].  After passing the A15 the A47 quickly heads south-westwards, where after passing another grade separated junction for local traffic the road meets the A1260 at [[Longthorpe]]. The Nene Parkway terminates in the Peterborough Longthorpe [[Grade separation|Grade separated junction]] (GSJ) (which opened in December 1987) where it meets the A1260 Nene Parkway. There is a GSJ for [[Bretton, Peterborough|Bretton]] and a [[Sainsbury's]], and it passes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144937/http://www.bwcs.org.uk/ Bretton Woods Community School]. The \u00a31.2m Peterborough [[Westwood, Peterborough|Westwood]] GSJ opened in January 1987. After passing this junction the A47 heads westward into open countryside where it bypasses Castor and Ailsworth before the road becomes a single carriageway before reaching the A1 at Wansford.\n\n[[Image:UK road A605.PNG|130px]]\n\n===  Stanground/Kingston Park ===\nThe A605 comes into Peterborough from Whittlesey and comes into the city via the Stanground bypass. Once on the bypass the road heads towards the Kingston Park distribution center and then turns right at the roundabout and continues under the A1139 Fletton Parkway. From there it follows a short piece of single carriageway until it meets up with the Stanground roundabout junction with the A1139 and B1091. From there it continues towards the city and once again under the A1139 and finally meets with the A15 at the Peacock junction just short of the Peterborough United football ground.\n\n===  City Section ===\nThis section of the A605 is now completely isolated from the rest of the other sections of this road. The city section starts at the Town Bridge junction with the A15 near Peterborough United football ground.  The road heads in a westward direction towards the A1 as single carriageway.  The road meets the A1260 at a restricted junction near [[Orton, Peterborough|The Ortons]] with the road passing underneath.  The road than passes into The Ortons, where it provides a lot of local traffic to those who live in those areas. The road passes a couple of roundabouts which allow for local access, and also Ferry Meadows before reaching an industrial estate and Business park, where it meets a spur of the A1139.  The road than passes another small roundabout before reaching the A1.\nTo reach the Peterborough to Elton section of this road you must follow the A1139 spur until the junction with the main A1139 then take a right at the roundabout and follow the signs for the A1/A1(M)/A605 Northampton/Oundle\n\n===  Peterborough to Elton ===\nThe A605 leaves its junction with the A1(M)/A1/A1139 as a major single carriageway by widening to three lanes, before climbing up a hill close to the Peterborough (Morborne) FM & DAB radio transmitter is located. It then moves back to two lanes before moving on to Elton and out of Peterborough.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Stagecoach in Peterborough and Delaine ]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Peterborough}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Peterborough]]\n", "name_user": "Rschen7754", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File:UK road A605.PNG\u2192File:UK road A605.svgsvg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_transport_in_Peterborough"}

The exact time of the middle of the year is at [[noon]]. In countries that use [[summer time]] the actual exact time of the midpoint in a common year is at 1:00 p.m, or 11:00 a.m for countries in the southern hemisphere; this is when 182 days and 12 hours have elapsed and there are 182 days and 12 hours remaining. In a leap year in those countries, the midpoint occurs at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on July 2, or 11:00pm on July 1 in the southern hemisphere. This is due to summer time having advanced the time by one hour. It falls on the same day of the week as [[New Year's Day]] in common years.\n\nIn leap years, midpoint of the year occurs at 12:00am.\n\n==Events==\n* [[437]] &ndash; Emperor [[Valentinian III]] begins his reign over the [[Western Roman Empire]].
