The film stars [[Steve Martin]] as Neal Page, a high-strung marketing executive, and [[John Candy]] as Del Griffith, a goodhearted but annoying shower [[curtain ring]] salesman. They share a three-day odyssey of misadventures trying to get Neal home to Chicago in time for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] with his family.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Planes trains automobiles route map.gif|thumb|right|Route taken by Del Griffith and Neal Page in the film]]\nNeal Page is a marketing [[account executive]] on a business trip in New York City, eager to return to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving, which is in two days' time. After attending a tedious meeting that ends without a decision, Neal unsuccessfully attempts to hail a cab during rush hour. He is further delayed after paying a greedy attorney for a cab that is inadvertently stolen by Del Griffith, a loquacious traveling salesman who sells shower curtain rings. Neal and Del cross paths again at [[LaGuardia International Airport|LaGuardia Airport]], where they board a plane to [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. Their plane is diverted to [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport|Wichita]] due to a blizzard in Chicago.\n\nNeal, realizing that he must spend the night in Wichita, agrees to accompany Del to a cheap, dirty motel. During the night, Neal loses his temper with Del and lambasts him. In response, Del admits that he regards Neal as a cold cynic and says that despite how Neal feels, he likes himself and his wife and customers like him. Neal calms down and the two men go back to bed. As they sleep, their cash is stolen by a burglar.\n\nOn the following day, they attempt to reach Chicago by train. To Neal's relief, their assigned seats are in separate cars and they say goodbye prior to boarding. En route, the locomotive breaks down, stranding the passengers in a Missouri field where Del and Neal are reunited. After they reach [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], Del raises cash by selling shower curtain rings to passersby, advertising the items as earrings. Del uses the funds to buy bus tickets, but waits until they are on the road to tell Neal that the tickets are only valid to St. Louis. Upon arrival, Neal inadvertently offends Del over lunch and the two part ways again.\n\nAt the [[St. Louis Lambert International Airport|St. Louis airport]], Neal attempts to rent a car, but finds the space at the distant rental lot empty. After a long and perilous walk back to the terminal, Neal vents his anger with a profanity-laced tirade at the rental agent to no avail. In desperation, he attempts to hire a taxi to Chicago, but insults the dispatcher, who then punches Neal. By chance, Del arrives with his own rental car just in time to rescue Neal. While driving, they find themselves arguing again. The situation is made worse when Del nearly gets them killed on a freeway after [[wrong-way driving|driving in the wrong direction]], scraping between two oncoming semi trailer trucks.\n\nWhile they take a moment to compose themselves by the side of the road, Del's carelessly discarded cigarette sets fire to the car's interior. Neal initially gloats, thinking that Del is liable for the damage. Neal's amusement turns to anger when Del reveals he used Neal's credit card to rent the car after their cards were accidentally switched.\n\nWith his credit cards destroyed in the fire, Neal barters his [[Piaget SA|Piaget]] watch for a motel room for himself. Del is broke and attempts to sleep in the car, which has lost its roof in the fire. Neal eventually feels sympathy for Del and invites him in from the cold and snowy night. They consume Del's collection of [[Miniature (alcohol)|airline liquors]] and laugh about the events of the past two days. The pair resume driving to Chicago the next morning, but their badly damaged car is impounded by the police. They finally make it to Chicago, two days late, in the back of a refrigerator truck.\n\nThe two finally part ways at a [[Chicago \"L\"]] [[LaSalle/Van Buren (CTA station)|station]]. On the train, Neal remembers cryptic comments Del made during the journey and realizes that he may be alone for the holiday. Struck by compassion, Neal quickly returns to the station, finds Del sitting alone and asks why he has not gone home.

They share a three-day odyssey of misadventures trying to get Neal home to Chicago in time for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] with his family.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Planes trains automobiles route map.gif|thumb|right|Route taken by Del Griffith and Neal Page in the film]]\nNeal Page is a marketing [[account executive]] on a business trip in New York City, eager to return to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving, which is in two days' time. After attending a tedious meeting that ends without a decision, Neal unsuccessfully attempts to hail a cab during rush hour. He is further delayed after paying a greedy attorney for a cab that is inadvertently stolen by Del Griffith, a loquacious traveling salesman who sells shower curtain rings. Neal and Del cross paths again at [[LaGuardia International Airport|LaGuardia Airport]], where they board a plane to [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. Their plane is diverted to [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport|Wichita]] due to a blizzard in Chicago.\n\nNeal, realizing that he must spend the night in Wichita, agrees to accompany Del to a cheap, dirty motel. During the night, Neal loses his temper with Del and lambasts him. In response, Del admits that he regards Neal as a cold cynic and says that despite how Neal feels, he likes himself and his wife and customers like him. Neal calms down and the two men go back to bed. As they sleep, their cash is stolen by a burglar.\n\nOn the following day, they attempt to reach Chicago by train. To Neal's relief, their assigned seats are in separate cars and they say goodbye prior to boarding. En route, the locomotive breaks down, stranding the passengers in a Missouri field where Del and Neal are reunited. After they reach [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], Del raises cash by selling shower curtain rings to passersby, advertising the items as earrings. Del uses the funds to buy bus tickets, but waits until they are on the road to tell Neal that the tickets are only valid to St. Louis. Upon arrival, Neal inadvertently offends Del over lunch and the two part ways again.\n\nAt the [[St. Louis Lambert International Airport|St. Louis airport]], Neal attempts to rent a car, but finds the space at the distant rental lot empty. After a long and perilous walk back to the terminal, Neal vents his anger with a profanity-laced tirade at the rental agent to no avail. In desperation, he attempts to hire a taxi to Chicago, but insults the dispatcher, who then punches Neal. By chance, Del arrives with his own rental car just in time to rescue Neal. While driving, they find themselves arguing again. The situation is made worse when Del nearly gets them killed on a freeway after [[wrong-way driving|driving in the wrong direction]], scraping between two oncoming semi trailer trucks.\n\nWhile they take a moment to compose themselves by the side of the road, Del's carelessly discarded cigarette sets fire to the car's interior. Neal initially gloats, thinking that Del is liable for the damage. Neal's amusement turns to anger when Del reveals he used Neal's credit card to rent the car after their cards were accidentally switched.\n\nWith his credit cards destroyed in the fire, Neal barters his [[Piaget SA|Piaget]] watch for a motel room for himself. Del is broke and attempts to sleep in the car, which has lost its roof in the fire. Neal eventually feels sympathy for Del and invites him in from the cold and snowy night. They consume Del's collection of [[Miniature (alcohol)|airline liquors]] and laugh about the events of the past two days. The pair resume driving to Chicago the next morning, but their badly damaged car is impounded by the police. They finally make it to Chicago, two days late, in the back of a refrigerator truck.\n\nThe two finally part ways at a [[Chicago \"L\"]] [[LaSalle/Van Buren (CTA station)|station]]. On the train, Neal remembers cryptic comments Del made during the journey and realizes that he may be alone for the holiday. Struck by compassion, Neal quickly returns to the station, finds Del sitting alone and asks why he has not gone home. Del reveals that he does not have a home and that his wife died eight years earlier. \n\nNeal returns home to his family and introduces them to Del, whom he has invited to Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Neal Page\n* [[John Candy]] as Del Griffith\n* [[Laila Robins]] as Susan Page\n* [[Michael McKean]] as State Trooper\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Taxi Racer\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Owen\n* Lulie Newcomb as Owen's wife\n* [[Olivia Burnette]] as Marti Page\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Doobie\n* [[Richard Herd]] as Walt\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Neal Page, Jr.\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Car Rental Agent\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Man on Plane\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Wichita airport representative\n* [[Diana Douglas|Diana Dill]] as Peg\n* [[Charles Tyner]] as Gus Mooney\n* [[Martin Ferrero]] as 2nd Motel Clerk\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Planes, Train and Automobiles'' was filmed in 85 days,<ref name = \"ProVideo\">{{cite web|last=Hullfish|first=Steve|date=April 13, 2019|url=https://www.provideocoalition.com/art-of-the-cut-with-oscar-winner-paul-hirsch-ace/|title=ART OF THE CUT with Oscar winner, Paul Hirsch, ACE|website=Pro Video Coalition|accessdate=November 25, 2019}}</ref> mostly in [[Batavia, New York]] and [[South Dayton, New York]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Marcia|last=Greenwood|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2017/11/22/planes-trains-and-automobiles-filmed-batavia-1987/888031001/ |title=Planes, Trains and Automobiles filmed in Batavia: Behind the scenes |newspaper=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Rochester, New York|date=November 22, 2017|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> A scene that takes place in St. Louis was filmed at [[Lambert International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fox2now.com/2014/07/17/5-movies-with-locations-in-st-louis/|title=5 Movies With Locations in St. Louis|date=July 17, 2014|website=FOX2now.com|language=en|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2tZY-i6aa8C&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=%22planes+trains+and+automobiles%22+filmed+in+st+louis+airport&source=bl&ots=b05iqtER01&sig=ACfU3U1pFHC4ZuMV4dB8aToQHugdBCkWrQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdvMn9rYfjAhWUB50JHXjWAS84FBDoATAGegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=%22planes%20trains%20and%20automobiles%22%20filmed%20in%20st%20louis%20airport&f=false|title=Shot on This Site: A Traveler's Guide to the Places and Locations Used to Film Famous Movies and TV Shows|last=Gordon|first=William A.|date=1995|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=9780806516479|language=en}}</ref> Rewrites Hughes did during filming made the amount of footage he shot much larger than what the original screenplay needed.<ref name = \"ProVideo\"/>\n== Themes ==\nArgun Ulgen categorized ''Planes, Trains, and Automobiles'' as a lively portrayal of in-person interactions between people of different economic classes: \"people curse, make out in public, speak in platitudes, and retell the same jokes; generally, they are coarse and loud, imperfect, but not without love.\"<ref name = \"Popmatters\">{{cite web|last=Ulgen|first=Argun|date=November 14, 2017|url=https://www.popmatters.com/planes-trains-and-automobiles-celebrates-its-30th-anniversary-at-a-time-we-need-the-film-the-most-2508407785.html|title='Planes, Trains and Automobiles' Celebrates Its 30th Anniversary at a Time We Need It Most|website=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film marked a widely noticed change in the repertoire of John Hughes.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jack|last=Mathews|title='PTA' Transports John Hughes Beyond His Teen Comedy Image|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-15-ca-29192-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=December 15, 1987|page=1}}</ref> It was greeted with critical acclaim upon release, a revelation in that Hughes was considered a teen [[angst]] filmmaker.<ref name=\"Jay Carr 1987. pg. 34\">{{cite news|first=Jay|last=Carr|title='PLANES, TRAINS' NEVER GETS OFF THE GROUND|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|publisher=Boston Globe Partners, L.P.|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=November 25, 1987|page=34}}</ref> It also got two thumbs up from ''[[Siskel & Ebert]]'', with [[Gene Siskel]] declaring it John Candy's best role to date. \n\nIt has 93% positive ratings on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

The frenetic musical score by [[Ira Newborn]] makes extensive use of the folk song \"[[Red River Valley (song)|Red River Valley]]\", including a rock and roll version called \"Red River Rock\", performed by British group [[Silicon Teens]].
