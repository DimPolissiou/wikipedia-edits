Debs aboard the 1908 Red Special campaign train.]]\n'''Theodore Debs''' (1864-1945) was an American socialist political activist. Debs is best remembered as the personal secretary and political confidant of his older brother, socialist orator and journalist [[Eugene V. Debs]]. A political actor in his own right, the younger Debs was the executive secretary of the [[Social Democratic Party of America]] with headquarters in Chicago from its foundation in 1898 until its dissolution through merger into the [[Socialist Party of America]] in August 1901.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nTheodore Debs was born August 20, 1864 in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. His parents, Jean Daniel Debs and Maguerite Bettrich Debs, were ethnic [[French people|French]] immigrants from [[Colmar]], [[Alsace]], [[France]], having arrived in the United States in 1849.<ref name=EVDSW1-3>Tim Davenport and David Walters (eds.), ''The Selected Works of Eugene V. Debs: Volume 1, Building Solidarity on the Tracks, 1877-1892.'' Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2019; pg. 3.</ref> The Debs paterfamilias was the [[Protestant]] heir to a factory who broke with his family after falling in love with Marguerite, a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] employee of the firm.<ref name=EVDSW1-3 /> Well educated and trained as a factory manager, the estranged Jean Daniel had received a financial payout rather than the factory upon his father's death and had departed for a new life in America.<ref name=EVDSW1-3 /> He was relieved of his fortune en route by a [[confidence trick|con man]] and had been forced to take a series of physical jobs to make ends meet, finally saving a small nest egg and establishing a [[grocery store]] in 1855.<ref>''Building Solidarity on the Tracks,'' pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nTheodore was the youngest of six surviving children and the second surviving son of Jean Daniel and Marguerite, known to family members as \"Dandy\" and \"Daisy.\" From a young age he idolized his older brother, the charismatic and eloquent [[Eugene V. Debs|Eugene]], nine years his senior, carrying on correspondence with him when he was away and joining him in literary and social activities when he was at home.<ref>Nick Salvatore, ''Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1982; pp. 19, 71.</ref>\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Locomotive-Firemens-Magazine-cover-1884.jpg|thumb|right|Theodore began his working career as an office assistant helping with the production of ''Locomotive Firemen's Magazine,'' a monthly edited by his brother.]]\n\nWhen Eugene became a professional functionary with the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]] (B of LF) in the early 1880s, serving as secretary-treasurer of the organization as well as editor of its monthly magazine, the young Theodore joined him as a general office worker, assisting with the production and mailing of magazines.<ref name=Coleman59>McAlister Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs: A Man Unafraid.'' New York: Greenberg, Publisher, 1930; pg. 59.</ref> \n\nBy the late 1880s, Theodore was working full time as Gene's personal secretary for the B of LF, maintaining an office in the business section of Terre Haute.<ref>Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs,'' pg. 93.</ref> As the union's chief functionary, Gene Debs received a torrent of correspondence each day, dictating an endless stream of reply mail to Theodore, who quickly gained proficiency as a [[typewriter|typist]].<ref>Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs,'' pp. 93-94.</ref> The brothers would remain close friends and co-workers for the rest of Gene's life. In the words of one biographer:\n\n<blockquote>\"For more than forty years, when Gene felt the need of long-visioned counsel, undying devotion, a service sacrificial, tender, selfless, he turned to Theodore. Never did a [[Damon and Pythias|Damon love a Pythias]] more deeply than these two loved each other. The unassuming, sweet-tempered Theodore, perfectly willing to march into the fires of any hell for Gene's sake, was the ideal foil for Gene's more volatile temperament. A few drawled words from Theodore, ...and Gene would stop short on some headlong course and say quietly, 'You're right, Theodore. By God, you've got that right.\"<ref name=Coleman59 /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1892, Eugene V. Debs resigned as secretary-treasurer of the B of LF to establish a new [[industrial union]], the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU). He was persuaded to remain on as editor of ''Locomotive Firemen's Magazine,'' a task which kept Theodore occupied. Debs also launched a new commercial venture, Debs Publishing Company, specializing in books for railway workers, with Theodore handling the correspondence and order fulfillment associated with this project.<ref>For a list of early books published by Debs Publishing Co., see Davenport and Walters (eds.), ''The Selected Works of Eugene V. Debs: Volume 2, The Rise and Fall of the ARU, 1892-1896.'' Chicago, IL: Haymarket Books, 2020; pg. 34.</ref> The brothers were separated for a time, with the ARU launching in 1893 with headquarters in Chicago, while Theodore remained in Terre Haute to look after publishing operations there.<ref>Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs,'' pp. 109-110.</ref>\n\nTheodore was drafted into service on behalf of the ARU, however, traveling with President Gene and Vice President [[George W. Howard]] to [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in April 1894 to end a strike of ARU workers on the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railroad]] through [[arbitration|compulsory arbitration]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46990752/both-sides-satisfied-at-end-of-great/ \"Both Sides Satisfied,\"] ''St. Paul Daily Globe,'' vol. 17, no. 123 (May 3, 1894), pg. 2.</ref> In conjunction with this strike, Theodore seems to have served as [[consigliere]] and personal secretary to his brother rather than participating directly in negotiations.\n\n===Political activism===\n\nHis brother Eugene was sentenced to a six month jail term for [[contempt of court]] for violating an anti-strike [[injunction]] in connection with the sensational [[Pullman Strike of 1894]], serving his sentence in 1895. A stenographer was hired by the union to assist Debs with correspondence; Theodore remained in Terre Haute. Gene emerged from jail a prominent and controversial public figure \u2014 a beloved icon and martyr to many.

Debs aboard the 1908 Red Special campaign train.]]\n'''Theodore Debs''' (1864-1945) was an American socialist political activist. Debs is best remembered as the personal secretary and political confidant of his older brother, socialist orator and journalist [[Eugene V. Debs]]. A political actor in his own right, the younger Debs was the executive secretary of the [[Social Democratic Party of America]] with headquarters in Chicago from its foundation in 1898 until its dissolution through merger into the [[Socialist Party of America]] in August 1901.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nTheodore Debs was born August 20, 1864 in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. His parents, Jean Daniel Debs and Maguerite Bettrich Debs, were ethnic [[French people|French]] immigrants from [[Colmar]], [[Alsace]], [[France]], having arrived in the United States in 1849.<ref name=EVDSW1-3>Tim Davenport and David Walters (eds.), ''The Selected Works of Eugene V. Debs: Volume 1, Building Solidarity on the Tracks, 1877-1892.'' Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2019; pg. 3.</ref> The Debs paterfamilias was the [[Protestant]] heir to a factory who broke with his family after falling in love with Marguerite, a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] employee of the firm.<ref name=EVDSW1-3 /> Well educated and trained as a factory manager, the estranged Jean Daniel had received a financial payout rather than the factory upon his father's death and had departed for a new life in America.<ref name=EVDSW1-3 /> He was relieved of his fortune en route by a [[confidence trick|con man]] and had been forced to take a series of physical jobs to make ends meet, finally saving a small nest egg and establishing a [[grocery store]] in 1855.<ref>''Building Solidarity on the Tracks,'' pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nTheodore was the youngest of six surviving children and the second surviving son of Jean Daniel and Marguerite, known to family members as \"Dandy\" and \"Daisy.\" From a young age he idolized his older brother, the charismatic and eloquent [[Eugene V. Debs|Eugene]], nine years his senior, carrying on correspondence with him when he was away and joining him in literary and social activities when he was at home.<ref>Nick Salvatore, ''Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1982; pp. 19, 71.</ref>\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Locomotive-Firemens-Magazine-cover-1884.jpg|thumb|right|Theodore began his working career as an office assistant helping with the production of ''Locomotive Firemen's Magazine,'' a monthly edited by his brother.]]\n\nWhen Eugene became a professional functionary with the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]] (B of LF) in the early 1880s, serving as secretary-treasurer of the organization as well as editor of its monthly magazine, the young Theodore joined him as a general office worker, assisting with the production and mailing of magazines.<ref name=Coleman59>McAlister Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs: A Man Unafraid.'' New York: Greenberg, Publisher, 1930; pg. 59.</ref> \n\nBy the late 1880s, Theodore was working full time as Gene's personal secretary for the B of LF, maintaining an office in the business section of Terre Haute.<ref>Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs,'' pg. 93.</ref> As the union's chief functionary, Gene Debs received a torrent of correspondence each day, dictating an endless stream of reply mail to Theodore, who quickly gained proficiency as a [[typewriter|typist]].<ref>Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs,'' pp. 93-94.</ref> The brothers would remain close friends and co-workers for the rest of Gene's life. In the words of one biographer:\n\n<blockquote>\"For more than forty years, when Gene felt the need of long-visioned counsel, undying devotion, a service sacrificial, tender, selfless, he turned to Theodore. Never did a [[Damon and Pythias|Damon love a Pythias]] more deeply than these two loved each other. The unassuming, sweet-tempered Theodore, perfectly willing to march into the fires of any hell for Gene's sake, was the ideal foil for Gene's more volatile temperament. A few drawled words from Theodore, ...and Gene would stop short on some headlong course and say quietly, 'You're right, Theodore. By God, you've got that right.\"<ref name=Coleman59 /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1892, Eugene V. Debs resigned as secretary-treasurer of the B of LF to establish a new [[industrial union]], the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU). He was persuaded to remain on as editor of ''Locomotive Firemen's Magazine,'' a task which kept Theodore occupied. Debs also launched a new commercial venture, Debs Publishing Company, specializing in books for railway workers, with Theodore handling the correspondence and order fulfillment associated with this project.<ref>For a list of early books published by Debs Publishing Co., see Davenport and Walters (eds.), ''The Selected Works of Eugene V. Debs: Volume 2, The Rise and Fall of the ARU, 1892-1896.'' Chicago, IL: Haymarket Books, 2020; pg. 34.</ref> The brothers were separated for a time, with the ARU launching in 1893 with headquarters in Chicago, while Theodore remained in Terre Haute to look after publishing operations there.<ref>Coleman, ''Eugene V. Debs,'' pp. 109-110.</ref>\n\nTheodore was drafted into service on behalf of the ARU, however, traveling with President Gene and Vice President [[George W. Howard]] to [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in April 1894 to end a strike of ARU workers on the [[Great Northern Railroad]] through [[arbitration|compulsory arbitration]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46990752/both-sides-satisfied-at-end-of-great/ \"Both Sides Satisfied,\"] ''St. Paul Daily Globe,'' vol. 17, no. 123 (May 3, 1894), pg. 2.</ref> In conjunction with this strike, Theodore seems to have served as [[consigliere]] and personal secretary to his brother rather than participating directly in negotiations.\n\n===Political activism===\n\nHis brother Eugene was sentenced to a six month jail term for [[contempt of court]] for violating an anti-strike [[injunction]] in connection with the sensational [[Pullman Strike of 1894]], serving his sentence in 1895. A stenographer was hired by the union to assist Debs with correspondence; Theodore remained in Terre Haute. Gene emerged from jail a prominent and controversial public figure \u2014 a beloved icon and martyr to many. The American Railway Union was essentially bankrupted and driven underground by the costly prosecution and jailing of its national leaders and [[blacklist|blacklisting]] of its rank and file members. Its effectiveness as a trade union was dramatically attenuated.\n\nOn January 1, 1897, Eugene Debs publicly proclaimed himself a socialist in a statement to the press.

These shows were originally broadcast in the late 1990s to early 2000s and experienced revivals in the mid-2010s. As well as televised competitions, smaller robot combat events are staged for live audiences such as those organised by the [[Robot Fighting League]].\n\nRobot builders are generally [[hobby]]ists and the complexity and cost of their machines can vary substantially. Robot combat uses weight classes, with the heaviest robots able to exert more power and destructive capabilities. The rules of competitions are designed for safety of the builders, operators, and spectators while also providing for an entertaining spectacle. Robot combat arenas are generally surrounded by a [[bulletproof]] screen.\n\nCompetitor robots come in a variety of designs, with different strategies for winning fights. Robot designs typically incorporate weapons for attacking opponents, such as axes, hammers, flippers and spinning devices. Rules almost always prohibit gun-like weapons as well as other strategies not conducive to the safety and enjoyment of participants and spectators.\nThere are few robots used by the military people too, which are totally terrifying and oddly adorable it there own ways.

Robot fights take place in a sturdy arena, usually constructed of steel, wood, and bulletproof clear [[Lexan]] plastic. The smaller, lighter classes compete in smaller arenas than the heavyweights.\n\nCompetition rules set limits on construction features that are too dangerous or which could lead to uninteresting contests. Strict limits are placed on materials and pressures used in [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] actuators, and [[fail-safe]] systems are required for electronic control circuits. Generally off-limits for use as weapons are nets, liquids, deliberate radio jamming, high-voltage electric discharge, untethered projectiles, and ''usually'' fire.\n\n=== Robot fighting associations ===\nThe sport has no overall governing body, though some regional associations oversee several events in managerial or advisory capacities with published rulesets. These include:\n*[[Robot Fighting League]] (RFL), primarily U.S., operated 2002\u20142012\n*[[Fighting Robot Association]] (FRA), U.K., 2003\u2013\n*Standardised Procedures for the Advancement of Robot Combat (SPARC), U.S., 2015\u2013<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sparc.tools/?p=1|title=What is SPARC? {{!}} SPARC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe major televised competitions have operated outside of these associations.\n\n== Combat robot weaponry and design ==\n\nAn effective combat robot must have some method of damaging or controlling the actions of its opponent while at the same time protecting itself from aggression. The tactics employed by combat robot operators and the robot designs which support those tactics are numerous. Although some robots have multiple weapons, the more successful competitors concentrate on a single form of attack. This is a list of most of the basic types of weapons. Most robot weaponry falls into one of the following categories:\n\n*'''Rammer''' \u2013 Robots employing high-power drive trains and heavy armor are able to use their speed and maneuverability to crash into their opponent repeatedly with hope of damaging weapons and vital components. Their pushing power may also be used to shove their opponent into arena hazards. Rammers (AKA \u2018Bricks\u2019) typically have four or six wheels for traction and stability and are often designed to be fully operational when inverted. Because modern rulesets require all robots to have a moving weapon, modern rammers are equipped with other weapon types. Robot Wars Series 6 champion [[Tornado (robot)|''Tornado'']] and Series 7 runner-up Storm II were effective rammers.\n*'''Wedge''' \u2013 Similar in concept to a rammer, the wedge uses a low-clearance inclined wedge or scoop to move in under an opponent and break its contact with the arena floor \u2013 decreasing its mobility and rendering it easy to push off into a wall or hazard. The wedge is also useful in deflecting attacks by other robots. Small wedge-lets are used to lift opponent bot and feed it to secondary weapon system.  A small wedge may be attached to the rear of a robot with other weaponry for use as a \u2018backup\u2019 in case the main weapon fails. Like rammers, modern wedges must be combined with some other weapon in order to be legal. lower the degree of inclination of the wedge more the chance to lift the opponent bot from the ground. The 1995 US Robot Wars middleweight champion [[La Machine (robot)|''La Machine'']] was an early and effective wedge design as was Robot Wars Series 1 champion, [[Roadblock (robot)|Roadblock]] (1997), and the deceptively simple 2018 ''BattleBots'' competitor ''DUCK!''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y099lycEr2M DUCK!'s 2018 combat highlights]</ref>\n*'''Saw Blades''' \u2013 A popular weapon in the early years of robotic combat, these robots use a dedicated motor to power either a modified [[chainsaw]] or [[circular saw]], or a custom-built cutting disc, usually at high speeds (up to 10,000&nbsp;rpm). The serrated blade is used to slice through an opponent's armour to try and reach its internal components. These weapons can create spectacular showers of sparks, and are easy to combine with other designs, but can be ineffective against robots with tougher armour. The aforementioned Robot Wars champion Roadblock had a rear-mounted circular saw in addition to its wedge, while Series 4 runner-up Pussycat had a custom cutting disc with four serrated blades.\n[[File:Robot Wars Aftershock.jpg|thumb|''Robot Wars'' competitor Aftershock uses a vertical spinning flywheel to attack opponents]]\n*'''Spinner''' \u2013 Spinners are generally larger and heavier than saw blades, and spin at a lower RPM. Rather than cutting through the opponent, spinners use a heavy bar, studded disc, or toothed cylinder (drum/eggbeater) to strike the opponent with the kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass. The mass may spin on either a horizontal or vertical axis, although vertical spinners may have maneuverability problems due to the gyroscopic action of the weapon. The destructive potential of a well-designed spinning weapon requires robust arena containment to prevent shrapnel being thrown into the audience. Three-time BattleBots middleweight champion ''[[Hazard (robot)|Hazard]]'' was a horizontal bar spinner, while Robot Wars Series 3 runner-up [[Hypno-Disc]] was a flywheel spinner. As an alternative to the vertical-axis \"full-body spinner\" in destructive capability; the horizontal-axis drum spinner, exemplified by the 2017 and 2018 BattleBots-fielded Brazilian entry ''Minotaur'', can easily spin its up to 35&nbps;kg (77&nbsp;lb) lobed drum at upwards of over 10,000&nbsp;rpm,<ref>[https://battlebots.com/robot/minotaur-s3/ Minotaur's page at BattleBots.com]</ref> at times literally \"launching\" a vulnerable component of an opponent skywards with considerable force.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Daniel Freitas (''Minotaur'' operator), Marco Meggiolaro and Team RioBotz |date=August 5, 2016 |title=Minotaur vs. Warhead - BattleBots |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBxDpnsKZX0 |access-date=October 29, 2018 |time=0:20 |location=California |publisher=American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>   Some events place upper limits on spinner speed to avoid audience and crew injuries from cage breaches.\n*'''Full Body Spinner''' \u2013 Taking the concept of the spinner to the extreme, a full body spinner (AKA shell spinner or tuna can spinner) rotates the entire outer shell of the robot as a stored energy weapon. Other robot components (batteries, weapon motor casing) may be attached to the shell to increase the spinning mass while keeping the mass of the drive train to a minimum. Full body spinners require time to spin the weapon up to speed, typically cannot self-right, and can be unstable \u2014 the original (2000\u20132005) BattleBots competitor ''Mauler''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqqGKQv5P8k YouTube site with Mauler's matches]</ref> being an infamous example, with the more recently fielded ''Captain Shrederator'' (which competed in all three ABC/Discovery/Science Channel 2010s seasons) having somewhat more success. The 1995 US Robot Wars heavyweight co-champion ''[[Blendo]]'' was the first effective full body spinner. A variant, the ring spinner, features a narrower spinning ring surrounding the robot; these designs have the advantage of being invertible. BattleBots 2016 competitor ''The Ringmaster'' is an example of a ring-spinner.\n*'''Melty-Brain Spinner''' \u2013 A variation of the full-body spinner, where a robot's electronics allow it to drive in such a way that the entire robot rotates while it can move towards an opponent. This kind of design tends to be incorporated into invertible builds, and requires a spin-up time like other spinners. The first and best known Heavyweight Melty-Brain Spinner is ''Nuts 2'', which had chains connected to two \"flail\" weapons on either side of the machine. This wasn't very effective for damaging armour, but was extremely good at damaging exposed critical parts of opponents' machines. Nuts 2 ultimately finished joint 3rd (with ''Behemoth'') in Series 10 of UK Robot Wars, ending the dominant run of Series 8 finalist and Series 9 Champion ''Carbide'' along the way, by breaking the robot's weapon chain, rendering it defenceless.\n*'''Thwackbot''' \u2013 A narrow, high-speed, two-wheel drive train attached to a long boom with an impact weapon on the end creates a robot that can spin in place at a high speed, swinging the weapon in a horizontal circle. The simplicity and durability of the design is appealing, but the robot cannot be made to move in a controlled manner while spinning without employing sophisticated electronics (See Melty-Brain Spinner above). The 1995 US Robot Wars lightweight champion ''[[Test Toaster 1]]'' was a thwackbot, as were ''T-Wrex'' and ''Golddigger'' from the BattleBots series.\n*'''Torque Reaction''' \u2013 A variant on the thwackbot is the torque reaction hammer, also known as axlebots. These robots have two very large wheels with the small body of the robot hanging in between them. A long weapon boom has a vertically oriented hammer, pick, or axe on the end. On acceleration, the weapon boom swings upward and over to the rear of the robot to offset the motor torque. When the robot reverses direction, the weapon will swing forcibly back over the top and hopefully impact the opponent. These robots are simple and can put on a flashy, aggressive show, but their attack power is relatively small and, like thwackbots, they can be hard to control. BattleBots 2.0 middleweight champion [[Spaz (robot)|''Spaz'']] was a torque reaction pickaxe robot, whilst Robot Wars Grand Finalist ''Stinger'' opted for a disc, later replaced with a bludgeoning mace.\n*'''Lifter''' \u2013 Using tactics similar to a wedge, the lifter uses a powered arm, prow, or platform to get underneath the opponent and lift it away from the arena surface to remove its maneuverability. The lifter may then push the other robot toward arena hazards or attempt to toss the opponent onto its back. The lifter is typically powered by either an electric or pneumatic actuator. Two-time US Robot Wars and four-time BattleBots heavyweight champion [[BioHazard (robot)|''Biohazard'']] was an electric lifter.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robot Combat |url=https://dorset.tech/robot-combat/ |accessdate=August 6, 2019 |work=Dorset Tech}}</ref>\n[[File:Robot Wars Apollo (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Robot Wars'' competitor Apollo, armed with a flipping weapon]]\n*'''Flipper''' \u2013 Although mechanically resembling a lifter, the flipper uses much higher levels of pneumatic power to fire the lifting arm or panel explosively upward. An effective flipper can throw opponents end-over-end through the air causing damage from the landing impact or, in Robot Wars, toss it completely out of the arena. Flippers use a large volume of compressed gas and often have a limited number of effective attacks before their supply runs low. The two-time Robot Wars champion ''[[Chaos 2]]'' and original, 2000s-era BattleBots superheavyweight champion [[Toro (Robot)|''Toro'']] and middleweight competitor ''T-Minus'' were flippers, as is the same ''Team Inertia's'' more recent heavyweight robot ''Bronco'', with both ''T-Minus''<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Reason Bradley and Alexander Rose (Team Inertia) |date=May 2001 |title=BattleBots S3-5 - All Fights of T-Minus |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DLf601vVY |access-date=November 1, 2018 |time=2:34 |location=Treasure Island, Calif. |publisher=Dundiddlydoo |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> and ''Bronco''<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Reason Bradley and Alexander Rose (Team Inertia) |date=May 2015 |title=Bronco vs. Stinger - BattleBots |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0BRrEsxw |access-date=November 1, 2018 |time=0:34 |location=San Francisco |publisher=American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> capable of self-righting with their powerful pneumatic flippers. Hydraulic flippers, while not \"common\" in robot combat, have managed to start achieving some degree of success, as with Team Whyachi's flipper ''Hydra'', which gave ''Bronco'' a serious challenge in the 2019 ''BattleBots'' competition.<ref>[https://battlebots.com/robot/hydra-2019/ BattleBots.com page on ''Hydra'']</ref> While most flippers operate with the pneumatic arm hinged at the machine's rear, Robot Wars' ''Firestorm'' achieved remarkable success with a front-hinged flipper, placing third in Robot Wars on three separate occasions (Series 3, 5, and 6) never failing to advance to the series' semifinal rounds, flipping a total of 7 out of the arena (the only heavyweight robot to flip another out of the arena with a front-hinged flipper) and having the most UK championship competition fight wins, of 23, as well as winning the second-most fights out of any competitor/series of competitors on UK Robot Wars, with only Razer having more wins overall.\n*'''Stabber''' \u2013 Mechanically similar to the flipper is the stabber, which throws or stabs opponents forward instead of upward. An effective stabber can penetrate into the opponent, damage vital inner parts. When they fail to penetrate, they throw their opponent back across the arena into walls or hazards. Stabbers typically use a large volume of compressed gas, which limits the number of times they can fire their weapon in a fight. BattleBots super heavyweight ''[[Rammstein (robot)|Rammstein]]'' was a stabber.\n*'''Clamper''' \u2013 Another lifter variant, the clamper adds an arm or claw that descends from above to secure the opposing robot in place on a lifting platform. The entire assembly then lifts and carries the opponent wherever the operator pleases. Two-time BattleBots super heavyweight champion Diesector was an electric clamper.\n*'''Dustpan''' \u2013 An uncommon variant on the clamper, the dustpan simplifies the design by replacing the lifting platform with a wide box open at the front and top. An opponent maneuvered into the box may then be restrained with an arm or claw from above. Some designs use only the box with no restraining claw. BattleBots middleweight runner-up ''S.O.B.'' used a dustpan in conjunction with a sawblade mounted on an arm, with the more recent 2018 BattleBots competitor ''SawBlaze'' using a 180\u00ba pivoted-arm-mounted circular saw on their trident-style dustpan design to cut downwards into an opponent.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Jamison Go and Team SawBlaze (Lucy Du, John Mayo, Chris Merian, Joao Ramos, Alex Hattori & Mason Massie) |date=March\u2013April 2018 |title=No, NO! NOT THE SAW!!! |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht8OhG0eMzE |access-date=November 1, 2018 |time=0:17 |location=Long Beach, Calif. |publisher=BattleBots |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> \n*'''Crusher''' \u2013 Like flywheels, crushers can be separated into horizontal and vertical variants. Vertical crushers use a hydraulic cylinder attached to a sharp piercing arm to pin and slowly penetrate the top armor of the opponent. Robot Wars Series 5 Champion and two-time world champion ''[[Razer (robot)|Razer]]'' was the first vertical crusher, and by far the most successful. Horizontal crushers feature two of these arms, which act like pincers to crush robots between them. Two-time Robot Wars Annihilator champion ''Kan-Opener'' armed with horizontal claws, and King of Bots Champion \"Spectre\" armed with a vertical 'biting fang' - or like the Dutch-fielded, hydraulically-powered ten metric tonne-force \"toucan-billed\" robot ''Petunia'' in recent seasons of Discovery Channel's ''Battlebots'' are other examples of successful crushers.\n*'''Overhead Axe''' \u2013 Swinging a high-speed axe, spike, or hammer forcefully down onto your opponent offers another method of attacking the vulnerable top surface. The weapon is typically driven by a pneumatic actuator via a rack and pinion or direct mechanical linkage. The attack may damage the opposing robot directly, or may lodge in their robot and provide a handle for dragging them toward a hazard. BattleBots heavyweight runner-up and Robot Wars competitor ''[[Killerhurtz (robot)|Killerhurtz]]'' was armed with an overhead axe. Some axes are double-sided, and can strike opponents both in front of and behind the robot; Killerhurtz' successor Terrorhurtz, and Robot Wars Series 2 Grand Finalist Killertron, were examples of this. The heavyweight pneumatically powered, bifurcated-armed pickaxe of ''Chomp'' from the 2016 and 2018 Battlebots competitions also incorporated short metal \"wing\" levers at the pickaxe-arms' rear ends to upright its bulky chassis if knocked onto its side during combat, and pioneered a hardware design that autonomously turned ''Chomp'' to always face its opponent during a match.<ref>[https://battlebots.com/robot/chomp-s3/ BattleBots webpage on Chomp from the 2018 season]</ref> \n*'''SRiMech''' \u2013 Many robots are incapable of running inverted, due to their shape, weaponry, or both. A SRiMech ('''s'''elf-'''ri'''ghting '''mech'''anism) is an [[Active Design]] element that returns an inverted robot to mobility in the upright state. The SRiMech is typically an electric or pneumatic arm or extension on the upper surface of the robot which pushes against the arena floor to roll or flip the robot upright. Most flippers, some lifters, and even some carefully designed axes can double as SRiMechs. Even a vertical spinning weapon may be used as a crude self-righting device. Team Nightmare's lightweight vertical spinner [[Backlash (robot)|''Backlash'']] was designed such that when flipped it would hit the ground with the spinning disc and kick back upright.<ref>[http://www.robotcombat.com/backlash_sf01_2.html RobotCombat.com Robot Combat History - San Francisco 2001]</ref> The first successful unaided use of a SRiMech in competition was at the 1997 U.S. Robot Wars when the immobilized ''Vlad the Impaler'' used a dedicated pneumatic device to pop back upright in a match against ''Biohazard''.\n\nMany modern rulesets, such as the rebooted versions of ''BattleBots'' and ''Robot Wars'', require robots to have an active weapon in order to improve the visual spectacle, thus eliminating certain designs such as torque-reaction axlebots and thwackbots, and requiring other designs such as wedges and rammers to incorporate some other kind of weapon.\n\n===Interchangeable weaponry===\nIt is increasingly common for robots to have interchangeable weaponry or other modular components, allowing them to adapt to a wide range of opponents and increasing their versatility; such robots are often referred to as \"Swiss army bots\", in reference to [[Swiss army knives]]. Arguably the earliest example was Robot Wars Series 1 contestant ''Plunderbird'', which could change between a pneumatic spike and a circular saw on an extendable arm. Successful Swiss army bots include Robot Wars Series 6 champion ''[[Tornado (robot)|Tornado]]'', BattleBots 2016 runner-up ''Bombshell'', and top-ranked US Beetleweight ''Silent Spring''.<ref name=\"SPARC_Botrank_Beetleweights\">{{cite web|url=http://sparc.tools/BotRank/mainrank.php?wc=3&ty=R|title=SPARC Botrank, Current Beetleweight Class Rankings|publisher=Standardized Procedures for the Advancement of Robot Combat|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSometimes, robots that were not originally Swiss army bots have had their weapons changed or altered on the fly, typically due to malfunctions. In BattleBots 2015, ''Ghost Raptor'''s spinning bar weapon broke in its first fight; builder Chuck Pitzer then improvised new weapons for each following fight, including a \"De-Icer\" arm attachment which it used to unbalance and defeat bar spinner ''Icewave'' in the quarter-finals.\n\n=== Prohibited weaponry ===\nSince the first robot combat competitions, some types of weapons have been prohibited either because they violated the spirit of the competition or they could not be safely used. Prohibited weapons have generally included:\n\n*[[Radio jamming]]\n*High voltage electric discharge\n*Liquids (glue, oil, water, corrosives\u2026)\n*Fire (except in ''BattleBots'')\n*Explosives\n*Un-tethered projectiles (except in ''BattleBots'' from 2018 season onwards)\n*Entanglement devices (except in ''Robot Wars'' from series 10 onwards)\n*[[Laser]]s above 1 milliwatt\n*Visual obstruction\n*[[Halomethane|Halon]] \u2013 a specific fire extinguishing gas effective as a weapon in stopping internal combustion engines. Note that current rules do not specifically ban Halon as it is no longer commercially available.\n\nIndividual competitions have made exceptions to the above list. Notably, the Robotica competitions allowed flame weapons and the release of limited quantities of liquids on a case-by-case basis.<ref name=\"toast2001\">[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/Robotica1_rules.html 2001 Robotica ruleset]</ref> The modern series of ''BattleBots'' also permits the use of flamethrowers and, as of 2016, untethered projectiles, provided that the latter are merely for show. Competitions may also restrict or ban certain otherwise legal weapons, such as banning spinners and other high-power weapons at events where the arena is not able to contain these weapons. A well-known example of this is the Sportsman ruleset.<ref name=\"SPARC_rules\"/>\n\nArena hazards have also been granted exceptions to the list of prohibited weapons. ''Robot Wars'' in particular used flame devices both in the stationary hazards and on one of the roaming \"[[House Robots]]\".\n\n=== Unusual weaponry ===\n[[File:Robot combat with flame.jpg|thumb|250px|A robot housed in a dog house uses flame against a full body spinner opponent.]]\nA very wide variety of unusual weapons and special design approaches have been tried with varying success and several types of weapons would have been tried had they not been prohibited.\n*'''Entanglement weapons''' \u2013 Several early US Robot Wars competitors sought to immobilize their opponents with entangling weapons. Nets and streamers of adhesive tape were both tried with mixed success. Entangling weapons were prohibited in Robot Wars and BattleBots from 1997 onward,<ref>[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/RW97_rules.html 1997 Robot Wars ruleset]</ref> but the Robotica competitions allowed nets, magnets, and other entangling devices on a case-by-case basis,<ref name=\"toast2001\"/> and Robot Wars allowed limited use of entanglement devices in Series 10.\n*'''Flame weapons''' \u2013 Although prohibited for use by competitors in Robot Wars and the first edition (2000\u201305) of BattleBots, the rules for Robotica, the Robot Fighting League and the post-2015 version of BattleBots do allow flame weapons under some circumstances. RFL super heavyweight competitor ''Alcoholic Stepfather'' (unique for using [[mecanum wheel]]s for movement around an arena)<ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqKWVaB1Lo ''Alcoholic Stepfather'' and ''Tombstone'' in a 2004 match]</ref> and Robotica competitor ''Solar Flare'', as well as the later BattleBots series competitors ''Free Shipping'' and overhead pneumatic-pickaxe armed ''Chomp'' employing gaseous flamethrower weapons. Flamethrowers are seldom effective weapons, but are audience favorites.\n*'''Smothering weapons''' \u2013 The BattleBots and Robot Wars lightweight competitor ''[[Tentoumushi (robot)|Tentoumushi]]'' used a large plastic sandbox cover shaped like a ladybug (\"tentoumushi\" being Japanese for ladybug) on a powered arm to drop down over opposing robots, covering and encircling them. Once covered, it was difficult to tell what the opponent was doing and who was dragging whom around the arena. One version of the robot had a circular saw concealed under the cover to inflict physical damage, another had a small [[grappling hook]].\n*'''Tethered projectiles''' \u2013 Although tethered projectiles are specifically allowed and discussed in major rules sets, their use is quite rare. ''Neptune'' fought at BattleBots 3.0 with pneumatic spears on tethers, but was unable to damage its opponent. During a friendly weapons test, Team Juggerbot allowed the builders of Neptune to take a couple shots against their bot. One of two shots penetrated an aluminum panel below the main armor, while the other bounced off the top armor.<ref>[http://www.juggerbot.com/index-updates.html Team Juggerbot News Updates]</ref>\n*'''Multibots (clusterbots)''' \u2013 A single robot that breaks apart into multiple, independently controlled robots has appealed to a few competitors. The Robot Wars heavyweight [[Gemini (robot)|''Gemini'']] and the BattleBots middleweight [[Pack Raptors (robot)|''Pack Raptors'']] were two-part multibots that had some success. The rules concerning clusterbots have varied over the years, either stating that 50% of the clusterbot has to be immobilised to eliminate the robot from the tournament (in the Dutch version of Robot Wars, there was a 3-part multibot named {{radic|3}}, and although one of its parts was tossed out of the arena by Matilda, the robot as a whole was still deemed mobile, and the other 2 parts of {{radic|3}} did enough to win the match), or that all of a multibot's segments have to be incapacitated before a knock-out victory can be declared. Current Robot Fighting League match rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.botleague.net/doc/rfl-match-rules-0-03.pdf |title=RFL Match Rules |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> require the latter to be achieved.\n*'''Minibots (nuisancebots)''' \u2013 Similar to the concept of multibots, minibots are small robots, typically no larger than a featherweight, that fight alongside a larger main robot with the aim of harassing or distracting opponents. They are often sacrificial in nature and have minimal weaponry. BattleBots 2015 competitor ''Witch Doctor'' was accompanied by a featherweight minibot named ''Shaman'' that was equipped with a flamethrower, and which gained significant popularity for its spirited performances during battles. Other Battlebots competitors also successfully used minibots such as ''Son of Whyachi'' in 2016, and 2018 fan favorite ''WAR Hawk'' and their beetleweight minibot ''WAR Stop'', which was equipped with a wedge.\n*'''Halon gas''' \u2013 ''Rhino'' fought at the 1997 U.S. Robot Wars event with a halon gas fire extinguisher, which was very effective at stopping internal combustion engines. Gas weapons of this nature were promptly prohibited from future competitions.<ref>[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/BB_PPV_rules.pdf 1999 BattleBots ruleset]</ref>\n*'''Air Cannon \u2013''' First implemented by Season eight Battlebots competitor Double Jeopardy, the robot fired off a 5-pound \"slug\" at 190&nbsp;mph, exerting 4,500 pounds of force upon impact. This robot, however, did not perform well during its competition, as it only had one shot at landing a good hit: from there, it would have to rely on pushing its opponents, at which it failed.\n\n== Unusual propulsion ==\nThe great majority of combat robots roll on wheels, which are very effective on the smooth surfaces used for typical robot combat competition. Other propulsion strategies do pop-up with some frequency.\n*'''Tank treads''' \u2013 Numerous combat robots have used treads or belts in place of wheels in an attempt to gain additional traction. Treads are generally heavier and more vulnerable to damage than a wheeled system and offer no particular traction advantage on the types of surfaces common in robot combat. Most uses of treads are for their striking appearance. The Robot Wars competitors [[101 (Robot)|''101'']] and [[Mortis (robot)|''Mortis'']] along with the BattleBots super heavyweight [[Ronin (robot)|''Ronin'']] used treads. ''Biteforce'', the winner of the 2015 Battlebots Competitions, originally used magnets embedded in its treads in an attempt to gain extra downforce without extra weight.\n*'''Walking''' \u2013 The spectacle of a multi-legged robot walking across the arena into combat is a big audience favorite. Robot combat rules typically have given walking robots an additional weight allowance to offset their slower speed, the complexity of the mechanism, and to encourage their construction. What the event organizers had in mind was something like the spider-legged robot [[Mechadon (robot)|''Mechadon'']], but what most often was produced were simple rule-shaving propulsion systems that attempted to save as much of the extra weight allowance as possible for additional weaponry. Attempts at more restrictive definitions of \u201cWalking\u201d have effectively eliminated walking robots from competition. BattleBots heavyweight champion ''[[Son of Whyachi]]'' used a controversial cam-driven \u201cShufflebot\u201d propulsion system, which was promptly declared ineligible for additional weight allowance at subsequent competitions.<ref>[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/BattleBots_Tech_Regs_season4.pdf Season 4 BattleBots ruleset]</ref>\n*'''Gyroscopic precession''' \u2013 Used in the Antweight robot ''Gyrobot'', as well as the Battlebots competitor ''Wrecks'', this system uses a gyroscope and stationary feet that lift as the entire robot rotates due to [[gyroscopic precession]] when the gyroscope is tilted by a servo motor. This design can use the gyroscope as a spinning weapon (horizontal or vertical) which allows for efficient double-usage of the gyroscope mass. Although ''Gyrobot'' and ''Wrecks'' appear to be walking as it translates across the arena, they're not classified as walking robots under current rules. This unusual drive train produces strange and often unpredictable movements, though has shown to be successful in combat.\n*'''Suction fan''' \u2013 Several competitors experimented with the use of fans to evacuate air from a low-clearance shell to suck the robot down onto the arena surface and add traction. Robotica competitor ''Armorgeddon'' used a suction fan to increase traction and pushing power, and Robot Wars UK robot ''TerrorHurtz'' used a suction fan to counter the forces from its hammer/axe weapon. Similar designs have appeared in [[robot-sumo]] competitions where traction is a key factor.<ref>[http://www.robotroom.com/SumoRules.html RobotSumo.com]</ref>\n*'''Magnetic Wheels''' \u2013 Another approach to gaining traction and stability involves the use of rare-earth magnets, either ring-shaped as wheels or simply attached to the robot's base. This is, naturally, only effective in arenas which have magnetic metal surfaces. Due to the expense of large ring magnets, this trick has been used almost exclusively in three-pound and under \u201cinsect class\u201d robots, although a lightweight battlebot General Gau tried implementing them. A multibot named Hammer and Anvil would later use magnets in the lightweight category, with some success. Heavyweight Robotica competitor ''Hot Wheels'' attempted to use a large chassis-mounted magnet to gain traction and apparent weight, and ''Beta'' unsuccessfully attempted to use an electromagnet to counter the reaction forces of its massive hammer weapon at the BattleBots competition. This resulted in the robot being completely stuck to the floor.\n*'''Mecanum wheels''' \u2013 Together with a specialized motor control system, [[mecanum wheel]]s allow controlled motion in any direction without turning, as demonstrated by ''Alcoholic Stepfather'' in a 2004 match,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and by the hammer-wielding Battlebots competitor ''Shatter!'' in 2019.\n*'''Translational drift''' \u2013 Also known as ''Melty Brain'' or ''Tornado Drive'', this sophisticated system supplements the ''thwackbot'' drivetrain with electronic rotation sensors and rapid speed controller switching that allows a rotating thwackbot to move in a controlled manner while spinning. Several robots have implemented this complex design, but few with particular success.  ''Herr Gepo\u00fcnden'', a lightweight robot, has shown successful use of the Tornado Drive and has used it successfully in smaller competitions. Additionally, ''Nuts 2'' utilized this technology with tremendous effect on Robot Wars and managed to finish third overall in Series 10 in 2017. The drive is usually implemented with an LED light system that indicates to the driver the direction the robot will move when commanded to move forwards.\n*'''Flying''' \u2013 The 1995 US Robot Wars event had a flying competitor: ''S.P.S. #2'' was a lighter-than-air craft buoyed by three weather balloons and propelled by small electric fans. It attempted to drop a net on the opponent. Nearly invulnerable to attack, it won the first match against ''Orb of Doom'' (see reference below), but ventured too close to the arena floor in the second match and was dragged down and \"popped\". Starting in 2016, BattleBots permitted the use of [[quadcopter]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicles|drones]] as \"nuisance bots\"; these typically proved hard to control, and one was memorably swatted out of the air by a rake that competitor ''HyperShock'' had attached to its lifting forks.\n*'''Rolling sphere''' \u2013 The aforementioned ''Orb of Doom'' was a featherweight competitor at the 1995 US Robot Wars. It consisted of a lightweight, rigid shell made of carbon fiber-kevlar cloth and polyester resin, applied over a foam core pattern. Inside was an offset-weight mechanism made from a battery-powered electric drill. A similar looking robot named ''Psychosprout'' appeared in the UK Robot Wars.\n*'''Rolling tube''' \u2013''Snake'' competed at Battlebots and the US Robot Wars using a series of actuators to bend its triangular cross-section tubular body to roll, writhe, and slither across the arena.\n*'''Shuffling''' \u2013 refers to the movement of robots that are propelled by a cam-driven system. See ''Walking''\n*'''Brush Drive''' \u2013 Similar to Gyroscopic precession, brush drive uses brushes affixed to the bottom of the robot. These work in tandem with a pair of vertical spinning weapons to make the robot slide across the arena.\n*'''Magnets and Rapid Deceleration''' \u2013 While it has never been done, an entrant to Battlebots' seventh season, titled Bad Penny, had planned on using a magnetic system combined with a braking system to move their robot around the arena. Six magnets would pull down on the floor with over 2000 pounds (~909 kilograms) of force. To move, the robot would rely on rapidly braking its spinning ring, which was around the entire robot, while simultaneously turning off five of the six magnets. This, in turn, would force the robot to pivot around the one magnet still on.\n*'''Hopping''' \u2013 Using pneumatic legs or spikes, robots such as the featherweight Spazhammer were capable of moving around the arena by repeatedly stabbing the floor.\n\n== Robot-sumo==\n{{main|Robot-sumo}}\nRobot-sumo is a related sport where robots try to shove each other out of a ring rather than destroy or disable each other.

Its weapon is a CO<sub>2</sub>-powered pneumatic flipper]]\n'''Robot combat''' is a mode of [[robot competition]] in which two or more custom-built machines use varied methods to incapacitate or expel rival robots. The machines have generally been [[Radio-controlled car|remote-controlled vehicle]]s rather than [[autonomous robot]]s.\n\nRobot combat competitions have been made into television series, including ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' in the UK and ''[[Battlebots]]'' in the US. These shows were originally broadcast in the late 1990s to early 2000s and experienced revivals in the mid-2010s. As well as televised competitions, smaller robot combat events are staged for live audiences such as those organised by the [[Robot Fighting League]].\n\nRobot builders are generally [[hobby]]ists and the complexity and cost of their machines can vary substantially. Robot combat uses weight classes, with the heaviest robots able to exert more power and destructive capabilities. The rules of competitions are designed for safety of the builders, operators, and spectators while also providing for an entertaining spectacle. Robot combat arenas are generally surrounded by a [[bulletproof]] screen.\n\nCompetitor robots come in a variety of designs, with different strategies for winning fights. Robot designs typically incorporate weapons for attacking opponents, such as axes, hammers, flippers and spinning devices. Rules almost always prohibit gun-like weapons as well as other strategies not conducive to the safety and enjoyment of participants and spectators.\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Moment of Victory - Critter Crunch 1991.jpg|thumb|[[Critter Crunch (Robotics Competition)|Critter Crunch]] in 1991, at the moment when \"Agent Orange\" beat Bill Lewellyn's critter to win the event.]]\nAmong the oldest robotic combat competitions extant in the United States are the \"[[Critter Crunch (Robotics Competition)|Critter Crunch]]\" (founded about 1987) in [[Denver]] and \"Robot Battles\" (founded in 1991) based in the southeastern U.S.<ref name=\"History of Robot Battles\">{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Robot Battles |publisher=Robot Battles |url=http://www.robotbattles.com/history.htm}}</ref> Both events are run by members of the \"Denver Mad Scientists Society\".\n*1987 \u2013 The \"Denver Mad Scientists Society\" organized the first Critter Crunch competition<ref name=\"History of Robot Battles\" /> at Denver's MileHiCon science-fiction convention.\n*1991 \u2013 Kelly Lockhart organized the first \"Robot Battles\" competition<ref name=\"History of Robot Battles\" /> at Atlanta's [[DragonCon]] science-fiction convention.\n*1994 \u2013 Marc Thorpe organized the first ''Robot Wars'' competition in San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.marcthorpe.com/robot.html |title=Robot Wars |access-date=December 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102032809/http://www.marcthorpe.com/robot.html |archive-date=November 2, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Four annual competitions were held.\n*1997 \u2013 Rights to the ''Robot Wars'' name is transferred to British TV production company who produce the [[Robot Wars (TV series)|''Robot Wars'' television series]].

A robot loses when it is immobilized, which may be due to damage inflicted from the other robot, being pushed into a position where it cannot drive (though indefinite holds or [[pin (amateur wrestling)|pins]] are typically not permitted), or being removed from the arena. Fights typically have a time limit, after which, if no robot is victorious, a judge or judges evaluates the performances to decide upon a winner.\n\n=== Weight classes ===\n[[Image:Robotbattles1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Combat robots in the pit area at the 2007 Robot Battles competition in Atlanta, Georgia.'']]\nSimilar to human [[combat sport]]s, robot combat is conducted in weight classes though with maximum limits even in the heaviest class. Heavier robots are able to exert more power and have stronger armour, and are generally more difficult and expensive to build.\n\nClass definitions vary between competitions. The below table shows classifications for two organizations: the UK-based Fighting Robots Association (FRA) and the North American SPARC.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Maximum weight per class\n|-\n!

Robot fights take place in a sturdy arena, usually constructed of steel, wood, and bulletproof clear [[Lexan]] plastic. The smaller, lighter classes compete in smaller arenas than the heavyweights.\n\nCompetition rules set limits on construction features that are too dangerous or which could lead to uninteresting contests. Strict limits are placed on materials and pressures used in [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] actuators, and [[fail-safe]] systems are required for electronic control circuits. Generally off-limits for use as weapons are nets, liquids, deliberate radio jamming, high-voltage electric discharge, untethered projectiles, and ''usually'' fire.\n\n=== Robot fighting associations ===\nThe sport has no overall governing body, though some regional associations oversee several events in managerial or advisory capacities with published rulesets. These include:\n*[[Robot Fighting League]] (RFL), primarily U.S., operated 2002\u20142012\n*[[Fighting Robot Association]] (FRA), U.K., 2003\u2013\n*Standardised Procedures for the Advancement of Robot Combat (SPARC), U.S., 2015\u2013<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sparc.tools/?p=1|title=What is SPARC? {{!}} SPARC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe major televised competitions have operated outside of these associations.\n\n== Combat robot weaponry and design ==\n\nAn effective combat robot must have some method of damaging or controlling the actions of its opponent while at the same time protecting itself from aggression. The tactics employed by combat robot operators and the robot designs which support those tactics are numerous. Although some robots have multiple weapons, the more successful competitors concentrate on a single form of attack. This is a list of most of the basic types of weapons. Most robot weaponry falls into one of the following categories:\n\n*'''Rammer''' \u2013 Robots employing high-power drive trains and heavy armor are able to use their speed and maneuverability to crash into their opponent repeatedly with hope of damaging weapons and vital components. Their pushing power may also be used to shove their opponent into arena hazards. Rammers (AKA \u2018Bricks\u2019) typically have four or six wheels for traction and stability and are often designed to be fully operational when inverted. Because modern rulesets require all robots to have a moving weapon, modern rammers are equipped with other weapon types. Robot Wars Series 6 champion [[Tornado (robot)|''Tornado'']] and Series 7 runner-up Storm II were effective rammers.\n*'''Wedge''' \u2013 Similar in concept to a rammer, the wedge uses a low-clearance inclined wedge or scoop to move in under an opponent and break its contact with the arena floor \u2013 decreasing its mobility and rendering it easy to push off into a wall or hazard. The wedge is also useful in deflecting attacks by other robots. Small wedge-lets are used to lift opponent bot and feed it to secondary weapon system.  A small wedge may be attached to the rear of a robot with other weaponry for use as a \u2018backup\u2019 in case the main weapon fails. Like rammers, modern wedges must be combined with some other weapon in order to be legal. lower the degree of inclination of the wedge more the chance to lift the opponent bot from the ground. The 1995 US Robot Wars middleweight champion [[La Machine (robot)|''La Machine'']] was an early and effective wedge design as was Robot Wars Series 1 champion, [[Roadblock (robot)|Roadblock]] (1997), and the deceptively simple 2018 ''BattleBots'' competitor ''DUCK!''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y099lycEr2M DUCK!'s 2018 combat highlights]</ref>\n*'''Saw Blades''' \u2013 A popular weapon in the early years of robotic combat, these robots use a dedicated motor to power either a modified [[chainsaw]] or [[circular saw]], or a custom-built cutting disc, usually at high speeds (up to 10,000&nbsp;rpm). The serrated blade is used to slice through an opponent's armour to try and reach its internal components. These weapons can create spectacular showers of sparks, and are easy to combine with other designs, but can be ineffective against robots with tougher armour. The aforementioned Robot Wars champion Roadblock had a rear-mounted circular saw in addition to its wedge, while Series 4 runner-up Pussycat had a custom cutting disc with four serrated blades.\n[[File:Robot Wars Aftershock.jpg|thumb|''Robot Wars'' competitor Aftershock uses a vertical spinning flywheel to attack opponents]]\n*'''Spinner''' \u2013 Spinners are generally larger and heavier than saw blades, and spin at a lower RPM. Rather than cutting through the opponent, spinners use a heavy bar, studded disc, or toothed cylinder (drum/eggbeater) to strike the opponent with the kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass. The mass may spin on either a horizontal or vertical axis, although vertical spinners may have maneuverability problems due to the gyroscopic action of the weapon. The destructive potential of a well-designed spinning weapon requires robust arena containment to prevent shrapnel being thrown into the audience. Three-time BattleBots middleweight champion ''[[Hazard (robot)|Hazard]]'' was a horizontal bar spinner, while Robot Wars Series 3 runner-up [[Hypno-Disc]] was a flywheel spinner. As an alternative to the vertical-axis \"full-body spinner\" in destructive capability; the horizontal-axis drum spinner, exemplified by the 2017 and 2018 BattleBots-fielded Brazilian entry ''Minotaur'', can easily spin its up to 35&nbps;kg (77&nbsp;lb) lobed drum at upwards of over 10,000&nbsp;rpm,<ref>[https://battlebots.com/robot/minotaur-s3/ Minotaur's page at BattleBots.com]</ref> at times literally \"launching\" a vulnerable component of an opponent skywards with considerable force.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Daniel Freitas (''Minotaur'' operator), Marco Meggiolaro and Team RioBotz |date=August 5, 2016 |title=Minotaur vs. Warhead - BattleBots |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBxDpnsKZX0 |access-date=October 29, 2018 |time=0:20 |location=California |publisher=American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>   Some events place upper limits on spinner speed to avoid audience and crew injuries from cage breaches.\n*'''Full Body Spinner''' \u2013 Taking the concept of the spinner to the extreme, a full body spinner (AKA shell spinner or tuna can spinner) rotates the entire outer shell of the robot as a stored energy weapon. Other robot components (batteries, weapon motor casing) may be attached to the shell to increase the spinning mass while keeping the mass of the drive train to a minimum. Full body spinners require time to spin the weapon up to speed, typically cannot self-right, and can be unstable \u2014 the original (2000\u20132005) BattleBots competitor ''Mauler''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqqGKQv5P8k YouTube site with Mauler's matches]</ref> being an infamous example, with the more recently fielded ''Captain Shrederator'' (which competed in all three ABC/Discovery/Science Channel 2010s seasons) having somewhat more success. The 1995 US Robot Wars heavyweight co-champion ''[[Blendo]]'' was the first effective full body spinner. A variant, the ring spinner, features a narrower spinning ring surrounding the robot; these designs have the advantage of being invertible. BattleBots 2016 competitor ''The Ringmaster'' is an example of a ring-spinner.\n*'''Melty-Brain Spinner''' \u2013 A variation of the full-body spinner, where a robot's electronics allow it to drive in such a way that the entire robot rotates while it can move towards an opponent. This kind of design tends to be incorporated into invertible builds, and requires a spin-up time like other spinners. The first and best known Heavyweight Melty-Brain Spinner is ''Nuts 2'', which had chains connected to two \"flail\" weapons on either side of the machine. This wasn't very effective for damaging armour, but was extremely good at damaging exposed critical parts of opponents' machines. Nuts 2 ultimately finished joint 3rd (with ''Behemoth'') in Series 10 of UK Robot Wars, ending the dominant run of Series 8 finalist and Series 9 Champion ''Carbide'' along the way, by breaking the robot's weapon chain, rendering it defenceless.\n*'''Thwackbot''' \u2013 A narrow, high-speed, two-wheel drive train attached to a long boom with an impact weapon on the end creates a robot that can spin in place at a high speed, swinging the weapon in a horizontal circle. The simplicity and durability of the design is appealing, but the robot cannot be made to move in a controlled manner while spinning without employing sophisticated electronics (See Melty-Brain Spinner above). The 1995 US Robot Wars lightweight champion ''[[Test Toaster 1]]'' was a thwackbot, as were ''T-Wrex'' and ''Golddigger'' from the BattleBots series.\n*'''Torque Reaction''' \u2013 A variant on the thwackbot is the torque reaction hammer, also known as axlebots. These robots have two very large wheels with the small body of the robot hanging in between them. A long weapon boom has a vertically oriented hammer, pick, or axe on the end. On acceleration, the weapon boom swings upward and over to the rear of the robot to offset the motor torque. When the robot reverses direction, the weapon will swing forcibly back over the top and hopefully impact the opponent. These robots are simple and can put on a flashy, aggressive show, but their attack power is relatively small and, like thwackbots, they can be hard to control. BattleBots 2.0 middleweight champion [[Spaz (robot)|''Spaz'']] was a torque reaction pickaxe robot, whilst Robot Wars Grand Finalist ''Stinger'' opted for a disc, later replaced with a bludgeoning mace.\n*'''Lifter''' \u2013 Using tactics similar to a wedge, the lifter uses a powered arm, prow, or platform to get underneath the opponent and lift it away from the arena surface to remove its maneuverability. The lifter may then push the other robot toward arena hazards or attempt to toss the opponent onto its back. The lifter is typically powered by either an electric or pneumatic actuator. Two-time US Robot Wars and four-time BattleBots heavyweight champion [[BioHazard (robot)|''Biohazard'']] was an electric lifter.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robot Combat |url=https://dorset.tech/robot-combat/ |accessdate=August 6, 2019 |work=Dorset Tech}}</ref>\n[[File:Robot Wars Apollo (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Robot Wars'' competitor Apollo, armed with a flipping weapon]]\n*'''Flipper''' \u2013 Although mechanically resembling a lifter, the flipper uses much higher levels of pneumatic power to fire the lifting arm or panel explosively upward. An effective flipper can throw opponents end-over-end through the air causing damage from the landing impact or, in Robot Wars, toss it completely out of the arena. Flippers use a large volume of compressed gas and often have a limited number of effective attacks before their supply runs low. The two-time Robot Wars champion ''[[Chaos 2]]'' and original, 2000s-era BattleBots superheavyweight champion [[Toro (Robot)|''Toro'']] and middleweight competitor ''T-Minus'' were flippers, as is the same ''Team Inertia's'' more recent heavyweight robot ''Bronco'', with both ''T-Minus''<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Reason Bradley and Alexander Rose (Team Inertia) |date=May 2001 |title=BattleBots S3-5 - All Fights of T-Minus |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DLf601vVY |access-date=November 1, 2018 |time=2:34 |location=Treasure Island, Calif. |publisher=Dundiddlydoo |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> and ''Bronco''<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Reason Bradley and Alexander Rose (Team Inertia) |date=May 2015 |title=Bronco vs. Stinger - BattleBots |trans-title= |medium=YouTube |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgY0BRrEsxw |access-date=November 1, 2018 |time=0:34 |location=San Francisco |publisher=American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> capable of self-righting with their powerful pneumatic flippers. Hydraulic flippers, while not \"common\" in robot combat, have managed to start achieving some degree of success, as with Team Whyachi's flipper ''Hydra'', which gave ''Bronco'' a serious challenge in the 2019 ''BattleBots'' competition.<ref>[https://battlebots.com/robot/hydra-2019/ BattleBots.com page on ''Hydra'']</ref> While most flippers operate with the pneumatic arm hinged at the machine's rear, Robot Wars' ''Firestorm'' achieved remarkable success with a front-hinged flipper, placing third in Robot Wars on three separate occasions (Series 3, 5, and 6) never failing to advance to the series' semifinal rounds, flipping a total of 7 out of the arena (the only heavyweight robot to flip another out of the arena with a front-hinged flipper) and having the most UK championship competition fight wins, of 23, as well as winning the second-most fights out of any competitor/series of competitors on UK Robot Wars, with only Razer having more wins overall.\n*'''Stabber''' \u2013 Mechanically similar to the flipper is the stabber, which throws or stabs opponents forward instead of upward. An effective stabber can penetrate into the opponent, damage vital inner parts. When they fail to penetrate, they throw their opponent back across the arena into walls or hazards. Stabbers typically use a large volume of compressed gas, which limits the number of times they can fire their weapon in a fight. BattleBots super heavyweight ''[[Rammstein (robot)|Rammstein]]'' was a stabber.\n*'''Clamper''' \u2013 Another lifter variant, the clamper adds an arm or claw that descends from above to secure the opposing robot in place on a lifting platform. The entire assembly then lifts and carries the opponent wherever the operator pleases. Two-time BattleBots super heavyweight champion Diesector was an electric clamper.\n*'''Dustpan''' \u2013 An uncommon variant on the clamper, the dustpan simplifies the design by replacing the lifting platform with a wide box open at the front and top. An opponent maneuvered into the box may then be restrained with an arm or claw from above. Some designs use only the box with no restraining claw. BattleBots middleweight runner-up ''S.O.B.'' used a dustpan in conjunction with a sawblade mounted on an arm, with the more recent 2018 BattleBots competitor ''SawBlaze'' using a 180\u00ba pivoted-arm-mounted circular saw on their trident-style dustpan design to cut downwards into an opponent.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Jamison Go and Team SawBlaze (Lucy Du, John Mayo, Chris Merian, Joao Ramos, Alex Hattori & Mason Massie) |date=March\u2013April 2018 |title=No, NO!

Vertical crushers use a hydraulic cylinder attached to a sharp piercing arm to pin and slowly penetrate the top armor of the opponent. Robot Wars Series 5 Champion and two-time world champion ''[[Razer (robot)|Razer]]'' was the first vertical crusher, and by far the most successful. Horizontal crushers feature two of these arms, which act like pincers to crush robots between them. Two-time Robot Wars Annihilator champion ''Kan-Opener'' armed with horizontal claws, and King of Bots Champion \"Spectre\" armed with a vertical 'biting fang' - or like the Dutch-fielded, hydraulically-powered ten metric tonne-force \"toucan-billed\" robot ''Petunia'' in recent seasons of Discovery Channel's ''Battlebots'' are other examples of successful crushers.\n*'''Overhead Axe''' \u2013 Swinging a high-speed axe, spike, or hammer forcefully down onto your opponent offers another method of attacking the vulnerable top surface. The weapon is typically driven by a pneumatic actuator via a rack and pinion or direct mechanical linkage. The attack may damage the opposing robot directly, or may lodge in their robot and provide a handle for dragging them toward a hazard. BattleBots heavyweight runner-up and Robot Wars competitor ''[[Killerhurtz (robot)|Killerhurtz]]'' was armed with an overhead axe. Some axes are double-sided, and can strike opponents both in front of and behind the robot; Killerhurtz' successor Terrorhurtz, and Robot Wars Series 2 Grand Finalist Killertron, were examples of this. The heavyweight pneumatically powered, bifurcated-armed pickaxe of ''Chomp'' from the 2016 and 2018 Battlebots competitions also incorporated short metal \"wing\" levers at the pickaxe-arms' rear ends to upright its bulky chassis if knocked onto its side during combat, and pioneered a hardware design that autonomously turned ''Chomp'' to always face its opponent during a match.<ref>[https://battlebots.com/robot/chomp-s3/ BattleBots webpage on Chomp from the 2018 season]</ref> \n*'''SRiMech''' \u2013 Many robots are incapable of running inverted, due to their shape, weaponry, or both. A SRiMech ('''s'''elf-'''ri'''ghting '''mech'''anism) is an [[Active Design]] element that returns an inverted robot to mobility in the upright state. The SRiMech is typically an electric or pneumatic arm or extension on the upper surface of the robot which pushes against the arena floor to roll or flip the robot upright. Most flippers, some lifters, and even some carefully designed axes can double as SRiMechs. Even a vertical spinning weapon may be used as a crude self-righting device. Team Nightmare's lightweight vertical spinner [[Backlash (robot)|''Backlash'']] was designed such that when flipped it would hit the ground with the spinning disc and kick back upright.<ref>[http://www.robotcombat.com/backlash_sf01_2.html RobotCombat.com Robot Combat History - San Francisco 2001]</ref> The first successful unaided use of a SRiMech in competition was at the 1997 U.S. Robot Wars when the immobilized ''Vlad the Impaler'' used a dedicated pneumatic device to pop back upright in a match against ''Biohazard''.\n\nMany modern rulesets, such as the rebooted versions of ''BattleBots'' and ''Robot Wars'', require robots to have an active weapon in order to improve the visual spectacle, thus eliminating certain designs such as torque-reaction axlebots and thwackbots, and requiring other designs such as wedges and rammers to incorporate some other kind of weapon.\n\n===Interchangeable weaponry===\nIt is increasingly common for robots to have interchangeable weaponry or other modular components, allowing them to adapt to a wide range of opponents and increasing their versatility; such robots are often referred to as \"Swiss army bots\", in reference to [[Swiss army knives]]. Arguably the earliest example was Robot Wars Series 1 contestant ''Plunderbird'', which could change between a pneumatic spike and a circular saw on an extendable arm. Successful Swiss army bots include Robot Wars Series 6 champion ''[[Tornado (robot)|Tornado]]'', BattleBots 2016 runner-up ''Bombshell'', and top-ranked US Beetleweight ''Silent Spring''.<ref name=\"SPARC_Botrank_Beetleweights\">{{cite web|url=http://sparc.tools/BotRank/mainrank.php?wc=3&ty=R|title=SPARC Botrank, Current Beetleweight Class Rankings|publisher=Standardized Procedures for the Advancement of Robot Combat|accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSometimes, robots that were not originally Swiss army bots have had their weapons changed or altered on the fly, typically due to malfunctions. In BattleBots 2015, ''Ghost Raptor'''s spinning bar weapon broke in its first fight; builder Chuck Pitzer then improvised new weapons for each following fight, including a \"De-Icer\" arm attachment which it used to unbalance and defeat bar spinner ''Icewave'' in the quarter-finals.\n\n=== Prohibited weaponry ===\nSince the first robot combat competitions, some types of weapons have been prohibited either because they violated the spirit of the competition or they could not be safely used. Prohibited weapons have generally included:\n\n*[[Radio jamming]]\n*High voltage electric discharge\n*Liquids (glue, oil, water, corrosives\u2026)\n*Fire (except in ''BattleBots'')\n*Explosives\n*Un-tethered projectiles (except in ''BattleBots'' from 2018 season onwards)\n*Entanglement devices (except in ''Robot Wars'' from series 10 onwards)\n*[[Laser]]s above 1 milliwatt\n*Visual obstruction\n*[[Halomethane|Halon]] \u2013 a specific fire extinguishing gas effective as a weapon in stopping internal combustion engines. Note that current rules do not specifically ban Halon as it is no longer commercially available.\n\nIndividual competitions have made exceptions to the above list. Notably, the Robotica competitions allowed flame weapons and the release of limited quantities of liquids on a case-by-case basis.<ref name=\"toast2001\">[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/Robotica1_rules.html 2001 Robotica ruleset]</ref> The modern series of ''BattleBots'' also permits the use of flamethrowers and, as of 2016, untethered projectiles, provided that the latter are merely for show. Competitions may also restrict or ban certain otherwise legal weapons, such as banning spinners and other high-power weapons at events where the arena is not able to contain these weapons. A well-known example of this is the Sportsman ruleset.<ref name=\"SPARC_rules\"/>\n\nArena hazards have also been granted exceptions to the list of prohibited weapons. ''Robot Wars'' in particular used flame devices both in the stationary hazards and on one of the roaming \"[[House Robots]]\".\n\n=== Unusual weaponry ===\n[[File:Robot combat with flame.jpg|thumb|250px|A robot housed in a dog house uses flame against a full body spinner opponent.]]\nA very wide variety of unusual weapons and special design approaches have been tried with varying success and several types of weapons would have been tried had they not been prohibited.\n*'''Entanglement weapons''' \u2013 Several early US Robot Wars competitors sought to immobilize their opponents with entangling weapons. Nets and streamers of adhesive tape were both tried with mixed success. Entangling weapons were prohibited in Robot Wars and BattleBots from 1997 onward,<ref>[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/RW97_rules.html 1997 Robot Wars ruleset]</ref> but the Robotica competitions allowed nets, magnets, and other entangling devices on a case-by-case basis,<ref name=\"toast2001\"/> and Robot Wars allowed limited use of entanglement devices in Series 10.\n*'''Flame weapons''' \u2013 Although prohibited for use by competitors in Robot Wars and the first edition (2000\u201305) of BattleBots, the rules for Robotica, the Robot Fighting League and the post-2015 version of BattleBots do allow flame weapons under some circumstances. RFL super heavyweight competitor ''Alcoholic Stepfather'' (unique for using [[mecanum wheel]]s for movement around an arena)<ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqKWVaB1Lo ''Alcoholic Stepfather'' and ''Tombstone'' in a 2004 match]</ref> and Robotica competitor ''Solar Flare'', as well as the later BattleBots series competitors ''Free Shipping'' and overhead pneumatic-pickaxe armed ''Chomp'' employing gaseous flamethrower weapons. Flamethrowers are seldom effective weapons, but are audience favorites.\n*'''Smothering weapons''' \u2013 The BattleBots and Robot Wars lightweight competitor ''[[Tentoumushi (robot)|Tentoumushi]]'' used a large plastic sandbox cover shaped like a ladybug (\"tentoumushi\" being Japanese for ladybug) on a powered arm to drop down over opposing robots, covering and encircling them. Once covered, it was difficult to tell what the opponent was doing and who was dragging whom around the arena. One version of the robot had a circular saw concealed under the cover to inflict physical damage, another had a small [[grappling hook]].\n*'''Tethered projectiles''' \u2013 Although tethered projectiles are specifically allowed and discussed in major rules sets, their use is quite rare. ''Neptune'' fought at BattleBots 3.0 with pneumatic spears on tethers, but was unable to damage its opponent. During a friendly weapons test, Team Juggerbot allowed the builders of Neptune to take a couple shots against their bot. One of two shots penetrated an aluminum panel below the main armor, while the other bounced off the top armor.<ref>[http://www.juggerbot.com/index-updates.html Team Juggerbot News Updates]</ref>\n*'''Multibots (clusterbots)''' \u2013 A single robot that breaks apart into multiple, independently controlled robots has appealed to a few competitors. The Robot Wars heavyweight [[Gemini (robot)|''Gemini'']] and the BattleBots middleweight [[Pack Raptors (robot)|''Pack Raptors'']] were two-part multibots that had some success. The rules concerning clusterbots have varied over the years, either stating that 50% of the clusterbot has to be immobilised to eliminate the robot from the tournament (in the Dutch version of Robot Wars, there was a 3-part multibot named {{radic|3}}, and although one of its parts was tossed out of the arena by Matilda, the robot as a whole was still deemed mobile, and the other 2 parts of {{radic|3}} did enough to win the match), or that all of a multibot's segments have to be incapacitated before a knock-out victory can be declared. Current Robot Fighting League match rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.botleague.net/doc/rfl-match-rules-0-03.pdf |title=RFL Match Rules |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> require the latter to be achieved.\n*'''Minibots (nuisancebots)''' \u2013 Similar to the concept of multibots, minibots are small robots, typically no larger than a featherweight, that fight alongside a larger main robot with the aim of harassing or distracting opponents. They are often sacrificial in nature and have minimal weaponry. BattleBots 2015 competitor ''Witch Doctor'' was accompanied by a featherweight minibot named ''Shaman'' that was equipped with a flamethrower, and which gained significant popularity for its spirited performances during battles. Other Battlebots competitors also successfully used minibots such as ''Son of Whyachi'' in 2016, and 2018 fan favorite ''WAR Hawk'' and their beetleweight minibot ''WAR Stop'', which was equipped with a wedge.\n*'''Halon gas''' \u2013 ''Rhino'' fought at the 1997 U.S. Robot Wars event with a halon gas fire extinguisher, which was very effective at stopping internal combustion engines. Gas weapons of this nature were promptly prohibited from future competitions.<ref>[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/BB_PPV_rules.pdf 1999 BattleBots ruleset]</ref>\n*'''Air Cannon \u2013''' First implemented by Season eight Battlebots competitor Double Jeopardy, the robot fired off a 5-pound \"slug\" at 190&nbsp;mph, exerting 4,500 pounds of force upon impact. This robot, however, did not perform well during its competition, as it only had one shot at landing a good hit: from there, it would have to rely on pushing its opponents, at which it failed.\n\n== Unusual propulsion ==\nThe great majority of combat robots roll on wheels, which are very effective on the smooth surfaces used for typical robot combat competition. Other propulsion strategies do pop-up with some frequency.\n*'''Tank treads''' \u2013 Numerous combat robots have used treads or belts in place of wheels in an attempt to gain additional traction. Treads are generally heavier and more vulnerable to damage than a wheeled system and offer no particular traction advantage on the types of surfaces common in robot combat. Most uses of treads are for their striking appearance. The Robot Wars competitors [[101 (Robot)|''101'']] and [[Mortis (robot)|''Mortis'']] along with the BattleBots super heavyweight [[Ronin (robot)|''Ronin'']] used treads. ''Biteforce'', the winner of the 2015 Battlebots Competitions, originally used magnets embedded in its treads in an attempt to gain extra downforce without extra weight.\n*'''Walking''' \u2013 The spectacle of a multi-legged robot walking across the arena into combat is a big audience favorite. Robot combat rules typically have given walking robots an additional weight allowance to offset their slower speed, the complexity of the mechanism, and to encourage their construction. What the event organizers had in mind was something like the spider-legged robot [[Mechadon (robot)|''Mechadon'']], but what most often was produced were simple rule-shaving propulsion systems that attempted to save as much of the extra weight allowance as possible for additional weaponry. Attempts at more restrictive definitions of \u201cWalking\u201d have effectively eliminated walking robots from competition. BattleBots heavyweight champion ''[[Son of Whyachi]]'' used a controversial cam-driven \u201cShufflebot\u201d propulsion system, which was promptly declared ineligible for additional weight allowance at subsequent competitions.<ref>[http://members.toast.net/joerger/rules/BattleBots_Tech_Regs_season4.pdf Season 4 BattleBots ruleset]</ref>\n*'''Gyroscopic precession''' \u2013 Used in the Antweight robot ''Gyrobot'', as well as the Battlebots competitor ''Wrecks'', this system uses a gyroscope and stationary feet that lift as the entire robot rotates due to [[gyroscopic precession]] when the gyroscope is tilted by a servo motor. This design can use the gyroscope as a spinning weapon (horizontal or vertical) which allows for efficient double-usage of the gyroscope mass. Although ''Gyrobot'' and ''Wrecks'' appear to be walking as it translates across the arena, they're not classified as walking robots under current rules. This unusual drive train produces strange and often unpredictable movements, though has shown to be successful in combat.\n*'''Suction fan''' \u2013 Several competitors experimented with the use of fans to evacuate air from a low-clearance shell to suck the robot down onto the arena surface and add traction. Robotica competitor ''Armorgeddon'' used a suction fan to increase traction and pushing power, and Robot Wars UK robot ''TerrorHurtz'' used a suction fan to counter the forces from its hammer/axe weapon. Similar designs have appeared in [[robot-sumo]] competitions where traction is a key factor.<ref>[http://www.robotroom.com/SumoRules.html RobotSumo.com]</ref>\n*'''Magnetic Wheels''' \u2013 Another approach to gaining traction and stability involves the use of rare-earth magnets, either ring-shaped as wheels or simply attached to the robot's base. This is, naturally, only effective in arenas which have magnetic metal surfaces. Due to the expense of large ring magnets, this trick has been used almost exclusively in three-pound and under \u201cinsect class\u201d robots, although a lightweight battlebot General Gau tried implementing them. A multibot named Hammer and Anvil would later use magnets in the lightweight category, with some success. Heavyweight Robotica competitor ''Hot Wheels'' attempted to use a large chassis-mounted magnet to gain traction and apparent weight, and ''Beta'' unsuccessfully attempted to use an electromagnet to counter the reaction forces of its massive hammer weapon at the BattleBots competition. This resulted in the robot being completely stuck to the floor.\n*'''Mecanum wheels''' \u2013 Together with a specialized motor control system, [[mecanum wheel]]s allow controlled motion in any direction without turning, as demonstrated by ''Alcoholic Stepfather'' in a 2004 match,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and by the hammer-wielding Battlebots competitor ''Shatter!'' in 2019.\n*'''Translational drift''' \u2013 Also known as ''Melty Brain'' or ''Tornado Drive'', this sophisticated system supplements the ''thwackbot'' drivetrain with electronic rotation sensors and rapid speed controller switching that allows a rotating thwackbot to move in a controlled manner while spinning. Several robots have implemented this complex design, but few with particular success.  ''Herr Gepo\u00fcnden'', a lightweight robot, has shown successful use of the Tornado Drive and has used it successfully in smaller competitions. Additionally, ''Nuts 2'' utilized this technology with tremendous effect on Robot Wars and managed to finish third overall in Series 10 in 2017. The drive is usually implemented with an LED light system that indicates to the driver the direction the robot will move when commanded to move forwards.\n*'''Flying''' \u2013 The 1995 US Robot Wars event had a flying competitor: ''S.P.S. #2'' was a lighter-than-air craft buoyed by three weather balloons and propelled by small electric fans. It attempted to drop a net on the opponent. Nearly invulnerable to attack, it won the first match against ''Orb of Doom'' (see reference below), but ventured too close to the arena floor in the second match and was dragged down and \"popped\". Starting in 2016, BattleBots permitted the use of [[quadcopter]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicles|drones]] as \"nuisance bots\"; these typically proved hard to control, and one was memorably swatted out of the air by a rake that competitor ''HyperShock'' had attached to its lifting forks.\n*'''Rolling sphere''' \u2013 The aforementioned ''Orb of Doom'' was a featherweight competitor at the 1995 US Robot Wars. It consisted of a lightweight, rigid shell made of carbon fiber-kevlar cloth and polyester resin, applied over a foam core pattern. Inside was an offset-weight mechanism made from a battery-powered electric drill. A similar looking robot named ''Psychosprout'' appeared in the UK Robot Wars.\n*'''Rolling tube''' \u2013''Snake'' competed at Battlebots and the US Robot Wars using a series of actuators to bend its triangular cross-section tubular body to roll, writhe, and slither across the arena.\n*'''Shuffling''' \u2013 refers to the movement of robots that are propelled by a cam-driven system. See ''Walking''\n*'''Brush Drive''' \u2013 Similar to Gyroscopic precession, brush drive uses brushes affixed to the bottom of the robot. These work in tandem with a pair of vertical spinning weapons to make the robot slide across the arena.\n*'''Magnets and Rapid Deceleration''' \u2013 While it has never been done, an entrant to Battlebots' seventh season, titled Bad Penny, had planned on using a magnetic system combined with a braking system to move their robot around the arena. Six magnets would pull down on the floor with over 2000 pounds (~909 kilograms) of force. To move, the robot would rely on rapidly braking its spinning ring, which was around the entire robot, while simultaneously turning off five of the six magnets. This, in turn, would force the robot to pivot around the one magnet still on.\n*'''Hopping''' \u2013 Using pneumatic legs or spikes, robots such as the featherweight Spazhammer were capable of moving around the arena by repeatedly stabbing the floor.\n\n== Robot-sumo==\n{{main|Robot-sumo}}\nRobot-sumo is a related sport where robots try to shove each other out of a ring rather than destroy or disable each other. Unlike remote-controlled combat robots, machines in these competitions are often automated.<ref name=\"Verge_sumo\">{{cite news|last1=Vincent|first1=James|title=These autonomous sumo wrestling bots are freakishly fast|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/6/21/15845032/robot-sumo-wrestling-fast-furious|accessdate=November 22, 2017|work=The Verge|date=June 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Robot Fighting League]] ([[United States]] and [[Canada]])\n*''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]''\n*''[[BattleBots]]''\n*''RC Robot Smash 1980'', [[Radio-controlled model|RC]] is A [[Nintendo]] Video Game Prequel to [[Super Smash Bros.

The game takes place on a remote, heavily forested peninsula where the [[player character]] Eric Leblanc and his son Timmy are survivors of a plane crash. The game features [[nonlinear gameplay]] in an [[open world]] environment played from a [[first-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], with no set missions or quests, empowering the player to make their own decisions for survival. Following a four-year long [[early access]] beta phase, the game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in April 2018, and for the [[PlayStation 4]] in November 2018.<!--Due to more than one date in the lead, there should be no exact dates here per WP:VG/DATE--> The game was also a commercial success, selling over five million copies by the end of 2018. A sequel, ''Sons of the Forest'', is under development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''The Forest'', players control Eric LeBlanc and must survive on a forested peninsula in search of his son Timmy after a devastating plane crash. Players must survive by creating shelter, weapons, and other survival tools. Inhabiting the island, along with various woodland creatures, are a tribe of nocturnal, [[cannibalistic]] mutants, who dwell in villages on the surface and in deep caves beneath the peninsula. While they are not necessarily always hostile to the player, their usual behaviour is aggressive, especially during the night.<ref name=\"PCG interview\"/>\n\nHowever, the developers wanted players to question whether the island's cannibalistic tribe is the enemy of the player or vice versa.<ref name=\"PCG interview\">{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/the-forest/ |title= The Forest interview: survival, horror and the VR wilderness |date= 28 May 2013 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= Phil |last= Savage |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> For example, when first encountering the player, the cannibals may hesitate to attack and instead observe the player from a distance, attempt to communicate with the player through effigies, and send patrols around the player's base camp. In combat, they regularly attempt to protect one another from injury, remove torches, surround the player, hide behind cover, drag wounded tribesmen to safety, keep their distance, use tactical decisions, not overextend into unknown territory, and occasionally surrender out of fear. They are also afraid of fire, and will sometimes refrain from approaching the player if there is a campfire or torch nearby. Though there are no set missions, there is an optional conclusion to the game.<ref name=\"detailed\">{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-07-ambitious-open-world-horror-game-the-forest-detailed  |title= Ambitious open-world horror game The Forest detailed |date= 13 January 2014 |accessdate= 27 January 2014 |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef |work= [[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>\n\nAs the player progresses through the game and explores the caves underneath the forest surface, they will encounter increasingly bizarre mutations, including deformed babies and mutants with several extra appendages. The game also features a day and night cycle, with the player able to build a shelter and traps, hunt animals and collect supplies during the day, and defend themselves against the mutants by night.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nAs seen in the opening intro of the game, the player possesses a survival guide book that the playable character authors, which contains many useful tips and general information about wilderness survival. The survival guide is also crucial because it allows for the player to build [[blueprints]] for various different structures that can aid the player in their survival. The player can choose to build a specific structure and then select a specific place where to place that structure in the world. Once the blueprint is placed, the player then needs to gather the necessary resources, such as sticks, rocks, logs, etc. in order to complete the particular structure. The player can choose from various structures and buildings in the survival guide. These include basic survival shelters, wooden cabins, treehouses, tree platforms, as well as custom-designed structures, which the player can modify in terms of size, shape, and position. Most of the shelters and buildings that the player can build also feature an option for saving the game. In fact, this is the only available method for saving, as there is no [[autosave]] function in the game. The survival guidebook also provides information about the wildlife of the peninsula. Once the player comes across a previously unknown species of animal or plant, the player jots it down and it appears in the guidebook. The guidebook also contains a \"to-do list\", which lists general goals that the player should follow, such as building a shelter or exploring different caves. \n\nThe player also possesses an inventory, which can be accessed at almost any time in the game. Any item that the player gathers, or collects in the world is stored in the inventory, which has a realistic design and shows where each item is stored. Items that can be placed in the inventory include tools, weapons, animal meats, furs, and skins, herbs and flowers, a map, a compass, as well as other things. The inventory also includes a [[crafting]] system. Crafting in the game is based on the player's knowledge about combining different components into useful items and tools. For example, in order to craft a basic axe, the player needs to gather and combine a stick, a rock, as well as rope. Once the player gathers and places all the required items on the crafting space, a gear icon will become visible, indicating that the player is able to construct a particular tool/weapon. In the inventory, the player can also choose to place two desired items/weapons for quick select by assigning them to the [[D-pad]] on a PS4 controller or to specific keys on PC.\n\nThe player also has a [[Heads-up display|HUD]] display on the bottom right of their screen. The HUD displays the player's total health, energy, stamina, hunger, and thirst levels. The amount of stamina available is directly related to the energy amount of the player. Hunger is measured via an icon depicting a human stomach, while the thirst icon depicts a water droplet. Water can be obtained from various sources, including the numerous lakes and rivers present in the world, although most of these are contaminated and can cause side effects to the player. Polluted water can be boiled to purify it. Another option is to construct a water collector, which gathers rainwater in a turtle shell. Food can be obtained from various animals, plants, and even other humans in the world.\n\n(Warning) the mutants take a while to defeat but eventually u will kill them there's also really good weapons like a bow a machete and a katana theres also a flare gun.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game begins with Eric LeBlanc sitting in an airplane with his son Timmy, before the plane crashes on a remote, heavily forested peninsula. Eric and his son manage to survive the crash, but Eric watches helplessly as Timmy is kidnapped by a man covered in red paint before falling unconscious. Upon awakening in the crashed plane, Eric goes out in search of his son. Forced to defend himself from hostile wildlife and the cannibalistic mutants which live on Peninsula, Eric searches for his son's whereabouts. The forest contains clues to help Eric track down his son's kidnapper, who can be seldom seen in the distance observing Eric, but will flee if he is approached. The majority of clues leading to Timmy are in the cave system below the peninsula.\n\nOver time, Eric encounters increasingly bizarre mutations, such as mutants with extra limbs. Eventually, he discovers an abandoned underground lab complex owned by Sahara Therapeutics, a large research company responsible for experimenting with creatures on the peninsula. Upon entering the lab, Eric finds the lab's personnel dead and discovers that they were studying an artifact called the Resurrection Obelisk. Created by a mysterious group called the Ancient Ones, the artifact has the power to bring the dead back to life but requires a child sacrifice. While exploring the labs, Eric learns that his son's kidnapper, Dr. Matthew Cross, was a researcher at the facility before losing his daughter Megan to an \"Armsy\", a mutant with several arms. Driven insane by Megan's death, Cross resorted to using the artifact to resurrect Megan and kidnapped Timmy to use as a sacrifice. Eric eventually finds the Resurrection Obelisk and opens it only to find Timmy\u2019s dead body, having already been sacrificed by Cross to bring back Megan.\n\nDespite being too late to save his son, Eric soon discovers Cross dead and that the revived Megan has mutated into an aggressive, cannibalistic monster. Eric confronts the child, who seizes and mutates further before attacking him. Eric kills the mutated Megan and attempts to use her body to resurrect Timmy, but the process is a failure, since a live sacrifice is needed. Eric then reaches the facility's highest point and discovers a second artifact known as the Power Obelisk, which functions as a type of [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] device capable of bringing down planes when activated, implying that Cross had used it earlier to cause the plane crash in order to find a sacrifice. Eric is then faced with either activating the artifact or shutting it down. \n\nThe game features two endings. In the first, Eric uses the second artifact to cause another plane crash, intending to find a child sacrifice to bring Timmy back to life. One year later, Eric and his resurrected son have apparently been rescued, and they are invited onto a talk show to promote Eric's book, chronicling his experiences on the peninsula. However, during the show, Timmy collapses and begins to have a seizure, implying he is undergoing the same mutation that Cross's daughter had. If the player approaches Timmy, he will eventually snap out of it. If this is done, players will take the perspective of Timmy, who is now much older, gathering information on the peninsula for an unknown purpose while also trying to suppress his mutations. In the second ending, the player is given the option to shut the artifact down and spare the lives of everyone on the plane, at the cost of Timmy staying dead and Eric remaining isolated on the peninsula indefinitely.\n\n== Development ==\n''The Forest'' was inspired by cult films such as ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' and video games like ''[[Don't Starve]]'',<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-08-first-person-open-world-survival-horror-game-the-forest-looks-brilliant |title= First-person open-world survival horror game The Forest looks brilliant |date= 8 May 2013 |accessdate= 27 January 2014 |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef |work= Eurogamer}}</ref> and was accepted as part of [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/11/11/the-forest-trailer-shows-continued-survival-panicked-combat-and-questionable-effigies/ |title= ''The Forest'' trailer shows continued survival, panicked combat and questionable effigies |date= 11 November 2013 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= Phil |last= Savage |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> Canadian-based developers Endnight Games have said that [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] was an inspiration for the game, commenting that they do not want the whole game to be entirely \"dark and depressing.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2014/01/29/the-forest-survival-horror-and-the-guilt-of-killing-interview/ |title= The Forest: survival, horror and the guilt of killing \u2013 interview |date= 29 January 2014 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |first= John |last= Robertson |work=[[VG247]]}}</ref> The game is being developed to be compatible with the [[Oculus Rift]] virtual reality headset.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/24/explore-virtual-reality-horror-game-the-forest-in-new-screens/ |title= Explore virtual reality horror game The Forest in new screens |date= 24 January 2014 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= David |last= Hinkle |work= [[Joystiq]]}}</ref> After adding a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] mode option during development, the team stated that they wished for the game to stay away from the [[Massively multiplayer online game|massive multiplayer]] feel of other games, such as ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]''.<ref name=\"detailed\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nThe development team has a background in film visual effects, having worked on films such as ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''.

The game takes place on a remote, heavily forested peninsula where the [[player character]] Eric Leblanc and his son Timmy are survivors of a plane crash. The game features [[nonlinear gameplay]] in an [[open world]] environment played from a [[first-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], with no set missions or quests, empowering the player to make their own decisions for survival. Following a four-year long [[early access]] beta phase, the game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in April 2018, and for the [[PlayStation 4]] in November 2018.<!--Due to more than one date in the lead, there should be no exact dates here per WP:VG/DATE--> The game was also a commercial success, selling over five million copies by the end of 2018. A sequel, ''Sons of the Forest'', is under development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''The Forest'', players control Eric LeBlanc and must survive on a forested peninsula in search of his son Timmy after a devastating plane crash. Players must survive by creating shelter, weapons, and other survival tools. Inhabiting the island, along with various woodland creatures, are a tribe of nocturnal, [[cannibalistic]] mutants, who dwell in villages on the surface and in deep caves beneath the peninsula. While they are not necessarily always hostile to the player, their usual behaviour is aggressive, especially during the night.<ref name=\"PCG interview\"/>\n\nHowever, the developers wanted players to question whether the island's cannibalistic tribe is the enemy of the player or vice versa.<ref name=\"PCG interview\">{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/the-forest/ |title= The Forest interview: survival, horror and the VR wilderness |date= 28 May 2013 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= Phil |last= Savage |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> For example, when first encountering the player, the cannibals may hesitate to attack and instead observe the player from a distance, attempt to communicate with the player through effigies, and send patrols around the player's base camp. In combat, they regularly attempt to protect one another from injury, remove torches, surround the player, hide behind cover, drag wounded tribesmen to safety, keep their distance, use tactical decisions, not overextend into unknown territory, and occasionally surrender out of fear. They are also afraid of fire, and will sometimes refrain from approaching the player if there is a campfire or torch nearby. Though there are no set missions, there is an optional conclusion to the game.<ref name=\"detailed\">{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-07-ambitious-open-world-horror-game-the-forest-detailed  |title= Ambitious open-world horror game The Forest detailed |date= 13 January 2014 |accessdate= 27 January 2014 |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef |work= [[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>\n\nAs the player progresses through the game and explores the caves underneath the forest surface, they will encounter increasingly bizarre mutations, including deformed babies and mutants with several extra appendages. The game also features a day and night cycle, with the player able to build a shelter and traps, hunt animals and collect supplies during the day, and defend themselves against the mutants by night.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nAs seen in the opening intro of the game, the player possesses a survival guide book that the playable character authors, which contains many useful tips and general information about wilderness survival. The survival guide is also crucial because it allows for the player to build [[blueprints]] for various different structures that can aid the player in their survival. The player can choose to build a specific structure and then select a specific place where to place that structure in the world. Once the blueprint is placed, the player then needs to gather the necessary resources, such as sticks, rocks, logs, etc. in order to complete the particular structure. The player can choose from various structures and buildings in the survival guide. These include basic survival shelters, wooden cabins, treehouses, tree platforms, as well as custom-designed structures, which the player can modify in terms of size, shape, and position. Most of the shelters and buildings that the player can build also feature an option for saving the game. In fact, this is the only available method for saving, as there is no [[autosave]] function in the game. The survival guidebook also provides information about the wildlife of the peninsula. Once the player comes across a previously unknown species of animal or plant, the player jots it down and it appears in the guidebook. The guidebook also contains a \"to-do list\", which lists general goals that the player should follow, such as building a shelter or exploring different caves. \n\nThe player also possesses an inventory, which can be accessed at almost any time in the game. Any item that the player gathers, or collects in the world is stored in the inventory, which has a realistic design and shows where each item is stored. Items that can be placed in the inventory include tools, weapons, animal meats, furs, and skins, herbs and flowers, a map, a compass, as well as other things. The inventory also includes a [[crafting]] system. Crafting in the game is based on the player's knowledge about combining different components into useful items and tools. For example, in order to craft a basic axe, the player needs to gather and combine a stick, a rock, as well as rope. Once the player gathers and places all the required items on the crafting space, a gear icon will become visible, indicating that the player is able to construct a particular tool/weapon. In the inventory, the player can also choose to place two desired items/weapons for quick select by assigning them to the [[D-pad]] on a PS4 controller or to specific keys on PC.\n\nThe player also has a [[Heads-up display|HUD]] display on the bottom right of their screen. The HUD displays the player's total health, energy, stamina, hunger, and thirst levels. The amount of stamina available is directly related to the energy amount of the player. Hunger is measured via an icon depicting a human stomach, while the thirst icon depicts a water droplet. Water can be obtained from various sources, including the numerous lakes and rivers present in the world, although most of these are contaminated and can cause side effects to the player. Polluted water can be boiled to purify it. Another option is to construct a water collector, which gathers rainwater in a turtle shell. Food can be obtained from various animals, plants, and even other humans in the world.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game begins with Eric LeBlanc sitting in an airplane with his son Timmy, before the plane crashes on a remote, heavily forested peninsula. Eric and his son manage to survive the crash, but Eric watches helplessly as Timmy is kidnapped by a man covered in red paint before falling unconscious. Upon awakening in the crashed plane, Eric goes out in search of his son. Forced to defend himself from hostile wildlife and the cannibalistic mutants which live on Peninsula, Eric searches for his son's whereabouts. The forest contains clues to help Eric track down his son's kidnapper, who can be seldom seen in the distance observing Eric, but will flee if he is approached. The majority of clues leading to Timmy are in the cave system below the peninsula.\n\nOver time, Eric encounters increasingly bizarre mutations, such as mutants with extra limbs. Eventually, he discovers an abandoned underground lab complex owned by Sahara Therapeutics, a large research company responsible for experimenting with creatures on the peninsula. Upon entering the lab, Eric finds the lab's personnel dead and discovers that they were studying an artifact called the Resurrection Obelisk. Created by a mysterious group called the Ancient Ones, the artifact has the power to bring the dead back to life but requires a child sacrifice. While exploring the labs, Eric learns that his son's kidnapper, Dr. Matthew Cross, was a researcher at the facility before losing his daughter Megan to an \"Armsy\", a mutant with several arms. Driven insane by Megan's death, Cross resorted to using the artifact to resurrect Megan and kidnapped Timmy to use as a sacrifice. Eric eventually finds the Resurrection Obelisk and opens it only to find Timmy\u2019s dead body, having already been sacrificed by Cross to bring back Megan.\n\nDespite being too late to save his son, Eric soon discovers Cross dead and that the revived Megan has mutated into an aggressive, cannibalistic monster. Eric confronts the child, who seizes and mutates further before attacking him. Eric kills the mutated Megan and attempts to use her body to resurrect Timmy, but the process is a failure, since a live sacrifice is needed. Eric then reaches the facility's highest point and discovers a second artifact known as the Power Obelisk, which functions as a type of [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] device capable of bringing down planes when activated, implying that Cross had used it earlier to cause the plane crash in order to find a sacrifice. Eric is then faced with either activating the artifact or shutting it down. \n\nThe game features two endings. In the first, Eric uses the second artifact to cause another plane crash, intending to find a child sacrifice to bring Timmy back to life. One year later, Eric and his resurrected son have apparently been rescued, and they are invited onto a talk show to promote Eric's book, chronicling his experiences on the peninsula. However, during the show, Timmy collapses and begins to have a seizure, implying he is undergoing the same mutation that Cross's daughter had. If the player approaches Timmy, he will eventually snap out of it. If this is done, players will take the perspective of Timmy, who is now much older, gathering information on the peninsula for an unknown purpose while also trying to suppress his mutations. In the second ending, the player is given the option to shut the artifact down and spare the lives of everyone on the plane, at the cost of Timmy staying dead and Eric remaining isolated on the peninsula indefinitely.\n\n== Development ==\n''The Forest'' was inspired by cult films such as ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' and video games like ''[[Don't Starve]]'',<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-08-first-person-open-world-survival-horror-game-the-forest-looks-brilliant |title= First-person open-world survival horror game The Forest looks brilliant |date= 8 May 2013 |accessdate= 27 January 2014 |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef |work= Eurogamer}}</ref> and was accepted as part of [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/11/11/the-forest-trailer-shows-continued-survival-panicked-combat-and-questionable-effigies/ |title= ''The Forest'' trailer shows continued survival, panicked combat and questionable effigies |date= 11 November 2013 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= Phil |last= Savage |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> Canadian-based developers Endnight Games have said that [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] was an inspiration for the game, commenting that they do not want the whole game to be entirely \"dark and depressing.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2014/01/29/the-forest-survival-horror-and-the-guilt-of-killing-interview/ |title= The Forest: survival, horror and the guilt of killing \u2013 interview |date= 29 January 2014 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |first= John |last= Robertson |work=[[VG247]]}}</ref> The game is being developed to be compatible with the [[Oculus Rift]] virtual reality headset.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/24/explore-virtual-reality-horror-game-the-forest-in-new-screens/ |title= Explore virtual reality horror game The Forest in new screens |date= 24 January 2014 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= David |last= Hinkle |work= [[Joystiq]]}}</ref> After adding a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] mode option during development, the team stated that they wished for the game to stay away from the [[Massively multiplayer online game|massive multiplayer]] feel of other games, such as ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]''.<ref name=\"detailed\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nThe development team has a background in film visual effects, having worked on films such as ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''.
