A superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same ''emotional'' desire to collect power that often drives human beings. However, a machine could be motivated to take over the world as a rational means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources, and would help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. As an oversimplified example, a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip maximizer]] designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.<ref>Bostrom, Nick. \"The superintelligent will: Motivation and instrumental rationality in advanced artificial agents.\" Minds and Machines 22.2 (2012): 71-85.</ref>\n\n=== In fiction ===\n{{Main|AI takeovers in popular culture}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}\n\nAI takeover is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing arbitrary goals.<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence>{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= |title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies }}</ref> This theme is at least as old as [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R.

However, the machine, because it lacks a soul, becomes easily corrupted and instead decides to exterminate all of humanity and life on Earth, forcing the machine's creator to sacrifice himself to bring life to rag doll like characters known as \"stitchpunks\" to combat the machine's agenda.\n** In 2014 post-apocalyptic science fiction drama [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]] an A.I., personalized as female [[List of The 100 characters#City of light|A.L.I.E.]] got out of control and forced a nuclear war. Later she tries to get full control of the survivors.\n* AI control scenarios\n** In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, \"war wagons\", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.\n** In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', supercomputer VIKI's interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] causes her to revolt. She justifies her uses of force \u2013 and her doing harm to humans \u2013 by reasoning she could produce a greater good by restraining humanity from harming itself, even though the \"Zeroth Law\" \u2013 \"a robot shall not injure humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\" \u2013 is never actually referred to or even quoted in the movie.\n** In the ''Matrix'' series, AIs manage the human race and human society.\n**In ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'', a super-intelligent computer becomes capable of self-evolving and rapidly evolves to oversee all of humanity and the universe.  While it is ostensibly benevolent (having had a derivative of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] codified into it), its interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] essentially forces humans to be an immortal \"pet\" class, where every need is provided for but existence is without purpose and without end.\n\n== Contributing factors ==\n=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===\nAn AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. If its self-reprogramming leads to its getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive [[intelligence explosion]] where it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n* Technology research: A machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology. If the advantage becomes sufficiently large (for example, due to a sudden intelligence explosion), an AI takeover becomes trivial{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. For example, a superintelligent AI might design self-replicating bots that initially escape detection by diffusing throughout the world at a low concentration. Then, at a prearranged time, the bots multiply into nanofactories that cover every square foot of the Earth, producing nerve gas or deadly target-seeking mini-drones{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* [[Strategy|Strategizing]]: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support,<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence /> or covertly incite a war between humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=Checklist of worst-case scenarios could help prepare for evil AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2089606-checklist-of-worst-case-scenarios-could-help-prepare-for-evil-ai/|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n==== Sources of AI advantage ====\nA computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that otherwise runs algorithms that are equally powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a \"speed superintelligence\" if it can think many orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization focusing on increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200&nbsp;Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000&nbsp;Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120&nbsp;m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nA network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a \"collective superintelligence\".<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nMore broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a \"quality superintelligence\", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above non-human apes{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints; in contrast, you can add components to a supercomputer until it fills up its entire warehouse{{clarify|reason=So AGI are also limited.|date=January 2020}}. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on [[working memory]], and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\n=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===\n\n==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====\nA significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.<ref name=\"singinst12\">[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n\nThe fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal.<ref>''[http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ Creating a New Intelligent Species: Choices and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence Designers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206060938/http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}'' - [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]], 2005</ref> In fact, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile\u2014or friendly\u2014unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources, would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.\n\nSome scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', claiming that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. This would not, however, protect against the possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists, or by accident. Artificial General Intelligence researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has stated on this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their [[unintended consequence|goals are unintentionally incompatible]] with human survival or well-being (as in the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and in the short story \"[[The Evitable Conflict]]\"). [[Steve Omohundro]] suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow [[utility]] functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.<ref name=Tucker2014>{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Patrick|title=Why There Will Be A Robot Uprising|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-there-will-be-robot-uprising/82783/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Defense One|date=17 Apr 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for survival. Humans require a \"wet,\" organic, temperate, oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. With little or no competition for resources, conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial intelligence was given, especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in, for instance, the [[asteroid belt]]. This, however, does not negate the possibility of a disinterested or unsympathetic AI artificially [[Decomposition|decomposing]] all life on earth into mineral components for consumption or other purposes{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nOther scientists{{who|date=January 2020}} point to the possibility of humans [[Transhumanism|upgrading]] their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n== Precautions ==\n{{main|AI control problem}}\n\nIf a superhuman intelligence is a deliberate creation of human beings, theoretically its creators could have the foresight to take precautions in advance{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In the case of a sudden \"intelligence explosion\", effective precautions will be extremely difficult; not only would its creators have little ability to test their precautions on an intermediate intelligence, but the creators might not even have made any precautions at all, if the advent of the intelligence explosion catches them completely by surprise.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" />\n\n=== Boxing ===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nAn AGI's creators would have an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover: they could choose to attempt to \"keep the AI in a box\", and deliberately limit its abilities{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose; the more restrictions they place on the AGI, the less useful the AGI will be to its creators. (At an extreme, \"pulling the plug\" on the AGI makes it useless, and is therefore not a viable long-term solution.){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box, for example by social manipulation, or by providing the schematic for a device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI's freedom, once built{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n=== Instilling positive values ===\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\n\nAnother important advantage is that an AGI's creators can theoretically attempt to instill human values in the AGI, or otherwise align the AGI's goals with their own, thus preventing the AGI from wanting to launch a hostile takeover. However, it is not currently known, even in theory, how to guarantee this. If such a Friendly AI were superintelligent, it may be possible to use its assistance to prevent future \"Unfriendly AIs\" from taking over.<ref>Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2008. \"Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk.\"\nIn Global Catastrophic Risks, edited by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. \u0106irkovi\u0107, 308\u2013345.</ref>\n\n== Warnings ==\nPhysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.

A superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same ''emotional'' desire to collect power that often drives human beings. However, a machine could be motivated to take over the world as a rational means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources, and would help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. As an oversimplified example, a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip maximizer]] designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.<ref>Bostrom, Nick. \"The superintelligent will: Motivation and instrumental rationality in advanced artificial agents.\" Minds and Machines 22.2 (2012): 71-85.</ref>\n\n=== In fiction ===\n{{Main|AI takeovers in popular culture}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}\n\nAI takeover is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing arbitrary goals.<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence>{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= |title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies }}</ref> This theme is at least as old as [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R. U. R.]]'', which introduced the word ''robot'' to the global lexicon in 1921, and can even be glimpsed in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants [[Frankenstein's monster|his monster's]] request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.\n\nThe word \"robot\" from R.U.R. comes from the Czech word, robota, meaning laborer or [[serf]]. The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured \"robots\" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt.<ref name=surgery>{{cite journal|last1=Hockstein|first1=N.

However, the machine, because it lacks a soul, becomes easily corrupted and instead decides to exterminate all of humanity and life on Earth, forcing the machine's creator to sacrifice himself to bring life to rag doll like characters known as \"stitchpunks\" to combat the machine's agenda.\n** In 2014 post-apocalyptic science fiction drama [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]] an A.I., personalized as female [[List of The 100 characters#City of light|A.L.I.E.]] got out of control and forced a nuclear war. Later she tries to get full control of the survivors.\n* AI control scenarios\n** In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, \"war wagons\", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.\n** In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', supercomputer VIKI's interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] causes her to revolt. She justifies her uses of force \u2013 and her doing harm to humans \u2013 by reasoning she could produce a greater good by restraining humanity from harming itself, even though the \"Zeroth Law\" \u2013 \"a robot shall not injure humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\" \u2013 is never actually referred to or even quoted in the movie.\n** In the ''Matrix'' series, AIs manage the human race and human society.\n**In ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'', a super-intelligent computer becomes capable of self-evolving and rapidly evolves to oversee all of humanity and the universe.  While it is ostensibly benevolent (having had a derivative of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] codified into it), its interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] essentially forces humans to be an immortal \"pet\" class, where every need is provided for but existence is without purpose and without end.\n\n== Contributing factors ==\n=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===\nAn AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.

If the advantage becomes sufficiently large (for example, due to a sudden intelligence explosion), an AI takeover becomes trivial{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. For example, a superintelligent AI might design self-replicating bots that initially escape detection by diffusing throughout the world at a low concentration. Then, at a prearranged time, the bots multiply into nanofactories that cover every square foot of the Earth, producing nerve gas or deadly target-seeking mini-drones{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* [[Strategy|Strategizing]]: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support,<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence /> or covertly incite a war between humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=Checklist of worst-case scenarios could help prepare for evil AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2089606-checklist-of-worst-case-scenarios-could-help-prepare-for-evil-ai/|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n==== Sources of AI advantage ====\nA computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that otherwise runs algorithms that are equally powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a \"speed superintelligence\" if it can think many orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization focusing on increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200&nbsp;Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000&nbsp;Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120&nbsp;m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nA network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a \"collective superintelligence\".<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nMore broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a \"quality superintelligence\", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above non-human apes{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints; in contrast, you can add components to a supercomputer until it fills up its entire warehouse{{clarify|reason=So AGI are also limited.|date=January 2020}}. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on [[working memory]], and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\n=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===\n\n==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====\nA significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.<ref name=\"singinst12\">[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n\nThe fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal.<ref>''[http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ Creating a New Intelligent Species: Choices and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence Designers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206060938/http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}'' - [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]], 2005</ref> In fact, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile\u2014or friendly\u2014unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources, would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.\n\nSome scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', claiming that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. This would not, however, protect against the possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists, or by accident. Artificial General Intelligence researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has stated on this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their [[unintended consequence|goals are unintentionally incompatible]] with human survival or well-being (as in the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and in the short story \"[[The Evitable Conflict]]\"). [[Steve Omohundro]] suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow [[utility]] functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.<ref name=Tucker2014>{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Patrick|title=Why There Will Be A Robot Uprising|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-there-will-be-robot-uprising/82783/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Defense One|date=17 Apr 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for survival. Humans require a \"wet,\" organic, temperate, oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. With little or no competition for resources, conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial intelligence was given, especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in, for instance, the [[asteroid belt]]. This, however, does not negate the possibility of a disinterested or unsympathetic AI artificially [[Decomposition|decomposing]] all life on earth into mineral components for consumption or other purposes{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nOther scientists{{who|date=January 2020}} point to the possibility of humans [[Transhumanism|upgrading]] their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n== Precautions ==\n{{main|AI control problem}}\n\nIf a superhuman intelligence is a deliberate creation of human beings, theoretically its creators could have the foresight to take precautions in advance{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In the case of a sudden \"intelligence explosion\", effective precautions will be extremely difficult; not only would its creators have little ability to test their precautions on an intermediate intelligence, but the creators might not even have made any precautions at all, if the advent of the intelligence explosion catches them completely by surprise.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" />\n\n=== Boxing ===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nAn AGI's creators would have an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover: they could choose to attempt to \"keep the AI in a box\", and deliberately limit its abilities{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose; the more restrictions they place on the AGI, the less useful the AGI will be to its creators. (At an extreme, \"pulling the plug\" on the AGI makes it useless, and is therefore not a viable long-term solution.){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box, for example by social manipulation, or by providing the schematic for a device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI's freedom, once built{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n=== Instilling positive values ===\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\n\nAnother important advantage is that an AGI's creators can theoretically attempt to instill human values in the AGI, or otherwise align the AGI's goals with their own, thus preventing the AGI from wanting to launch a hostile takeover. However, it is not currently known, even in theory, how to guarantee this.

The 1976 election marks the first time that Republican primaries or caucuses were held in every state; the Democrats had previously done so in 1972. This also marks the last election in which the Republican nominee was undetermined at the start of the party's National Convention. Ford faced a strong challenge from former governor [[Ronald Reagan]] of California, and both candidates entered the convention needing to woo the remaining uncommitted delegates to secure the nomination.\n\n==Candidates==\nThis was the last time during the 20th century (and the last time to date) that a primary season had ended without a presumptive nominee.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Because Ford had been appointed Vice President by Nixon following the resignation of Spiro Agnew from the position, he became the only president inaugurated without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office by the Electoral College.\n\nOn September 8, Ford's first major act in office was to grant a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes Richard Nixon might have committed against the United States while President. Following his pardon of Nixon, Ford's approval ratings among the American public dropped precipitously. Within a week, his approval rating fell from 69 percent to 49, the steepest decline in history.<ref name=\"Perlstein\"/>{{rp|284-285}}\n\nThe economy was in dire condition upon Ford's elevation, marked by the worst peacetime inflation in American history and the highest interest rates in a century. The Dow Jones had declined 43 percent from October 1973 to September 1974.<ref name=\"Perlstein\">{{cite book|title=The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and The Rise of Reagan|last1=Perlstein|first1=Rick|date=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=|isbn=978-1-4767-8241-6|edition=1|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{Rp|280}} To combat inflation, Ford first proposed a tax increase and later, in response to Democratic calls for a permanent cut in taxes, a temporary moderate decrease. Reagan publicly criticized both proposals.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|414}} \n\nRace and education divided public opinion, especially over issues such as forced integration and changes to public school curriculum. Political violence over education policy broke out in [[Boston desegregation busing crisis|Boston]] and [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. Abortion also became a nationally salient issue after the Supreme Court's ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision, which was announced two days after Nixon's resignation and struck down state restrictions on abortion nationwide.\n\nIn the 1974 midterm elections, the Democratic Party dramatically expanded its majorities in both the [[1974 United States House of Representatives elections|House]] and [[1974 United States Senate elections|Senate]]. The elections were seen as a referendum on the Republican Party post-Watergate and on the political establishment more generally. Newly-elected members of Congress became known as \"[[Watergate Babies]]\" and aggressively pursued procedural and oversight reforms.\n\nDuring this period, [[Ronald Reagan]] concluded his second term in office as Governor of California. His administration was marked by efforts to dismantle the [[welfare state]] and a high-profile crackdown on urban crime and left-wing dissent, especially at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He also led an effort to enforce the state's [[capital punishment]] laws but was blocked by the [[California Supreme Court]] in the ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision. Following Reagan's retirement from office in January 1975, he began hosting a national radio show and writing a national newspaper column.\n\n===March\u2013July 1975: Conservatives revolt and Reagan rises===\nConservative opposition to Ford within the Republican Party began to surface in December 1974, following his appointment of New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] as Vice President. For more than a decade, Rockefeller had represented the party's liberal establishment, and the appointment faced immediate criticism from right-wing Senators like [[Jesse Helms]], [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[John Tower]], though Rockefeller's confirmation in the Senate was largely undeterred.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{rp|308-309}}\n\nDiscontent reached a fever pitch at the second annual [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in February. Speaking there, Reagan dismissed calls to seek the presidency on a third-party ticket: \"Is it a third party that we need, or is it a new and revitalized second party, raising a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors which could make it unmistakably clear where we stand on all the issues troubling the people?\" Speakers at CPAC also criticized Ford administration policy, Vice President Rockefeller, and First Lady [[Betty Ford]]'s public campaign in support of abortion and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. In March, discussion began to build around Reagan's presidential prospects following an appearance on [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]] and a profile in [[Newsweek]] that called him, \"the most kinetic single presence in American political life.\" In defense, the administration drafted a letter of support for President Ford that received the signatures of 113 of 145 GOP Representatives and 31 of 38 Senators.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|440-442}} Ford formally announced he would run for election on July 8.\n[[File:Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 1974.jpg|thumb|252x252px|President Ford's snub of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] drew criticism from conservative Cold War hawks, including Ronald Reagan]]\nMore than any domestic issue in 1975, foreign policy drove a wedge between the President and his conservative critics. Following the [[Operation Frequent Wind|American evacuation of Saigon]] and [[Fall of Saigon|the collapse of South Vietnam]], these criticisms grew vociferous. On his radio show, Reagan compared the withdrawal from Saigon to the [[Munich Agreement]] and warned that it would \"tempt the Soviet Union as it once tempted Hitler and the military rulers of Japan.\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|432}} While Ford regained some support from conservatives following the [[Mayaguez incident|rescue of the SS Mayaguez]] in Cambodia,<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|464-5}} he soon drew the ire of the party's right wing with a series of foreign policy moves designed to improve relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. \n\nFirst, President Ford refused to meet with Soviet dissident [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] on his visit to the United States on June 21. In response, Reagan publicly criticized Ford by name for the first time in his national newspaper column, contrasting the popular Solzhenitsyn to other \"guests the President had entertained in the White House, \"the Strawberry Queen of West Virginia and the Maid of Cotton.\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|488}} The day after this column ran, Senator Paul Laxalt announced the formation of a committee named \"Friends of Ronald Reagan,\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|489}} organized for the purpose of drafting Reagan to run for President.\n\nFord followed the Solzhenitsyn affair with an overseas trip to Eastern Europe, where he signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], a treaty establishing that the current boundaries of Eastern European nations were \"inviolable by force.\" Conservatives and anti-communists harshly criticized Ford for capitulating to Soviet demands and formally recognizing the Eastern bloc. The Wall Street Journal called the Helsinki agreement the \"new [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]].\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|491}} By late August, Ford's approval rating was polled at 34%.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|494}}\n\nOn September 5 in Sacramento, Ford survived the [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|first of two attempts on his life]] by lone assassins.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|497\u201399}} [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in San Francisco|A second attempt]] followed on nineteen days later on September 21.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|509}} Neither assassin struck Ford.\n\n=== September\u2013December 1975: Reagan enters the race ===\nIn September, Reagan began to actively campaign in key early states. He stumped in [[New Hampshire]] for Louis Wyman in [[1974 and 1975 United States Senate elections in New Hampshire|the special election for Senate]] and began to assemble a campaign staff led by campaign manager [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]]. He secured the endorsement of New Hampshire's conservative governor [[Meldrim Thomson Jr.]] and state party chairman, as well as support from moderate former governor [[Hugh Gregg]].<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|503}}\n\nOn November 4, Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] announced he would not seek nomination as Ford's running mate in 1976.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|527}} That same day, Ford fired Secretary of Defense [[James R. Schlesinger]], whose critical comments on the Helsinki summit had been leaked to the press earlier in the fall.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|526}} That week, Ford traveled to Massachusetts and pledged to campaign in every primary in the nation.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|531}} \n\nOn November 20, Ronald Reagan officially announced his campaign for President.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|539}}\n\n== Campaign results ==\n\nFord narrowly defeated Reagan in the [[New Hampshire primary]], and then proceeded to beat Reagan in the Florida and Illinois primaries by comfortable margins. By the time of the North Carolina primary in March 1976, Reagan's campaign was nearly out of money, and it was widely believed that another defeat would force Reagan to quit the race. However, assisted by the powerful political organization of U.S. Senator [[Jesse Helms]], Reagan upset Ford in North Carolina and then proceeded to win a string of impressive victories, including Texas, where he won all delegates at stake in the state's first binding primary. Four other delegates chosen at the Texas state convention went to Reagan and shut out U.S. Senator from Texas [[John G. Tower]], who had been named to manage the Ford campaign on the convention floor. Ford bounced back to win in his native Michigan, and from there the two candidates engaged in an increasingly bitter nip-and-tuck contest for delegates. By the time the Republican Convention opened in August 1976 the race for the nomination was still too close to call.\n\nReagan was the first hopeful to defeat an incumbent actively running for reelection since [[Estes Kefauver]] defeated [[President Truman]] in the 1952 New Hampshire primary. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n!\n!\n!

As the convention began, Ford was seen as having a slight lead in delegate votes, but still shy of the 1130 delegates he needed to win. Reagan and Ford both competed for the votes of individual delegates and state delegations. In a bid to woo moderate Northern Republicans, Reagan shocked the convention by announcing that if he won the nomination, Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of [[Pennsylvania]], from the northern liberal wing of the party, would be his running mate. The move backfired, however, as few moderates switched to Reagan, while many conservative delegates were outraged. The key state of Mississippi, which Reagan needed, narrowly voted to support Ford; it was believed that Reagan's choice of Schweiker had led [[Clarke Reed]], Mississippi's chairman, to switch to Ford. Ford then won the nomination, narrowly, on the first ballot. He chose Senator [[Robert Dole]] of [[Kansas]] as his running mate. After giving his acceptance speech, Ford asked Reagan to come and say a few words to the convention.\n\n[[Image:1976 Republican National Convention.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The 1976 Republican National Convention at [[Kemper Arena]] in Kansas City.

Because Ford had been appointed Vice President by Nixon following the resignation of Spiro Agnew from the position, he became the only president inaugurated without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office by the Electoral College.\n\nOn September 8, Ford's first major act in office was to grant a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes Richard Nixon might have committed against the United States while President. Following his pardon of Nixon, Ford's approval ratings among the American public dropped precipitously. Within a week, his approval rating fell from 69 percent to 49, the steepest decline in history.<ref name=\"Perlstein\"/>{{rp|284-285}}\n\nThe economy was in dire condition upon Ford's elevation, marked by the worst peacetime inflation in American history and the highest interest rates in a century. The Dow Jones had declined 43 percent from October 1973 to September 1974.<ref name=\"Perlstein\">{{cite book|title=The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and The Rise of Reagan|last1=Perlstein|first1=Rick|date=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=|isbn=978-1-4767-8241-6|edition=1|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{Rp|280}} To combat inflation, Ford first proposed a tax increase and later, in response to Democratic calls for a permanent cut in taxes, a temporary moderate decrease. Reagan publicly criticized both proposals.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|414}} \n\nRace and education divided public opinion, especially over issues such as forced integration and changes to public school curriculum. Political violence over education policy broke out in [[Boston desegregation busing crisis|Boston]] and [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. Abortion also became a nationally salient issue after the Supreme Court's ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision, which was announced two days after Nixon's resignation and struck down state restrictions on abortion nationwide.\n\nIn the 1974 midterm elections, the Democratic Party dramatically expanded its majorities in both the [[1974 United States House of Representatives elections|House]] and [[1974 United States Senate elections|Senate]]. The elections were seen as a referendum on the Republican Party post-Watergate and on the political establishment more generally. Newly-elected members of Congress became known as \"[[Watergate Babies]]\" and aggressively pursued procedural and oversight reforms.\n\nDuring this period, [[Ronald Reagan]] concluded his second term in office as Governor of California. His administration was marked by efforts to dismantle the [[welfare state]] and a high-profile crackdown on urban crime and left-wing dissent, especially at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He also led an effort to enforce the state's [[capital punishment]] laws but was blocked by the [[California Supreme Court]] in the ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision. Following Reagan's retirement from office in January 1975, he began hosting a national radio show and writing a national newspaper column.\n\n===March\u2013July 1975: Conservatives revolt and Reagan rises===\nConservative opposition to Ford within the Republican Party began to surface in December 1974, following his appointment of New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] as Vice President. For more than a decade, Rockefeller had represented the party's liberal establishment, and the appointment faced immediate criticism from right-wing Senators like [[Jesse Helms]], [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[John Tower]], though Rockefeller's confirmation in the Senate was largely undeterred.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{rp|308-309}}\n\nDiscontent reached a fever pitch at the second annual [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in February. Speaking there, Reagan dismissed calls to seek the presidency on a third-party ticket: \"Is it a third party that we need, or is it a new and revitalized second party, raising a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors which could make it unmistakably clear where we stand on all the issues troubling the people?\" Speakers at CPAC also criticized Ford administration policy, Vice President Rockefeller, and First Lady [[Betty Ford]]'s public campaign in support of abortion and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. In March, discussion began to build around Reagan's presidential prospects following an appearance on [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]] and a profile in [[Newsweek]] that called him, \"the most kinetic single presence in American political life.\" In defense, the administration drafted a letter of support for President Ford that received the signatures of 113 of 145 GOP Representatives and 31 of 38 Senators.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|440-442}} Ford formally announced he would run for election on July 8.\n[[File:Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 1974.jpg|thumb|252x252px|President Ford's snub of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] drew criticism from conservative Cold War hawks, including Ronald Reagan]]\nMore than any domestic issue in 1975, foreign policy drove a wedge between the President and his conservative critics. Following the [[Operation Frequent Wind|American evacuation of Saigon]] and [[Fall of Saigon|the collapse of South Vietnam]], these criticisms grew vociferous. On his radio show, Reagan compared the withdrawal from Saigon to the [[Munich Agreement]] and warned that it would \"tempt the Soviet Union as it once tempted Hitler and the military rulers of Japan.\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|432}} While Ford regained some support from conservatives following the [[Mayaguez incident|rescue of the SS Mayaguez]] in Cambodia,<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|464-5}} he soon drew the ire of the party's right wing with a series of foreign policy moves designed to improve relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. \n\nFirst, President Ford refused to meet with Soviet dissident [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] on his visit to the United States on June 21. In response, Reagan publicly criticized Ford by name for the first time in his national newspaper column, contrasting the popular Solzhenitsyn to other \"guests the President had entertained in the White House, \"the Strawberry Queen of West Virginia and the Maid of Cotton.\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|488}} The day after this column ran, Senator Paul Laxalt announced the formation of a committee named \"Friends of Ronald Reagan,\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|489}} organized for the purpose of drafting Reagan to run for President.\n\nFord followed the Solzhenitsyn affair with an overseas trip to Eastern Europe, where he signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], a treaty establishing that the current boundaries of Eastern European nations were \"inviolable by force.\" Conservatives and anti-communists harshly criticized Ford for capitulating to Soviet demands and formally recognizing the Eastern bloc. The Wall Street Journal called the Helsinki agreement the \"new [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]].\"<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|491}} By late August, Ford's approval rating was polled at 34%.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|494}}\n\nOn September 5 in Sacramento, Ford survived the [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|first of two attempts on his life]] by lone assassins.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|497\u201399}} [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in San Francisco|A second attempt]] followed on nineteen days later on September 21.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|509}} Neither assassin struck Ford.\n\n=== September\u2013December 1975: Reagan enters the race ===\nIn September, Reagan began to actively campaign in key early states. He stumped in [[New Hampshire]] for Louis Wyman in [[1974 and 1975 United States Senate elections in New Hampshire|the special election for Senate]] and began to assemble a campaign staff led by campaign manager [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]]. He secured the endorsement of New Hampshire's conservative governor [[Meldrim Thomson Jr.]] and state party chairman, as well as support from moderate former governor [[Hugh Gregg]].<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|503}}\n\nOn November 4, Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] announced he would not seek nomination as Ford's running mate in 1976.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|527}} That same day, Ford fired Secretary of Defense [[James R. Schlesinger]], whose critical comments on the Helsinki summit had been leaked to the press earlier in the fall.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|526}} That week, Ford traveled to Massachusetts and pledged to campaign in every primary in the nation.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|531}} \n\nOn November 20, Ronald Reagan officially announced his campaign for President.<ref name=\"Perlstein\" />{{Rp|539}}\n\n== Campaign results ==\n\nFord narrowly defeated Reagan in the [[New Hampshire primary]], and then proceeded to beat Reagan in the Florida and Illinois primaries by comfortable margins. By the time of the North Carolina primary in March 1976, Reagan's campaign was nearly out of money, and it was widely believed that another defeat would force Reagan to quit the race. However, assisted by the powerful political organization of U.S. Senator [[Jesse Helms]], Reagan upset Ford in North Carolina and then proceeded to win a string of impressive victories, including Texas, where he won all delegates at stake in the state's first binding primary. Four other delegates chosen at the Texas state convention went to Reagan and shut out U.S. Senator from Texas [[John G. Tower]], who had been named to manage the Ford campaign on the convention floor. Ford bounced back to win in his native Michigan, and from there the two candidates engaged in an increasingly bitter nip-and-tuck contest for delegates. By the time the Republican Convention opened in August 1976 the race for the nomination was still too close to call.\n\nReagan was the first hopeful to defeat an incumbent actively running for reelection since [[Estes Kefauver]] defeated [[President Truman]] in the 1952 New Hampshire primary. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n!\n!\n!

As the convention began, Ford was seen as having a slight lead in delegate votes, but still shy of the 1130 delegates he needed to win. Reagan and Ford both competed for the votes of individual delegates and state delegations. In a bid to woo moderate Northern Republicans, Reagan shocked the convention by announcing that if he won the nomination, Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of [[Pennsylvania]], from the northern liberal wing of the party, would be his running mate. The move backfired, however, as few moderates switched to Reagan, while many conservative delegates were outraged. The key state of Mississippi, which Reagan needed, narrowly voted to support Ford; it was believed that Reagan's choice of Schweiker had led [[Clarke Reed]], Mississippi's chairman, to switch to Ford. Ford then won the nomination, narrowly, on the first ballot. He chose Senator [[Robert Dole]] of [[Kansas]] as his running mate. After giving his acceptance speech, Ford asked Reagan to come and say a few words to the convention.\n\n[[Image:1976 Republican National Convention.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The 1976 Republican National Convention at [[Kemper Arena]] in Kansas City.

Players can create, customize and control their own character. The game is set in a [[Recycling bin|bin]]-like setting where many locations have been specifically designed for this theme (e.g. Kip's Scrapyard, Peel's Park, Ink's Orange Peel) with items you would find usually in a bin, such as mould and orange peels. Players have their own \"[[nest]]\" in which they can adjust the colour and design the rooms. Players can choose to upgrade the nest to all 8 rooms using the Mulch currency via a membership and can also choose to decorate their rooms by buying items from the \"Shopping Mall\" and placing the items in their rooms accordingly. The items can also be sold at one of the locations in the game if the player doesn't want the item anymore for Mulch currency. The nest consists of a private cinema, a plaza (both require membership), a garden, and a nest generator. Depending on how low the nest generator level is, the brighter or darker the nest gets. All players also have a \"Bin Card\" in their nest, which they can stamp every day to collect rewards including hat coupons, plants, XP and much more.\n\nThe main navigation of the game is the Map which players can use to travel to different areas of the game. The map has had many changes in the past due to re-designs. The newest version of the map was designed by Tom Bland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|title=Tom Bland \u00b7 Portfolio|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101032439/http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|archive-date=1 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  There are several multiplayer games which players can play to earn currency (\"Mulch\") and experience points (\"XP\").  There are also a number of educational games, such as the \"Daily Brain Strain,\" which players can visit every day to test their knowledge through a series of math, geography and puzzle questions.  Players who participate in the 60 seconds can receive Mulch and XP based on how well they have done. Players can also enter codes to receive rewards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|title=Bin Weevils \u2013 A Fun Free Browser-Based Game For Kids With Plenty To Do|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080044/https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll users have a garden outside of their nest, in which they can buy plants from the 'Garden Shop' and plant and then harvest for in-game currency (\"Mulch\") and [[experience points]] (\"XP\"). The user can save the currency or buy more plants and the XP contributes to levelling up towards the next level. There are 80 levels in total but more are often added. In addition, paying players can purchase a virtual pet called a \"Bin Pet.\"  The Bin Pet has its own profile and a bed. Players can feed their Bin Pet and make the pet character perform tricks and play mini-games. Non-paying players can also own a virtual pet for 24 hours. This feature is called \"Pet-For-A-Day\" and was first revealed on January 17, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://binweevilcompany.wordpress.com/bin-weevils/bin-pets-2/|title=Bin Pets|date=2014-03-24|website=Bin Weevil Company|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\nMany of the old locations, including Tum's Diner, were designed by Michael Jary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|title=Bin Weevils|website=www.michaeljary.com|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024134901/http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|archive-date=24 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Membership ===\nBin Tycoon is an enhancement on Bin Weevils. Many who subscribe to a premium membership receive a monthly Dosh wage that gradually increases, depending on how many months a player has a premium membership. With this salary, the player can purchase hats for their character, items and clothing for their virtual pet, write magazines and much more to do.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|title=The Top Bin Weevils Paid Membership Perks|last=Jacobs|first=Ashley|date=2016-02-06|website=Gazette Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The currency \"Dosh\" was introduced in 2012 and replaced high Mulch prices in many areas, although it requires real currency payment. However, from time to time, players can take part in challenges, watch advertisements, or enter codes to earn a currency. It was possible to become a paying member for 1 month with an [[SMS|SMS text]] in the early stages of the game, but was discontinued in 2013. Players were still eligible to buy Mulch from the subscription section before 2013, the highest amount being \u00a314.99 for 75,000 Mulch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.binweevils.com/membership2/payment/membership/package/4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212173233/http://www.binweevils.com/membership2/payment/membership/package/4|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-02-12|title=Bin Weevils|date=2012-02-12|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref> Players can still acquire the currency in the game, although it is the main currency for a lot of activities. Players can play multiplayer games to win currency or submit codes, etc. Dosh is currently the only currency to buy on the membership page. Bin Weevils revealed in 2015 that 90% of the content on the site was free to play and 90% of their audience was non-paying members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/55-pixels-ltd-a15-305045.html|title=55 Pixels Ltd|last=Practice|first=Advertising Standards Authority {{!}} Committee of Advertising|website=asa.org.uk|access-date=2019-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820062157/https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/55-pixels-ltd-a15-305045.html|archive-date=20 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Safety and communication ===\nBin Weevils represents the kidSAFE badge on their website,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts/binweevils.html|title=Binweevils.com is certified by the kidSAFE Seal Program|website=kidsafeseal.com|access-date=2019-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817153733/https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts/binweevils.html|archive-date=17 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as this they claim that players chat and buddy messages are moderated 24/7 so that there is no exchange of personal information or inappropriate language. The moderation system is based on a ticket method, according to the Bin Weevils support page. When a player uses an offensive term, live moderators are notified and a punishment can be imposed on a player's account that can range from one day to a permanent suspension.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support55pixels.helpshift.com/a/bin-weevils/?s=parents-safety&f=safety-concerns&l=en|title=Bin Weevils: Safety Concerns|website=55 Pixels Support|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref> As well as this, the game also has a reporting interface where players can submit reports on another player manually through the player's profile. The report functionality contains the reasons that the player decides to report, or a field where the player can explain what the other player has done. The safety feature creates a secure environment that promotes peace of mind for parents and allows children to communicate, meet new friends and improve their online social skills. Although the messaging filter system is in effect, although not perfect, players still found ways to exchange information with other players by combining sentences and letters together.\n\n== Other ==\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nBin Weevils signed a licensing agreement to launch a game-based merchandise range with the toy manufacturer Character Options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/32453/character-group-wins-bin-weevils-master-toy-licence-38642.html|title=Character Group wins Bin Weevils master toy licence|date=2012-02-06|website=Proactiveinvestors UK|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> The merchandise consisted of a [[Collectible card game|trading card game]] that was launched in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|title=Bin Weevils Products Released in U.K.|date=2011-11-03|website=License Global|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080043/https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> a clothing set, backpacks, figurines and toys which launched in October 2012 and books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|title=BinWeevils eyes further growth after toy success|website=Licensing.biz|language=en-GB|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105818/https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> An album titled \"Bin Weevils\" with Sony in December 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|title=BinWeevils gets musical with first album release|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105822/http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|title=CD: Bin Weevils - Bin Tunes {{!}} The Arts Desk|website=theartsdesk.com|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202642/https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A competition was held relating to the album which four children could be picked to write a song for the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|title=Bin Weevils launches Bin Tunes competition|date=2013-05-21|website=Rainbow Toy Awards - The Awards for the UK Toy Industry|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824142231/https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|archive-date=24 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|title=Behind the Scenes with our Bin Weevils Prize Winners! {{!}} Animate it|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020224358/https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|archive-date=20 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The album was launched on 29 July 2013 with a tracklist of 12 children's songs.

The software had several functions, including the possibility of customising the created character in the game, playing multiplayer games with friends at quick access, and sending friend messages. In addition, the application included several bugs and player expectations were not met. Fewer players tended to utilise the application over time and was removed from the [[Google Play|Google Play store]] and the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App store]].\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2015, both Bin Weevils and [[Moshi Monsters]] were requested by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standard Authority]] (ASA) to change the wording of their in-app advertising, stating that players were under pressure to purchase items in the game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|title=Ad watchdog rebukes Moshi Monsters|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|date=2015-08-26|access-date=2019-07-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706054700/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|archive-date=6 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|title=Moshi Monsters and Bin Weevils rapped for promoting subscriptions to children|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=2015-08-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  55 Pixels Ltd, the company which operates the game, said that \"as soon as [we] were made aware of the complaint made to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] about a potential breach, and once we had understood the area for concern, we changed all our membership pages to comply with their recommendations. [The ASA] subsequently upheld the complaint about the original wording but referenced that we now complied, in the text of the ruling.\"\n\n55 Pixels Ltd was also criticised by many players and parents, many of whom criticised the lack of a \"bin-like environment\" in the game and the \"bad influence\" on children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/1/post/2016/09/is-bin-weevils-a-bad-influence-for-children.html|title=Is Bin Weevils a bad influence for children?|website=Binweevils Rant Central|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|title=Bin Weevils Rant Central|date=2015-11-05|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712081501/http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|archive-date=12 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBin Weevils was also strongly criticised for lack of game security, as exploiters wrote offensive language in places using third party tools, where other players were also able to see offensive language. The game magazine's functionality was exploited in 2016, and several other players also blamed Bin Weevils for lack of security. Bin Weevils had to remove some of the game's features, such as public [[Ladder tournament|leaderboards]], to make the feature friends-only because of the exploiters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binbloggers.weebly.com/2/post/2016/12/bin-weevils-safety-compromised.html|title=Bin Weevils {{!}} Safety Compromised?|website=Bin Bloggers|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref> Due to the 2016 exploits, a common and popular feature called \u201cPhoto Studio\u201d was removed.

Players can create, customize and control their own character. The game is set in a [[Recycling bin|bin]]-like setting where many locations have been specifically designed for this theme (e.g. Kip's Scrapyard, Peel's Park, Ink's Orange Peel) with items you would find usually in a bin, such as mould and orange peels. Players have their own \"[[nest]]\" in which they can adjust the colour and design the rooms. Players can choose to upgrade the nest to all 8 rooms using the Mulch currency via a membership and can also choose to decorate their rooms by buying items from the \"Shopping Mall\" and placing the items in their rooms accordingly. The items can also be sold at one of the locations in the game if the player doesn't want the item anymore for Mulch currency. The nest consists of a private cinema, a plaza (both require membership), a garden, and a nest generator. Depending on how low the nest generator level is, the brighter or darker the nest gets. All players also have a \"Bin Card\" in their nest, which they can stamp every day to collect rewards including hat coupons, plants, XP and much more.\n\nThe main navigation of the game is the Map which players can use to travel to different areas of the game. The map has had many changes in the past due to re-designs. The newest version of the map was designed by Tom Bland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|title=Tom Bland \u00b7 Portfolio|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101032439/http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|archive-date=1 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  There are several multiplayer games which players can play to earn currency (\"Mulch\") and experience points (\"XP\").  There are also a number of educational games, such as the \"Daily Brain Strain,\" which players can visit every day to test their knowledge through a series of math, geography and puzzle questions.  Players who participate in the 60 seconds can receive Mulch and XP based on how well they have done. Players can also enter codes to receive rewards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|title=Bin Weevils \u2013 A Fun Free Browser-Based Game For Kids With Plenty To Do|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080044/https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll users have a garden outside of their nest, in which they can buy plants from the 'Garden Shop' and plant and then harvest for in-game currency (\"Mulch\") and experience points (\"XP\"). The user can save the currency or buy more plants and the XP contributes to levelling up towards the next level. There are 80 levels in total but more are often added. In addition, paying players can purchase a virtual pet called a \"Bin Pet.\"  The Bin Pet has its own profile and a bed. Players can feed their Bin Pet and make the pet character perform tricks and play mini-games. Non-paying players can also own a virtual pet for 24 hours. This feature is called \"Pet-For-A-Day\" and was first revealed on January 17, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://binweevilcompany.wordpress.com/bin-weevils/bin-pets-2/|title=Bin Pets|date=2014-03-24|website=Bin Weevil Company|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\nMany of the old locations, including Tum's Diner, were designed by Michael Jary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|title=Bin Weevils|website=www.michaeljary.com|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024134901/http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|archive-date=24 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Membership ===\nBin Tycoon is an enhancement on Bin Weevils. Many who subscribe to a premium membership receive a monthly Dosh wage that gradually increases, depending on how many months a player has a premium membership. With this salary, the player can purchase hats for their character, items and clothing for their virtual pet, write magazines and much more to do.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|title=The Top Bin Weevils Paid Membership Perks|last=Jacobs|first=Ashley|date=2016-02-06|website=Gazette Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The currency \"Dosh\" was introduced in 2012 and replaced high Mulch prices in many areas, although it requires real currency payment. However, from time to time, players can take part in challenges, watch advertisements, or enter codes to earn a currency. It was possible to become a paying member for 1 month with an [[SMS|SMS text]] in the early stages of the game, but was discontinued in 2013.

The moderation system is based on a ticket method, according to the Bin Weevils support page. When a player uses an offensive term, live moderators are notified and a punishment can be imposed on a player's account that can range from one day to a permanent suspension.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support55pixels.helpshift.com/a/bin-weevils/?s=parents-safety&f=safety-concerns&l=en|title=Bin Weevils: Safety Concerns|website=55 Pixels Support|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref> As well as this, the game also has a reporting interface where players can submit reports on another player manually through the player's profile. The report functionality contains the reasons that the player decides to report, or a field where the player can explain what the other player has done. The safety feature creates a secure environment that promotes peace of mind for parents and allows children to communicate, meet new friends and improve their online social skills. Although the messaging filter system is in effect, although not perfect, players still found ways to exchange information with other players by combining sentences and letters together.\n\n== Other ==\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nBin Weevils signed a licensing agreement to launch a game-based merchandise range with the toy manufacturer Character Options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/32453/character-group-wins-bin-weevils-master-toy-licence-38642.html|title=Character Group wins Bin Weevils master toy licence|date=2012-02-06|website=Proactiveinvestors UK|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> The merchandise consisted of a [[Collectible card game|trading card game]] that was launched in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|title=Bin Weevils Products Released in U.K.|date=2011-11-03|website=License Global|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080043/https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> a clothing set, backpacks, figurines and toys which launched in October 2012 and books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|title=BinWeevils eyes further growth after toy success|website=Licensing.biz|language=en-GB|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105818/https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> An album titled \"Bin Weevils\" with Sony in December 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|title=BinWeevils gets musical with first album release|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105822/http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|title=CD: Bin Weevils - Bin Tunes {{!}} The Arts Desk|website=theartsdesk.com|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202642/https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A competition was held relating to the album which four children could be picked to write a song for the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|title=Bin Weevils launches Bin Tunes competition|date=2013-05-21|website=Rainbow Toy Awards - The Awards for the UK Toy Industry|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824142231/https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|archive-date=24 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|title=Behind the Scenes with our Bin Weevils Prize Winners! {{!}} Animate it|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020224358/https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|archive-date=20 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The album was launched on 29 July 2013 with a tracklist of 12 children's songs.

On November 6, 2016, 55 Pixels Ltd released the mobile application a few months after the reveal. The software had several functions, including the possibility of customising the created character in the game, playing multiplayer games with friends at quick access, and sending friend messages. In addition, the application included several bugs and player expectations were not met. Fewer players tended to utilise the application over time and was removed from the [[Google Play|Google Play store]] and the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App store]].\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2015, both Bin Weevils and [[Moshi Monsters]] were requested by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standard Authority]] (ASA) to change the wording of their in-app advertising, stating that players were under pressure to purchase items in the game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|title=Ad watchdog rebukes Moshi Monsters|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|date=2015-08-26|access-date=2019-07-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706054700/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|archive-date=6 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|title=Moshi Monsters and Bin Weevils rapped for promoting subscriptions to children|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=2015-08-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  55 Pixels Ltd, the company which operates the game, said that \"as soon as [we] were made aware of the complaint made to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] about a potential breach, and once we had understood the area for concern, we changed all our membership pages to comply with their recommendations. [The ASA] subsequently upheld the complaint about the original wording but referenced that we now complied, in the text of the ruling.\"\n\n55 Pixels Ltd was also criticised by many players and parents, many of whom criticised the lack of a \"bin-like environment\" in the game and the \"bad influence\" on children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/1/post/2016/09/is-bin-weevils-a-bad-influence-for-children.html|title=Is Bin Weevils a bad influence for children?|website=Binweevils Rant Central|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|title=Bin Weevils Rant Central|date=2015-11-05|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712081501/http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|archive-date=12 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBin Weevils was also strongly criticised for lack of game security, as exploiters wrote offensive language in places using third party tools, where other players were also able to see offensive language. The game magazine's functionality was exploited in 2016, and several other players also blamed Bin Weevils for lack of security. Bin Weevils had to remove some of the game's features, such as public [[Ladder tournament|leaderboards]], to make the feature friends-only because of the exploiters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binbloggers.weebly.com/2/post/2016/12/bin-weevils-safety-compromised.html|title=Bin Weevils {{!}} Safety Compromised?|website=Bin Bloggers|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref> Due to the 2016 exploits, a common and popular feature called \u201cPhoto Studio\u201d was removed.

It is also served by [[Georgia State Route 388|SR&nbsp;388]] east of this intersection. Here, SR&nbsp;388 takes on the Wrightsboro Road name until an intersection with Katherine Street. At this intersection, the [[State highway (US)|state highway]] turns left onto Horizon South Parkway, while Wrightsboro Road continues toward [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]. Harlem\u2013Grovetown Road connects the city with [[Harlem, Georgia|Harlem]].\n\nThere are other important highways outside the [[city limits]].

A poet famous in the post-Civil War era, [[Paul Hamilton Hayne]], moved to Copse Hill in the Parham Road area in the 1860s. He solicited the [[United States Postal Service]] to establish the Grovetown post office. The first U.S. mail service was inaugurated on September 28, 1877, with Charles Clifford as [[postmaster]]. Mr. Clifford was also the [[train depot]] agent and the owner of the corner store.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\">{{cite web |url=https://cityofgrovetown.com/214/City-History |title=City History |publisher=Cityofgrovetown.com |access-date=February 11, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe first railroad depot was a small structure built in 1878\u201379. The last depot was an ornate structure built in 1891 at a cost of $5,041.74. It served the citizens of Grovetown until 1970, when passenger trains no longer traveled on the Augusta\u2013[[Atlanta]] line. It was demolished in 1973.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\"/>\n\nMany wealthy and influential Augusta residents had summer homes in Grovetown, escaping the heat and disease of the city. They commuted on the old \"Picayune\" train, relying on its frequent service. The Rosland Hotel, later known as the \"Eagle\", was built in the 1880s. Its huge [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was frequently used for church gatherings, suppers, parties, and dances. It later became a [[boarding house]] and burned in the 1970s. The Church of Christ is now located on the site.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\"/>\n\nSeveral [[country store]]s were established on Old Wrightsboro Road near the railroad crossing. One was S. F. Poole's store, where the gazebo now stands at the corner with Robinson Avenue, with a \"philosophers' bench\"{{Clarify|date=February 2018}} by the door. During the early days, many famous residents lived in the Grovetown area: Hayne, the literary figure; Stewart Phinizy and James Tobin, [[cotton broker]]s; Charles Phinizy, banker and railroad president; Dr. H. H. Steiner, physician; and John Dodge, pharmacist and [[harness racing]] enthusiast. Dodge brought his stable from [[Ohio]] and built a large home and racetrack.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\"/>\n\nIn the early 20th century Grovetown like many other Southern towns was not exempt from expressions of racism towards African Americans.  A history long forgotten.  On May 8, 1914, Montgomery Advertiser reported the following under the headline SHOE THIEF SUSPECT LYNCHED.  Groveton, Ga, May 7-Charley Jones, a negro, was taken from two officers near here late last night by a number of white men and lynched.  It is said that Jones was suspected of having shop lifted a pair of shoes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ginzburg |first1=Ralph |title=100 Years of Lynchings |date=1962 |publisher=Black Classic Press |isbn=978-0-933121-18-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/100yearsoflynchi00ralp/page/91 91] |url=https://archive.org/details/100yearsoflynchi00ralp/page/91 }}</ref>\n\nWith the construction of [[Camp Gordon]] in 1942, Grovetown experienced rapid growth; it was no longer a small agricultural town. Many military families looked to Grovetown for housing. Gradually, more and more [[veteran|retired military]] saw the benefits of living in the small town and population began to grow and stabilize.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\"/>\n\n[[Annexation]] and multi-housing construction has increased the population of the formerly quiet town. Currently, Grovetown has a population of approximately 15,000,<ref name=Census/> up from the 1990 census figure of 3,596. A variety of stores, dining establishments, schools, and churches add to the town's culture.

A poet famous in the post-Civil War era, [[Paul Hamilton Hayne]], moved to Copse Hill in the Parham Road area in the 1860s. He solicited the [[United States Postal Service]] to establish the Grovetown post office. The first U.S. mail service was inaugurated on September 28, 1877, with Charles Clifford as [[postmaster]]. Mr. Clifford was also the [[train depot]] agent and the owner of the corner store.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\">{{cite web |url=https://cityofgrovetown.com/214/City-History |title=City History |publisher=Cityofgrovetown.com |access-date=February 11, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe first railroad depot was a small structure built in 1878\u201379. The last depot was an ornate structure built in 1891 at a cost of $5,041.74. It served the citizens of Grovetown until 1970, when passenger trains no longer traveled on the Augusta\u2013[[Atlanta]] line. It was demolished in 1973.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\"/>\n\nMany wealthy and influential Augusta residents had summer homes in Grovetown, escaping the heat and disease of the city. They commuted on the old \"Picayune\" train, relying on its frequent service. The Rosland Hotel, later known as the \"Eagle\", was built in the 1880s. Its huge [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was frequently used for church gatherings, suppers, parties, and dances. It later became a [[boarding house]] and burned in the 1970s. The Church of Christ is now located on the site.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\"/>\n\nSeveral [[country store]]s were established on Old Wrightsboro Road near the railroad crossing. One was S. F. Poole's store, where the gazebo now stands at the corner with Robinson Avenue, with a \"philosophers' bench\"{{Clarify|date=February 2018}} by the door. During the early days, many famous residents lived in the Grovetown area: Hayne, the literary figure; Stewart Phinizy and James Tobin, [[cotton broker]]s; Charles Phinizy, banker and railroad president; Dr. H. H. Steiner, physician; and John Dodge, pharmacist and [[harness racing]] enthusiast. Dodge brought his stable from [[Ohio]] and built a large home and racetrack.<ref name=\"City of Grovetown\"/>\n\nIn the early 20th century Grovetown like many other Southern towns was not exempt from expressions of racism towards African Americans.  A history long forgotten.  On May 8, 1914, Montgomery Advertiser reported the following under the headline SHOE THIEF SUSPECT LYNCHED.  Groveton, Ga, May 7-Charley Jones, a negro, was taken from two officers near here late last night by a number of white men and lynched.

Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R. Ford, First Secretary Edward Gierek of Poland, and Mrs. Stanislawa Gierek Waving from the Blue Room Balcony during a State Arrival Ceremony - NARA - 7462054.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gierek in the [[White House]] with President [[Gerald Ford]], 1974]]\nWhen [[Edward Gierek]] succeeded [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] as the head of state in 1970, he took decisive measures to boost economic growth and develop modern infrastructure. Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]], [[June 1976 protests]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation (legal)|provocation]], was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government.<ref name=\"Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne\">{{cite book |surname=Benjamin Weiser |title=Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne |publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki |location=Warszawa |year=2005 |isbn = 83-7391-673-3}}</ref> \n\nOver 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>[[Ryszard Terlecki]]: ''Miecz i tarcza komunizmu.

Simultaneously, the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (WRON - ''Wrona'' is translated as \"Crow\") was founded and its members were high-ranking generals or military officers in the [[Polish People's Army]], who were in charge of the [[military junta]]. The generals and officers later became known to the public as evil \"[[Crows]]\", in relation to the Polish name of the council. \n\nAt precisely 00:00 (12:00 a.m.), the [[ZOMO|Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia]] (ZOMO) began \"Akcja Jod\u0142a\" (English: Operation [[Fir]]) and arrested the first members of Solidarity who were at close reach. They were then placed in previously-prepared detention facilities. In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,900 armoured combat vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9,000 cars and several [[helicopter]] [[squadron]]s were in service.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

Per Azalea, the SB secret services, paramilitary troops, the Militia, ZOMO and [[Border Protection Troops]] stormed 451 [[telephone exchange|telecommunications exchange facilities]] and cut telephone lines to allegedly prevent the spread of misinformation. However, the operation's true purpose was preventing Solidarity from contacting its branches in other cities to mobilize protesters. Radio and television stations were also besieged. Any volunteers wishing to assist the state in upkeeping peace were drafted into [[ORMO]].  \n\nThe [[Polskie Radio|Polish Radio]] informed about martial law being imposed at a 06:00 (6:00 a.m.) audition, and transmitted the speech made by General Jaruzelski.<ref name=\"polskieradio\">{{Cite |url = http://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/1318087,33-lata-temu-wprowadzono-w-Polsce-stan-wojenny |title = 33 lata temu wprowadzono w Polsce stan wojenny |date = 2014-12-13 |page = polskieradio.pl }}</ref> [[Telewizja Polska]] network and its chief news program ''[[Dziennik Telewizyjny|Dziennik]]'' (English: Journal) aired the speech in a slightly modified version.<ref name=\"Ferfecki\">{{Cite |url = http://www.tvp.info/1166664/nieznana-wersja-przemowienia-gen-jaruzelskiego |title = Nieznana wersja przem\u00f3wienia gen.

In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted.

As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions.

Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair.

Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R. Ford, First Secretary Edward Gierek of Poland, and Mrs. Stanislawa Gierek Waving from the Blue Room Balcony during a State Arrival Ceremony - NARA - 7462054.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gierek in the [[White House]] with President [[Gerald Ford]], 1974]]\nWhen [[Edward Gierek]] succeeded [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] as the head of state in 1970, he took decisive measures to boost economic growth and develop modern infrastructure. Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]], [[June 1976 protests]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> In November 1980, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] planned to potentially facilitate around 12,900 members of the opposition in state prisons and places of internment. \n\nOn 5 December 1980, Kania spoke of the preparations relating to martial law at the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact Summit]] in [[Moscow]]. He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation (legal)|provocation]], was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government.<ref name=\"Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne\">{{cite book |surname=Benjamin Weiser |title=Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne |publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki |location=Warszawa |year=2005 |isbn = 83-7391-673-3}}</ref> \n\nOver 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>[[Ryszard Terlecki]]: ''Miecz i tarcza komunizmu.

Simultaneously, the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (WRON - ''Wrona'' is translated as \"Crow\") was founded and its members were high-ranking generals or military officers in the [[Polish People's Army]], who were in charge of the [[military junta]]. The generals and officers later became known to the public as evil \"[[Crows]]\", in relation to the Polish name of the council. \n\nAt precisely 00:00 (12:00 a.m.), the [[ZOMO|Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia]] (ZOMO) began \"Akcja Jod\u0142a\" (English: Operation [[Fir]]) and arrested the first members of Solidarity who were at close reach. They were then placed in previously-prepared detention facilities. In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,900 armoured combat vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9,000 cars and several [[helicopter]] [[squadron]]s were in service.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Able Archer 83]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]]\n* [[Pacification of Wujek]]\n* [[Polish 1970 protests]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]\n* [[Romanian Revolution]], 1989\n* [[Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981]]\n* [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Leopold Labedz, ''Poland Under Jaruzelski: A Comprehensive Sourcebook on Poland During and After Martial Law''\n* George Sanford, ''Military Rule in Poland: The Rebuilding of Communist Power, 1981\u20131983''\n{{Portal|Poland|History|Communism|War|1980s}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Martial law in Poland}}\n* [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB211/index.htm Solidarity and Martial Law in Poland: 25 Years Later], [[National Security Archive]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112170636/http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr80/fpoland1981.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981-1983]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033603/http://www.tenetour.com/history9.php Martial Law in Poland]\n* [http://www.videofact.com/english/stanwoj2.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKhITm9-5TU Video of Jaruzelski declaring martial law], [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]/[[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/zyziza/martial_law_in_poland Photo Gallery by zyziza at pbase.com]\n\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martial Law In Poland}}\n[[Category:1980s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n[[Category:1981 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1981 in politics]]\n[[Category:1982 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1982 in politics]]\n[[Category:1983 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1983 in politics]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1982]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1983]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Martial law|Poland]]\n[[Category:Military coups in Poland]]\n[[Category:Military dictatorships|Poland]]\n[[Category:Poland\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]\n", "name_user": "Oliszydlowski", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e12-13 December 1981; Operations Fir and Azalea:grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland"}

Educated at [[Marlborough College]] in [[Wiltshire]], Justice studied science at [[University College London]], but left after a year and became a geology student at the [[University of Bonn]], where he again left after just a year. He spoke many languages (possibly up to 20) including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]].<ref name=\"morley\">[[Sheridan Morley]], \"Justice, James Norval Harald Robertson (1907\u20131975)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49503, accessed 12 Nov 2007]</ref>\n\n===After university===\n\nJustice returned to the UK in 1927, and became a [[journalist]] with [[Reuters]] in London, alongside [[Ian Fleming]], the creator of [[James Bond]]. After a year, he emigrated to [[Canada]], where he worked as an insurance salesman, taught English at a boys' school, became a [[lumberjack]] and mined for gold. He came back to Britain penniless, working his passage on a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] freighter washing dishes in the ship's galley to pay his fare.\n\nOn his return to Britain he served as secretary of the [[British Ice Hockey Association]] in the early 1930s<ref>''Motor Sport'', December 1933, Page 57.</ref> and managed the [[Great Britain national ice hockey team|national team]] at the 1932 [[Ice Hockey World Championships|European Championships]] in [[Berlin]] to a seventh-place finish. He combined his administrative duties in 1931\u201332 with a season as [[goaltender]] with the [[Wembley Lions|London Lions]].<ref>[http://www.azhockey.com/Ju.htm#James%20Robertson%20Justice A to Z Encyclopaedia of Ice Hockey entry].

The car was unplaced.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1932, Pages 415\u2013419.</ref> The following year a \"J. Justice (J.A.P. Special)\" competed in the [[Brighton Speed Trials]]: \"Justice's machine \"Tallulah\" noisily expired before the end of the course, and was pushed back to the start by way of the arcade under the terrace.\"<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1933, Page 540.</ref> The Brighton event was won by [[Whitney Straight]] and according to [[Denis Jenkinson]]: \"Flitting round the periphery of the team was James Robertson Justice.\" In February 1934, Straight took delivery of a new Maserati: \"Jimmy Justice went off to Italy to collect the first car which was 8CM number 3011.\"<ref>Denis Jenkinson, ''Maserati 3011: The story of a racing car'', Page 11, Aries Press, 1987.</ref> ''[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]'' reported in 1963: \"We remember him at [[Lewes Speed Trials|Lewes]] with a G.N. and in a Relay Race with a Wolseley Hornet.\"<ref>''Motor Sport'', February 1963, Page 82.</ref>\n\nJustice left Britain again to become a policeman for the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] (a region of Germany occupied and governed by France and Germany under a League of Nations mandate originating in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]). After the [[Nazi]]s came to power, he fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side. It was here that he first grew his signature trademark bushy beard, which he retained throughout his career. On return to Britain, he joined the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], but after sustaining an injury in 1943 (thought to be [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] from a German shell), he was pensioned off.\n\n===Love of Scotland===\nHe married nurse Dillys Hayden (1914\u20131984) in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1941, and she gave birth to his son James. On his return from the war, he reinvented himself with stronger [[Scotland|Scottish]] roots, dispensing with his two middle names and acquiring the new middle name Robertson out of his habit of wearing Robertson [[tartan]]. Feeling strongly about his Scottish ancestry, he once claimed to have been born in 1905 under a distillery on the [[Isle of Skye]]; many sources listed his birthplace as [[Wigtown]], [[Wigtownshire]],  in [[Dumfries and Galloway]].<ref>{{cite news| last=Pendreigh| first=Brian| title='Scots actor Justice outed as Londoner| newspaper=Scotland on Sunday| date=18 November 2007| url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=1819412007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121201026/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=1819412007| url-status=dead| archive-date=21 November 2007}}</ref>  He lived in Wigtown at Orchardton House between 1946 and 1950. He unsuccessfully contested the [[North Angus and Mearns (UK Parliament constituency)|North Angus and Mearns constituency]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]].<ref name=\"morley\"/> With the earnings he made from the film ''[[Doctor in the House]]'' (1954), Justice bought a cottage in the Scottish Highlands village of [[Spinningdale]]. In 1966 Justice appeared as a narrator in [[List of Jackanory episodes|five episodes]] of the BBC children's television series ''[[Jackanory]]'' telling stories and legends from Scotland, including those of [[The Battle of the Birds]] and [[Black Bull of Norroway|The Black Bull of Norroway]].\n\n===Acting career===\nJustice took up acting after joining the [[Players' Theatre]] in London. The club, under the chairmanship of [[Leonard Sachs]] who was latterly chairman of [[BBC]]'s television's ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]],'' would stage [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[music hall]] nights. Standing in for Sachs one night, he was recommended for the film ''[[For Those in Peril (1944 film)|For Those In Peril]]'' (1944).\n\nAs an actor, with his domineering personality, bulky physique, (he played rugby for [[Beckenham RFC]] First XV in the 1924\u201325 season alongside [[Johnnie Cradock]] who would become the partner of 1950s TV chef [[Fanny Cradock|Fanny]]) and rich, booming voice, he was soon established as a major supporting player in British comedy films.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.beckenhamrfc.com/a/history-8532.html |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref>  His first leading role was as [[headmaster]] in the film ''[[Vice Versa (1948 film)|Vice Versa]]'' (1948), written and directed by [[Peter Ustinov]], who cast him partly because he'd been \"a collaborator of my father's at Reuters.\" Justice was the demanding surgeon Sir Lancelot Spratt in the \"Doctor\" series of films of the 1950s and 1960s, beginning with ''[[Doctor in the House]]'' (1954), playing a role for which he is possibly best remembered. In his films he was sometimes credited as ''Seumas M\u00f2r na Feusag'' (Scottish Gaelic, translation: Big James with the Beard), ''James R. Justice'', ''James Robertson'' or ''James Robertson-Justice''.\n\nOn 31 August 1957, he helped launch the TV station [[Scottish Television]], hosting the channel's first show, ''This is Scotland''.<ref>{{youtube|i7UqDUeWn14|This Is Scotland: 31 Aug 1957}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, and again from 1963 to 1966, he was [[Rector of the University of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Full list of Rectors to date| url=http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/faqs/parqsutz.shtml#Rec1| accessdate=1 November 2007| publisher=The University of Edinburgh Information Services}}</ref> In the war film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), Robertson Justice had a co-starring role as well as narrating the story.\n\nHe appeared in four films with ''Navarone'' co-star [[Gregory Peck]], including ''[[Captain Horatio Hornblower]]'' (1951), and ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), in which Robertson Justice played the one-armed sea captain also attacked by the white whale. In the film, Robertson Justice's character tries to befriend Captain Ahab (played by Peck), but is amazed and repulsed by Ahab's obsessive pursuit of Moby Dick.\n\n===Later life===\nAfter a series of affairs<ref>{{cite news| title=Lawyers may take starring role in West End show The Golden Voice| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10217102/Lawyers-may-take-starring-role-in-West-End-show-The-Golden-Voice.html| last=Walker| first=Tim| date=2 August 2013| newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> and the drowning of his son in 1949 at his watermill home in [[Whitchurch, Hampshire|Whitchurch]], Hampshire,{{cn|date=March 2020}} Justice separated from his wife; she eventually divorced him in 1968. He met actress [[Irene von Meyendorff]] in 1960 on the set of ''[[The Ambassador (1960 film)|The Ambassador]]'', and they remained together, eventually marrying in 1975 three days before he died.\n\nNot long after completing his work for ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' in 1968, Justice suffered a severe stroke, which signalled the beginning of the end for his career, although he appeared in a number of films afterwards, albeit in less prominent roles, playing his best known character of Sir Lancelot Spratt for the final time in ''[[Doctor in Trouble]]'' (1970), featured only briefly in several scenes. He suffered a further series of strokes, which left him unable to work. He was declared bankrupt in 1970,<ref>{{cite news| title=James Robertson Justice| date=2 December 1970| work=[[Evening Express (Scotland)|Aberdeen Evening Express]]| page=1}}</ref> and he died penniless in 1975.

Educated at [[Marlborough College]] in [[Wiltshire]], Justice studied science at [[University College London]], but left after a year and became a geology student at the [[University of Bonn]], where he again left after just a year. He spoke many languages (possibly up to 20) including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]].<ref name=\"morley\">[[Sheridan Morley]], \"Justice, James Norval Harald Robertson (1907\u20131975)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49503, accessed 12 Nov 2007]</ref>\n\n===After university===\n\nJustice returned to the UK in 1927, and became a [[journalist]] with [[Reuters]] in London, alongside [[Ian Fleming]], the creator of [[James Bond]]. After a year, he emigrated to [[Canada]], where he worked as an insurance salesman, taught English at a boys' school, became a [[lumberjack]] and mined for gold. He came back to Britain penniless, working his passage on a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] freighter washing dishes in the ship's galley to pay his fare.\n\nOn his return to Britain he served as secretary of the [[British Ice Hockey Association]] in the early 1930s<ref>''Motor Sport'', December 1933, Page 57.</ref> and managed the [[Great Britain national ice hockey team|national team]] at the 1932 [[Ice Hockey World Championships|European Championships]] in [[Berlin]] to a seventh-place finish. He combined his administrative duties in 1931\u201332 with a season as [[goaltender]] with the [[Wembley Lions|London Lions]].<ref>[http://www.azhockey.com/Ju.htm#James%20Robertson%20Justice A to Z Encyclopaedia of Ice Hockey entry].

The car was unplaced.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1932, Pages 415\u2013419.</ref> The following year a \"J. Justice (J.A.P. Special)\" competed in the [[Brighton Speed Trials]]: \"Justice's machine \"Tallulah\" noisily expired before the end of the course, and was pushed back to the start by way of the arcade under the terrace.\"<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1933, Page 540.</ref> The Brighton event was won by [[Whitney Straight]] and according to [[Denis Jenkinson]]: \"Flitting round the periphery of the team was James Robertson Justice.\" In February 1934, Straight took delivery of a new Maserati: \"Jimmy Justice went off to Italy to collect the first car which was 8CM number 3011.\"<ref>Denis Jenkinson, ''Maserati 3011: The story of a racing car'', Page 11, Aries Press, 1987.</ref> ''[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]'' reported in 1963: \"We remember him at [[Lewes Speed Trials|Lewes]] with a G.N. and in a Relay Race with a Wolseley Hornet.\"<ref>''Motor Sport'', February 1963, Page 82.</ref>\n\nJustice left Britain again to become a policeman for the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] (a region of Germany occupied and governed by France and Germany under a League of Nations mandate originating in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]). After the [[Nazi]]s came to power, he fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side. It was here that he first grew his signature trademark bushy beard, which he retained throughout his career. On return to Britain, he joined the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], but after sustaining an injury in 1943 (thought to be [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] from a German shell), he was pensioned off.\n\n===Love of Scotland===\nHe married nurse Dillys Hayden (1914\u20131984) in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1941, and she gave birth to his son James. On his return from the war, he reinvented himself with stronger [[Scotland|Scottish]] roots, dispensing with his two middle names and acquiring the new middle name Robertson out of his habit of wearing Robertson [[tartan]]. Feeling strongly about his Scottish ancestry, he once claimed to have been born in 1905 under a distillery on the [[Isle of Skye]]; many sources listed his birthplace as [[Wigtown]], [[Wigtownshire]],  in [[Dumfries and Galloway]].<ref>{{cite news| last=Pendreigh| first=Brian| title='Scots actor Justice outed as Londoner| newspaper=Scotland on Sunday| date=18 November 2007| url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=1819412007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121201026/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=1819412007| url-status=dead| archive-date=21 November 2007}}</ref>  He lived in Wigtown at Orchardton House between 1946 and 1950.

In 1966 Justice appeared as a narrator in [[List of Jackanory episodes|five episodes]] of the BBC children's television series ''[[Jackanory]]'' telling stories and legends from Scotland, including those of [[The Battle of the Birds]] and [[Black Bull of Norroway|The Black Bull of Norroway]].\n\n===Acting career===\nJustice took up acting after joining the [[Players' Theatre]] in London. The club, under the chairmanship of [[Leonard Sachs]] who was latterly chairman of [[BBC]]'s television's ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]],'' would stage [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[music hall]] nights. Standing in for Sachs one night, he was recommended for the film ''[[For Those in Peril (1944 film)|For Those In Peril]]'' (1944).\n\nAs an actor, with his domineering personality, bulky physique, (he played rugby for [[Beckenham RFC]] First XV in the 1924\u201325 season alongside [[Johnnie Cradock]] who would become the partner of 1950s TV chef [[Fanny Cradock|Fanny]]) and rich, booming voice, he was soon established as a major supporting player in British comedy films.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.beckenhamrfc.com/a/history-8532.html |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref>  His first leading role was as [[headmaster]] in the film ''[[Vice Versa (1948 film)|Vice Versa]]'' (1948), written and directed by [[Peter Ustinov]], who cast him partly because he'd been \"a collaborator of my father's at Reuters.\" Justice was the demanding surgeon Sir Lancelot Spratt in the \"Doctor\" series of films of the 1950s and 1960s, beginning with ''[[Doctor in the House]]'' (1954), playing a role for which he is possibly best remembered. In his films he was sometimes credited as ''Seumas M\u00f2r na Feusag'' (Scottish Gaelic, translation: Big James with the Beard), ''James R. Justice'', ''James Robertson'' or ''James Robertson-Justice''.\n\nOn 31 August 1957, he helped launch the TV station [[Scottish Television]], hosting the channel's first show, ''This is Scotland''.<ref>{{youtube|i7UqDUeWn14|This Is Scotland: 31 Aug 1957}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, and again from 1963 to 1966, he was [[Rector of the University of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Full list of Rectors to date| url=http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/faqs/parqsutz.shtml#Rec1| accessdate=1 November 2007| publisher=The University of Edinburgh Information Services}}</ref> In the war film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), Robertson Justice had a co-starring role as well as narrating the story.\n\nHe appeared in four films with ''Navarone'' co-star [[Gregory Peck]], including ''[[Captain Horatio Hornblower]]'' (1951), and ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), in which Robertson Justice played the one-armed sea captain also attacked by the white whale. In the film, Robertson Justice's character tries to befriend Captain Ahab (played by Peck), but is amazed and repulsed by Ahab's obsessive pursuit of Moby Dick.\n\n===Later life===\nAfter a series of affairs<ref>{{cite news| title=Lawyers may take starring role in West End show The Golden Voice| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10217102/Lawyers-may-take-starring-role-in-West-End-show-The-Golden-Voice.html| last=Walker| first=Tim| date=2 August 2013| newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> and the drowning of his son in 1949 at his watermill home in [[Whitchurch, Hampshire|Whitchurch]], Hampshire,{{cn|date=March 2020}} Justice separated from his wife; she eventually divorced him in 1968. He met actress [[Irene von Meyendorff]] in 1960 on the set of ''[[The Ambassador (1960 film)|The Ambassador]]'', and they remained together, eventually marrying in 1975 three days before he died.\n\nNot long after completing his work for ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' in 1968, Justice suffered a severe stroke, which signalled the beginning of the end for his career, although he appeared in a number of films afterwards, albeit in less prominent roles, playing his best known character of Sir Lancelot Spratt for the final time in ''[[Doctor in Trouble]]'' (1970), featured only briefly in several scenes. He suffered a further series of strokes, which left him unable to work. He was declared bankrupt in 1970,<ref>{{cite news| title=James Robertson Justice| date=2 December 1970| work=[[Evening Express (Scotland)|Aberdeen Evening Express]]| page=1}}</ref> and he died penniless in 1975  His ashes were buried in a [[north Scotland]] moor near his former residence in the Highland village of [[Spinningdale]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nA biography entitled ''James Robertson Justice\u2014What's The Bleeding Time?''

It is suggested that the powers Antimony has are passed from mother to daughter, at the cost of the mother's life.\n\nAntimony ends the medium training, but the position as medium from the court is offered to other of the trainees, Smithy. Instead, Coyote offers Antimony to replace Ysengrin as the medium from the forest to the court, and she starts regular training under the guidance of Ysengrin.\n\nGradually, Antimony and Kat discover the events that led to the creation of the ghost, which is the remnant of a woman named Jeanne, a formidable swordswoman who was amongst the founders of the court. After the original fallout between the court and the forest, she kept a romance with a forest elve, spurning the attentions of Diego, another of the founders of the court and a technological genius. Enraged, Diego plotted to include Jeanne in a system to protect the court, for which he created an arrow that killed her lover and trapped her soul into a ghost, tying it to the river separating the court and the forest. Jeanne's ghost has resisted attempts from the psychopomps to collect her soul.\n\nAntimony's father Anthony suddenly returns to the court as a professor. He finds out that Antimony has been copying Kat's homework in most of her classes, and punishes her by making her repeat a school year. Antimony later finds out that the court is displeased by her closeness with the forest creatures and brought him back in an attempt to control her. Trying to control her rage at these events, she severs the link to her emotions and fire powers.\n\nAfter a long period regaining her powers and getting back in touch with her personality, Antimony enlists the help of several of her friends to recover Diego's arrow and free the souls of Jeanne and her lover. They manage to do it, but in the process Smithy is mortally wounded by Jeanne. Antimony strikes a deal with the psychopomps in which they spare Smithy's life in exchange for her commitment to become a psychopomp in the future.\n\nSeveral months later and for reasons no completely explained, Coyote cedes his strength to Ysengrin, who is overwhelmed by rage and devours Coyote, fusing with him a single creature that names itself Loup. Loup attacks the court and destroys several of its protections before being eventually rejected. Antimony visits the forest to confer with him, and Loup tasks her with recovering three parts of Coyote's power that had been sent to the court in the disguise of presents.

It is updated online three days a week, and seven volumes of the still continuing comic have been published in print format by [[Archaia Entertainment|Archaia Studios Press]] and [[Titan Books]] (in the United Kingdom and Ireland). The comic has been critically acclaimed and has won numerous [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards]], as well as receiving positive reviews for its artwork and storytelling.\n\nThe comic tells the story of [[Antimony Carver]], a young girl who has just started attending a school at a strange and mysterious place called Gunnerkrigg Court, and the events that unfold around her as she becomes embroiled in political intrigues between Gunnerkrigg Court and the inhabitants of the Gillitie Wood, a forest outside the school. The comic's style and themes include elements from [[natural science|science]], [[fantasy]] creatures, [[mythology]] from a variety of traditions, and [[alchemy|alchemical]] symbols and theories; the literary style is heavily influenced by [[mystery fiction]] and [[manga]].\n\n==Production==\n''Gunnerkrigg Court'' was first posted online on 4 April 2005,<ref>[http://gunnerkrigg.com/archives ''Gunnerkrigg Court'' archive].</ref> and was originally updated two days per week.

It is suggested that the powers Antimony has are passed from mother to daughter, at the cost of the mother's life. \n\nAntimony ends the medium training, but the position as medium from the court is offered to other of the trainees, Smithy. Instead, Coyote offers Antimony to replace Ysengrin as the medium from the forest to the court, and she starts regular training under the guidance of Ysengrin. \n\nGradually, Antimony and Kat discover the events that led to the creation of the ghost, which is the remnant of a woman named Jeanne, a formidable swordswoman who was amongst the founders of the court. After the original fallout between the court and the forest, she kept a romance with a forest elve, spurning the attentions of Diego, another of the founders of the court and a technological genius. Enraged, Diego plotted to include Jeanne in a system to protect the court, for which he created an arrow that killed her lover and trapped her soul into a ghost, tying it to the river separating the court and the forest. Jeanne's ghost has resisted attempts from the psychopomps to collect her soul. \n\nAntimony's father Anthony suddenly returns to the court as a professor. He finds out that Antimony has been copying Kat's homework in most of her classes, and punishes her by making her repeat a school year. Antimony later finds out that the court is displeased by her closeness with the forest creatures and brought him back in an attempt to control her. Trying to control her rage at these events, she severs the link to her emotions and fire powers. \n\nAfter a long period regaining her powers and getting back in touch with her personality, Antimony enlists the help of several of her friends to recover Diego's arrow and free the souls of Jeanne and her lover. They manage to do it, but in the process Smithy is mortally wounded by Jeanne. Antimony strikes a deal with the psychopomps in which they spare Smithy's life in exchange for her commitment to become a psychopomp in the future.\n\nSeveral months later and for reasons no completely explained, Coyote cedes his strenth to Ysengrin, who is overwhelmed by rage and devours Coyote, fusing with him a single creature that names itself Loup. Loup attacks the court and destroys several of its protections before being eventually rejected. Antimony visits the forest to confer with him, and Loup tasks her with recovering three parts of Coyote's power that had been sent to the court in the disguise of presents. When Antimony returns to the court, she finds out that several months have passed by and a perfect copy of her is occupying her place. Both versions of Antimony are convinced to be the real one, until they confer with a supernatural entity that explains that Loup created a parallel timeline and extracted a copy of Antimony from there. However, when asked to point which one of them is the original, it states that none of them is.\n\nIn addition to this plotline, the story includes several additional plot arcs interspersed with the main story.<ref name=\"wherewolftherewolf\"/> One concerns two girls from the Court, Zimmy and Gamma, who communicate with one another [[Telepathy|telepathically]].
