In 1886, he began residing at [[Toynbee Hall]] in East London. That same year he started a 'Working Boys Cadet Corps'.  He became a captain in the 26th Middlesex [[Rifle Volunteer Corps|Rifle Volunteers]] in 1888. While serving in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899\u20131902), he was appointed a [[magistrate]] in 1902.  He was removed from that position for supposedly being too \"pro-Boer\".<ref name=\"wcml\"/>  He wrote \"The War and One Year After\" pamphlet in 1903 criticising the British method of war.

Vane had been directed to take command of [[Cathal Brugha Barracks|Portobello Barracks]], Dublin, then garrison for the largely Belfast-recruited [[Royal Irish Rifles]] and the Ulster Militia Battalion. On the third day of the Rising, Vane had taken up an observation position in the tower of the [[Rathmines#Rathmines Township|Rathmines Town Hall]]. On returning to barracks he learned that civilian hostages had been taken and later killed there by order of Captain Bowen-Colthurst. They included the well-known pacifist [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]] and two pro-Union journalists who were misidentified as Nationalists. Bowen-Colthurst had also led a raid against a house allegedly sympathetic to the insurgents, and during this raid he had summarily executed a youth named Coade in the street.<ref name = \"Royal Commission\">[http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/22375 \"Royal Commission on the Arrest and subsequent treatment of Mr. Francis Sheehy Skeffington, Mr. Thomas Dickson, and Mr. Patrick James McIntyre: Report of the Commission\"], presented to both houses of Parliament by command of His Majesty, London: Darling & Son, 1916 (accessed 29 March 2016).</ref>\n\nVane ordered these incidents to be reported to the garrison high command and to British high command. But his superiors covered up the crimes, and removed him from command. Thereupon Vane went directly to London and met with Secretary of War [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] and with [[Maurice Bonham Carter]], [[Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister]], to expose the murders.<ref name = \"Commons\">British House of Commons, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1916/aug/01/sir-francis-vanes-position#S5CV0085P0_19160801_HOC_23 ''Disturbances in Ireland\"], hearing held on 1 August 1916 (accessed 31 March 2016).</ref> As a result, Bowen-Colthurst was arrested a week after the uprising, and was charged with murder at a military [[court-martial]] held a month after the uprising. The court-martial found Bowen-Colthurst guilty, but insane; he was sent to [[Broadmoor Hospital]] for the criminally insane.<ref name = \"Royal Commission\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Vane's superior [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Sir John Maxwell]] filed an adverse report about Vane, resulting in Vane's dismissal from the army sometime prior to August 1916.<ref name = \"Commons\"/>\n\n==Between military stints==\n''Daily News'', ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', ''Westminster'' and ''Truth'' employed Vane from 1902 to 1904 as a reporter for South Africa.  He was the unsuccessful [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate for [[Burton (UK Parliament constituency)|Burton]] in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election]].  Following that he became active in antiwar and suffragette campaigns from 1907-1912.<ref name=\"wcml\"/><ref name=\"II\"/>  He published two more items:  ''Walks and Peoples in Tuscany'' (1908) and ''On Certain Fundamentals'' (1909).\n\n==Scouting==\nBy 1909, Vane was the [[The Scout Association|Baden-Powell Boy Scouts']] London [[Scout Commissioner|Commissioner]]. He felt that [[Scouting]] should be nonmilitary and, through [[mediation]], reconciled the [[British Boy Scouts]] (BBS) with Baden-Powell organisation by having the BBS as an affiliated organisation of the Baden-Powell organisation. The BBS had formed as the [[Battersea]] Boy Scouts (BBS) and registered with the Baden-Powell Boy Scout organisation but soon left the Baden-Powell organisation over perceived militarisation and nondemocratic nature of the national headquarters. The BBS had renamed and reconstituted itself as a national organisation. Vane briefly reconciled the two organisations. With Vane pushing for Baden-Powell's organisation to be more democratic, his position was eliminated by Baden-Powell's headquarters staff.  In a protest meeting, the London area Scoutmasters voted overwhelming in support of Sir Francis, however Baden-Powell never reinstated him.  Members of the [[National Service League]], a pro-military group, were appointed to Baden-Powell's headquarters. On 3 December 1909, Vane accepted the presidency of the British Boy Scouts taking most London area Troops with him. The Quakers' Birmingham and Midland Troops also followed as Vane was key in having Quakers sponsor Scouting Troops.<ref name=\"BBS\">[http://www.boy-scout.net/en/page8/page9/page9.html The BBS Story] The British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association. accessed 25 September 2008.</ref>\n\nVane got the [[Boy's Life Brigade]] (BLB) to join the British Boy Scouts in a loose federation called The National Peace Scouts in February 1910.<ref name=\"BBS\"/><ref name=\"SOSSI\">[http://www.sossi.org/others/others.htm Other Youth Programs] Author Victor M. Alexieff. SOSSI Journal. Vol. 37, No. 9, September 1982</ref>  At the merger the BBS had 45,000 Scouts and BLB had 40,000 members.  With Vane having an Italian summer home, he was able to launch the Scouting Movement in Italy with the [[Scouting in Italy|Ragazzi Esploratori Italiani]] in 1910.<ref name=\"wcml\"/><ref name=\"BBS\"/>  In 1911, Vane assisted Augustin Dufresne, a shipowner, to organise a French Scouting organisation.<ref name=\"hbu\">[http://www.histclo.com/youth/youth/org/sco/int/sco-intows.htm Boy Scout Movement: Internationalism--Order of World Scouts] Historic Boys' Uniform website.</ref>\n\nWith the spread of the alternative British Boy Scouts programme throughout the world, Vane informally aligned the various groups as the Legion of World Scouts, the first international organisation, in 1911 then more formally as the [[Order of World Scouts]] on 11 November 1911.<ref name=\"SOSSI\"/><ref name=\"hbu\"/> Vane became the Grand Scout Master of the Order of World Scouts.<ref name=\"SOSSI\"/>\n\nVane put his wealth behind the organisations: providing a London headquarters and financed the organisation, even the manufacture of BBS uniforms. This overburdened his finances to the point of having to declare bankruptcy in 1912.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28656|date=22 October 1912|page=7837}}</ref> Thus the British Boy Scouts lost their headquarters, source of equipment and uniforms and their leader. Vane continued his involvement with the remnant BBS, as he inspected the Troop of the London Commissioner Percy Herbert Pooley in 1915.<ref name=\"BBS\"/><ref name=\"hbu\"/>\n\nVane returned to Italy after World War I to find that the Italian Boy Scouts he founded had been mainly absorbed by the National Scouts Corps (Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori Italiani - [[CNGEI]]). Some joined in with the creation of the Catholic Association of Scouts (Associazione Scautistica Cattolica Italiana - ASCI) in 1916, later named [[AGESCI]].  He began working with the latter group.  He tried to get Baden-Powell to accept the ASCI as a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].  He also try to get the BBS back together with the Boy Scouts Association.  Both of these efforts were without success.<ref name=\"BBS\"/>  In 1927, he left for the United Kingdom as the Fascists quashed the Italian Scouting Movement,<ref name=\"wcml\"/> in favour of the [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] (ONB), an Italian Fascist youth organisation. Despite a private letter to Sir Francis Vane 24 April 1933, sympathising with Vane\u2019s worries, the Balilla was an organisation that was publicly highly praised by Baden-Powell,<ref>The praise was given in an article published in the Daily Telegraph - Jeal, Tim, Baden-Powell, Hutchinson 1989, page 545</ref> as the application of scouting as part of national education.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe succeeded his cousin Sir Henry Ralph Fletcher-Vane as [[Fletcher-Vane baronets|baronet]] in 1908.\n \nHis first wife, Anna Oliphant da Costa Ricci, daughter of the Baron Anselmo da Costa Ricci of Portugal, whom he married in 1888, died in 1922. Vane became a Knight Commander of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)]] in 1889. He married his second wife, Kathleen Crosbie in 1927. Sir Francis died in 1934 aged 72, after spending his last year of life in ill health at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in Lambeth.<ref>Information supplied by the Reverend Dr Michael Foster from information held in the British Boy Scouts Archive</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Francis Fletcher Vane, ''Agin the governments: memories and adventures of Sir Francis Fletcher Vane'' (London, Sampson Low, Marston & Co., Ltd., 1929)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[ODNB]] article by Roger T.

With Vane having an Italian summer home, he was able to launch the Scouting Movement in Italy with the [[Scouting in Italy|Ragazzi Esploratori Italiani]] in 1910.<ref name=\"wcml\"/><ref name=\"BBS\"/>  In 1911, Vane assisted Augustin Dufresne, a shipowner, to organise a French Scouting organisation.<ref name=\"hbu\">[http://www.histclo.com/youth/youth/org/sco/int/sco-intows.htm Boy Scout Movement: Internationalism--Order of World Scouts] Historic Boys' Uniform website.</ref>\n\nWith the spread of the alternative British Boy Scouts programme throughout the world, Vane informally aligned the various groups as the Legion of World Scouts, the first international organisation, in 1911 then more formally as the [[Order of World Scouts]] on 11 November 1911.<ref name=\"SOSSI\"/><ref name=\"hbu\"/> Vane became the Grand Scout Master of the Order of World Scouts.<ref name=\"SOSSI\"/>\n\nVane put his wealth behind the organisations: providing a London headquarters and financed the organisation, even the manufacture of BBS uniforms. This overburdened his finances to the point of having to declare bankruptcy in 1912.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28656|date=22 October 1912|page=7837}}</ref> Thus the British Boy Scouts lost their headquarters, source of equipment and uniforms and their leader. Vane continued his involvement with the remnant BBS, as he inspected the Troop of the London Commissioner Percy Herbert Pooley in 1915.<ref name=\"BBS\"/><ref name=\"hbu\"/>\n\nVane returned to Italy after World War I to find that the Italian Boy Scouts he founded had been mainly absorbed by the National Scouts Corps (Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori Italiani - [[CNGEI]]). Some joined in with the creation of the Catholic Association of Scouts (Associazione Scautistica Cattolica Italiana - ASCI) in 1916, later named [[AGESCI]].  He began working with the latter group.  He tried to get Baden-Powell to accept the ASCI as a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].  He also try to get the BBS back together with the Boy Scouts Association.  Both of these efforts were without success.<ref name=\"BBS\"/>  In 1927, he left for the United Kingdom as the Fascists quashed the Italian Scouting Movement,<ref name=\"wcml\"/> in favour of the [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] (ONB), an Italian Fascist youth organisation. Despite a private letter to Sir Francis Vane 24 April 1933, sympathising with Vane\u2019s worries, the Balilla was an organisation that was publicly highly praised by Baden-Powell,<ref>The praise was given in an article published in the Daily Telegraph - Jeal, Tim, Baden-Powell, Hutchinson 1989, page 545</ref> as the application of scouting as part of national education.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe succeeded his cousin Sir Henry Ralph Fletcher-Vane as [[Fletcher-Vane baronets|baronet]] in 1908.\n \nHis first wife, Anna Oliphant da Costa Ricci, daughter of the Baron Anselmo da Costa Ricci of Portugal, whom he married in 1888, died in 1922. Vane became a Knight Commander of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)]] in 1889. He married his second wife, Kathleen Crosbie in 1927.

The longest line in the network, it travels mainly east\u2013west for approximately {{convert|33|mi|km|0}} in the cities of [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Portland, and [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], serving 48 stations between {{stn|Hatfield Government Center}} and {{stn|Cleveland Avenue}}. The line is the busiest of the five MAX lines, carrying an average 55,370 riders per day on weekdays in September 2018. It runs for 22{{frac|1|2}} hours per day from Monday to Thursday, with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and five minutes during [[rush hour]]. Service runs later in the evening on Fridays and Saturdays and ends earlier on Sundays.\n\nThe success of local [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] in the early 1970s led to the reallocation of [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance funds]] from the proposed [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505) projects to mass transit. Local governments approved the construction of a light rail line in Portland in 1978. Referred to as the '''Banfield light rail project''' during its planning and construction because of its proximity to the [[Banfield Freeway]], and later, the '''Eastside MAX''', construction of what is now the line's eastern half\u2014between [[downtown Portland]] and Gresham\u2014began in 1983. It opened on September&nbsp;5, 1986, as the inaugural line of the MAX system.\n\nPlanning for the line's subsequent extension to the west side, known as the '''Westside MAX''', began as early as 1979. This second segment, delayed by nearly a decade due to funding disagreements, had initially been slated to terminate on 185th Avenue, near the border between Hillsboro and Beaverton. Proponents of a longer line achieved a supplemental extension to downtown Hillsboro just before the line's groundbreaking in 1993. It opened in two phases following delays in tunnel construction; the first section up to [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] opened in 1997 and the entire extension began operating on September&nbsp;12, 1998.\n\nIn 2000, the two distinct segments, already operating as a single [[through route]] between Gresham and Hillsboro, were further unified in passenger information as the Blue Line, after TriMet introduced a [[color code|color coding]] scheme amid preparations for the opening of a second service: the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] to [[Portland International Airport]]. The Blue Line currently shares its route with the Red Line on the west side, between [[Beaverton Transit Center]] and [[Rose Quarter Transit Center]].

The longest line in the network, it travels mainly east\u2013west for approximately {{convert|33|mi|km|0}} in the cities of [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Portland, and [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], serving 48 stations between {{stn|Hatfield Government Center}} and {{stn|Cleveland Avenue}}. The line is the busiest of the five MAX lines, carrying an average 55,370 riders per day on weekdays in September 2018. It runs for 22{{frac|1|2}} hours per day from Monday to Thursday, with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and five minutes during [[rush hour]]. Service runs later in the evening on Fridays and Saturdays and ends earlier on Sundays.\n\nThe success of local [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] in the early 1970s led to the reallocation of [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance funds]] from the proposed [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505) projects to mass transit. Local governments approved the construction of a light rail line in Portland in 1978. Referred to as the '''Banfield light rail project''' during its planning and construction because of its proximity to the [[Banfield Freeway]], and later, the '''Eastside MAX''', construction of what is now the line's eastern half\u2014between [[downtown Portland]] and Gresham\u2014began in 1983. It opened on September&nbsp;5, 1986, as the inaugural line of the MAX system.\n\nPlanning for the line's subsequent extension to the west side, known as the '''Westside MAX''', began as early as 1979. This second segment, delayed by nearly a decade due to funding disagreements, had initially been slated to terminate on 185th Avenue, near the border between Hillsboro and Beaverton. Proponents of a longer line achieved a supplemental extension to downtown Hillsboro just before the line's groundbreaking in 1993. It opened in two phases following delays in tunnel construction; the first section up to [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] opened in 1997 and the entire extension began operating on September&nbsp;12, 1998.\n\nIn 2000, the two distinct segments, already operating as a single [[through route]] between Gresham and Hillsboro, were further unified in passenger information as the Blue Line, after TriMet introduced a [[color code|color coding]] scheme amid preparations for the opening of a second service: the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] to [[Portland International Airport]]. The Blue Line currently shares its route with the Red Line on the west side, between [[Beaverton Transit Center]] and [[Rose Quarter Transit Center]]. On the east side, it shares tracks with both the Red Line and the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]], between Rose Quarter Transit Center and [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]].\n\n==Eastside history==\n===Early freeway proposals===\n{{Main|Mount Hood Freeway}}\n\nIn 1955, the [[Oregon Department of Transportation|Oregon State Highway Department]] laid out the freeway development plan for the [[Portland metropolitan area]]; it proposed the construction of the [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|I-505]], among others.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shoemaker |first=Mervin |title=Plan Given for Traffic of Future - Highway Engineer Submits Report to Commission |work=[[The Oregonian]] |date=June 29, 1955 |page=1}}</ref> Led by newly elected Portland Mayor [[Neil Goldschmidt]], whose campaign centered around freeway opposition,<ref name=\"Portland kills\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html |title=Feb. 4, 1974: Portland kills the Mount Hood Freeway... |last=Mesh |first=Aaron |newspaper=[[Willamette Week]] |date=November 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010161716/https://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html |archive-date=October 10, 2018 |access-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref> citizen protests and two other factors led to the eventual cancellation of both projects.

He has worked as a sportswriter and taught screenwriting at the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI). American mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] was a mentor and major influence; Cousineau wrote the documentary film and companion book about Campbell's life, [[The Hero's Journey (film)|The Hero's Journey]]. The author of more than 25 nonfiction books, Cousineau has more than 15 documentary screenwriting credits to his name, including the 1991 [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Forever Activists]].\n\nSeminal works include, ''Soul: An Archaeology, Readings from Socrates to Ray Charles'', which [[Los Angeles Times]] columnist [[Jonathan Kirsch]] reviewed as \"Inspiring, often mind-blowing, sometimes even a little scary,\" <ref>''Los Angeles Times'', March 2, 1994</ref> and the best-selling book, ''The Art of Pilgrimage: The Seeker's Guide the Making Travel Sacred'', described in the [[Austin American-Statesman]] as \"If Joseph Campbell, the [[Dalai Lama]] and Bill Moyers were to have collaborated on a book about journeys...I suspect it would look very much like ''The Art of Pilgrimage''.\" Cousineau worked with religion scholar [[Huston Smith]] on three books as well as four documentary films on contemporary [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] issues. His books have been translated into nine languages. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', \"Phil Cousineau has long been a powerful presence in the [San Francisco] Bay Area literary scene, but he is best known as a filmmaker and...writer who has carried on and reinterpreted the work of Joseph Campbell, especially regarding the omnipresent influence of [[myth]] in modern life.\" <ref>''San Francisco Chronicle'', May 8, 2005</ref>\n\nCousineau grew up just outside [[Detroit]], once known as \"the Paris of the Midwest,\u201d with [[French Canadian]] roots. While moonlighting in a steel factory he studied journalism at the [[University of Detroit]]. Before turning to writing books and films full-time, Cousineau\u2019s peripatetic career also included playing semi-professional [[basketball]] in Europe, harvesting date trees on an Israeli [[kibbutz]], painting 44 Victorian houses (also known as [[Painted Ladies]] in [[San Francisco]]), teaching, and leading art and literary tours to [[Europe]].\n\n==Current work==\nAn expert on mythology and film and the [[monomyth]] \"hero journey\" structure of screenplays, Cousineau consults on scripts, books, and writing projects of all kinds. An inspiring speaker, he lectures frequently on themes of sacred travel, sports, mentorship, writing, and creativity to diverse audiences.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qs1e9hEsF8 TedX, April 17, 2011]</ref>\n\nCousineau is currently the host and co-writer of the [[Link TV]] television series, ''Global Spirit'', interviewing guests such as [[Robert Thurman]], [[Karen Armstrong]], [[Andrew Harvey (religious writer)|Andrew Harvey]], [[Deepak Chopra]], and [[Joanne Shenandoah]]. \u201cI try to put myself in the position of people I know who are curious about cultures,\u201d said Cousineau in ''The New York Times'', \u201cand try to ask what they would ask if they were in my lucky shoes.\u201d <ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/arts/television/11spiri.html ''New York Times'', April 10, 2009]</ref> Broadcast journalist [[Bill Moyers]] has commented that \u201cThe discussions on Link TV\u2019s ''Global Spirit'' series are sorely needed in this dispirited and disenchanted world. In many ways it is more important than journalism today.\u201d The first season of ''Global Spirit'' was presented by [[John Cleese]] and broadcast on PBS-TV stations nationwide in the United States in 2012 and 2013.<ref>[http://blogs.kqed.org/pressroom/global-spirit-takes-viewers-on-a-mind-and-soul-expanding-journey/ KQED-TV]</ref><ref>[http://kqed.info/tv/programs/archive/index.jsp?pgmid=20821 KQED-TV]</ref>\n\nA self-avowed night owl, Cousineau published ''Burning the Midnight Oil'', a book of essays and poems about finding inspiration in the night, in 2013. He discussed his love of the night with [[Scott Simon]] on [[NPR]] along with forewordist and holy fool [[Jeff Dowd]] of [[The Big Lebowski]] fame on the winter solstice that year.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/books/titles/255442309/burning-the-midnight-oil-illuminating-words-for-the-long-nights-journey NPR Books, December 21, 2013]</ref>\n\nCousineau lives in [[North Beach, San Francisco, California]] and is currently writing a book about beauty and the [[Venus de Milo]], as well as a young adult novel about baseball.\n\n==Famous quotes==\n\n'''On [[Art]]:'''\n\"Art is the making of something the world\u2019s never seen before in images or words. It is creation itself on a human level. It is as necessary as breathing because it is our greatest means for learning about and conveying to others what life means. Art is a meaning-making machine. Without it, we are stammer and grasp, like [[Eugene O\u2019Neill]]\u2019s fog people.\"<ref>[http://www.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2014/08/14/the-write-stuff-phil-cousineau-on-the-making-of-something-the-worlds-never-seen ''San Francisco Weekly'', August 14, 2014]</ref>\n\n'''On [[Words]]:'''\n\"Who knows why some words ignite the hearts of some readers while others are like wet matches that won't light.\"\n\n'''On [[Creativity]]:'''\n\"Inspiration comes and goes, creativity is the result of practice.\" ~from ''Stoking the Creative Fires: 9 Ways to Rekindle Passion and  Imagination''\n\n\"The creative urge matters. Stories matter. Images matter. It matters that you were born with a genius, a guiding spirit, a daimon that may know more about your destiny than you do.\"\n\n\"But what if your fire is not burning well or, worse, has gone out? Without inner fire, you have no light, no heat, no desire... there's only one way out - and that's through the dark woods. You must change your life.\"\n\n'''On [[Travel]] and [[Pilgrimage]]:'''\n\"Now is the time to lead your ideal life.\" ~from ''The Art of Pilgrimage: The Seeker's Guide to Making Travel Sacred''\n\n\"The practice of soulful travel is to discover the overlapping point between history and everyday life, the way to find the essence of every place, every day: in the markets, small chapels, out-of-the-way parks, craft shops. Curiosity about the extraordinary in the ordinary moves the heart of the traveler intent on seeing behind the veil of tourism.\"\n\n\"In each of us dwells a [[pilgrim]]. It is the part of us that longs to have direct contact with the sacred.\"\n\n\"The pilgrim is a poetic traveler, one who believes that there is poetry on the road, at the heart of everything.\"\n\n\"Are you alive now at home? Are you going to stay in your coffin of mediocrity, [or] break out of your cage, and take a journey to discover this in order to find yourself?\"\n\n\"What every traveler confronts sooner or later is that the way we spend each day of our travel...is the way we spend our lives.\"\n\n\"Have you ever made a vow to go someplace that is sacred to you, your family, your group? Have you ever imagined yourself in a place that stirred your soul like the song of doves at dawn? If not you, then who? If not now, when? If not here, where?\"\n\n\"Mapping out dozens of deeply focused trips around the world has convinced me that preparation no more spoils the chance for spontaneity and serendipity than discipline ruins the opportunity for genuine self-expression in sports, acting, or the tea ceremony.\"\n\n\"The force behind [[myths]], [[fairytales]], [[parables]] and soulful travel stories reveals the myriad ways the sacred breaks through the resistance and shines forth into our world. [[Pilgrimage]] holds out the promise of personal contact with that sacred force.\"\n\n\"The art of movement, the poetry of motion, the music of personal experience, of the sacred in those places it has been known to shine forth.

He has worked as a sportswriter and taught screenwriting at the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI). American mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] was a mentor and major influence; Cousineau wrote the documentary film and companion book about Campbell's life, [[The Hero's Journey (film)|The Hero's Journey]]. The author of more than 25 nonfiction books, Cousineau has more than 15 documentary screenwriting credits to his name, including the 1991 [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Forever Activists]].\n\nSeminal works include, ''Soul: An Archaeology, Readings from Socrates to Ray Charles'', which [[Los Angeles Times]] columnist [[Jonathan Kirsch]] reviewed as \"Inspiring, often mind-blowing, sometimes even a little scary,\" <ref>''Los Angeles Times'', March 2, 1994</ref> and the best-selling book, ''The Art of Pilgrimage: The Seeker's Guide the Making Travel Sacred'', described in the [[Austin American-Statesman]] as \"If Joseph Campbell, the [[Dalai Lama]] and Bill Moyers were to have collaborated on a book about journeys...I suspect it would look very much like ''The Art of Pilgrimage''.\" Cousineau worked with religion scholar [[Huston Smith]] on three books as well as four documentary films on contemporary [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] issues. His books have been translated into nine languages. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', \"Phil Cousineau has long been a powerful presence in the [San Francisco] Bay Area literary scene, but he is best known as a filmmaker and...writer who has carried on and reinterpreted the work of Joseph Campbell, especially regarding the omnipresent influence of [[myth]] in modern life.\" <ref>''San Francisco Chronicle'', May 8, 2005</ref>\n\nCousineau grew up just outside [[Detroit]], once known as \"the Paris of the Midwest,\u201d with [[French Canadian]] roots. While moonlighting in a steel factory he studied journalism at the [[University of Detroit]]. Before turning to writing books and films full-time, Cousineau\u2019s peripatetic career also included playing semi-professional [[basketball]] in Europe, harvesting date trees on an Israeli [[kibbutz]], painting 44 Victorian houses (also known as [[Painted Ladies]] in [[San Francisco]]), teaching, and leading art and literary tours to [[Europe]].\n\n==Current work==\nAn expert on mythology and film and the [[monomyth]] \"hero journey\" structure of screenplays, Cousineau consults on scripts, books, and writing projects of all kinds. An inspiring speaker, he lectures frequently on themes of sacred travel, sports, mentorship, writing, and creativity to diverse audiences.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qs1e9hEsF8 TedX, April 17, 2011]</ref>\n\nCousineau is currently the host and co-writer of the [[Link TV]] television series, ''Global Spirit'', interviewing guests such as [[Robert Thurman]], [[Karen Armstrong]], [[Andrew Harvey (religious writer)|Andrew Harvey]], [[Deepak Chopra]], and [[Joanne Shenandoah]]. \u201cI try to put myself in the position of people I know who are curious about cultures,\u201d said Cousineau in ''The New York Times'', \u201cand try to ask what they would ask if they were in my lucky shoes.\u201d <ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/arts/television/11spiri.html ''New York Times'', April 10, 2009]</ref> Broadcast journalist [[Bill Moyers]] has commented that \u201cThe discussions on Link TV\u2019s ''Global Spirit'' series are sorely needed in this dispirited and disenchanted world. In many ways it is more important than journalism today.\u201d The first season of ''Global Spirit'' was presented by [[John Cleese]] and broadcast on PBS-TV stations nationwide in the United States in 2012 and 2013.<ref>[http://blogs.kqed.org/pressroom/global-spirit-takes-viewers-on-a-mind-and-soul-expanding-journey/ KQED-TV]</ref><ref>[http://kqed.info/tv/programs/archive/index.jsp?pgmid=20821 KQED-TV]</ref>\n\nA self-avowed night owl, Cousineau published ''Burning the Midnight Oil'', a book of essays and poems about finding inspiration in the night, in 2013. He discussed his love of the night with [[Scott Simon]] on [[NPR]] along with forewordist and holy fool [[Jeff Dowd]] of [[The Big Lebowski]] fame on the winter solstice that year.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/books/titles/255442309/burning-the-midnight-oil-illuminating-words-for-the-long-nights-journey NPR Books, December 21, 2013]</ref>\n\nCousineau lives in [[North Beach, San Francisco, California]] and is currently writing a book about beauty and the [[Venus de Milo]], as well as a young adult novel about baseball.\n\n==Famous quotes==\n\n'''On [[Art]]:'''\n\"Art is the making of something the world\u2019s never seen before in images or words. It is creation itself on a human level. It is as necessary as breathing because it is our greatest means for learning about and conveying to others what life means. Art is a meaning-making machine. Without it, we are stammer and grasp, like [[Eugene O\u2019Neill]]\u2019s fog people.\"<ref>[http://www.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2014/08/14/the-write-stuff-phil-cousineau-on-the-making-of-something-the-worlds-never-seen ''San Francisco Weekly'', August 14, 2014]</ref>\n\n'''On [[Words]]:'''\n\"Who knows why some words ignite the hearts of some readers while others are like wet matches that won't light.\"\n\n'''On [[Creativity]]:'''\n\"Inspiration comes and goes, creativity is the result of practice.\" ~from ''Stoking the Creative Fires: 9 Ways to Rekindle Passion and  Imagination''\n\n\"The creative urge matters. Stories matter. Images matter. It matters that you were born with a genius, a guiding spirit, a daimon that may know more about your destiny than you do.\"\n\n\"But what if your fire is not burning well or, worse, has gone out? Without inner fire, you have no light, no heat, no desire... there's only one way out - and that's through the dark woods. You must change your life.\"\n\n'''On [[Travel]] and [[Pilgrimage]]:'''\n\"Now is the time to lead your ideal life.\" ~from ''The Art of Pilgrimage: The Seeker's Guide to Making Travel Sacred''\n\n\"The practice of soulful travel is to discover the overlapping point between history and everyday life, the way to find the essence of every place, every day: in the markets, small chapels, out-of-the-way parks, craft shops. Curiosity about the extraordinary in the ordinary moves the heart of the traveler intent on seeing behind the veil of tourism.\"\n\n\"In each of us dwells a [[pilgrim]]. It is the part of us that longs to have direct contact with the sacred.\"\n\n\"The pilgrim is a poetic traveler, one who believes that there is poetry on the road, at the heart of everything.\"\n\n\"Are you alive now at home? Are you going to stay in your coffin of mediocrity, [or] break out of your cage, and take a journey to discover this in order to find yourself?\"\n\n\"What every traveler confronts sooner or later is that the way we spend each day of our travel...is the way we spend our lives.\"\n\n\"Have you ever made a vow to go someplace that is sacred to you, your family, your group? Have you ever imagined yourself in a place that stirred your soul like the song of doves at dawn? If not you, then who? If not now, when? If not here, where?\"\n\n\"Mapping out dozens of deeply focused trips around the world has convinced me that preparation no more spoils the chance for spontaneity and serendipity than discipline ruins the opportunity for genuine self-expression in sports, acting, or the tea ceremony.\"\n\n\"The force behind [[myths]], [[fairytales]], [[parables]] and soulful travel stories reveals the myriad ways the sacred breaks through the resistance and shines forth into our world. [[Pilgrimage]] holds out the promise of personal contact with that sacred force.\"\n\n\"The art of movement, the poetry of motion, the music of personal experience, of the sacred in those places it has been known to shine forth. If we are not astounded by these possibilities, we can never plumb the depths of our own souls or the soul of the world.\u201d\n\n\"What is sacred is what is worthy of our reverence, what evokes awe and wonder in the human heart, and what, when contemplated, transforms us utterly.\"\n\n\"Uncover what you long for and you will discover who you are.\"\n\n\"Our task in life is to find our deep soul work and throw ourselves headlong into it.\"\n\n'''On [[Synchronicity]]:'''\n\"[Synchronicity is] an inexplicable but profoundly meaningful coincidence that stirs the soul and offers a glimpse of one's destiny.\"\n\n'''On the [[Soul]]:'''\n\"As the ancients said, the soul is realized in love.\"\n\n'''On the [[Hero's Journey]]:'''\n\"The journey of the hero is about the courage to seek the depths; the image of creative rebirth; the eternal cycle of change within us; the uncanny discovery that the seeker is the mystery which the seeker seeks to know. The hero journey is a symbol that binds, in the original sense of the word, two distant ideas, the spiritual quest of the ancients with the modern search for identity, \u201calways the one, shape-shifting yet marvelously constant story that we find.\"\n\n'''On [[Jim Morrison]]:'''\n\"Morrison represents the power of a god that won't die. It's the story of a young god who dies, and yet lives on though his music.\"\n<ref>''The Free Lance-Star'', July 6, 1996</ref>\n\n==Select books==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | title = Burning the Midnight Oil: Illuminating Words for the Long Night's Journey Into Day\n  | publisher = Viva Editions\n  |date=Dec 2013\n  | pages = 244 pages\n\n  | isbn = 978-1-936-74073-4}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | others = Gregg Chadwick (illus.)\n  | title = The Painted Word: A Treasure Chest of Remarkable Words and Their Origins\n  | publisher = Viva Editions\n  |date=Sep 2012\n  | pages = 336\n\n  | isbn = 978-1-936-74017-8}}\n* {{cite book |last      = Smith\n |first     = Huston\n |author2   = Phil Cousineau\n |title     = And Live Rejoicing: Chapters from a Charmed Life \u2014 Personal Encounters with Spiritual Mavericks, Remarkable Seekers, and the World's Great Religious Leaders\n |publisher = New World Library\n |date      = Sep 2012\n |pages     = [https://archive.org/details/andliverejoicing00hust/page/248 248]\n |isbn      = 978-1-608-68071-9\n |url       = https://archive.org/details/andliverejoicing00hust/page/248\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | others= [[Huston Smith]] (foreword)\n  | title = Beyond Forgiveness: Reflections on Atonement\n  | publisher = Jossey-Bass\n  |date=February 2011\n  | pages = 272\n  \n  | isbn = 978-0-470-90773-3}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | others = Gregg Chadwick (illus.)\n  | title = Wordcatcher: An Odyssey into the World of Weird and Wonderful Words\n  | publisher = Viva Editions\n  | date = April 2010\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/wordcatcherodyss00cous_0/page/305 305]\n  | isbn = 978-1-57344-400-2\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/wordcatcherodyss00cous_0/page/305\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | title = The Oldest Story in the World\n  | publisher = Sisyphus Press\n  |date=January 2010\n  | pages = 84\n  \n  | isbn = 978-0-9626548-9-3}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | author2 = Scott Chamberlin Hoyt\n  | title = The Meaning of Tea: A Tea Inspired Journey\n  | publisher = Talking Leaves Press\n  |date=September 2009\n  | pages = 362\n  \n  | isbn = 978-0-615-20442-0}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | title = Stoking the Creative Fires: 9 Ways to Rekindle Passion and Imagination\n  | publisher = Conari Press\n  | date = May 2008\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/stokingcreativef00cous/page/224 224]\n  | isbn = 978-1-57324-299-8\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/stokingcreativef00cous/page/224\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Smith\n  | first = Huston\n  | last2 = Cousineau\n  | first2 = Phil\n  | title = A Seat at the Table: [[Huston Smith]] in Conversation with Native Americans on Religious Freedom\n  | publisher = University of California Press\n  | date = December 2005\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/seatattable00hust/page/253 253]\n  | isbn = 978-0-520-24439-9\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | title = The Blue Museum: Poems\n  | publisher = Sisyphus Press\n  | year = 2004\n  | pages = 152\n\n  | isbn = 978-0-9626548-2-4}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | title = The Olympic Odyssey: Rekindling the True Spirit of the Great Games\n  | publisher = Quest Books\n  | date = November 2003\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/olympicodysseyre0000cous/page/224 224]\n  | isbn = 978-0-8356-0833-6\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/olympicodysseyre0000cous/page/224\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Smith\n  | first = Huston\n  | last2 = Cousineau\n  | first2 = Phil\n  | title = The Way Things Are: Conversations with [[Huston Smith]] on the Spiritual Life\n  | publisher = University of California Press\n  | date = September 2003\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/waythingsareconv00smit/page/338 338]\n  | isbn = 978-0-520-23816-9\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cousineau\n  | first = Phil\n  | others = [[Wes Nisker]] (foreword)\n  | title = Coincidence Or Destiny?
