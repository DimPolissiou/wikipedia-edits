Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the [[rock 'n roll]] revolution of the mid-1950s and continues in a definable path to today.}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nAccording to author John Storey, there are various definitions of popular culture.<ref>John Storey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4\u20138</ref> The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much \"[[high culture]]\" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"leftover\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]].\n\nA third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>S\u00e9rgio Campos Gon\u00e7alves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista \u2013 N\u00facleo de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica em Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 UNAERP (Ribeir\u00e3o Preto), v. 3, pp. 18\u201328, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"\n\nStorey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Levels===\nWithin the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>\n\n===Folklore===\nAdaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A.

With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves.\n\n== Criticism ==\nMany people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n\nSources of popular culture include:\n* [[Film]]s\n* [[Television show|Television programs]]\n* [[Popular music]]\n* [[Sport]]s\n* [[Corporation]]s\n* [[Book]]s \n* [[Radio]] \n* [[Video game]]s <sup>''(no section)''</sup>\n* [[Internet|The Internet]] <sup>''(no section)''</sup><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/64/Pop_Culture_An_Overview|title=Pop Culture: An Overview {{!}} Issue 64 {{!}} Philosophy Now|website=philosophynow.org|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\n===Print Culture===\nWith the invention of the printing press in the sixteenth century, mass produced, cheap books became widely available to the public.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4\u20138</ref> The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much \"[[high culture]]\" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"leftover\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]].\n\nA third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>S\u00e9rgio Campos Gon\u00e7alves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista \u2013 N\u00facleo de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica em Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 UNAERP (Ribeir\u00e3o Preto), v. 3, pp. 18\u201328, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"\n\nStorey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Levels===\nWithin the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>\n\n===Folklore===\nAdaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A.

With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves.\n\n== Criticism ==\nMany people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n\nSources of popular culture include:\n* [[Film]]s\n* [[Television show|Television programs]]\n* [[Popular music]]\n* [[Sport]]s\n* [[Corporation]]s\n* [[Book]]s \n* [[Radio]] \n* [[Video game]]s <sup>''(no section)''</sup>\n* [[Internet|The Internet]] <sup>''(no section)''</sup><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/64/Pop_Culture_An_Overview|title=Pop Culture: An Overview {{!}} Issue 64 {{!}} Philosophy Now|website=philosophynow.org|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\n===Print Culture===\nWith the invention of the printing press in the sixteenth century, mass produced, cheap books became widely available to the public.

Scouting for native Indians was started by Justice [[Vivian Bose]], [[Pandit]] [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]], Pandit [[Hridayanath Kunzru]], [[Girija Shankar Bajpai]], [[Annie Besant]] and [[George Arundale]], in 1913. Prior to this date, Scouting was open only for British and foreign Scouts. In 1916, a [[Cub Scout|Cub]] section was started, followed by the [[Rover Scout|Rover]] section in 1918.\n\nIn 1916, [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]'s Senior Deputy Commissioner of Police [[J. S. Wilson]] introduced ''Scouting for Boys'' as a textbook in the Calcutta Police Training School. Colonel Wilson volunteered his services to the District Scout Commissioner, [[Alfred Pickford]], and in 1917 became Assistant Scoutmaster of the Old Mission Church Troop. Together the two struggled for the admission of Indian boys into the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts Association]], which had not been admitted due to a [[British Raj|Government of India]] order against it because \"Scouting might train them to become revolutionaries\". Shortly Wilson was acting as Cubmaster and Scoutmaster, and succeeded Pickford as District Commissioner in May 1919 when Pickford was promoted to Chief Scout Commissioner for India.\n\nAs a way of getting around the Government Order, the ''Boy Scouts of Bengal'' was founded, with identical aims and methods. Many separate Scout organizations began to spring up, the ''Indian Boy Scouts Association'', founded in 1916, based in [[Chennai|Madras]] and headed by Annie Besant and George Arundale; ''Boy Scouts of [[Mysore]]''; ''Boy Scouts of [[Vadodara|Baroda]]''; ''[[Nizam]]'s Scouts'' in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]; ''[[Seva Samiti]] Scout Association'' (Humanity Uplift Service Society), founded in 1917 by Madan Mohan Malaviya and Hridayanath Kunzru and based in [[Allahabad]]; the aforementioned ''Boy Scouts of [[Bengal]]'' and likely others. A conference was held in Calcutta in August 1920 in which Wilson staged a Scout Rally, and as a result the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]] sent an invitation to [[Robert Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]], by then Chief Scout of the World, to visit India. Lord and [[Olave Baden-Powell|Lady Baden-Powell]] arrived in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in late January 1921 for a short tour of the subcontinent before leaving Calcutta for [[Yangon|Rangoon]]. Alfred Pickford accompanied them and became one of their closest friends.\n\n[[Image:Boy Scouts Association in India.svg|thumb|140px|The emblem of the Boy Scouts Association in India\u2013note modern Burma, Pakistan and Bangladesh are included in the map]]\n\nThe result of this visit was a union of all of the Scout organizations except the Seva Samiti Scout Association into '''The Boy Scouts Association in India'''. In 1922 Pickford returned to England and was appointed Overseas Commissioner of The Boy Scouts Association at their headquarters in London, but his dream of allowance of local boys into the program had been fulfilled.\n\nIn 1938, a number of members left the Boy Scouts Association in India after a wave of nationalism. They formed \u2013 together with the Seva Samiti Scout Association and the newly founded ''India National Scout Association'' \u2013 the '''Hindustan Scout Association''', the first coeducational Scouting and Guiding organisation in India.<ref name=\"BSG-history1\">{{cite web |title=The Bharat Scouts and Guides |url=http://www.scoutsnguides.com/html/Section2/Sec2_History.htm |publisher=scoutsnguides.com |accessdate=13 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215818/http://www.scoutsnguides.com/html/Section2/Sec2_History.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 10 January 2007}}</ref> In the same year, the Boy Scouts Association in India became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.\n\n===Girl Guides===\nThe first Girl Guides company was founded in [[Jabalpur]] in 1911 at [[Christ Church School]] The movement immediately grew: In 1915, more than fifty companies existed with a membership of over 1,200, all of them directly registered with the [[Girlguiding UK|Girl Guide Association]] and all restricted to girls of European descent. These companies formed the '''All India Girl Guides Association''' in 1916.

S. Wilson]] provided transportation for Girl Guide rallies.\n<blockquote>\nThe girls themselves were never quite sure whether they preferred to ride in police vans or in the riot truck. The former concealed them from public view, but were very hot; the latter, being cages of expanded metal, were cooler, but reminiscent of the [[Calcutta Zoo]]!\n</blockquote>\nIn 1928, the ''All India Girl Guides Association'' joined the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts as one of its founder members. This membership was renewed in 1948 after the independence of India and its [[partition of India|partition]].<ref name=\"Trefoil1997\"/>\n\n===Bharat Scouts and Guides===\n[[File:The Bharat Scouts & Guides National Headquarters, Delhi.jpg|thumb|220px|The Bharat Scouts and Guides National Headquarters, Delhi]]\nIn the first years after India's independence leading politicians, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] and [[Mangal Das Pakvasa]], as well as Scout leaders tried to unify India's Scouts and Guides. A first success was the merger of the ''Boy Scouts Association in India'' and the ''Hindustan Scout Association'' forming the Bharat Scouts and Guides on 7 November 1950. About a year later, on 15 August 1951, the ''All India Girl Guides Association'' joined this new organisation.<ref name=\"BSG-history2\"/>\n\nIn 1959, the [[World Scout Conference|17th World Scout Conference]] in New Delhi was hosted by the BSG. The [[Sangam World Girl Guide/Girl Scout Center]] in [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]], India, opened in 1966. The idea for this fourth world centre dates back to 1956 when it was developed during a WAGGGS International commissioners' meeting in [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe [[United Nations]] selected the Bharat Scouts and Guides as honorary \"Peace Messengers\" for their significant and concrete contributions to the [[International Year of Peace]] in 1986.\n\n===Sethna's 18th West Bombay Scout Group===\n'''Sethna's 18th West Bombay Scout Group''' is the [[Oldest Scout Groups|oldest continuously running Scout Group]] in India.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Group|url=http://sethnas.org/the-group/|publisher=Sethna's 18th West Bombay Scouts|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> It was established in 1914, when Rustomji Edulji Sethna (1898\u20131954) came across the book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', written by Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout movement. He was enamoured by the book and formed one of India's first Scout groups for native boys. Prior to that, there existed some Scout groups, but they were primarily for the British expatriates in India.\n\nSethna resisted joining one of the competing Scout associations and registering his troop until Scouting became open for all irrespective of color, caste, or creed. He wrote to Baden-Powell about this discrepancy. In 1921 the regulations were changed and all were allowed to become part of the Scout movement in India. The 18th West has been continuously running since the day it started. None of the World Wars or the [[Partition of India]] stopped the group from functioning.\n\n===Notable members===\n[[Vivian Bose]] was a member of the [[World Scout Committee]] of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1947 until 1949.\n\nIn 1969, Mrs. [[Lakhshmi Mazumdar]] was awarded the ''[[Bronze Wolf]]'', the only distinction of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]], awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.\n\n==Program==\nThe association describes its aims in its mission:\n:''The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.''<ref name=\"BSG-misson\">{{cite web |title=Mission statement |url=http://www.bsgindia.org/MISSION%20VISION.htm |publisher=The Bharat Scouts and Guides |accessdate=13 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nScout and Guide units are separate although they have some coeducational activities such as Jamborees, rallies, and conferences.

Scouting for native Indians was started by Justice [[Vivian Bose]], [[Pandit]] [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]], Pandit [[Hridayanath Kunzru]], [[Girija Shankar Bajpai]], [[Annie Besant]] and [[George Arundale]], in 1913. Prior to this date, Scouting was open only for British and foreign Scouts. In 1916, a [[Cub Scout|Cub]] section was started, followed by the [[Rover Scout|Rover]] section in 1918.\n\nIn 1916, [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]'s Senior Deputy Commissioner of Police [[J. S. Wilson]] introduced ''Scouting for Boys'' as a textbook in the Calcutta Police Training School. Colonel Wilson volunteered his services to the District Scout Commissioner, [[Alfred Pickford]], and in 1917 became Assistant Scoutmaster of the Old Mission Church Troop. Together the two struggled for the admission of Indian boys into the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts Association]], which had not been admitted due to a [[British Raj|Government of India]] order against it because \"Scouting might train them to become revolutionaries\". Shortly Wilson was acting as Cubmaster and Scoutmaster, and succeeded Pickford as District Commissioner in May 1919 when Pickford was promoted to Chief Scout Commissioner for India.\n\nAs a way of getting around the Government Order, the ''Boy Scouts of Bengal'' was founded, with identical aims and methods. Many separate Scout organizations began to spring up, the ''Indian Boy Scouts Association'', founded in 1916, based in [[Chennai|Madras]] and headed by Annie Besant and George Arundale; ''Boy Scouts of [[Mysore]]''; ''Boy Scouts of [[Vadodara|Baroda]]''; ''[[Nizam]]'s Scouts'' in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]; ''[[Seva Samiti]] Scout Association'' (Humanity Uplift Service Society), founded in 1917 by Madan Mohan Malaviya and Hridayanath Kunzru and based in [[Allahabad]]; the aforementioned ''Boy Scouts of [[Bengal]]'' and likely others. A conference was held in Calcutta in August 1920 in which Wilson staged a Scout Rally, and as a result the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]] sent an invitation to [[Robert Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]], by then Chief Scout of the World, to visit India. Lord and [[Olave Baden-Powell|Lady Baden-Powell]] arrived in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in late January 1921 for a short tour of the subcontinent before leaving Calcutta for [[Yangon|Rangoon]]. Alfred Pickford accompanied them and became one of their closest friends.\n\n[[Image:Boy Scouts Association in India.svg|thumb|140px|The emblem of the Boy Scouts Association in India\u2013note modern Burma, Pakistan and Bangladesh are included in the map]]\n\nThe result of this visit was a union of all of the Scout organizations except the Seva Samiti Scout Association into '''The Boy Scouts Association in India'''. In 1922 Pickford returned to England and was appointed Overseas Commissioner of The Boy Scouts Association at their headquarters in London, but his dream of allowance of local boys into the program had been fulfilled.\n\nIn 1938, a number of members left the Boy Scouts Association in India after a wave of nationalism. They formed \u2013 together with the Seva Samiti Scout Association and the newly founded ''India National Scout Association'' \u2013 the '''Hindustan Scout Association''', the first coeducational Scouting and Guiding organisation in India.<ref name=\"BSG-history1\">{{cite web |title=The Bharat Scouts and Guides |url=http://www.scoutsnguides.com/html/Section2/Sec2_History.htm |publisher=scoutsnguides.com |accessdate=13 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215818/http://www.scoutsnguides.com/html/Section2/Sec2_History.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 10 January 2007}}</ref> In the same year, the Boy Scouts Association in India became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.\n\n===Girl Guides===\nThe first Girl Guides company was founded in [[Jabalpur]] in 1911 at [[Christ Church School]] The movement immediately grew: In 1915, more than fifty companies existed with a membership of over 1,200, all of them directly registered with the [[Girlguiding UK|Girl Guide Association]] and all restricted to girls of European descent. These companies formed the '''All India Girl Guides Association''' in 1916.

The former concealed them from public view, but were very hot; the latter, being cages of expanded metal, were cooler, but reminiscent of the [[Calcutta Zoo]]!\n</blockquote>\nIn 1928, the ''All India Girl Guides Association'' joined the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts as one of its founder members. This membership was renewed in 1948 after the independence of India and its [[partition of India|partition]].<ref name=\"Trefoil1997\"/>\n\n===Bharat Scouts and Guides===\n[[File:The Bharat Scouts & Guides National Headquarters, Delhi.jpg|thumb|220px|The Bharat Scouts and Guides National Headquarters, Delhi]]\nIn the first years after India's independence leading politicians, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] and [[Mangal Das Pakvasa]], as well as Scout leaders tried to unify India's Scouts and Guides. A first success was the merger of the ''Boy Scouts Association in India'' and the ''Hindustan Scout Association'' forming the Bharat Scouts and Guides on 7 November 1950. About a year later, on 15 August 1951, the ''All India Girl Guides Association'' joined this new organisation.<ref name=\"BSG-history2\"/>\n\nIn 1959, the [[World Scout Conference|17th World Scout Conference]] in New Delhi was hosted by the BSG. The [[Sangam World Girl Guide/Girl Scout Center]] in [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]], India, opened in 1966. The idea for this fourth world centre dates back to 1956 when it was developed during a WAGGGS International commissioners' meeting in [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe [[United Nations]] selected the Bharat Scouts and Guides as honorary \"Peace Messengers\" for their significant and concrete contributions to the [[International Year of Peace]] in 1986.\n\n===Sethna's 18th West Bombay Scout Group===\n'''Sethna's 18th West Bombay Scout Group''' is the [[Oldest Scout Groups|oldest continuously running Scout Group]] in India.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Group|url=http://sethnas.org/the-group/|publisher=Sethna's 18th West Bombay Scouts|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> It was established in 1914, when Rustomji Edulji Sethna (1898\u20131954) came across the book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', written by Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout movement. He was enamoured by the book and formed one of India's first Scout groups for native boys. Prior to that, there existed some Scout groups, but they were primarily for the British expatriates in India.\n\nSethna resisted joining one of the competing Scout associations and registering his troop until Scouting became open for all irrespective of color, caste, or creed. He wrote to Baden-Powell about this discrepancy. In 1921 the regulations were changed and all were allowed to become part of the Scout movement in India. The 18th West has been continuously running since the day it started. None of the World Wars or the [[Partition of India]] stopped the group from functioning.\n\n===Notable members===\n[[Vivian Bose]] was a member of the [[World Scout Committee]] of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1947 until 1949.\n\nIn 1969, Mrs. [[Lakhshmi Mazumdar]] was awarded the ''[[Bronze Wolf]]'', the only distinction of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]], awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.\n\n==Program==\nThe association describes its aims in its mission:\n:''The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.''<ref name=\"BSG-misson\">{{cite web |title=Mission statement |url=http://www.bsgindia.org/MISSION%20VISION.htm |publisher=The Bharat Scouts and Guides |accessdate=13 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nScout and Guide units are separate although they have some coeducational activities such as Jamborees, rallies, and conferences.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

He executed designs for a number of ballets including ''Labyrinth'' (1942), ''Sentimental Colloquy'', ''Mad Tristan'', and ''The Cafe of Chinitas'' (all 1944).<ref name=\":1\">Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 431-43</ref> In 1945 he created the dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's film ''Spellbound''.<ref name=\":2\">Gibson, Ian (1997) p 434-45</ref> He also produced art work for advertising campaigns for products such as perfumes, cosmetics, hosiery and ties.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 430-31</ref>\n\n====== Post War in United States (1946-48) ======\nIn 1946 Dal\u00ed worked with Walt Disney and animator John Hench on an unfinished animated film ''Destino''.<ref name=\":3\">Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 436-38</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed exhibited new work at the Bignou Gallery from November 1947 to January 1948. The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss his marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dal\u00ed sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 461-63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968\u201370).\n\nDal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]] was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s.

While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed described the earlier of these works, ''Honey is Sweeter than Blood'', as \"equidistant between Cubism and Surrealism.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 162</ref> The works featured a number of elements that were to become characteristic of his Surrealist period including dreamlike images, precise draftsmanship, idiosyncratic inconography (such as rotting donkeys and dismembered bodies), and lighting and landscapes strongly evocative of his native Catalonia. The works provoked bemusement among the public and debate among critics about whether Dal\u00ed had become a Surrealist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 171</ref>\n\nInfluenced by his reading of Freud, Dal\u00ed increasingly introduced suggestive sexual imagery and symbolism into his work. He submitted ''Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires)'' (1928) to the Barcelona Autumn Salon for 1928 but the work was rejected because \"it was not fit to be exhibited in any gallery habitually visited by the numerous public little prepared for certain surprises.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 287</ref> The resulting scandal was widely covered in the Barcelona press and prompted a popular Madrid illustrated weekly to publish an interview with the now controversial artist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 186-190</ref>\n\nSome trends in Dal\u00ed's work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s.

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.
