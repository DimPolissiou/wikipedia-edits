He lived on 12th Street and 4th Avenue and went to Manual Training High School in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] section. His parents divorced while he was a child. To help keep him out of trouble, his father bought him a large [[Trans-Oceanic]] radio, and Smith became an avid fan of R&B music and the disc jockeys who played it, including [[\"Jocko\" Henderson]] of Philadelphia, New York's \"Dr. Jive\" ([[Tommy Smalls]]), the \"Moon Dog\" from Cleveland, [[Alan Freed]], and Nashville's \"[[John R.]]\" Richbourg, who later became his mentor. After selling [[encyclopedia]]s and [[Fuller Brush Company|Fuller brushes]] door-to-door, Smith attended the National Academy of Broadcasting in [[Washington, D.C.]] After he graduated in 1960, he began working as \"Daddy Jules\" at [[WTJZ|WYOU]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. When the station format changed to \"beautiful music\", Smith became known as \"Roger Gordon and Music in Good Taste\". In 1962, he moved to country music station KCIJ/1050 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], as the station manager and morning disc jockey, \"Big Smith with the Records\". He married Lucy \"Lou\" Lamb in 1961, and they had two children.<ref>John A. Drobnicki, \"Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)\", in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 581.</ref>\n\nDisc jockey [[Alan Freed]] had played a role in the transformation of black [[rhythm and blues]] into [[rock and roll]] music, and originally called himself the \"Moon Dog\" after [[New York City]] [[Busking|street musician]] [[Moondog]]. Freed both adopted this name and used a recorded howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character. Smith's adaptation of the Moondog theme was to call himself Wolfman Jack and add his own sound effects. The character was based in part on the manner and style of [[blues]]man [[Howlin' Wolf]]. It was at KCIJ in Shreveport, Louisiana that he first began to develop his famous alter ego Wolfman Jack. According to author Philip A. Lieberman, Smith's \"Wolfman\" persona \"derived from Smith's love of horror films and his shenanigans as a 'wolfman' with his two young nephews. The 'Jack' was added as a part of the 'hipster' lingo of the 1950s, as in 'Take a page from my book, Jack,' or the more popular, 'Hit the road, Jack.'\"<ref>Philip A. Lieberman, ''Radio's Morning Show Personalities: Early Hour Broadcasters and Deejays from the 1920s to the 1990s'' (McFarland & Company, 1996), p. 58.</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Smith took his act to the border when the Inter-American Radio Advertising's Ramon Bosquez hired him and sent him to the studio and transmitter site of [[XERF-AM]] at [[Ciudad Acu\u00f1a]] in Mexico, a station whose high-powered [[border blaster]] signal could be picked up across much of the United States. In an interview with writer [[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]], Smith described the reach of the XERF signal: \"We had the most powerful signal in North America. Birds dropped dead when they flew too close to the tower. A car driving from New York to L.A. would never lose the station.\"<ref>[[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]]. ''On the Border: Portraits of America\u2019s Southwestern Frontier'', pp. 84\u201385.</ref> Most of the border stations broadcast at 250,000 watts, five times the U.S. limit, meaning that their signals were picked up all over North America, and at night as far away as Europe and the Soviet Union. It was at XERF that Smith developed his signature style (with phrases like \"Who's this on the Wolfman telephone?\") and widespread fame. The border stations made money by renting time to Pentecostal preachers and psychics, and by taking 50 percent of the profit from anything sold by mail order. The Wolfman did pitches for dog food, weight-loss pills, weight-gain pills, rose bushes, and baby chicks. There was even a pill called Florex, which was supposed to enhance one's sex drive. \"Some zing for your [[Water caltrop|ling nuts]],\" the Wolfman would say.<ref>Wes Smith, ''The Pied Pipers of Rock 'n' Roll'' (Longstreet Press, 1989), p. 272.</ref>\n\nThat sales pitch was typical of Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style.  In the spirit of his character name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to \"get naked\" or \"lay your hands on the radio and squeeze my knobs\".  Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast had no idea how to recognize the face behind the voice that said things like \"Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!\"\n\n[[XEPRS-AM|XERB]] was the original call sign for the [[border blaster]] station in [[Rosarito Beach]], Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. The station boasted \"50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power\". That station continues to broadcast today with the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small [[strip mall]] on Third Avenue in [[Chula Vista]], [[California]]. It was not unlike the small broadcast studio depicted in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (which was filmed at [[KVTO|KRE]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]). It was located only ten minutes from the [[Tijuana]]\u2013[[San Diego]] border crossing. It was rumored that the Wolfman actually broadcast from this location during the early-to-mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to run station KUXL. Even though Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station.  Missing the excitement, however, he returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area in January 1966. The Wolfman recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be beamed across the U.S.<ref>Gene Fowler and Bill Crawford, ''Border Radio'' (Limelight Editions, 1990).</ref> It was during his time broadcasting on XERB that Smith met Don Kelley, who became his personal manager and business partner for more than 20 years. It was Kelley who saw the potential for Wolfman Jack to become more than a radio personality. Kelley started to work on a strategy to transform Smith from a cult figure to a mainstream entertainer in film, recordings, and television. He promoted Smith to the major media and formed enduring relationships with key journalists.\n\nIn 1971, the Mexican government decided that its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic citizens should not be subjected to proselytizing and banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80 percent of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station [[KBLA|KDAY]] 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. However, Smith capitalized on his fame by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock and roll [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually also marketed to [[oldies]] stations). He also appeared on [[Armed Forces Radio]] from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries.<ref>John A. Drobnicki, \"Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)\". in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 582.</ref> He was heard as far off as the Wild Coast, [[Transkei]], on a station based there, Capital Radio 604.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716045022/http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647|url-status=dead|title=Wolfman Jack in Africa, 1980. - BORDERBLASTING IN A BANTUSTAN|date=July 16, 2012|archivedate=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>  In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, The Wolfman was paid handsomely to join [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York in August 1973, the same month that ''American Graffiti'' premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers stating that the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], which had \"[[Cousin Brucie]]\" (Bruce Morrow). The ads proclaimed, \"Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered\", and thousands of small tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, \"Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack.\"<ref>Ben Fong-Torres, ''The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio'' (Miller Freeman Books, 1998), p. 142.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/30244852/Wolfman_Hits_the_Road_Jack |author=[[Paul Levinson]] |title=Wolfman Hits the Road, Jack |work=The Village Voice |date=July 4, 1976 |page=34}}</ref> After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984-1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family.<ref>James F. Mills, \"Wolfman Turns into Country Gentleman: N.C. Mansion Home to Rock 'n' Roll DJ\", ''Charlotte Observer'' (February 27, 1994), p. 8B.</ref>  In the 80s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.\n\nRecordings of Wolfman Jack's old shows were reintroduced to syndication a decade after his death and remain available to local stations, currently through Envision Networks as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.envisionnetworks.com/show/the-wolfman-jack-radio-show/|title=The Wolfman Jack Radio Show|work=Envision Networks|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Film, television, and music career==\nIn the early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies for rock bands at Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance, he looked a little different because he had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat \"ethnic\". Other times he had a big [[afro]] wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. His audience finally got a good look at him when he appeared in the 1969 film ''A Session with the Committee'', a montage of skits by the comedy troupe [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]].\n\nWolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett. Garrett helped record the album ''Boogie With The Wolfman'' by Wolfman Jack & the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. He was also responsible for engineering, producing, and assembling the band.<ref>Minnesota Rocked, Tom Tourville, 2nd Edition, 1983, LOCCC# 82-074566</ref> Wolfman Jack also released ''Wolfman Jack'' (1972) and ''Through the Ages'' (1973) on the [[Wooden Nickel Records|Wooden Nickel]] label.<ref>{{cite web| last = Callahan| first = Mike| last2 = Edwards| first2 = David| last3 = Eyries| first3 = Patrice| title = Wooden Nickel Album Discography| date = October 26, 2005| url = http://www.bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| accessdate = October 3, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100113140243/http://bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| archive-date = January 13, 2010| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, he appeared as himself in [[George Lucas]]'s second feature film ''[[American Graffiti]]''.

He lived on 12th Street and 4th Avenue and went to Manual Training High School in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] section. His parents divorced while he was a child. To help keep him out of trouble, his father bought him a large [[Trans-Oceanic]] radio, and Smith became an avid fan of R&B music and the disc jockeys who played it, including [[\"Jocko\" Henderson]] of Philadelphia, New York's \"Dr. Jive\" ([[Tommy Smalls]]), the \"Moon Dog\" from Cleveland, [[Alan Freed]], and Nashville's \"[[John R.]]\" Richbourg, who later became his mentor. After selling [[encyclopedia]]s and [[Fuller Brush Company|Fuller brushes]] door-to-door, Smith attended the National Academy of Broadcasting in [[Washington, D.C.]] After he graduated in 1960, he began working as \"Daddy Jules\" at [[WTJZ|WYOU]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. When the station format changed to \"beautiful music\", Smith became known as \"Roger Gordon and Music in Good Taste\". In 1962, he moved to country music station KCIJ/1050 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], as the station manager and morning disc jockey, \"Big Smith with the Records\". He married Lucy \"Lou\" Lamb in 1961, and they had two children.<ref>John A. Drobnicki, \"Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)\", in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 581.</ref>\n\nDisc jockey [[Alan Freed]] had played a role in the transformation of black [[rhythm and blues]] into [[rock and roll]] music, and originally called himself the \"Moon Dog\" after [[New York City]] [[Busking|street musician]] [[Moondog]]. Freed both adopted this name and used a recorded howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character. Smith's adaptation of the Moondog theme was to call himself Wolfman Jack and add his own sound effects. The character was based in part on the manner and style of [[blues]]man [[Howlin' Wolf]]. It was at KCIJ in Shreveport, Louisiana that he first began to develop his famous alter ego Wolfman Jack. According to author Philip A. Lieberman, Smith's \"Wolfman\" persona \"derived from Smith's love of horror films and his shenanigans as a 'wolfman' with his two young nephews. The 'Jack' was added as a part of the 'hipster' lingo of the 1950s, as in 'Take a page from my book, Jack,' or the more popular, 'Hit the road, Jack.'\"<ref>Philip A. Lieberman, ''Radio's Morning Show Personalities: Early Hour Broadcasters and Deejays from the 1920s to the 1990s'' (McFarland & Company, 1996), p. 58.</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Smith took his act to the border when the Inter-American Radio Advertising's Ramon Bosquez hired him and sent him to the studio and transmitter site of [[XERF-AM]] at [[Ciudad Acu\u00f1a]] in Mexico, a station whose high-powered [[border blaster]] signal could be picked up across much of the United States. In an interview with writer [[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]], Smith described the reach of the XERF signal: \"We had the most powerful signal in North America. Birds dropped dead when they flew too close to the tower. A car driving from New York to L.A. would never lose the station.\"<ref>[[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]]. ''On the Border: Portraits of America\u2019s Southwestern Frontier'', pp. 84\u201385.</ref> Most of the border stations broadcast at 250,000 watts, five times the U.S. limit, meaning that their signals were picked up all over North America, and at night as far away as Europe and the Soviet Union. It was at XERF that Smith developed his signature style (with phrases like \"Who's this on the Wolfman telephone?\") and widespread fame. The border stations made money by renting time to Pentecostal preachers and psychics, and by taking 50 percent of the profit from anything sold by mail order. The Wolfman did pitches for dog food, weight-loss pills, weight-gain pills, rose bushes, and baby chicks. There was even a pill called Florex, which was supposed to enhance one's sex drive. \"Some zing for your [[Water caltrop|ling nuts]],\" the Wolfman would say.<ref>Wes Smith, ''The Pied Pipers of Rock 'n' Roll'' (Longstreet Press, 1989), p. 272.</ref>\n\nThat sales pitch was typical of Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style.  In the spirit of his character name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to \"get naked\" or \"lay your hands on the radio and squeeze my knobs\".  Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast had no idea how to recognize the face behind the voice that said things like \"Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!\"\n\n[[XEPRS-AM|XERB]] was the original call sign for the [[border blaster]] station in [[Rosarito Beach]], Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. The station boasted \"50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power\". That station continues to broadcast today with the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small [[strip mall]] on Third Avenue in [[Chula Vista]], [[California]]. It was not unlike the small broadcast studio depicted in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (which was filmed at [[KVTO|KRE]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]). It was located only ten minutes from the [[Tijuana]]\u2013[[San Diego]] border crossing. It was rumored that the Wolfman actually broadcast from this location during the early-to-mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to run station KUXL. Even though Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station.  Missing the excitement, however, he returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area in January 1966. The Wolfman recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be beamed across the U.S.<ref>Gene Fowler and Bill Crawford, ''Border Radio'' (Limelight Editions, 1990).</ref> It was during his time broadcasting on XERB that Smith met Don Kelley, who became his personal manager and business partner for more than 20 years. It was Kelley who saw the potential for Wolfman Jack to become more than a radio personality. Kelley started to work on a strategy to transform Smith from a cult figure to a mainstream entertainer in film, recordings, and television. He promoted Smith to the major media and formed enduring relationships with key journalists.\n\nIn 1971, the Mexican government decided that its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic citizens should not be subjected to proselytizing and banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80 percent of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station [[KBLA|KDAY]] 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. However, Smith capitalized on his fame by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock and roll [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually also marketed to [[oldies]] stations). He also appeared on [[Armed Forces Radio]] from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries.<ref>John A. Drobnicki, \"Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)\". in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 582.</ref> He was heard as far off as the Wild Coast, [[Transkei]], on a station based there, Capital Radio 604.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716045022/http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647|url-status=dead|title=Wolfman Jack in Africa, 1980. - BORDERBLASTING IN A BANTUSTAN|date=July 16, 2012|archivedate=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>  In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, The Wolfman was paid handsomely to join [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York in August 1973, the same month that ''American Graffiti'' premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers stating that the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], which had \"[[Cousin Brucie]]\" (Bruce Morrow). The ads proclaimed, \"Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered\", and thousands of small tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, \"Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack.\"<ref>Ben Fong-Torres, ''The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio'' (Miller Freeman Books, 1998), p. 142.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/30244852/Wolfman_Hits_the_Road_Jack |author=[[Paul Levinson]] |title=Wolfman Hits the Road, Jack |work=The Village Voice |date=July 4, 1976 |page=34}}</ref> After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984-1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family.<ref>James F. Mills, \"Wolfman Turns into Country Gentleman: N.C. Mansion Home to Rock 'n' Roll DJ\", ''Charlotte Observer'' (February 27, 1994), p. 8B.</ref>  In the 80s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.\n\nRecordings of Wolfman Jack's old shows were reintroduced to syndication a decade after his death and remain available to local stations, currently through Envision Networks as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.envisionnetworks.com/show/the-wolfman-jack-radio-show/|title=The Wolfman Jack Radio Show|work=Envision Networks|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Film, television, and music career==\nIn the early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies for rock bands at Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance, he looked a little different because he had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat \"ethnic\". Other times he had a big [[afro]] wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. His audience finally got a good look at him when he appeared in the 1969 film ''A Session with the Committee'', a montage of skits by the comedy troupe [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]].\n\nWolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett. Garrett helped record the album ''Boogie With The Wolfman'' by Wolfman Jack & the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. He was also responsible for engineering, producing, and assembling the band.<ref>Minnesota Rocked, Tom Tourville, 2nd Edition, 1983, LOCCC# 82-074566</ref> Wolfman Jack also released ''Wolfman Jack'' (1972) and ''Through the Ages'' (1973) on the [[Wooden Nickel Records|Wooden Nickel]] label.<ref>{{cite web| last = Callahan| first = Mike| last2 = Edwards| first2 = David| last3 = Eyries| first3 = Patrice| title = Wooden Nickel Album Discography| date = October 26, 2005| url = http://www.bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| accessdate = October 3, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100113140243/http://bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| archive-date = January 13, 2010| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, he appeared as himself in [[George Lucas]]'s second feature film ''[[American Graffiti]]''.

{"title_page": "Holotomography", "text_new": "'''Holotomography''' (HT) is a laser technique to measure three-dimensional [[refractive index]] (RI) tomogram of a microscopic sample such as biological cells and tissues. Because the RI can serve as an intrinsic imaging contrast for transparent or phase objects, measurements of RI tomograms can provide label-free quantitative imaging of microscopic phase objects. In order to measure 3-D RI tomogram of samples, HT employs the principle of holographic imaging and inverse scattering. Typically, multiple 2D holographic images of a sample are measured at various illumination angles, employing the principle of interferometric imaging. Then, a 3D RI tomogram of the sample is reconstructed from these multiple 2D holographic images by inversely solving light scattering in the sample.\n\nThe principle of HT is very similar to X-ray computed tomography (CT) or [[CT scan]]. CT scan measures multiple 2-D X-ray images of a human body at various illumination angles, and a 3-D tomogram (X-ray absorptivity) is then retrieved via the inverse scattering theory. Both the X-ray CT and laser HT shares the same governing equation \u2013 [[Helmholtz equation]],  [[Wave equation|the wave equatio]]<nowiki/>n for a monochromatic wavelength. HT is also known as optical diffraction tomography.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lauer|first=V|date=2002|title=New approach to optical diffraction tomography yielding a vector equation of diffraction tomography and a novel tomographic microscope|journal=Journal of Microscopy|volume=205|issue=2|pages=165\u2013176|doi=10.1046/j.0022-2720.2001.00980.x|pmid=11879431}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe first theoretical proposal was presented by Emil Wolf,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Emil|date=1969|title=Three-dimensional structure determination of semi-transparent objects from holographic data|url=|journal=Optics Communications|volume=1|issue=4|pages=153\u2013156|bibcode=1969OptCo...1..153W|doi=10.1016/0030-4018(69)90052-2}}</ref> and the first experimental demonstration was shown by Fercher et al.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fercher|first=A.F.|last2=Bartelt|first2=H.|last3=Becker|first3=H.|last4=Wiltschko|first4=E.|date=1979|title=Image formation by inversion of scattered field data: experiments and computational simulation|journal=Applied Optics|volume=18|issue=14|pages=2427\u201339|bibcode=1979ApOpt..18.2427F|doi=10.1364/AO.18.002427|pmid=20212679}}</ref> From 2000s, HT techniques had been extensively studied and applied to the field of biology and medicine, by several research groups including the MIT spectroscopy laboratory. Both the technical developments and applications of HT have been significantly advanced. During the mid 2010s, first commercial HT companies Nanolive and Tomocube were founded.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe applications of HT includes    \n[[File:3D RI image of a live cell.gif|thumb|3D RI tomogram of a live cell (macrophage)]]\n\n=== Cell biology ===\nHT provides 3D dynamic images of live cells and thin tissues without using exogenous labeling agents such as fluorescence proteins or dyes. HT enables quantitative live cell imaging, and also provides quantitative information such as cell volume, surface area, protein concentration. HT provides following advantages over conventional 3D microscopic techniques.  \n# Label-free: Cellular membrane and subcellular organelles can clearly be imaged without using exogenous labeling agents.

Because the RI can serve as an intrinsic imaging contrast for transparent or phase objects, measurements of RI tomograms can provide label-free quantitative imaging of microscopic phase objects. In order to measure 3-D RI tomogram of samples, HT employs the principle of holographic imaging and inverse scattering. Typically, multiple 2D holographic images of a sample are measured at various illumination angles, employing the principle of interferometric imaging. Then, a 3D RI tomogram of the sample is reconstructed from these multiple 2D holographic images by inversely solving light scattering in the sample.\n\nThe principle of HT is very similar to X-ray computed tomography (CT) or [[CT scan]]. CT scan measures multiple 2-D X-ray images of a human body at various illumination angles, and a 3-D tomogram (X-ray absorptivity) is then retrieved via the inverse scattering theory. Both the X-ray CT and laser HT shares the same governing equation \u2013 [[Helmholtz equation]],  [[Wave equation|the wave equatio]]<nowiki/>n for a monochromatic wavelength.
