It was a black-white-green horizontal flag, with a red triangle extending from the mast side, inspired by the [[flag of the Arab Revolt]]. It was soon changed to a new version with a red trapezoid replacing the triangle and two seven-point white stars on denoting the two principal peoples of the kingdom: the [[Arabs]] and the [[Kurds]]. Both designs also reflected the newly installed [[Hashemite]] Dynasty in Iraq (originally from [[Hejaz]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]), who had played a leading role in the [[Arab Revolt]]. As such, it was similar to the flags of Hashemite [[flag of Jordan|Jordan]], and the short-lived [[Kingdom of Hejaz]].<ref>http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Iraq.htm</ref><ref>http://www.vexilla-mundi.com/iraq_history.html</ref> The new flag continued to be used in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]].\n\n===1958===\n{{main|Flag of the Arab Federation}}\n[[File:Flag of the Arab Federation.svg|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical}}January 1, 1958 \u2013 August 22, 1958 (ratio: 1:2)]]\n\nIn 1958, in response to the merger of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] in the [[United Arab Republic]], the two Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and [[Jordan]] established the [[Arab Federation]], a confederation of the two states.

The black, white, green, and red are the [[pan-Arab colours]], representing [[pan-Arabism]], while the yellow sun represented the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] minority.

This horizontal tricolour of red, white, and black bands (first used in the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]) formed the basis of the flag of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR). Though the UAR broke up in 1961, hopes for Arab unity persisted. As such, whereas the UAR flag had two green stars in the white band, signifying its two members ([[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]), the new Iraqi flag had three stars, symbolising the aspiration that Iraq would join with Egypt and Syria in a new union. Sharing this goal, Syria adopted the new Iraqi flag as its own later that same year. This remained the [[flag of Syria]] until 1971, when the green stars were replaced by the [[Hawk of Qureish]] as the [[Coat of arms of Syria]]. \n\nThe Iraqi Flag Law No. 28 of 1963 was replaced by Flag Law No. 33 of 1986, during the presidency of [[Saddam Hussein]], in which although the flag remained the same, the meaning of the three stars was changed from their original geographic meaning to representations of the three tenets of the [[Ba'ath Party]] motto: ''{{transl|ar|wahda, hurriyah, ishtirakiyah}}'' (unity, freedom and socialism).{{-}}\n\n===1991\u20132004===\n[[File:Flag of Iraq (1991-2004).svg|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical}}{{IFIS|Equal}} January 13, 1991 \u2013 August 5, 2004 (ratio: 2:3)]]\n\nOn 13 January 1991, the flag was modified by Flag Law No. 6 of 1991.

Strong speculation followed that the U.S. government would press for a change in the Iraqi flag to remove its pan-Arab symbolism, and to make a definitive break with the period of Ba'athist rule. To a degree, this view was shared by some groups in Iraq. In addition to some displeasure among Iraqis who had suffered under Saddam Hussein to retaining national symbols used by his government, there was also strong aversion to the flag from Iraq's Kurdish minority, who resented its evocation of pan-Arabism. However, Iraqi opponents of changing the flag argued that since the flag had been used since 1963, long before Saddam Hussein's presidency, it was unfair to characterise it as a \"Saddamist\" flag. They also stressed that pan-Arabism has been a dominant popular principle among Iraqi's majority population for decades prior to Iraqi independence in 1932.\n\nOn 26 April 2004 the U.S.-appointed [[Iraqi Governing Council]] (IGC) announced a new flag for post-Saddam Iraq. The IGC stated that, from around 30 competing entries, it had chosen a design by the distinguished Iraqi artist-architect [[Rifat Chadirji]], who lives in London, and is a brother of a member of the IGC.\n\nThe proposed flag had several meanings:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Symbol\n! Meaning\n|-\n| White background\n| Purity\n|-\n| Two blue bands\n| The blue bands represent the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] rivers.\n|-\n| Yellow band\n| Kurdish minority. The [[flag of Kurdistan]] features a yellow sun.\n|-\n| Blue crescent\n| The [[Star and crescent|crescent]] represents [[Islam]].<br/>The shade of blue represents [[Iraqi Turkmens]].\n|}\n\nThe design marked a notable break with the three flags of modern Iraqi history (namely the Arab Revolt-inspired flag of the Kingdom, the flag introduced by Abdul Karim Qassim, and the Arab Liberation inspired flag of 1963), all of which were based on the four [[pan-Arab colours]]. Indeed, of these colours, only white was represented in the IGC design. Moreover, Islamic crescents are usually depicted in green or red in Arab heraldry. The proposed change provoked an intensely negative reaction across groups of Iraq's Arab majority, including those vehemently opposed to Saddam Hussein. Those opposed to the U.S. occupation, including [[Shi'a]] cleric [[Muqtada Al-Sadr]], decried the design as an attempt by the U.S. government to strip Iraq of its identity, and its historically prominent role in the [[Arab world]]. In particular, critics lamented the proposed abandonment of the Arab Liberation Flag, the omission of the traditional colors of [[pan-Arabism]], and the removal of the ''takb\u012br''.\n\nAdditionally, the new flag's predominantly blue-on-white appearance immediately antagonised many in Iraq because of its alleged resemblance to the [[flag of Israel|flag of the State of Israel]], considered [[Iraq\u2013Israel relations|hostile to Iraq]] since the former's establishment in 1948.\n\nThe new flag was reported to have been [[Flag desecration#Iraq|burned by insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] on 27 April 2004, the day before its planned official adoption.\n\nOn 28 April 2004, IGC President [[Massoud Barzani]] formally presented a modified version of the flag in which the originally very light shade of blue as reported by the press on 26 April 2004 had been changed to a darker tone. It was unclear whether this was a change made because of the protests made against the original design or, as the Council claimed, a rectification of printing errors in the earlier news reports. Barzani also explained that the flag was a temporary design, to be used over the ensuing months until the adoption of a definitive flag.\n\nIn the face of the overwhelming public outcry, adoption of the blue crescent flag was abandoned entirely.{{-}}\n\n===2008 flag proposal===\n[[File:Proposed flag of Iraq (first proposal, 2008).svg|thumb|right|{{IFIS|Equal}} First proposal, 2008]]\nDespite the compromise in 2004, opposition to the flag persisted from Kurdish groups. In January 2008, a new design was proposed, removing the three green stars, instead placing a green eight pointed star around a yellow circle in the middle of the ''takb\u012br'', which is written in the Kufic script and prized as a Mesopotamian Arabic style, having originated in Iraq.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18049763 | title=Iraq to Restore Former Baath Party Followers | last=Garrels | first=Anne | accessdate=2008-01-24 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | date=2008-01-12 }}</ref>{{-}}\n\n===2008 flag contest===\n[[File:Proposed flag of Iraq (second proposal, 2008).svg|thumb|{{IFIS|Equal}} Second proposal, 2008]]\nIn July 2008, the Iraqi parliament launched a contest to design a new Iraqi flag. The contest ran until September 2008, with 50 designs submitted.

It was a black-white-green horizontal flag, with a red triangle extending from the mast side, inspired by the [[flag of the Arab Revolt]]. It was soon changed to a new version with a red trapezoid replacing the triangle and two seven-point white stars on denoting the two principal peoples of the kingdom: the [[Arabs]] and the [[Kurds]]. Both designs also reflected the newly installed [[Hashemite]] Dynasty in Iraq (originally from [[Hejaz]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]), who had played a leading role in the [[Arab Revolt]]. As such, it was similar to the flags of Hashemite [[flag of Jordan|Jordan]], and the short-lived [[Kingdom of Hejaz]].<ref>http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Iraq.htm</ref><ref>http://www.vexilla-mundi.com/iraq_history.html</ref> The new flag continued to be used in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]].\n\n===1958===\n{{main|Flag of the Arab Federation}}\n[[File:Flag of the Arab Federation.svg|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical}}January 1, 1958 \u2013 August 22, 1958 (ratio: 1:2)]]\n\nIn 1958, in response to the merger of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] in the [[United Arab Republic]], the two Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and [[Jordan]] established the [[Arab Federation]], a confederation of the two states.

This horizontal tricolour of red, white, and black bands (first used in the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]) formed the basis of the flag of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR). Though the UAR broke up in 1961, hopes for Arab unity persisted. As such, whereas the UAR flag had two green stars in the white band, signifying its two members ([[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]), the new Iraqi flag had three stars, symbolising the aspiration that Iraq would join with Egypt and Syria in a new union. Sharing this goal, Syria adopted the new Iraqi flag as its own later that same year. This remained the [[flag of Syria]] until 1971, when the green stars were replaced by the [[Hawk of Qureish]] as the [[Coat of arms of Syria]]. \n\nThe Iraqi Flag Law No. 28 of 1963 was replaced by Flag Law No. 33 of 1986, during the presidency of [[Saddam Hussein]], in which although the flag remained the same, the meaning of the three stars was changed from their original geographic meaning to representations of the three tenets of the [[Ba'ath Party]] motto: ''{{transl|ar|wahda, hurriyah, ishtirakiyah}}'' (unity, freedom and socialism).{{-}}\n\n===1991\u20132004===\n[[File:Flag of Iraq (1991-2004).svg|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical}}{{IFIS|Equal}} January 13, 1991 \u2013 August 5, 2004 (ratio: 2:3)]]\n\nOn 13 January 1991, the flag was modified by Flag Law No. 6 of 1991.

Strong speculation followed that the U.S. government would press for a change in the Iraqi flag to remove its pan-Arab symbolism, and to make a definitive break with the period of Ba'athist rule. To a degree, this view was shared by some groups in Iraq. In addition to some displeasure among Iraqis who had suffered under Saddam Hussein to retaining national symbols used by his government, there was also strong aversion to the flag from Iraq's Kurdish minority, who resented its evocation of pan-Arabism. However, Iraqi opponents of changing the flag argued that since the flag had been used since 1963, long before Saddam Hussein's presidency, it was unfair to characterise it as a \"Saddamist\" flag. They also stressed that pan-Arabism has been a dominant popular principle among Iraqi's majority population for decades prior to Iraqi independence in 1932.\n\nOn 26 April 2004 the U.S.-appointed [[Iraqi Governing Council]] (IGC) announced a new flag for post-Saddam Iraq. The IGC stated that, from around 30 competing entries, it had chosen a design by the distinguished Iraqi artist-architect [[Rifat Chadirji]], who lives in London, and is a brother of a member of the IGC.\n\nThe proposed flag had several meanings:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Symbol\n! Meaning\n|-\n| White background\n| Purity\n|-\n| Two blue bands\n| The blue bands represent the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] rivers.\n|-\n| Yellow band\n| Kurdish minority. The [[flag of Kurdistan]] features a yellow sun.\n|-\n| Blue crescent\n| The [[Star and crescent|crescent]] represents [[Islam]].<br/>The shade of blue represents [[Iraqi Turkmens]].\n|}\n\nThe design marked a notable break with the three flags of modern Iraqi history (namely the Arab Revolt-inspired flag of the Kingdom, the flag introduced by Abdul Karim Qassim, and the Arab Liberation inspired flag of 1963), all of which were based on the four [[pan-Arab colours]]. Indeed, of these colours, only white was represented in the IGC design. Moreover, Islamic crescents are usually depicted in green or red in Arab heraldry. The proposed change provoked an intensely negative reaction across groups of Iraq's Arab majority, including those vehemently opposed to Saddam Hussein. Those opposed to the U.S. occupation, including [[Shi'a]] cleric [[Muqtada Al-Sadr]], decried the design as an attempt by the U.S. government to strip Iraq of its identity, and its historically prominent role in the [[Arab world]]. In particular, critics lamented the proposed abandonment of the Arab Liberation Flag, the omission of the traditional colors of [[pan-Arabism]], and the removal of the ''takb\u012br''.\n\nAdditionally, the new flag's predominantly blue-on-white appearance immediately antagonised many in Iraq because of its alleged resemblance to the [[flag of Israel|flag of the State of Israel]], considered [[Iraq\u2013Israel relations|hostile to Iraq]] since the former's establishment in 1948.\n\nThe new flag was reported to have been [[Flag desecration#Iraq|burned by insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] on 27 April 2004, the day before its planned official adoption.\n\nOn 28 April 2004, IGC President [[Massoud Barzani]] formally presented a modified version of the flag in which the originally very light shade of blue as reported by the press on 26 April 2004 had been changed to a darker tone. It was unclear whether this was a change made because of the protests made against the original design or, as the Council claimed, a rectification of printing errors in the earlier news reports. Barzani also explained that the flag was a temporary design, to be used over the ensuing months until the adoption of a definitive flag.\n\nIn the face of the overwhelming public outcry, adoption of the blue crescent flag was abandoned entirely.{{-}}\n\n===2008 flag proposal===\n[[File:Proposed flag of Iraq (first proposal, 2008).svg|thumb|right|{{IFIS|Equal}} First proposal, 2008]]\nDespite the compromise in 2004, opposition to the flag persisted from Kurdish groups. In January 2008, a new design was proposed, removing the three green stars, instead placing a green eight pointed star around a yellow circle in the middle of the ''takb\u012br'', which is written in the Kufic script and prized as a Mesopotamian Arabic style, having originated in Iraq.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18049763 | title=Iraq to Restore Former Baath Party Followers | last=Garrels | first=Anne | accessdate=2008-01-24 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | date=2008-01-12 }}</ref>{{-}}\n\n===2008 flag contest===\n[[File:Proposed flag of Iraq (second proposal, 2008).svg|thumb|{{IFIS|Equal}} Second proposal, 2008]]\nIn July 2008, the Iraqi parliament launched a contest to design a new Iraqi flag.
