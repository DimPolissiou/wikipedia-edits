In 1961 he proclaimed the founding of the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]], and continued as its prime minister from 1961 until his assassination in 1966 by [[Dimitri Tsafendas]].\n\nVerwoerd was an authoritarian, socially conservative leader and an [[Afrikaner nationalist]]. His goal in founding the Republic of South Africa, thereby leaving the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], was to preserve [[minority rule]] by white Afrikaners over the various non-white ethnic groups, including [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], [[Coloureds|Coloured]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] people, who were the majority of South Africa's population. To that end, he greatly expanded [[apartheid]], the system of forced classification and segregation by race that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nVerwoerd characterised apartheid as merely \"good-neighbourliness\", but its practical effects have been widely condemned, then and since, as a form of racism. Decisions that Prime Minister Verwoerd made in the areas of legislation, law enforcement and public policy caused almost the entire non-white population of South Africa to be disenfranchised, lose civil rights, and suffer from [[discrimination based on skin color]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hendrik-Frensch-Verwoerd|title=Hendrik Verwoerd {{!}} prime minister of South Africa|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=7 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica\"/>\n\nVerwoerd heavily repressed the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], ordering the detention and imprisonment of tens of thousands of people and the exile of further thousands, while greatly empowering, modernising and enlarging the security forces and army.{{dubious|date=March 2019}} Black-dominated political organisations such as the [[African National Congress]] and the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] were banned under Verwoerd, and future-president of South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], were prosecuted for sabotage in the [[Rivonia Trial]].<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">[https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/11/guardianobituaries.davidberesford?commentpage=1 \"Obituary: Long-jailed assassin of South African premier\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 October 1999.

These actions prompted the passing of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761]], condemning apartheid, and ultimately leading to international isolation and [[economic sanctions against South Africa]]. On 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was stabbed several times by parliamentary aide [[Dimitri Tsafendas]]; he died shortly after and Tsafendas was jailed until his death in 1999.\n\n== Early life ==\nHendrik Verwoerd was born in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in 1901. Verwoerd is South Africa's only foreign-born prime minister. He was the second child of Anje Strik and Wilhelmus Johannes Verwoerd. Hendrik Verwoerd had an elder brother named Leendert and a younger sister named Lucie. His father was a shopkeeper and a deeply religious man who decided to move his family to South Africa in 1903 because of his sympathy towards the Afrikaner nation in the wake of the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nVerwoerd went to a [[Lutheran]] primary school in [[Wynberg, Cape Town]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grobbelaar|first=Pieter Willem|title=This was a Man|year=1967|publisher=Human & Rousseau|page=13}}</ref> By the end of 1912, the Verwoerd family moved to [[Bulawayo]], [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesia]], where his father became an assistant evangelist in the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|Dutch Reformed Church]]. Verwoerd attended [[Milton High School, Bulawayo|Milton High School]] where he was awarded the Beit Scholarship, established by diamond magnate and financier [[Alfred Beit]]. Verwoerd received the top marks for English literature in the whole of Rhodesia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grobbelaar|title=This was a Man|year=1967|publisher=|page=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1917, the family moved back to South Africa since the congregation in Bulawayo had appointed a second minister of religion. His father took up a position in the church in [[Brandfort]], [[Orange Free State]]. Due to the worldwide [[Spanish flu]] epidemic, the younger Verwoerd only sat for his matriculation exams in February 1919, achieving first position in the Orange Free State and fifth in South Africa.<ref>Beyers, C. J. (1981). ''Dictionary of South African Biography'', Vol. 4, Durban: Butterworth, pp. 730\u201340; P. W. Grobbelaar, Man van die Volk, 13\u201315 (1966).</ref>\n\nAfter his schooling, Verwoerd proceeded to study theology at the [[University of Stellenbosch]]. He was regarded as a brilliant student and known to possess a nearly photographic memory. He was also a member of a debating club as well as a hiking club and participated in theatre productions. Verwoerd graduated with honours in 1921. Verwoerd applied for admission to the Theology School. However, he was required to submit a reference from the minister of religion from his home town, Brandfort, on his suitability for such studies. Since the latter did not know him personally, but the university insisted that he should first recommend Verwoerd, Verwoerd withdrew his application for admission{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\nHe then continued to study psychology and philosophy. He was awarded a master's degree cum laude the next year. During this time he also served on the students' council together with [[Betsie Schoombie]], later his wife, and was its president in 1923. He completed his doctorate in 1924, also cum laude. The title of his thesis was \"Thought Processes and the Problem of Values\".<ref>{{cite book |first=G. |last=Allighan |title=Verwoerd \u2013 The End |page=xvi |year=1961 |publisher=Purnell and Sons (SA) (Pty) Ltd }}</ref>\n\nVerwoerd was awarded two scholarships for further post-doctoral studies abroad\u2014one by the Abe Bailey Trust to study at the [[University of Oxford]], England, and another one to continue his studies in Germany. He opted for the latter, although it was not financially as generous, because he wanted to study under a number of famous German professors of the time. Verwoerd left for Germany in 1926, and proceeded to study psychology at the [[University of Hamburg]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. In Hamburg he studied under [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]], in Berlin under [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] and [[Otto Lipmann]], and in Leipzig under [[Felix Krueger]].

Later that year, he continued his studies in the United Kingdom, and then proceeded to the United States. His lecture notes and memoranda at [[Stellenbosch University]] stressed that there were no biological differences between the big racial groups, and concluded that \"this was not really a factor in the development of a higher social civilisation by the Caucasians.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Joyce |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Dictionary of South African Biography |location=Cape Town |publisher=Francolin |pages=275\u2013276 |isbn=1-86859-037-2 }}</ref>\n\n== Return to South Africa ==\nVerwoerd returned with his wife to South Africa in 1928 and was appointed to the chair of Applied Psychology and Psycho Technique at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] where, six years later, he became Professor of Sociology and Social Work. During the [[Great Depression]], Verwoerd became active in social work among poor white South Africans. He devoted much attention to welfare work and was often consulted by welfare organisations, while he served on numerous committees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAfrikaans politics from 1910 to 1948 were divided between the \"liberals\" such as Jan Smuts who argued for a reconciliation with Britain vs. the \"extremists\" who had neither forgotten nor forgiven the British for the Boer War.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick 1989 p. 87\">Brogan, Patrick (1989).

Malan's [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] (HNP) concluded an election pact with the Afrikaner Party in 1947. They won the elections with a very narrow majority of five seats in Parliament, although they only got 40 percent of the voter support. This was due to the loaded constituencies in cities, which was to the advantage of rural constituencies. The nine Afrikaner Party MPs thus made it possible for Malan's HNP to form a coalition government with the Afrikaner Party of [[Nicolaas Havenga|Klasie Havenga]]. The two parties amalgamated in 1951 as the National Party although Havenga was not comfortable with NP policy to remove coloured voters from the common voters' roll.\n\nRunning on the platform of self-determination and apartheid as it was termed for the first time, Prime Minister [[Daniel Malan]] and his party benefited from their support in the rural electorates, defeating General [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]] and his United Party. General Smuts lost his own seat of [[Standerton]]. Most party leaders agreed that the nationalist policies were responsible for the National Party's victory. To further cement their nationalist policies, Herenigde Nasionale Party leader Daniel Malan called for stricter enforcement of job reservation protecting the rights of the White working class, and the rights of White workers to organise their own labour unions outside of company control.\n\nVerwoerd was elected to the [[South African Senate]] later that year, and became the minister of native affairs under Prime Minister Malan in 1950, until his appointment as prime minister in 1958. In that position, he helped to implement the Nationalist Party's programme.<ref name=\"Lentz\" />\n\nAmong the laws which were drawn and enacted during Verwoerd's time as minister for native affairs were the [[Population Registration Act]] and the [[Group Areas Act]] in 1950, the [[Pass Laws Act]] of 1952 and the [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act]] of 1953. Verwoerd wrote the Bantu Education Act, which was to have a deleterious effect on the ability of black South Africans to be educated as Verwoerd himself noted that the purpose of the Bantu Education Act was to ensure that blacks would have only just enough education to work as unskilled laborers.<ref name=Gross2008>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=D. |date=14 September 2016 |title=How Should South Africa Remember the Architect of Apartheid? |publisher=Smithsonian |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-should-south-africa-remember-architect-apartheid-180960449/ |accessdate=29 May 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Bantu Education Act ensured that black South Africans had only the barest minimal of education, thus entrenching the role of blacks in the apartheid economy as a cheap source of unskilled labor. In June 1954, Verwoerd in a speech stated: \u201cThe Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects. There is no place for him in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour. Within his own community, however, all doors are open\".<ref name=Gross2008 />\n\nOne black South African woman who worked as an anti-apartheid activist, Nomavenda Mathiane, in particular criticized Verwoerd for the Bantu Education Act of 1953, which caused generations of black South Africans to suffer an inferior education, saying: \"After white people had taken the land, after white people had impoverished us in South Africa, the only way out of our poverty was through education. And he came up with the idea of giving us an inferior education.\"<ref name=Gross2008 />\n\n==Prime minister==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nPrime Minister [[Daniel Malan]] announced his retirement from politics following the National Party's success in the [[1953 South African general election|elections of 1953]]. In the succession debate that followed Malan's retirement in 1954, [[N. C. Havenga]], and J. G. Strijdom were potential successors. The Young Turks of the Transvaal got the upper hand and thus [[J. G. Strijdom]] was elected as the new leader of the National Party, who succeeded Malan as Prime Minister.\n\nVerwoerd gradually gained popularity with the Afrikaner electorate and continued to expand his political support. With his overwhelming constituency victory in the 1958 election and the death shortly thereafter of Prime Minister J. G. Strijdom, Verwoerd was nominated together with Eben D\u00f6nges and C. R. Swart from the Free State as candidates to head the party. Verwoerd got the most votes in the second round and thus succeeded Strijdom as Prime Minister.\n\n==Apartheid==\n{{Apartheid}}\nHendrik Verwoerd is often called the architect of [[apartheid]] for his role in shaping the implementation of apartheid policy when he was minister of native affairs and then prime minister.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Catherine M.|title=Performing South Africa's Truth Commission: Stages of Transition|year=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-22145-2|pages=31, 226}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Thomas M.|title=Encyclopedia of the Developing World|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Routledge/Taylor & Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-97662-6|page=1661}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=Annie E.|title=History after Apartheid: Visual Culture and Public Memory in a Democratic South Africa |year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8223-3060-1|page=22}}</ref> Verwoerd once described apartheid as a \"policy of good neighbourliness\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=320&Itemid=44 |title=Culture, Communication and Media Studies \u2013 Freedom Square-Back to the Future |publisher=Ccms.ukzn.ac.za |accessdate=16 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822201544/http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=320&Itemid=44 |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the NP came to power in 1948, there were factional differences in the party about the implementation of systemic racial segregation.

A second faction were the \"purists\", who believed in \"vertical segregation\", in which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term.

In January 1960, Verwoerd announced that a referendum would be called to determine the republican issue, the objective being a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Two weeks later, [[Harold Macmillan]], then British Prime Minister, visited South Africa.\n\nIn an address to both Houses of Parliament, Macmillan gave his famous [[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change]] speech, which was interpreted as an end to British support for white rule. This speech, which implicitly criticized apartheid together with the worldwide criticism following the [[Sharpeville massacre]], created a \"siege mentality\" in South Africa, which Verwoerd seized upon to booster his case for a republic, presenting Elizabeth II as the ruler of a hostile power.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick 1989 p. 88\">Brogan, Patrick (1989).

''The Fighting Never Stopped'' Vintage Books. p.92</ref>\n\nIn order to bolster support for a republic, the voting age for whites was lowered from 21 to 18, benefiting younger Afrikaans speakers, who were more likely to favour a republic, and the franchise was extended to whites in [[South-West Africa]], most of whom were German or [[Afrikaans]] speakers. This was done even though [[English South African]]s were slightly outnumbered by Afrikaners. The vast majority of English-South Africans were against South Africa becoming a republic and were still loyal to the British Crown.\n\nThe [[1960 South Africa referendum]] was accepted by Parliament.<ref>Osada, Masako (2002).

Their last Olympic Games\u2014until the abolition of apartheid\u2014was in 1960, South Africa was expelled from FIFA in 1976, and whenever South African teams did participate in sports, protests and disruptions were the result. When supporters of South Africa decried their exclusion, the usual response was: \"Who started it?\", in reference to Verwoerd.\n\n== First assassination attempt ==\n[[File:Assassination attempt on Hendrik Verwoerd 2.jpg|thumb|[[David Pratt (assassin)|David Pratt]] is overpowered after he shoots Hendrik Verwoerd]]\nOn 9 April 1960, Verwoerd opened the Union Exposition in Milner Park, Johannesburg, to mark the jubilee of the [[Union of South Africa]]. After Verwoerd delivered his opening address, [[David Pratt (assassin)|David Pratt]], a rich English businessman and farmer from the Magaliesberg, near Pretoria, attempted to assassinate Verwoerd, firing two shots from a [[.22 caliber|.22]] pistol at point-blank range, one bullet perforating Verwoerd's right cheek and the second his right ear.\n\nColonel G. M. Harrison, president of the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society, leapt up and knocked the pistol from the gunman's hand. After the pistol fell to the floor, Harrison, with the help of Major Carl Richter, the Prime Minister's personal bodyguard, civilians and another policeman overpowered the gunman. He was taken to the Marshall Square police station and later transferred to the Forensic Medical Laboratory due to his peculiar behaviour.\n\nWithin minutes of the assassination attempt, Verwoerd\u2014still conscious and blood gushing from his face\u2014was rushed to the nearby Johannesburg Hospital. Two days later, the hospital issued a statement which described his condition as 'indeed satisfactory\u2014further examinations were carried out today and they confirm good expectations. Dr. Verwoerd at present is restful. There is no need for any immediate operation.' Once his condition stabilised, Verwoerd was transferred to a Pretoria Hospital. The neurologists who treated Verwoerd later stated that his escape had been 'absolutely miraculous'.<ref>Allan Bird, ''Bird on a wing'', 205 (1992).</ref> Specialist surgeons were called in to remove the bullets. At first, there was speculation that Verwoerd would lose his hearing and sense of balance, but this was to prove groundless. He returned to public life on 29 May, less than two months after the shooting.\n\nDavid Pratt was initially held under the emergency regulations, declared on 30 March 1960, nine days after the [[Sharpeville massacre]] and shortly after Verwoerd received a death threat with a red note reading, \"Today we kill Verwoerd\".<ref>\"Verwoerd knew of threats but did not withdraw.\" ''The Star'', 11 April 1960.</ref> Pratt appeared for a preliminary hearing in the Johannesburg Magistrates' Court on 20 and 21 July 1960, once it was clear that the attempt was not fatal.<ref>\"Aanslag: Nuwe stap met gearresteerde.

However, in his defence, he stated he only wanted to injure, not kill, Verwoerd. The court accepted the medical reports submitted to it by five different psychiatrists, all of which confirmed that Pratt lacked legal capacity and could not be held criminally liable for having shot the prime minister. On 26 September 1960, he was committed to a mental hospital in Bloemfontein. On 1 October 1961, his 53rd birthday, he committed suicide, shortly before parole was to be considered.<ref>Loammi Wolf, [http://www.litnet.co.za/Article/david-beresford-pratt-die-mens-agter-die-sluipmoordenaar ''David Beresford Pratt: die mens agter die sluipmoordpoging''], LitNet Akademies, vol. 9(3), 2012 (English summary); I.

As leader of South Africa's [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] he served as the last [[Prime Minister of South Africa|prime minister]] of the [[Union of South Africa]] from 1958 until 1961. In 1961 he proclaimed the founding of the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]], and continued as its prime minister from 1961 until his assassination in 1966 by [[Dimitri Tsafendas]].\n\nVerwoerd was an authoritarian, socially conservative leader and an [[Afrikaner nationalist]]. His goal in founding the Republic of South Africa, thereby leaving the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], was to preserve [[minority rule]] by white Afrikaners over the various non-white ethnic groups, including [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], [[Coloureds|Coloured]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] people, who were the majority of South Africa's population. To that end, he greatly expanded [[apartheid]], the system of forced classification and segregation by race that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nVerwoerd characterised apartheid as merely \"good-neighbourliness\", but its practical effects have been widely condemned, then and since, as a form of racism.

These actions prompted the passing of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761]], condemning apartheid, and ultimately leading to international isolation and [[economic sanctions against South Africa]]. On 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was stabbed several times by parliamentary aide [[Dimitri Tsafendas]]; he died shortly after and Tsafendas was jailed until his death in 1999.\n\n== Early life ==\nHendrik Verwoerd was born in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in 1901. Verwoerd is South Africa's only foreign-born prime minister. He was the second child of Anje Strik and Wilhelmus Johannes Verwoerd. Hendrik Verwoerd had an elder brother named Leendert and a younger sister named Lucie. His father was a shopkeeper and a deeply religious man who decided to move his family to South Africa in 1903 because of his sympathy towards the Afrikaner nation in the wake of the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nVerwoerd went to a [[Lutheran]] primary school in [[Wynberg, Cape Town]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grobbelaar|first=Pieter Willem|title=This was a Man|year=1967|publisher=Human & Rousseau|page=13}}</ref> By the end of 1912, the Verwoerd family moved to [[Bulawayo]], [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesia]], where his father became an assistant evangelist in the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|Dutch Reformed Church]]. Verwoerd attended [[Milton High School, Bulawayo|Milton High School]] where he was awarded the Beit Scholarship, established by diamond magnate and financier [[Alfred Beit]]. Verwoerd received the top marks for English literature in the whole of Rhodesia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grobbelaar|title=This was a Man|year=1967|publisher=|page=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1917, the family moved back to South Africa since the congregation in Bulawayo had appointed a second minister of religion. His father took up a position in the church in [[Brandfort]], [[Orange Free State]]. Due to the worldwide [[Spanish flu]] epidemic, the younger Verwoerd only sat for his matriculation exams in February 1919, achieving first position in the Orange Free State and fifth in South Africa.<ref>Beyers, C. J. (1981). ''Dictionary of South African Biography'', Vol. 4, Durban: Butterworth, pp. 730\u201340; P. W.

He was regarded as a brilliant student and known to possess a nearly photographic memory. He was also a member of a debating club as well as a hiking club and participated in theatre productions. Verwoerd graduated with honours in 1921. Verwoerd applied for admission to the Theology School. However, he was required to submit a reference from the minister of religion from his home town, Brandfort, on his suitability for such studies. Since the latter did not know him personally, but the university insisted that he should first recommend Verwoerd, Verwoerd withdrew his application for admission{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\nHe then continued to study psychology and philosophy. He was awarded a master's degree cum laude the next year. During this time he also served on the students' council together with [[Betsie Schoombie]], later his wife, and was its president in 1923. He completed his doctorate in 1924, also cum laude. The title of his thesis was \"Thought Processes and the Problem of Values\".<ref>{{cite book |first=G. |last=Allighan |title=Verwoerd \u2013 The End |page=xvi |year=1961 |publisher=Purnell and Sons (SA) (Pty) Ltd }}</ref>\n\nVerwoerd was awarded two scholarships for further post-doctoral studies abroad\u2014one by the Abe Bailey Trust to study at the [[University of Oxford]], England, and another one to continue his studies in Germany. He opted for the latter, although it was not financially as generous, because he wanted to study under a number of famous German professors of the time. Verwoerd left for Germany in 1926, and proceeded to study psychology at the [[University of Hamburg]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. In Hamburg he studied under [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]], in Berlin under [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] and [[Otto Lipmann]], and in Leipzig under [[Felix Krueger]].

Malan's [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] (HNP) concluded an election pact with the Afrikaner Party in 1947. They won the elections with a very narrow majority of five seats in Parliament, although they only got 40 percent of the voter support. This was due to the loaded constituencies in cities, which was to the advantage of rural constituencies. The nine Afrikaner Party MPs thus made it possible for Malan's HNP to form a coalition government with the Afrikaner Party of [[Nicolaas Havenga|Klasie Havenga]]. The two parties amalgamated in 1951 as the National Party although Havenga was not comfortable with NP policy to remove coloured voters from the common voters' roll.\n\nRunning on the platform of self-determination and apartheid as it was termed for the first time, Prime Minister [[Daniel Malan]] and his party benefited from their support in the rural electorates, defeating General [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]] and his United Party. General Smuts lost his own seat of [[Standerton]]. Most party leaders agreed that the nationalist policies were responsible for the National Party's victory. To further cement their nationalist policies, Herenigde Nasionale Party leader Daniel Malan called for stricter enforcement of job reservation protecting the rights of the White working class, and the rights of White workers to organise their own labour unions outside of company control.\n\nVerwoerd was elected to the [[South African Senate]] later that year, and became the minister of native affairs under Prime Minister Malan in 1950, until his appointment as prime minister in 1958. In that position, he helped to implement the Nationalist Party's programme.<ref name=\"Lentz\" />\n\nAmong the laws which were drawn and enacted during Verwoerd's time as minister for native affairs were the [[Population Registration Act]] and the [[Group Areas Act]] in 1950, the [[Pass Laws Act]] of 1952 and the [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act]] of 1953. Verwoerd wrote the Bantu Education Act, which was to have a deleterious effect on the ability of black South Africans to be educated as Verwoerd himself noted that the purpose of the Bantu Education Act was to ensure that blacks would have only just enough education to work as unskilled laborers.<ref name=Gross2008>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=D. |date=14 September 2016 |title=How Should South Africa Remember the Architect of Apartheid? |publisher=Smithsonian |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-should-south-africa-remember-architect-apartheid-180960449/ |accessdate=29 May 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Bantu Education Act ensured that black South Africans had only the barest minimal of education, thus entrenching the role of blacks in the apartheid economy as a cheap source of unskilled labor. In June 1954, Verwoerd in a speech stated: \u201cThe Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects. There is no place for him in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour. Within his own community, however, all doors are open\".<ref name=Gross2008 />\n\nOne black South African woman who worked as an anti-apartheid activist, Nomavenda Mathiane, in particular criticized Verwoerd for the Bantu Education Act of 1953, which caused generations of black South Africans to suffer an inferior education, saying: \"After white people had taken the land, after white people had impoverished us in South Africa, the only way out of our poverty was through education. And he came up with the idea of giving us an inferior education.\"<ref name=Gross2008 />\n\n==Prime minister==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nPrime Minister [[Daniel Malan]] announced his retirement from politics following the National Party's success in the [[1953 South African general election|elections of 1953]]. In the succession debate that followed Malan's retirement in 1954, [[N. C. Havenga]], and J. G. Strijdom were potential successors. The Young Turks of the Transvaal got the upper hand and thus [[J. G. Strijdom]] was elected as the new leader of the National Party, who succeeded Malan as Prime Minister.\n\nVerwoerd gradually gained popularity with the Afrikaner electorate and continued to expand his political support. With his overwhelming constituency victory in the 1958 election and the death shortly thereafter of Prime Minister J. G. Strijdom, Verwoerd was nominated together with Eben D\u00f6nges and C. R. Swart from the Free State as candidates to head the party. Verwoerd got the most votes in the second round and thus succeeded Strijdom as Prime Minister.\n\n==Apartheid==\n{{Apartheid}}\nHendrik Verwoerd is often called the architect of [[apartheid]] for his role in shaping the implementation of apartheid policy when he was minister of native affairs and then prime minister.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Catherine M.|title=Performing South Africa's Truth Commission: Stages of Transition|year=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-22145-2|pages=31, 226}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Thomas M.|title=Encyclopedia of the Developing World|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Routledge/Taylor & Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-97662-6|page=1661}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Coombes|first=Annie E.|title=History after Apartheid: Visual Culture and Public Memory in a Democratic South Africa |year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8223-3060-1|page=22}}</ref> Verwoerd once described apartheid as a \"policy of good neighbourliness\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=320&Itemid=44 |title=Culture, Communication and Media Studies \u2013 Freedom Square-Back to the Future |publisher=Ccms.ukzn.ac.za |accessdate=16 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822201544/http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=320&Itemid=44 |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the NP came to power in 1948, there were factional differences in the party about the implementation of systemic racial segregation. The larger {{lang|af|[[baasskap]]}} faction, favoured segregation, but also favoured the participation of black Africans in the economy as long as black labour could be controlled to advance the economic gains of Afrikaners. A second faction were the \"purists\", who believed in \"vertical segregation\", in which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term. Verwoerd belonged to a third faction, that sympathised with the purists, but allowed for the use of black labour, while implementing the purist goal of vertical separation.<ref name=\"Kuperus1999\">{{cite book|author=T.

In January 1960, Verwoerd announced that a referendum would be called to determine the republican issue, the objective being a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Two weeks later, [[Harold Macmillan]], then British Prime Minister, visited South Africa.\n\nIn an address to both Houses of Parliament, Macmillan gave his famous [[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change]] speech, which was interpreted as an end to British support for white rule. This speech, which implicitly criticized apartheid together with the worldwide criticism following the [[Sharpeville massacre]], created a \"siege mentality\" in South Africa, which Verwoerd seized upon to booster his case for a republic, presenting Elizabeth II as the ruler of a hostile power.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick 1989 p. 88\">Brogan, Patrick (1989). ''The Fighting Never Stopped'' Vintage Books. p. 88.</ref>\n\nVerwoerd also ensured that South African media gave generous coverage of the breakdown of society in the Congo in the summer of 1960 following independence from Belgium as an example of the sort of \"horrors\" that allegedly would ensure in South Africa if apartheid was ended, which he then linked to the criticism of apartheid in Britain, arguing the Congolese \"horrors\" were what people in Britain were intent upon inflicting on white South Africans, fanning the flames of Anglophobia.<ref>Brogan, Patrick (1989). ''The Fighting Never Stopped'' Vintage Books. p.92</ref>\n\nIn order to bolster support for a republic, the voting age for whites was lowered from 21 to 18, benefiting younger Afrikaans speakers, who were more likely to favour a republic, and the franchise was extended to whites in [[South-West Africa]], most of whom were German or [[Afrikaans]] speakers. This was done even though [[English South African]]s were slightly outnumbered by Afrikaners. The vast majority of English-South Africans were against South Africa becoming a republic and were still loyal to the British Crown.\n\nThe [[1960 South Africa referendum]] was accepted by Parliament.<ref>Osada, Masako (2002). ''Sanctions and honorary whites: diplomatic policies and economic realities in relations between Japan and South Africa.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 54.</ref> In March 1961 at a conference of Commonwealth prime ministers in London, Verwoerd abandoned an attempt to rejoin the Commonwealth, which was necessary given the intention to declare a republic following a resolution jointly sponsored by Jawaharlal Nehru of India and John Diefenbaker of Canada declaring that racism was incompatible with Commonwealth membership.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick 1989 p. 88\"/> Verwoerd abandoned the application to rejoin the Commonwealth after the Indo-Canadian resolution was accepted mostly by votes from non-white nations (Canada was the only majority white country to vote for the resolution), and stormed out of the conference.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick 1989 p. 88\"/> For many white South Africans, especially those of British extraction, leaving the Commonwealth imposed a certain psychological sense of isolation as South Africa had left a club that it belonged to since 1910 and had been a prominent member of.<ref name=\"Brogan, Patrick 1989 p. 88\"/> The Republic of South Africa came into existence on 31 May 1961, the anniversary of the signing of the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] that had brought the [[Second Boer War]] to an end in 1902, and the establishment of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910.

''Life International'', 3 October 1966</ref> Verwoerd's overt moves to block non-whites from representing South Africa in sports\u2014starting with cricket\u2014started the international movement to ostracise South Africa from international sporting competition. Their last Olympic Games\u2014until the abolition of apartheid\u2014was in 1960, South Africa was expelled from FIFA in 1976, and whenever South African teams did participate in sports, protests and disruptions were the result.

After Verwoerd delivered his opening address, [[David Pratt (assassin)|David Pratt]], a rich English businessman and farmer from the Magaliesberg, near Pretoria, attempted to assassinate Verwoerd, firing two shots from a [[.22 caliber|.22]] pistol at point-blank range, one bullet perforating Verwoerd's right cheek and the second his right ear.\n\nColonel G. M. Harrison, president of the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society, leapt up and knocked the pistol from the gunman's hand. After the pistol fell to the floor, Harrison, with the help of Major Carl Richter, the Prime Minister's personal bodyguard, civilians and another policeman overpowered the gunman. He was taken to the Marshall Square police station and later transferred to the Forensic Medical Laboratory due to his peculiar behaviour.\n\nWithin minutes of the assassination attempt, Verwoerd\u2014still conscious and blood gushing from his face\u2014was rushed to the nearby Johannesburg Hospital. Two days later, the hospital issued a statement which described his condition as 'indeed satisfactory\u2014further examinations were carried out today and they confirm good expectations. Dr. Verwoerd at present is restful. There is no need for any immediate operation.' Once his condition stabilised, Verwoerd was transferred to a Pretoria Hospital. The neurologists who treated Verwoerd later stated that his escape had been 'absolutely miraculous'.<ref>Allan Bird, ''Bird on a wing'', 205 (1992).</ref> Specialist surgeons were called in to remove the bullets. At first, there was speculation that Verwoerd would lose his hearing and sense of balance, but this was to prove groundless. He returned to public life on 29 May, less than two months after the shooting.\n\nDavid Pratt was initially held under the emergency regulations, declared on 30 March 1960, nine days after the [[Sharpeville massacre]] and shortly after Verwoerd received a death threat with a red note reading, \"Today we kill Verwoerd\".<ref>\"Verwoerd knew of threats but did not withdraw.\" ''The Star'', 11 April 1960.</ref> Pratt appeared for a preliminary hearing in the Johannesburg Magistrates' Court on 20 and 21 July 1960, once it was clear that the attempt was not fatal.<ref>\"Aanslag: Nuwe stap met gearresteerde.

However, in his defence, he stated he only wanted to injure, not kill, Verwoerd. The court accepted the medical reports submitted to it by five different psychiatrists, all of which confirmed that Pratt lacked legal capacity and could not be held criminally liable for having shot the prime minister. On 26 September 1960, he was committed to a mental hospital in Bloemfontein. On 1 October 1961, his 53rd birthday, he committed suicide, shortly before parole was to be considered.<ref>Loammi Wolf, [http://www.litnet.co.za/Article/david-beresford-pratt-die-mens-agter-die-sluipmoordenaar ''David Beresford Pratt: die mens agter die sluipmoordpoging''], LitNet Akademies, vol. 9(3), 2012 (English summary); I.

Both SLaM and King's College Hospital are part of [[King's Health Partners]] Academic Health Sciences Centre.\n\n''Keeping Britain Alive: The NHS in a Day'', also made by The Garden Productions, but for [[BBC Two]], was based on the inverse premise to ''24 Hours in A&E'': instead of observing different days in a single institution, the eight-part series followed the work of a variety of NHS services on a single day, Thursday 18 October 2012.

Both SLaM and King's College Hospital are part of [[King's Health Partners]] Academic Health Sciences Centre.\n\n''Keeping Britain Alive: The NHS in a Day'', also made by The Garden Productions, but for [[BBC Two]], was based on the inverse premise to ''24 Hours in A&E'': instead of observing different days in a single institution, the eight-part series followed the work of a variety of NHS services on a single day, Thursday 18 October 2012. The series aired from March 2013.\n\nDue to the success of ''24 Hours in A&E'', Channel 4 commissioned a series with the same format that follows police officers in [[Luton]], called ''[[24 Hours in Police Custody]]''.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
