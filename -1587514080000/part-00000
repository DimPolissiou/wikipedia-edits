Two of the four added letters now stand included in the Tibetan Unicode alphabet.\n\nThe Tibetan script had been in vogue in Baltistan until the last quarter of the 14th century, when the Baltis converted to Islam. Since then, Persian script replaced the Tibetan script, but the former had no letters for seven Balti sounds and was in vogue in spite of the fact that it was defective. Adding the seven new letters has now made it a complete script for Balti.\n\nRecently, a number of Balti scholars and social activists have attempted to promote the use of the Tibetan Balti or \"Yige\" alphabet with the aim of helping to preserve indigenous Balti and Ladakhi culture and ethnic identity. Following a request from this community, the September 2006 Tokyo meeting of ISO/IEC 10646 WG2 agreed to encode two characters which are invented by Abadi (U+0F6B TIBETAN LETTER KKA and TIBETAN U+0F6C LETTER RRA) in the [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] and [[Unicode]] standards in order to support rendering Urdu loanwords present in modern Balti using the Yige alphabet.\n\n===Yige Alphabet===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!

In modern times, Balti has no native names or vocabulary for dozens of newly invented and introduced things; instead, Urdu and English words are being used in Balti.\n\nBalti has retained many honorific words that are characteristic of Tibetan dialects and many other languages.\n\nBelow are a few examples:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ordinary Balti \n!Text Writing!!

Some epics and sagas appear in oral literature such as the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]'', and the stories of ''rgya lu cho lo bzang'' and ''rgya lu sras bu''. All other literature is in verse. Balti literature has adopted numerous [[Persian language|Persian]] styles of verse and vocables which amplify the beauty and melody of its poetry.\n\nNearly all the languages and dialects of the mountain region in the north of Pakistan such as [[Pashto]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]] and Shina are [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] or [[Iranian languages|Iranic]] languages, but Balti is one of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. As such, it has nothing in common with neighboring languages except some loanwords absorbed as a result of linguistic contact. Balti and [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] are closely related.\n\nThe major issue facing the development of Balti literature is its centuries-long isolation from [[Tibet]], owing to political divisions and strong religious differences and even from its immediate neighbor Ladakh for the last 50 years. Separated from its linguistic kin, Balti is under pressure from more dominant languages such as [[Urdu]]. This is compounded by the lack of a suitable means of transcribing the language following the abandonment of its original Tibetan script. The Baltis do not have the awareness to revive their original script and there is no institution that could restore it and persuade the people to use it again. Even if the script is revived, it would need modification to express certain Urdu phonemes that occur in common loanwords within Balti.\n\nExamples of poetry:{{quote|<center>\n:Youq fangsay thalang paqzi na mandoq na mabour na\n:Na drolbi laming yani si soq fangse chi thobtook\n:Nasir Karmi</center>}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sart]]\n* [[Balti people]]\n* [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*\n*{{Cite book| last = Bashir| first = Elena L.| date = 2016| chapter = Perso-Arabic adaptions for South Asian languages| editor-last1 = Hock| editor-first1 = Hans Henrich|  editor-last2 = Bashir| editor-first2 = Elena L.| title = The languages and linguistics of South Asia: a comprehensive guide| series = World of Linguistics| publisher = De Gruyter Mouton| location = Berlin| isbn = 978-3-11-042715-8| pages = 803\u20139| ref = harv}}\n*{{Cite report|last = Pandey| first = Anshuman| date = 2010| title = Introducing Another Script for Writing Balti| url = https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10231-n3842-balti.pdf| ref = harv}}\n* Muhammad Yousuf Hussainabadi, 'Baltistan per aik Nazar'. 1984.\n* Hussainabadi, Mohamad Yusuf.

In the twin districts of Ladakh region (Kargil and Leh) it is spoken in Kargil city and its surrounding villages like Hardass, Lato, Karkitchhoo and Balti Bazar and in Leh \u2013 Turtuk, Bogdang, Tyakshi including Leh city and nearby villages.\n\nIn some rural areas, the [[Shina people]] still speak the [[Shina language]] but they are very few in number.

Two of the four added letters now stand included in the Tibetan Unicode alphabet.\n\nThe Tibetan script had been in vogue in Baltistan until the last quarter of the 14th century, when the Baltis converted to Islam. Since then, Persian script replaced the Tibetan script, but the former had no letters for seven Balti sounds and was in vogue in spite of the fact that it was defective. Adding the seven new letters has now made it a complete script for Balti.\n\nRecently, a number of Balti scholars and social activists have attempted to promote the use of the Tibetan Balti or \"Yige\" alphabet with the aim of helping to preserve indigenous Balti and Ladakhi culture and ethnic identity. Following a request from this community, the September 2006 Tokyo meeting of ISO/IEC 10646 WG2 agreed to encode two characters which are invented by Abadi (U+0F6B TIBETAN LETTER KKA and TIBETAN U+0F6C LETTER RRA) in the [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] and [[Unicode]] standards in order to support rendering Urdu loanwords present in modern Balti using the Yige alphabet.\n\n===Yige Alphabet===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!

In modern times, Balti has no native names or vocabulary for dozens of newly invented and introduced things; instead, Urdu and English words are being used in Balti.\n\nBalti has retained many honorific words that are characteristic of Tibetan dialects and many other languages.\n\nBelow are a few examples:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ordinary Balti \n!Text Writing!!

Some epics and sagas appear in oral literature such as the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]'', and the stories of ''rgya lu cho lo bzang'' and ''rgya lu sras bu''. All other literature is in verse. Balti literature has adopted numerous [[Persian language|Persian]] styles of verse and vocables which amplify the beauty and melody of its poetry.\n\nNearly all the languages and dialects of the mountain region in the north of Pakistan such as [[Pashto]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]] and Shina are [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] or [[Iranian languages|Iranic]] languages, but Balti is one of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. As such, it has nothing in common with neighboring languages except some loanwords absorbed as a result of linguistic contact. Balti and [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] are closely related.\n\nThe major issue facing the development of Balti literature is its centuries-long isolation from [[Tibet]], owing to political divisions and strong religious differences and even from its immediate neighbor Ladakh for the last 50 years. Separated from its linguistic kin, Balti is under pressure from more dominant languages such as [[Urdu]]. This is compounded by the lack of a suitable means of transcribing the language following the abandonment of its original Tibetan script. The Baltis do not have the awareness to revive their original script and there is no institution that could restore it and persuade the people to use it again. Even if the script is revived, it would need modification to express certain Urdu phonemes that occur in common loanwords within Balti.\n\nExamples of poetry:{{quote|<center>\n:Youq fangsay thalang paqzi na mandoq na mabour na\n:Na drolbi laming yani si soq fangse chi thobtook\n:Nasir Karmi</center>}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sart]]\n* [[Balti people]]\n* [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*\n*{{Cite book| last = Bashir| first = Elena L.| date = 2016| chapter = Perso-Arabic adaptions for South Asian languages| editor-last1 = Hock| editor-first1 = Hans Henrich|  editor-last2 = Bashir| editor-first2 = Elena L.| title = The languages and linguistics of South Asia: a comprehensive guide| series = World of Linguistics| publisher = De Gruyter Mouton| location = Berlin| isbn = 978-3-11-042715-8| pages = 803\u20139| ref = harv}}\n*{{Cite report|last = Pandey| first = Anshuman| date = 2010| title = Introducing Another Script for Writing Balti| url = https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10231-n3842-balti.pdf| ref = harv}}\n* Muhammad Yousuf Hussainabadi, 'Baltistan per aik Nazar'. 1984.\n* Hussainabadi, Mohamad Yusuf.
