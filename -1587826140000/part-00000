One of his main arguments in ''Small Is Beautiful'' is that we cannot consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we recklessly erode our finite [[natural capital]] and deprive future generations of its benefits. Schumacher's work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism, and he became a hero to many in the [[environmental movement]] and [[community movement]].\n\nIn 1976, he received the prestigious award [[:fr:Prix Europ\u00e9en de l'Essai Charles Veillon|Prix Europ\u00e9en de l'Essai Charles Veillon]] for ''Small Is Beautiful''.\n\nHis 1977 work ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'' is both a critique of [[materialism|materialistic]] [[scientism]] and an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge.\n\n==Later life==\nAs a young man, Schumacher was a dedicated atheist, but his later rejection of materialist, capitalist, agnostic modernity was paralleled by a growing fascination with religion.<ref>Diana Schumacher.

K. Chesterton]], [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[Vincent McNabb]].

At this post he was assigned the task of compiling information for the obituary of John Maynard Keynes. He also wrote for ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Resurgence & Ecologist|Resurgence]]''. He served as adviser to the [[India Planning Commission]], as well as to the governments of Zambia and Burma \u2013 an experience that led to his much-read essay \"Buddhist Economics\".\n\nThe 1973 publication of ''[[Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered]]'', a collection of essays, finished in the house of his friend Leopold Kohr, brought his ideas to a wider audience. One of his main arguments in ''Small Is Beautiful'' is that we cannot consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we recklessly erode our finite [[natural capital]] and deprive future generations of its benefits. Schumacher's work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism, and he became a hero to many in the [[environmental movement]] and [[community movement]].\n\nIn 1976, he received the prestigious award [[:fr:Prix Europ\u00e9en de l'Essai Charles Veillon|Prix Europ\u00e9en de l'Essai Charles Veillon]] for ''Small Is Beautiful''.\n\nHis 1977 work ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'' is both a critique of [[materialism|materialistic]] [[scientism]] and an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge.\n\n==Later life==\nAs a young man, Schumacher was a dedicated atheist, but his later rejection of materialist, capitalist, agnostic modernity was paralleled by a growing fascination with religion.<ref>Diana Schumacher.

He noted the similarities between his own economic views and the teaching of papal [[Encyclical|encyclicals]] on socio-economic issues, from [[Leo XIII]]'s \"[[Rerum novarum]]\" to [[Pope John XXIII]]'s ''[[Mater et magistra]]'', as well as with the [[distributism]] supported by the Catholic thinkers [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[Vincent McNabb]]. Philosophically, he absorbed much of [[Thomism]], which provided an objective system in contrast to what he saw as the self-centered [[subjectivism]] and [[relativism]] of modern philosophy and society.<ref>Charles Fager.
