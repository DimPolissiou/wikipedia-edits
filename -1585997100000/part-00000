The new car, named the Tuatara was previewed in concept form at the 2011 [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] but due to certain reasons never came to the production stage. In August 2018, 7 years after the debut of the concept, the production version of the Tuatara was shown to the general public.

Various SBL All-Stars and All-Star teams have been announced over the years, with a number of All-Star games occurring between 1990 and 1993, and various All-Star teams being named yearly between 1996 and 2004. In 1995, an All-Star Five and an All-Star Ten was named for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. In 2005 and 2006, MSBL and WSBL All-Star Five teams were named. The SBL then introduced a first, second, and third team All-Star (or \"All-SBL\") format for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The SBL returned to a five-player All-Star team in 2009 for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. The term \"All-Star Five\" has been used by the SBL in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nOn a few occasions, due to the different voting systems, the Most Valuable Player has not been named in the All-Star Five.\n\n==Selections==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has been selected\n|-\n|'''Player<br><small>(in bold text)'''\n|Indicates the player who won the [[State Basketball League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in the same year\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n===1995===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| \n!colspan=2| WSBL\n!colspan=2| MSBL\n!rowspan=2| Ref\n|-\n!Players!!Teams\n!Players!!Teams\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Five\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]] ||rowspan=15 align=center|<ref>{{cite book |year=1995 |title=Annual Report 1995 |publisher=[[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.)]] |page=56 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gina Stevens]] || [[Stirling Senators]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Katie Watts || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || Alan Erickson || [[Cockburn Cougars]]\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Ken Epperson || [[Swan City Mustangs]]\n|-\n| Katrine Linssen || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Pete Hansen || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]]\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n|rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Ten\n| Sue Arthur || [[Rockingham Flames]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Shelley Boston || [[Rockingham Flames]] || Robin Behrendorff || Rainbow Coast Raiders\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Wade Bennett || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| '''[[Tanya Fisher]]''' || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Greg Brown || [[Geraldton Buccaneers]]\n|-\n| Linda Jose || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || [[C.

"{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nThe '''State Basketball League All-Star Five''' is an annual [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) honour bestowed on the best players in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL following every season. Various SBL All-Stars and All-Star teams have been announced over the years, with a number of All-Star games occurring between 1990 and 1993, and various All-Star teams being named yearly between 1996 and 2004. In 1995, an All-Star Five and an All-Star Ten was named for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. In 2005 and 2006, MSBL and WSBL All-Star Five teams were named. The SBL then introduced a first, second, and third team All-Star (or \"All-SBL\") format for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The SBL returned to a five-player All-Star team in 2009 for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. The term \"All-Star Five\" has been used by the SBL in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nOn a few occasions, due to the different voting systems, the Most Valuable Player has not been named in the All-Star Five.\n\n==Selections==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has been selected\n|-\n|'''Player<br><small>(in bold text)'''\n|Indicates the player who won the [[State Basketball League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in the same year\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n===1995===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| \n!colspan=2| WSBL\n!colspan=2| MSBL\n!rowspan=2| Ref\n|-\n!Players!!Teams\n!Players!!Teams\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Five\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]] ||rowspan=15 align=center|<ref>{{cite book |year=1995 |title=Annual Report 1995 |publisher=[[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.)]] |page=56 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gina Stevens]] || [[Stirling Senators]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Katie Watts || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || Alan Erickson || [[Cockburn Cougars]]\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Ken Epperson || [[Swan City Mustangs]]\n|-\n| Katrine Linssen || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Pete Hansen || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]]\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n|rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Ten\n| Sue Arthur || [[Rockingham Flames]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Shelley Boston || [[Rockingham Flames]] || Robin Behrendorff || Rainbow Coast Raiders\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Wade Bennett || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| '''[[Tanya Fisher]]''' || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Greg Brown || [[Geraldton Buccaneers]]\n|-\n| Linda Jose || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || [[C.

With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\n\n==Strangulation of Phnom Penh==\nAt the beginning of 1975 the [[Khmer Republic]], a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the [[Mekong River]] that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from [[South Vietnam]]. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the [[Khmer Rouge]] set out to cut off the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked [[Neak Luong]], a key [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack over the {{convert|100|km}} journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit [[naval mine]]s laid by the Khmer Rouge at Phu My approximately {{convert|74|km}} from Phnom Penh. The FANK naval branch, the [[Khmer National Navy]] (MNK), had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or at best extremely costly.<ref name=Dunham>{{cite book |last=Dunham |first=George R |title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Bitter End, 1973\u20131975 (Marine Corps Vietnam Operational Historical Series)|publisher=Marine Corps Association|year=1990|url=https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|isbn=978-0-16-026455-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd/page/n112 102]\u20134}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.<ref name=Shawcross>{{cite book |title=Sideshow Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia |last=Shawcross |first=William |publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited |year=1979 |isbn=0-233-97077-0 |page=347}}</ref>\n\nBy 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line. In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to [[Pochentong Airport]].<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}} The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]],<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|347}} [[BirdAir]], a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of [[C-130]] and [[DC-8]] planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}}\n\nOn 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap, north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in on the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift.  On 1 April the Khmer Rouge overran Neak Luong and Ban-am, the last remaining FANK positions on the Mekong.

With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\n\n==Strangulation of Phnom Penh==\nAt the beginning of 1975 the [[Khmer Republic]], a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the [[Mekong River]] that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from [[South Vietnam]]. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the [[Khmer Rouge]] set out to cut off the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked [[Neak Luong]], a key [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack over the {{convert|100|km}} journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit [[naval mine]]s laid by the Khmer Rouge at Phu My approximately {{convert|74|km}} from Phnom Penh. The FANK naval branch, the [[Khmer National Navy]] (MNK), had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or at best extremely costly.<ref name=Dunham>{{cite book |last=Dunham |first=George R |title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Bitter End, 1973\u20131975 (Marine Corps Vietnam Operational Historical Series)|publisher=Marine Corps Association|year=1990|url=https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|isbn=978-0-16-026455-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd/page/n112 102]\u20134}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.<ref name=Shawcross>{{cite book |title=Sideshow Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia |last=Shawcross |first=William |publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited |year=1979 |isbn=0-233-97077-0 |page=347}}</ref>\n\nBy 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line.

On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift.

First playing under the moniker Rockets Of Love in 2009, the five-piece saw little to no opportunities in the US and began focussing on the [[European]] market.\n\n== Since 2013 ==\nIn Europe, the band first popped up in 2013, bringing a full catalog of [[Classic rock music|classic rock]] songs to stages across the continent.

It is located in the coastal Djibouti Region on the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]].\n\nDjibouti City has a population of around 562,000 inhabitants,<ref name=CIA/> which counts for over 70% of the country's population. The settlement was founded in 1888 by the French, on land leased from the ruling Somali and Afar Sultans. During the ensuing period, it served as the capital of [[French Somaliland]] and its successor the [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]].\n\nKnown as the ''Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura'' due to its location, Djibouti City is strategically positioned near the world's busiest shipping lanes and acts as a refueling and transshipment center. The [[Port of Djibouti]] is the principal maritime port for imports to and exports from neighboring [[Ethiopia]]. [[Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport]] is the main domestic airport, connecting the capital to various major global destinations. Djibouti City has the second-largest economy of any city in the [[Horn of Africa]] after [[Addis Ababa]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Djibouti City|History of Djibouti}}\nThere is evidence of human settlement on the eastern coastline of [[Djibouti]] dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nFrom 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] was called ''[[Obock]]'' and was ruled by [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.<ref name=\"Uwechue\">Raph Uwechue, ''Africa year book and who's who'', (Africa Journal Ltd.: 1977), p. 209</ref><ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Somaliland#History of French Somaliland |display=Somaliland: History of French Somaliland |volume=25 |page=383}}</ref><ref name=\"Apcoatf\">''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor & Francis), p. 132</ref> The exchange of Franco-British notes of February 2 and 9, 1888 fixes the territorial limit between the colonies of the two countries.

It is then that this point begins to be used as departure for caravans towards [[Harar]]. \n[[File:OlderDjibouticity.jpg|thumb|left|Djibouti City's [[Al Sada Mosque]] in the 1940s.]]\n\nThe French subsequently founded Djibouti City in 1888, in a previously uninhabited stretch of coast. In 1896, the settlement was made the capital of [[French Somaliland]].<ref name=\"Wbi\">World Book, Inc, ''The [[World Book Encyclopedia]]'', Volume 1, (World Book: 2007)</ref>\nThe main purpose of French interest was to protect the trade route to Madagascar and Indochina from the British and Italian. The town later grew considerably in size following the construction of the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Imperial Ethiopian Railway]]. It grew rapidly, going from 1,200 inhabitants in 1893 to 5,561 in 1906. Additionally, the rich agricultural southern area of [[Ambouli]] continued to flourish due to an abundance of [[Date palm|date palm]] farms and [[Orchard|orchards]]. The [[Port of Djibouti]] became a stopover for the Messageries Maritimes on the route between [[France]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Indochina]] in November 1895. \n\nIt at the time had a population of 15,000 residents,<ref name=EBJ>\"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Jibuti |volume=15 |page=414}}\" (i.e., Djibouti)</ref> exceeding the population of all cities in neighbouring [[Ethiopia]] except [[Harar]].<ref name=EBA>\"{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia#Provinces and Towns |display=Abyssinia: (7) Provinces and Towns |volume=1 |page=86}}</ref> Although the initial company failed and required a government bailout to avoid falling under [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] administration,<ref name=EBA/> the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Franco-Ethiopian Railway]] itself was a success and allowed Djibouti city's commerce to quickly eclipse the former caravan-based trade carried on with nearby [[Zeila]] in [[British Somaliland]].<ref name=EBZ>\"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}</ref> Djibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the [[Ogaden]], including trade in [[Harari coffee]] and [[khat]].<ref name=EBJ/> Djibouti City began to develop as a commercial center. In 1932, Djibouti City was the first town to be wired to electricity in [[French Somaliland]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Djibouti City was hit by [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian airstrikes]] on June 21, 1940, which killed more people in the town. The [[anti-aircraft]] fire was intense and two Italian aircraft failed to return, but fires and explosions were seen in Djibouti. Overnight, several waves of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] bombers attacked the port facilities. After the [[France]] fell and the colony was then ruled by the [[Vichy France|pro-Axis Vichy (French) government]]. By that time, the British offensive against the Italians had tightened the blockade of [[French Somaliland]] and a famine was setting in. Malnutrition-related diseases took many lives, 70% of them women and children. The locals named the blockade the carmii, a word for a type of sorghum usually reserved for cattle, but used as human food at the height of the famine. In December 1942, about 4,000 [[British people|British]] and [[Free French]] troops [[British invasion of French Somaliland|occupied]] the town. \n\nThe population of Djibouti City was growing rapidly, from officially about 17,000 inhabitants in 1947. In 1949, the plan of Djibouti City consisted of four main features: a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to form a civic center. It then became the headquarters of the succeeding [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]].\n\nWhen Djibouti declared [[Independence Day (Djibouti)|Independence]] on 27 June 1977, the population of Djibouti City was over 110,000, the city has served as the administrative and commercial capital of the Republic of Djibouti.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Topography===\nDjibouti City is the capital and largest settlement in [[Djibouti]], situated in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The city is located in eastern Djibouti, approximately {{convert|21|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the [[Somalia]] border. It is a seaport, with the only sheltered harbour on the western side of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]]. The wadi of Ambouli, flows through the city, separating the older parts of the city from the Balbala district. The landscape around the city, along with Djibouti's coastal lowlands, is [[desert]] or [[semi-desert]]. The city's sandy beaches include Siesta Beach and Heron Beach. It is known as the \"Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura\" due to its location.\n\n===Districts===\nDjibouti City's urban area is partitioned into 31 districts, which include Heron, Gabode, Haramous and Makka Al Moukarama. [[Balbala]] suburb has been officially part of the city since 1987, and is divided into 18 districts.\n[[File:Djibouti City and Balbala Districts.png|thumb|500px|upright=1.8|alt=A map of Bangkok|Map showing the 49 districts of Djibouti City]]\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n||\n# '''Heron'''\n# '''Marabout'''\n# '''Gare'''\n# '''Sepent'''\n# '''Republic'''\n# '''Financial Center'''\n# '''Boulaos'''\n# '''Einguella'''\n# '''Sacuudi'''\n# '''Q1'''\n# '''Q2'''\n# '''Q4'''\n# '''Q3'''\n# '''Q6'''\n# '''Q5'''\n# '''Q7'''\n# '''Stade'''\n# '''Gabode'''\n# '''Guelleh Batal'''\n# '''Haramous'''\n# '''Aviation'''\n# '''Djebel'''\n# '''Ambouli'''\n# '''Q7 Bis'''\n# '''PoudriEre'''\n||\n<ol start=\"26\">\n<li>'''Arhiba'''</li>\n<li>'''Makka Al Moukarama'''</li>\n<li>'''Wadgir'''</li>\n<li>'''Gachamaleh'''</li>\n<li>'''Palmeraie'''</li>\n<li>'''Progres'''</li>\n<li>'''Fiyetnam'''</li>\n<li>'''Cheik Moussa'''</li>\n<li>'''Cheik Osman'''</li>\n<li>'''Balbala Caadi'''</li>\n<li>'''Bahaache'''</li>\n<li>'''Balbala 6'''</li>\n<li>'''Gouled'''</li>\n<li>'''Barwago'''</li>\n<li>'''Hayableh'''</li>\n<li>'''Cagdaalis'''</li>\n<li>'''Bambada'''</li>\n<li>'''Wahle Daba'''</li>\n<li>'''Nassib'''</li>\n<li>'''Hodan'''</li>\n<li>'''Layableh'''</li>\n<li>'''I.O.G'''</li>\n<li>'''PK12'''</li>\n<li>'''PK13'''</li>\n</ol>\n|}\n\n===Climate===\nDjibouti City has an [[arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''[[hot desert climate|BWh]]''). It is characterised by very hot rainless summers and a very warm, slightly wetter winter season. Most of the annual precipitation falls between October and May. The city sees on average {{convert|163.5|mm|in|2}} of rainfall per year. Average high temperatures range from {{convert|29|C|F}} during the months of December, January and February, to about {{convert|42|C|F}} in July. There are two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season with more precipitation from November to April (winter). The rainfall on the coast usually occurs between November to March, whereas further inland it falls between April to October. In the summer months, temperatures routinely exceed {{convert|40|C|F}}, with relative humidity at its lowest point of the year. Sunshine is abundant in the city, averaging eight to ten hours a day year-round. It is lowest during the rainy period, when there is some coastal [[fog]] and greater [[cloud]] coverage as warm air passes over the cool sea surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal {{convert|224|mm|in|2}} falling in November 1949.<ref>KNMI Climate explorer, Precipitation totals 1901\u20132000</ref>\n\nThis [[climate]] zone has summers that reach a maximum [[temperature]] of {{convert|41.7|C|F}} and a minimum temperature of {{convert|32|C|F}}. Winters have average nighttime temperatures of {{convert|21|C|F}} and a daytime maximum temperatures of {{convert|29|C|F|}}. There are barely any days in the year without sunshine, and even during the [[winter]] there are many clear days.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Djibouti City (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first =

The old section is filled with [[bazaar]]s and [[souk]]s nestled along narrow streets. It is serves as both a center for commerce and entertainment, as well as a residential area. To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being constructed in and around the city. A few of the building fronts have been renovated and date back to the 19th century. The Place Menelik in the city center is also distinguished by its [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]]-inspired arches.

The Djibouti Region is one of the six regions of Djibouti. It borders the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] to the north and east, and the [[Arta Region]] to the south and west. The Djibouti Region is the smallest province in the country, but also the region with the highest population.

Due to its maritime location, it was the logical choice as the young republic's administrative center. Following independence, Djibouti City continued with its status as the country's political and cultural hub.

Djibouti City has the second-largest economy of any city in the [[Horn of Africa]] after [[Addis Ababa]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Djibouti City|History of Djibouti}}\nThere is evidence of human settlement on the eastern coastline of [[Djibouti]] dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nFrom 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] was called ''[[Obock]]'' and was ruled by [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.<ref name=\"Uwechue\">Raph Uwechue, ''Africa year book and who's who'', (Africa Journal Ltd.: 1977), p. 209</ref><ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Somaliland#History of French Somaliland |display=Somaliland: History of French Somaliland |volume=25 |page=383}}</ref><ref name=\"Apcoatf\">''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor & Francis), p. 132</ref> The exchange of Franco-British notes of February 2 and 9, 1888 fixes the territorial limit between the colonies of the two countries. It leaves explicitly under [[France|French]] authority the southern coasts of the Gulf of Tadjoura, including a [[peninsula]] composed of insubmersible plateaux, Ras Djiboutil. It is then that this point begins to be used as departure for caravans towards [[Harar]]. \n[[File:OlderDjibouticity.jpg|thumb|left|Djibouti City's [[Al Sada Mosque]] in the 1940s.]]\n\nThe French subsequently founded Djibouti City in 1888, in a previously uninhabited stretch of coast. In 1896, the settlement was made the capital of [[French Somaliland]].<ref name=\"Wbi\">World Book, Inc, ''The [[World Book Encyclopedia]]'', Volume 1, (World Book: 2007)</ref>\nThe main purpose of French interest was to protect the trade route to Madagascar and Indochina from the British and Italian. The town later grew considerably in size following the construction of the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Imperial Ethiopian Railway]]. It grew rapidly, going from 1,200 inhabitants in 1893 to 5,561 in 1906. Additionally, the rich agricultural southern area of [[Ambouli]] continued to flourish due to an abundance of [[Date palm|date palm]] farms and [[Orchard|orchards]]. The [[Port of Djibouti]] became a stopover for the Messageries Maritimes on the route between [[France]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Indochina]] in November 1895. \n\nIt at the time had a population of 15,000 residents,<ref name=EBJ>\"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Jibuti |volume=15 |page=414}}\" (i.e., Djibouti)</ref> exceeding the population of all cities in neighbouring [[Ethiopia]] except [[Harar]].<ref name=EBA>\"{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia#Provinces and Towns |display=Abyssinia: (7) Provinces and Towns |volume=1 |page=86}}</ref> Although the initial company failed and required a government bailout to avoid falling under [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] administration,<ref name=EBA/> the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Franco-Ethiopian Railway]] itself was a success and allowed Djibouti city's commerce to quickly eclipse the former caravan-based trade carried on with nearby [[Zeila]] in [[British Somaliland]].<ref name=EBZ>\"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}</ref> Djibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the [[Ogaden]], including trade in [[Harari coffee]] and [[khat]].<ref name=EBJ/> Djibouti City began to develop as a commercial center. In 1932, Djibouti City was the first town to be wired to electricity in [[French Somaliland]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Djibouti City was hit by [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian airstrikes]] on June 21, 1940, which killed more people in the town. The [[anti-aircraft]] fire was intense and two Italian aircraft failed to return, but fires and explosions were seen in Djibouti. Overnight, several waves of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] bombers attacked the port facilities. After the [[France]] fell and the colony was then ruled by the [[Vichy France|pro-Axis Vichy (French) government]]. By that time, the British offensive against the Italians had tightened the blockade of [[French Somaliland]] and a famine was setting in. Malnutrition-related diseases took many lives, 70% of them women and children. The locals named the blockade the carmii, a word for a type of sorghum usually reserved for cattle, but used as human food at the height of the famine. In December 1942, about 4,000 [[British]] and [[Free French]] troops [[British invasion of French Somaliland|occupied]] the town. \n\nThe population of Djibouti City was growing rapidly, from officially about 17,000 inhabitants in 1947. In 1949, the plan of Djibouti City consisted of four main features: a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to form a civic center. It then became the headquarters of the succeeding [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]].\n\nWhen Djibouti declared [[Independence Day (Djibouti)|Independence]] on 27 June 1977, the population of Djibouti City was over 110,000, the city has served as the administrative and commercial capital of the Republic of Djibouti.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Topography===\nDjibouti City is the capital and largest settlement in [[Djibouti]], situated in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The city is located in eastern Djibouti, approximately {{convert|21|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the [[Somalia]] border. It is a seaport, with the only sheltered harbour on the western side of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]]. The wadi of Ambouli, flows through the city, separating the older parts of the city from the Balbala district. The landscape around the city, along with Djibouti's coastal lowlands, is [[desert]] or [[semi-desert]]. The city's sandy beaches include Siesta Beach and Heron Beach. It is known as the \"Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura\" due to its location.\n\n===Districts===\nDjibouti City's urban area is partitioned into 31 districts, which include Heron, Gabode, Haramous and Makka Al Moukarama. [[Balbala]] suburb has been officially part of the city since 1987, and is divided into 18 districts.\n[[File:Djibouti City and Balbala Districts.png|thumb|500px|upright=1.8|alt=A map of Bangkok|Map showing the 49 districts of Djibouti City]]\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n||\n# '''Heron'''\n# '''Marabout'''\n# '''Gare'''\n# '''Sepent'''\n# '''Republic'''\n# '''Financial Center'''\n# '''Boulaos'''\n# '''Einguella'''\n# '''Sacuudi'''\n# '''Q1'''\n# '''Q2'''\n# '''Q4'''\n# '''Q3'''\n# '''Q6'''\n# '''Q5'''\n# '''Q7'''\n# '''Stade'''\n# '''Gabode'''\n# '''Guelleh Batal'''\n# '''Haramous'''\n# '''Aviation'''\n# '''Djebel'''\n# '''Ambouli'''\n# '''Q7 Bis'''\n# '''PoudriEre'''\n||\n<ol start=\"26\">\n<li>'''Arhiba'''</li>\n<li>'''Makka Al Moukarama'''</li>\n<li>'''Wadgir'''</li>\n<li>'''Gachamaleh'''</li>\n<li>'''Palmeraie'''</li>\n<li>'''Progres'''</li>\n<li>'''Fiyetnam'''</li>\n<li>'''Cheik Moussa'''</li>\n<li>'''Cheik Osman'''</li>\n<li>'''Balbala Caadi'''</li>\n<li>'''Bahaache'''</li>\n<li>'''Balbala 6'''</li>\n<li>'''Gouled'''</li>\n<li>'''Barwago'''</li>\n<li>'''Hayableh'''</li>\n<li>'''Cagdaalis'''</li>\n<li>'''Bambada'''</li>\n<li>'''Wahle Daba'''</li>\n<li>'''Nassib'''</li>\n<li>'''Hodan'''</li>\n<li>'''Layableh'''</li>\n<li>'''I.O.G'''</li>\n<li>'''PK12'''</li>\n<li>'''PK13'''</li>\n</ol>\n|}\n\n===Climate===\nDjibouti City has an [[arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''[[hot desert climate|BWh]]''). It is characterised by very hot rainless summers and a very warm, slightly wetter winter season. Most of the annual precipitation falls between October and May. The city sees on average {{convert|163.5|mm|in|2}} of rainfall per year. Average high temperatures range from {{convert|29|C|F}} during the months of December, January and February, to about {{convert|42|C|F}} in July. There are two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season with more precipitation from November to April (winter). The rainfall on the coast usually occurs between November to March, whereas further inland it falls between April to October. In the summer months, temperatures routinely exceed {{convert|40|C|F}}, with relative humidity at its lowest point of the year. Sunshine is abundant in the city, averaging eight to ten hours a day year-round. It is lowest during the rainy period, when there is some coastal [[fog]] and greater [[cloud]] coverage as warm air passes over the cool sea surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal {{convert|224|mm|in|2}} falling in November 1949.<ref>KNMI Climate explorer, Precipitation totals 1901\u20132000</ref>\n\nThis [[climate]] zone has summers that reach a maximum [[temperature]] of {{convert|41.7|C|F}} and a minimum temperature of {{convert|32|C|F}}. Winters have average nighttime temperatures of {{convert|21|C|F}} and a daytime maximum temperatures of {{convert|29|C|F|}}. There are barely any days in the year without sunshine, and even during the [[winter]] there are many clear days.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Djibouti City (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first =

To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being constructed in and around the city. A few of the building fronts have been renovated and date back to the 19th century. The Place Menelik in the city center is also distinguished by its [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]]-inspired arches.

It is the seat of the government and home to all the national institutions: the government house, the [[National Assembly (Djibouti)|parliament]], ministries, the presidential palace, the vice-presidential residence, the constitutional court, judicial bodies and other public organizations.\n\nDjibouti City also serves as a hub for various state agencies, as well as continental and international organizations. The Social Development Agency of Djibouti (Agence de D\u00e9veloppement Sociale de Djibouti) has its head offices here, as does the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD) trade bloc. Additionally, the [[Regional Somali Language Academy]], a language regulator established in June 2013 by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia, has its headquarters in the city.<ref name=\"Crslalid\">{{cite web|title=Regional Somali Language Academy Launched in Djibouti|url=http://www.comesaria.org/site/en/news_details.php?chaine=regional-somali-language-academy-launched-in-djibouti&id_news=17578&id_article=119|publisher=COMESA Regional Investment Agency|accessdate=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121105039/http://www.comesaria.org/site/en/news_details.php?chaine=regional-somali-language-academy-launched-in-djibouti&id_news=17578&id_article=119|archive-date=21 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDjibouti City is also home to the [[Djibouti Armed Forces|Armoured Regiment of Djibouti]].

For much of its recent history, the town was characterized by roadside markets and small shops that sold a wide variety of goods. The culture of Djibouti City has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilizations, including Somali, Afar, Yemeni and French traditions. The capital is home to a large number of [[mosque]]s in various architectural styles, which date from different historical periods. Five times a day, [[Muslim]]s are called to prayer from the minarets of the city's many masjids. Additionally, the local opera is a traditional form of [[musical theater]] well known throughout the nation. The [[Djiboutian]] attire is typical of several countries in the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\n===Media===\nDjibouti City has long been a center of media in the country. The first forms of public film display in the city and Djibouti at large were newsreels of key events during the early colonial period. The Djibouti City-based [[Radio Television of Djibouti]] is the principal national public service broadcaster. RTD airs 24 hours a day, and can be viewed both within Djibouti and abroad via terrestrial and satellite platforms. Several newspapers, magazines and printing facilities have their offices in the capital.

Various film and music productions are also filmed in the city.\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Cafdegardjib.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Caf\u00e9 de la Gare, one of a number of popular restaurants in the city.]]\nDjibouti City has long been renowned for its [[Djiboutian cuisine|diverse cuisine]]. Traditional [[Somali cuisine|Somali]], [[Afar people|Afar]] and [[Yemeni cuisine|Yemeni]] delicacies are served alongside international dishes; especially [[French cuisine|French]] culinary staples. The Yemeni dish [[Mandi (food)|mandi]] is also a popular meal, particularly during lunchtime. Several other popular dishes feature seafood and meat, including Fah-fah (spicy boiled beef soup).\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of restaurants located throughout the city. These establishments serve everything from traditional dishes, to gourmet delicacies, to fast food and snacks.

The city's port is the terminus for Ethiopian oil transport and export. Increase in railway infrastructure has further enabled Ethiopian and Eritrean oil products to reach the capital.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:SiestaBeach.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Siesta Beach at sunrise.]]\n[[Tourism in Djibouti]] is centered in the Djibouti region. City landmarks include historic buildings, two important public squares, and the Hall of the People. Many private companies offer organized tours of these sites. Known as the \"Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura\", the city's sandy beaches are also popular tourist attractions.\n\nKhor Ambado lies on the outskirts of Djibouti city, around {{convert|15|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the city center. A popular local attraction, this beach has a number of restaurant establishments overlooking the sea. Doraleh is another beach situated about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the capital, on a paved road that winds through the dunes of volcanic rocks. With its main restaurant, Doraleh is a favorite hangout on Fridays leading up to the weekend. Other prominent beaches in the city include Siesta Beach and Heron Beach.\n\nThe two small [[Maskali Islands|Maskali]] and [[Moucha Island|Moucha]] islands are situated an hour's drive from Djibouti City. They feature madreporic mangroves, with a rich seabed and colorful algae.

Roads leading out of the city connect it to other national localities and to [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]]. Public transportation is provided through [[bus]]es stationed at the Djibouti City Bus Service Enterprise. The city at large serves as a point of intersection for the main roads and highways linking different parts of the country. It is one of the most accessible urban areas in the country, where one can find public and private transportation 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. A significant number of the city's residents use the local informal minibuses and taxis, which include a fleet of 400 green-and-white [[taxi]]s. The main bus hub in Djibouti City is the Central Bus Station, located at the crossing of Rue de Bender.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Djibouti\u2013Ambouli International Airport Apron View.png|thumb|right|[[Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport]]]]\nDjibouti City is served primarily by the [[Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport]].

It is the largest airport in Djibouti and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Horn of Africa and the world. Located approximately {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the city centre, the airport was opened in 1948. Originally a modest-sized facility, the airport grew considerably in size in the post-independence period after numerous successive renovation projects. Outbound international travel from the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport accounts for the majority of all air passengers traveling to and from Djibouti. Due to its strategic location, the facility acts as a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of departures and arrivals, and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing.\n\n===Sea===\n[[File:The container terminal at the Port of Djibouti.jpg|thumb|The container terminal at the [[Port of Djibouti]].]]\nThe [[Port of Djibouti]] is one of the largest and busiest seaports in the [[Horn of Africa|Horn region]]. {{As of|2013}}, the container terminal at the port handles the bulk of the nation's trade.

The story revolves around a small village during the [[United Kingdom|British]]-era whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of [[cricket]] as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learng the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny. This story is inspired by Anmol.\n\n''Lagaan'' received critical acclaim and awards at [[List of film festivals|international film festivals]], as well as many Indian film awards. It became the third [[Indian film]] to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] after ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957) and ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' (1988).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nIn a small town, Champaner, during the height of the [[British Raj]] in 1893, Captain Andrew Russell ([[Paul Blackthorne]]), the commanding officer of the Champaner [[cantonment]], has imposed high taxes (\"Lagaan\") on people from the local villages. They are unable to pay due to losses caused by a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan ([[Aamir Khan]]), the villagers pay a visit to [[Raja]] Puran Singh ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) to seek his help. Near the palace, they witness a [[Cricket in India|cricket]] match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into an argument with one of the British officers who insults them. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province for three years if the villagers can defeat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times their current taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villagers in the province, despite their dissent.\n\nBhuvan begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only three people willing to join the team. Tipu, Bagha, and Guran. He is aided in his efforts by Russell's sister Elizabeth ([[Rachel Shelley]]), who feels that her brother mistreated the villagers. Eventually, Goli and Ishwar Kaka join Bhuvan's team. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri ([[Gracy Singh]]), who is also in love with him. After Elizabeth and Ram Singh take their leave, Bhuvan and the villagers start practicing. Guran tosses the  ball towards Goli and accidentally hits him smack on his forehead. Goli whirls it back to Guran and it zooms past him and eventually lands on Bhura's chickens. So Bhura asks threateningly, \"Who threw this ball?!\" Tipu replies, \"Goli Chacha did!\" To this, Bhura start to pick another fight with Goli and tries to throw a huge rock at him. Goli gets his slingshot out. While Ishwar tries to break up the fight, Bhuvan says, \"Hey, Bhura!,\" and then throws the ball to Bhura. He catches it. Bhuvan then takes the ball from Bhura and throws it to him again and once again Bhura catches it. Bhura then agrees to join the cricket team if they'll promise to look after his chickens. Meanwhile, at the cantonment, Captain Russell reports to Colonel J.R. Boyer's office. Boyer understands that Russell has agreed to cancel the tax of the farmers of Champaneer if they beat him in a game of cricket. To this, Boyer, Major Cotton and Major Warren are furious. Boyer decides to only make Russell's unfair whim fair by saying, \"If you win, you will have a narrow escape, but if you lose,  you will pay the taxes for Champaneer and the entire province out of your own pocket, and then you'll be packed off to Central Africa! Is that clear?\" Russell says yes and is dismissed. He returns to the cantonment gets all huffy at Lieutenant Wesson. Smith asks Russell what's the matter and Russell claim that the British Empire has lost their sense of Adventure. Arjan, who is nailing a horseshoe on Russell's horse, overhears Russell say \"What's the matter with a little fun and games along with the Lagaan?\" He pounds the nail into the horse's shoe with the hammer and the horse shrieks. Russell responds by horse-whipping and kicking Arjan. Then he looks Arjan dead in the eyes and says, \"You bloody slaves are going to be crushed under our boots!\" Arjan says back, \"No matter how thick the soul is the nail will still happen to prick, sir!\" Russell orders Arjan away from him. Arjan goes to Bhuvan and joins the team. Later that day, Ismael also joins the team. That night, all the villagers and Elizabeth celebrate Krishna's birthday. Bhuvan and Gauri play the parts of Krishna and Radha while dancing merrily with the other villagers. Elizabeth, who alongside Gauri is in love with Bhuvan, is still a good sport about it and compliments Gauri's dancing. After Bhuvan reciprocates Gauri's feelings, the woodcutter Lakha ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]), who is in love with Gauri, grows jealous of Bhuvan and becomes a spy for Russell. He orders Lakha to join the villagers' team but not contribute in any way. Short one player, Bhuvan invites an [[Dalit|untouchable]], Kachra ([[Aditya Lakhia]]), who can bowl spin. The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers and convinces them to accept Kachra.\n\nOn the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra to bowl only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball&nbsp;\u2014 new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (which the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha [[Match fixing|deliberately drops many catches]]. Later that evening, Elizabeth notices Lakha meeting with Russell and immediately informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.\n\nThe next day Lakha redeems himself by taking a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score 295 runs, losing only three [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl with a now-worn ball, and takes a [[hat-trick]], which sparks the collapse of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings after the British are dismissed for 322 runs. Bhuvan and Deva ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), a Sikh who has played cricket earlier when he was a British [[sepoy]], give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. Next comes Arjan who starts off very well on the first two bats, then Smith walks up to him and threatens him by saying, \"You won't have a morsel to eat! Nor a piece of cloth to wear!\" This only makes him stronger and bat harder. As Smith's threatening words echo through his head he bats the ball further outside the field. Russell's words of terror from the cantonment then echo through his head and he bats the ball hard but North catches it. Russel decides to get revenge for Lakha\u2019s betrayal, and when Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Bagha comes in strong and hits the first two balls and misses the third and final one. Ismail retires hurt as he is hit on the leg. Ishwar tries to cover for Ismael, but the ball knocks the bat right out of his hand. Smith and Burton both yell, \"How's that?!\" The umpire shakes his head no. The villagers' team ends the day with six batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board. In desperation, the villagers pray for success.\n\nOn the third and final day, Bhuvan passes his [[century (cricket)|century]], while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and passes his half-century, reducing the target to 28 runs of 16 balls. The game comes down to the last [[over (cricket)|over]] with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals [[no-ball]]. Bhuvan returns to bat and hits the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell runs backwards and catches it, believing that his team has won, until he realises that he has caught the ball on the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.\n\nBhuvan's defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the cantonment. In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realizing that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London. Heartbroken, she remains unmarried for the rest of her life. It is revealed, during the [[epilogue]], that Bhuvan and Gauri get married. But despite the historic triumph, Bhuvan's name was lost in the pages of history.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Bhuvan. Ashutosh first thought of having [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Bobby Deol]] and [[Abhishek Bachchan]] for the role of Bhuvan. After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with [[J. P.

As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due to the lack of comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought to take care of the crew's needs.<ref name=\"aamir_intw3\"/> Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers.

The story revolves around a small village during the [[British]]-era whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of [[cricket]] as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learng the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny. This story is inspired by Anmol.\n\n''Lagaan'' received critical acclaim and awards at [[List of film festivals|international film festivals]], as well as many Indian film awards. It became the third [[Indian film]] to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] after ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957) and ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' (1988).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nIn a small town, Champaner, during the height of the [[British Raj]] in 1893, Captain Andrew Russell ([[Paul Blackthorne]]), the commanding officer of the Champaner [[cantonment]], has imposed high taxes (\"Lagaan\") on people from the local villages. They are unable to pay due to losses caused by a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan ([[Aamir Khan]]), the villagers pay a visit to [[Raja]] Puran Singh ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) to seek his help. Near the palace, they witness a [[Cricket in India|cricket]] match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into an argument with one of the British officers who insults them. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province for three years if the villagers can defeat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times their current taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villagers in the province, despite their dissent.\n\nBhuvan begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only three people willing to join the team. Tipu, Bagha, and Guran. He is aided in his efforts by Russell's sister Elizabeth ([[Rachel Shelley]]), who feels that her brother mistreated the villagers. Eventually, Goli and Ishwar Kaka join Bhuvan's team. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri ([[Gracy Singh]]), who is also in love with him. After Elizabeth and Ram Singh take their leave, Bhuvan and the villagers start practicing. Guran tosses the  ball towards Goli and accidentally hits him smack on his forehead. Goli whirls it back to Guran and it zooms past him and eventually lands on Bhura's chickens. So Bhura asks threateningly, \"Who threw this ball?!\" Tipu replies, \"Goli Chacha did!\" To this, Bhura start to pick another fight with Goli and tries to throw a huge rock at him. Goli gets his slingshot out. While Ishwar tries to break up the fight, Bhuvan says, \"Hey, Bhura!,\" and then throws the ball to Bhura. He catches it. Bhuvan then takes the ball from Bhura and throws it to him again and once again Bhura catches it. Bhura then agrees to join the cricket team if they'll promise to look after his chickens. Meanwhile, at the cantonment, Captain Russell reports to Colonel J.R. Boyer's office. Boyer understands that Russell has agreed to cancel the tax of the farmers of Champaneer if they beat him in a game of cricket. To this, Boyer, Major Cotton and Major Warren are furious. Boyer decides to only make Russell's unfair whim fair by saying, \"If you win, you will have a narrow escape, but if you lose,  you will pay the taxes for Champaneer and the entire province out of your own pocket, and then you'll be packed off to Central Africa! Is that clear?\" Russell says yes and is dismissed. He returns to the cantonment gets all huffy at Lieutenant Wesson. Smith asks Russell what's the matter and Russell claim that the British Empire has lost their sense of Adventure. Arjan, who is nailing a horseshoe on Russell's horse, overhears Russell say \"What's the matter with a little fun and games along with the Lagaan?\" He pounds the nail into the horse's shoe with the hammer and the horse shrieks. Russell responds by horse-whipping and kicking Arjan. Then he looks Arjan dead in the eyes and says, \"You bloody slaves are going to be crushed under our boots!\" Arjan says back, \"No matter how thick the soul is the nail will still happen to prick, sir!\" Russell orders Arjan away from him. Arjan goes to Bhuvan and joins the team. Later that day, Ismael also joins the team. That night, all the villagers and Elizabeth celebrate Krishna's birthday. Bhuvan and Gauri play the parts of Krishna and Radha while dancing merrily with the other villagers. Elizabeth, who alongside Gauri is in love with Bhuvan, is still a good sport about it and compliments Gauri's dancing. After Bhuvan reciprocates Gauri's feelings, the woodcutter Lakha ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]), who is in love with Gauri, grows jealous of Bhuvan and becomes a spy for Russell. He orders Lakha to join the villagers' team but not contribute in any way. Short one player, Bhuvan invites an [[Dalit|untouchable]], Kachra ([[Aditya Lakhia]]), who can bowl spin. The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers and convinces them to accept Kachra.\n\nOn the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra to bowl only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball&nbsp;\u2014 new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (which the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha [[Match fixing|deliberately drops many catches]]. Later that evening, Elizabeth notices Lakha meeting with Russell and immediately informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.\n\nThe next day Lakha redeems himself by taking a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score 295 runs, losing only three [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl with a now-worn ball, and takes a [[hat-trick]], which sparks the collapse of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings after the British are dismissed for 322 runs. Bhuvan and Deva ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), a Sikh who has played cricket earlier when he was a British [[sepoy]], give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. Next comes Arjan who starts off very well on the first two bats, then Smith walks up to him and threatens him by saying, \"You won't have a morsel to eat! Nor a piece of cloth to wear!\" This only makes him stronger and bat harder. As Smith's threatening words echo through his head he bats the ball further outside the field. Russell's words of terror from the cantonment then echo through his head and he bats the ball hard but North catches it. Russel decides to get revenge for Lakha\u2019s betrayal, and when Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Bagha comes in strong and hits the first two balls and misses the third and final one. Ismail retires hurt as he is hit on the leg. Ishwar tries to cover for Ismael, but the ball knocks the bat right out of his hand. Smith and Burton both yell, \"How's that?!\" The umpire shakes his head no. The villagers' team ends the day with six batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board. In desperation, the villagers pray for success.\n\nOn the third and final day, Bhuvan passes his [[century (cricket)|century]], while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and passes his half-century, reducing the target to 28 runs of 16 balls. The game comes down to the last [[over (cricket)|over]] with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals [[no-ball]]. Bhuvan returns to bat and hits the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell runs backwards and catches it, believing that his team has won, until he realises that he has caught the ball on the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.\n\nBhuvan's defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the cantonment. In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realizing that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London. Heartbroken, she remains unmarried for the rest of her life. It is revealed, during the [[epilogue]], that Bhuvan and Gauri get married. But despite the historic triumph, Bhuvan's name was lost in the pages of history.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Bhuvan. Ashutosh first thought of having [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Bobby Deol]] and [[Abhishek Bachchan]] for the role of Bhuvan. After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with [[J. P.

Gowariker went to Aamir, who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script. Even after securing Khan, Ashutosh had trouble finding a producer.

After searching through Rajasthan, Nasik, UP, they zeroed in on an ancient village near [[Bhuj]], located in [[Gujarat]]'s [[Kutch District|Kutch]] district, by May 1999, where the film was primarily shot.<ref name=\"location\">{{cite news|accessdate=6 November 2009 |url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/reviews/2007/chale-chalo-review-180607.html |title=Chale Chalo \u2013 Review |date=18 June 2007 |last=Malani |first=Gaurav |publisher=oneindia.in |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228231642/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/reviews/2007/chale-chalo-review-180607.html |archivedate=28 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe script demanded a dry location: an agricultural village where it had not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles.<ref name=\"aamir_intw1\"/> Kutch faced the same problems at that time and hence the village of Kunariya, located a few miles away from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of ''Lagaan'', it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year.<ref name=\"gracy\"/> The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew.<ref name=\"location\"/> The [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]] devastated this region and displaced many locals.

As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due to the lack of comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought to take care of the crew's needs.<ref name=\"aamir_intw3\"/> Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers.

{"title_page": "List of State Basketball League champions", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nEvery year around late August and early September, [[Basketball Western Australia]] hosts a [[grand final]] weekend for the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) to determine the champion teams of the Women's SBL and Men's SBL. The current format of the WSBL championship game on the Friday night and the MSBL championship game on the Saturday night has been in place since 2001. All Grand Finals have been played in a one-game championship decider, except in 1995 when a best-of-three series was introduced for both competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sbl.asn.au/past-champions/|title=PAST CHAMPIONS|work=SBL.asn.au|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nUp until 1990, the event was held at [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. Then between 1991 and 1999, the event was held at the much larger [[HBF Stadium|Challenge Stadium]] (known as Perth Superdrome between 1991\u201396). The Grand Finals returned to Perry Lakes in 2000, with Perry Lakes remaining the grand final host venue until 2009. In August 2010, Basketball Western Australia hosted their first State Basketball League Grand Finals at the new home of basketball, the $40 million [[Bendat Basketball Centre|WA Basketball Centre]] (later renamed Bendat Basketball Centre in 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basketballwa.asn.au/blog/2010/08/09/sbl-grand-final-tickets-now-on-sale/|title=SBL GRAND FINAL TICKETS NOW ON

lists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nEvery year around late August and early September, [[Basketball Western Australia]] hosts a [[grand final]] weekend for the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) to determine the champion teams of the Women's SBL and Men's SBL. The current format of the WSBL championship game on the Friday night and the MSBL championship game on the Saturday night has been in place since 2001. All Grand Finals have been played in a one-game championship decider, except in 1995 when a best-of-three series was introduced for both competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sbl.asn.au/past-champions/|title=PAST CHAMPIONS|work=SBL.asn.au|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nUp until 1990, the event was held at [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. Then between 1991 and 1999, the event was held at the much larger [[HBF Stadium|Challenge Stadium]] (known as Perth Superdrome between 1991\u201396). The Grand Finals returned to Perry Lakes in 2000, with Perry Lakes remaining the grand final host venue until 2009. In August 2010, Basketball Western Australia hosted their first State Basketball League Grand Finals at the new home of basketball, the $40 million [[Bendat Basketball Centre|WA Basketball Centre]] (later renamed Bendat Basketball Centre in 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basketballwa.asn.au/blog/2010/08/09/sbl-grand-final-tickets-now-on-sale/|title=SBL GRAND FINAL TICKETS NOW ON
