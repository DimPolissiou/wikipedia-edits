Alec takes Nova in after her parents are viciously murdered by another villain gang (The Roaches) before the civil war, and was raised by the Anarchists. She can put people to sleep with skin-to-skin contact, and since her parents' murder, she has not slept at all. She wants revenge on the Renegades for not protecting her parents as promised, and leads an infiltration into their headquarters by posing as a Renegade-in-training.\nIt's a great series! i dare you to read it...\n\nIt also follows Adrian, the son of the leaders of the Renegades, Hugh Everhart (alias: Captain Chromium) and Simon Westwood (alias: Dread Warden). He was adopted by the two leaders after his mother, another member of the core-Renegades, was killed. He brings Nova onto his team at Renegades headquarters as she poses as 'Insomnia.'\n\n=== The World of ''Renegades'' ===\n''Renegades'' takes place in Gatlon (a fictional city), in the aftermath of a civil war between the Renegades and the Anarchists known as the Battle for Gatlon. Both are groups of people with superpowers, known as prodigies, in which some were born with powers with numerous capabilities. The Renegades consider themselves superheroes\u2014fighting for the greater good. The Anarchists are the most powerful of many villain gangs, and consider themselves the super-villains. The Renegades have beat the Anarchists, causing them to go into hiding. The remaining Anarchists after the civil war live in the old tunnel of the city's subway system, in order to live their lives in the rule of the Renegades.\n\n==Plot==\n10 years before the events of the book, 6-year-old Nova Artino watches as her parents are killed by a villain gang's hitman, and hears him shoot her baby sister, Evie\u2014dead. However, before he can shoot her, she uses her gift of putting people to sleep to cause him to faint. Her uncle Alec comes and reveals to Nova he is Ace Anarchy, the leader of the Anarchists, before killing the hitman.\n\nTen years later, Ace has been killed at the Battle of Gatlon, and Nova is at a Renegade parade, on a secret anarchist mission to kill Captain Chromium. She believes that, because he is invincible, the only way to kill him is to shoot him directly in the eye with a poison dart. While at the parade, a young prodigy steals a bracelet that belonged to Nova's mother. But Adrian, the son of the Renegades' founders, gets it back, and fixes the broken clasp on it with his ability to bring to life whatever he draws. Later, Nova disguises herself as her alias, Nightmare, to kill the Captain. But after a moment of hesitation, Nova fails to hit the Captain's eye. After a brief struggle with several Renegades, including Danna Bell (Monarch), and Ruby Tucker (Red Assassin), someone in an armored suit comes to face off against Nightmare: the Sentinel, who is later revealed to be Adrian. During the fight, the Puppeteer (Winston Pratt) intervenes, which results in his capture and Nightmare's escape.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Anarchists ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Alias\n!Name\n!superpower\n!Relations\n|-\n|'''Nightmare'''\n|Nova Artino\n|Tranquilization (can put others to sleep through skin contact), never sleeps (Insomnia)\n|Niece to Ace Anarchy\n|-\n|'''Ace Anarchy'''\n|Alec Artino\n|Telekinesis\n|Uncle to Nightmare (Nova Artino)\n|-\n|'''Cyanide'''\n|Leroy Flinn\n|Generates chemicals, acids & poisons, through skin\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Queen Bee'''\n|Honey Harper\n|Anthophilia (controls bees)\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Detonator'''\n|Ingrid Thompson\n|Generates explosive spheres\n|Anarchist (deceased)\n|-\n|'''Phobia'''\n|Unknown\n|Control over fear and shadows; can transform into anyone's worst fear\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Puppeteer'''\n|Winston Pratt\n|Possession (powers were neutralized in ''Archenemies'')\n|N/A\n|}\n\n=== Renegades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Alias\n!Name\n!Superpower\n!Relations\n|-\n|'''Sketch'''\n|Adrian Everhart\n|Creates objects from his drawings. \n|Biological son of Georgia Rawles, adopted by Hugh Everhart and Simon Westwood\n|-\n|'''Red Assassin'''\n|Ruby Tucker\n|Hemo-transformation (can turn exposed blood into crystal)\n|Patrol team with Adrian, Oscar, and Danna\n|-\n|'''Smokescreen'''\n|Oscar Silva\n|Can generate smoke and vapor and can also control them\n|Patrol team with Adrian, Ruby, and Danna\n|-\n|'''Monarch'''\n|Danna Bell\n|Metamorphosis; can morph into a swarm of monarch butterflies\n|Patrol team with Adrian, Oscar, and Ruby\n|-\n|'''The Bandit'''\n|Max Everhart\n|Absorption; absorbs other prodigies' powers\n|Adopted by Hugh Everhart and Simon Westwood\n|}\n\n=== Renegade Council ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Alias\n!Name\n!Superpower\n!Relations\n|-\n|'''Captain Chronium'''\n|Hugh Everhart\n|Invincibility, superstrength, generates and manipulates chromium\n\n|Married to Simon, adopted father of Adrian\n|-\n|'''The Dread Warden'''\n|Simon Westwood\n|Invisibility\n|Married to Hugh, adopted father to Adrian\n|-\n|'''Lady Indomitable'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Renegades|last=Meyer|first=Marissa|publisher=Feiwel & Friends|year=2017|isbn=9781250044662|location=|pages=150-152}}</ref>\n|Georgia Rawles\n|Levitation/flight\n|Biological mother to Adrian (Deceased)\n|-\n|'''Tsunami'''\n|Kasumi Hasegawa\n|Water manipulation\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Thunderbird'''\n|Tamaya Rae\n|Control over lightning/thunder, can fly (has wings)(Scared of Snakes)\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Blacklight'''\n|Evander Wade\n|Light manipulation\n|N/A\n|}\n\n== Publicity ==\nPublicity for ''Renegades'' included social media posts on Meyer's Twitter account, chapter releases, as well as a cover reveal with the ''LA Times''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/marissa_meyer/status/864268787121627136|title=HAVE YOU SEEN?!
