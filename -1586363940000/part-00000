It operates heavily within [[labour syndicate]]s, [[trade unions]] and [[workers' movement]]s, emphasizing the liberation of workers through [[class struggle]].\n\n=== Mutualism ===\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]]]\nMutualism emerged from early 19th century socialism and is generally considered a market-oriented strand within the libertarian socialist tradition. Originally developed by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], mutualism typically accepts property rights, but with brief abandonment time periods. In a community in which mutuality property rules were upheld, a landowner would need to make continuous use of the land. If failing to do so, the ownership rights would be extinguished and the land could be homesteaded by someone else. A mutualist property regime is often described as one rooted in [[Personal property|possession]], occupancy-and-use, or [[usufruct]].<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph.

Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized, being made the joint property of the commune (municipality). This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of armed insurrection, or [[propaganda by the deed]], which would inspire the workers and peasants as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.<ref name=\"Patsouras-p54\"/>\n\nCollectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed \"according to need\" as in [[anarcho-communism]].

Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a trade union centered anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution.

It is in many ways identical to specifism (''especifismo'') and has an antecedent in the work of [[Mikhail Bakunin]], advocating a strategy of \"organisational dualism\" which entails: (1) building specifically anarchist organisations with a general agreement on ideas and practices; and (2) anarchists working within broader popular organisations and movements that aren't specifically anarchist, hoping to maintain theoretical consistency as well as pushing popular movements in a more anarchistic direction from within.\n\nPlatformist/specifist groups reject the model of Leninist vanguardism.

This usually entails a willingness to work in single-issue campaigns, trade unionism and community groups and to fight for immediate reforms while linking this to a project of building popular consciousness and organisation.

It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon, the means of production are owned by the workers. The underlying values that Parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, workers' self-management and efficiency (efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets). It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable credit which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.\n\nParpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany Parecon. The values on which parpolity is based are freedom, self-management, justice, solidarity and tolerance. According to Shalom, the goal is to create a political system that will allow people to participate as much as possible in a face to face manner. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and [[capitalism]] arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of nested councils which would include every adult member of a given society. With five levels of nested councils it is thought, could represent the population of the United States.\n\nUnder participism, the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates, who would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.\n\n=== Social ecology and Communalism ===\n{{main|Communalism|Social ecology (theory)|l2=Social ecology}}\n[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Murray Bookchin]]]]\nSocial ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]] and influenced by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]].

While originally conceived as a form of social anarchism, he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology that incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism and radical ecology.\n\nPolitically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions that are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics\u2014especially municipal elections\u2014as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and anti-statist in outlook.\n\nEconomically, Communalism favours the abolition of markets and money and the transition to an economy similar to [[libertarian communism]] and according to the principle \"From each according to his ability, to each according to needs\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[:Category:Social anarchists|Social anarchists]] (category)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Commonscat-inline}}\n\n{{anarchism}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Social Anarchism}}\n[[Category:Anarchism]]\n[[Category:Anarchist schools of thought]]\n[[Category:Anarcho-communism]]\n[[Category:Anarcho-syndicalism]]\n[[Category:Communalism]]\n[[Category:Communism]]\n[[Category:Left-libertarianism]]\n[[Category:Libertarianism]]\n[[Category:Libertarian socialism]]\n[[Category:Libertarian theory]]\n[[Category:Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n[[Category:Platformism]]\n[[Category:Social anarchism| ]]\n[[Category:Social ecology]]\n[[Category:Socialism]]\n[[Category:Types of socialism]]\n[[Category:Syndicalism]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|branch of anarchism emphasizing mass working-class organizations and mutual aid}}\n{{about|the branch of anarchism emphasizing social ownership and mutual aid|anarchist and libertarian political philosophies within the socialist movement|Libertarian socialism|the journal|Social Anarchism (journal)}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n{{libertarianism sidebar}}\n'''Social anarchism'''<ref>Baldelli, Giovanni (1971).

In a community in which mutuality property rules were upheld, a landowner would need to make continuous use of the land.

It is in many ways identical to specifism (''especifismo'') and has an antecedent in the work of [[Mikhail Bakunin]], advocating a strategy of \"organisational dualism\" which entails: (1) building specifically anarchist organisations with a general agreement on ideas and practices; and (2) anarchists working within broader popular organisations and movements that aren't specifically anarchist, hoping to maintain theoretical consistency as well as pushing popular movements in a more anarchistic direction from within.\n\nPlatformist/specifist groups reject the model of Leninist vanguardism.

This usually entails a willingness to work in single-issue campaigns, trade unionism and community groups and to fight for immediate reforms while linking this to a project of building popular consciousness and organisation. They therefore reject approaches that they believe will prevent this, such as [[insurrectionist anarchism]], as well as \"views that dismiss activity in the unions\" or that dismiss anti-imperialist movements.<ref name=\"Anarkismo statement\">Anarkismo, 2012, [http://www.anarkismo.net/about_us \"About Us\"].

The theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy (ID; as distinguished from the political project that is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions) emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.\n\nAccording to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' \"offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism\".<ref>Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 \"Beyond Social Democracy?

It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon, the means of production are owned by the workers. The underlying values that Parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, workers' self-management and efficiency (efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets). It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable credit which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.\n\nParpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany Parecon. The values on which parpolity is based are freedom, self-management, justice, solidarity and tolerance. According to Shalom, the goal is to create a political system that will allow people to participate as much as possible in a face to face manner. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and [[capitalism]] arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of nested councils which would include every adult member of a given society. With five levels of nested councils it is thought, could represent the population of the United States.\n\nUnder participism, the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates, who would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.\n\n=== Social ecology and Communalism ===\n{{main|Communalism|Social ecology (theory)|l2=Social ecology}}\n[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Murray Bookchin]]]]\nSocial ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]] and influenced by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Social ecologists assert that the present [[ecological crisis]] has its roots in human social problems and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bookchin|first=Murray|title=The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism|year=1994|pages=119\u2013120|publisher=Black Rose Books|isbn=978-1-55164-018-1}}</ref>\n\nBookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology that he called Communalism (spelled with a capital C to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of social anarchism, he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology that incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism and radical ecology.\n\nPolitically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions that are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics\u2014especially municipal elections\u2014as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and anti-statist in outlook.\n\nEconomically, Communalism favours the abolition of markets and money and the transition to an economy similar to [[libertarian communism]] and according to the principle \"From each according to his ability, to each according to needs\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[:Category:Social anarchists|Social anarchists]] (category)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Commonscat-inline}}\n\n{{anarchism}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Social Anarchism}}\n[[Category:Anarchism]]\n[[Category:Anarchist schools of thought]]\n[[Category:Anarcho-communism]]\n[[Category:Anarcho-syndicalism]]\n[[Category:Communalism]]\n[[Category:Communism]]\n[[Category:Left-libertarianism]]\n[[Category:Libertarianism]]\n[[Category:Libertarian socialism]]\n[[Category:Libertarian theory]]\n[[Category:Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n[[Category:Platformism]]\n[[Category:Social anarchism| ]]\n[[Category:Social ecology]]\n[[Category:Socialism]]\n[[Category:Types of socialism]]\n[[Category:Syndicalism]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anarchism"}

Golwalkar]] \u2013 founder of [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], a Hindu nationalist organisation\n\nThe [[Partition of India|1947 Partition of India]] gave rise to bloody rioting and indiscriminate inter-communal killing of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs. Around 7.5 million Muslims were moved and left for [[West Pakistan]] and [[East Pakistan]] (now known as [[Bangladesh]]) and 7.2 million Hindus and Sikhs moved to India. This was a major factor in fueling Hindu,Sikh-Muslim animosity. What followed over the years was the laying of secular principles in the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]]. The last 60 years have been seemingly peaceful in most parts of the country except with the notable exception of communal riots in [[Bombay riots|1992 Bombay riots]] following the demolition of Babri mosque by extremists and [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. \n\n[[Andhra Pradesh]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast of India]] are some of the regions where conversion is prevalent. In response to the activities of Christian missionaries in India, hardline Hindu groups like Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have aggressively started reconversion of converted Christians as well as Muslims back to Hinduism. The Hindus still form the majority community in most states and territories of the country. Most of the northern and north-western India, especially [[Gujarat]] remains the stronghold of Hinduism. There is even reason to believe that Hinduism is growing through the incorporation of tribal belief-systems in specific areas of the northeast. However, in the [[Kashmir Valley]], the Hindu population has plummeted as an outcome of the terrorism when more than 550,000 members of [[Kashmiri Pandit]] community were forced to leave the valley (mass exodus) by Islamist insurgents.

Golwalkar]] \u2013 founder of [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], a Hindu nationalist organisation\n\nThe [[Partition of India|1947 Partition of India]] gave rise to bloody rioting and indiscriminate inter-communal killing of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs. Around 7.5 million Muslims were moved and left for [[West Pakistan]] and [[East Pakistan]] (now known as [[Bangladesh]]) and 7.2 million Hindus and Sikhs moved to India. This was a major factor in fueling Hindu,Sikh-Muslim animosity. What followed over the years was the laying of secular principles in the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]]. The last 60 years have been seemingly peaceful in most parts of the country except with the notable exception of communal riots in [[Bombay riots|1992 Bombay riots]] following the demolition of Babri mosque by extremists and [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. \n\n[[Andhra Pradesh]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast of India]] are some of the regions where conversion is prevalent. In response to the activities of Christian missionaries in India, hardline Hindu groups like Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have aggressively started reconversion of converted Christians as well as Muslims back to Hinduism. The Hindus still form the majority community in most states and territories of the country. Most of the northern and north-western India, especially [[Gujarat]] remains the stronghold of Hinduism. There is even reason to believe that Hinduism is growing through the incorporation of tribal belief-systems in specific areas of the northeast. However, in the [[Kashmir Valley]], the Hindu population has plummeted as an outcome of the terrorism when more than 550,000 members of [[Kashmiri Pandit]] community were forced to leave the valley (mass exodus) by Islamist insurgents. In [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], the [[Sikhs]] form the majority population.\n\n==Demographics==\n'''Decline of Hinduism in India'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Year'''\n! '''Percent'''\n!
