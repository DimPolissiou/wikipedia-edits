While [[Soldier Field]] in [[Chicago]] is older, it was not the home of the Bears until [[1971 Chicago Bears season|1971]] and the team did not play there during stadium renovations in 2002. Only the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[Fenway Park]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]] at Wrigley Field have longer active home-field tenures in American professional sports.\n\n==History==\n===Packers seek a modern facility===\nSince 1925, the Packers had played at 25,000-seat [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]], located behind [[Green Bay East High School]]. However, by the 1950s, it was considered inadequate for the times. It was built almost entirely of wood, and East High's locker room facilities were considered inadequate even in the 1920s; visiting teams often dressed before the game at the [[Hotel Northland]], where the Packers' opponents stayed at the time. The stadium could not be expanded. East High's location ruled out any expansion to the south, and it could not be expanded to the north or east due to its location along the [[East River (Wisconsin)|East River]].\n\nOfficials in [[Milwaukee]], {{convert|120|mi}} to the south, where the Packers had played part of their schedule since 1933, knew that City Stadium was less than ideal as an NFL venue. They built [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in 1953 in hopes of luring the Packers there full-time. As originally built, County Stadium was double the size of City Stadium.\n\nSoon after County Stadium opened, the other NFL owners threatened to force the Packers to move to Milwaukee unless they built a new stadium. In August 1955, the Packers announced plans for a new stadium in Green Bay, with a seating capacity of 32,000.<ref name=ngspbpk>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SAkkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qCUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7079%2C4861047 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=United Press |title=New grid stadium planned by Packers |date=August 25, 1955 |page=18\u2013part 2}}</ref> In April 1956, Green Bay voters responded by approving (70.3%) a bond issue to finance the new stadium.<ref name=bvabyos>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nAQqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rSYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5155%2C2261763 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=United Press |title=Bay votes a big 'yes' on stadium |date=April 4, 1956 |page=17\u2013part 2}}</ref><ref name=gbdytns>{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1956/04/04/page/53/article/green-bay-says-yes-to-new-stadium |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Green Bay says yes to new stadium |date=April 4, 1956 |page=3, part 4 }}</ref> The original cost in 1957 was $960,000 (paid off in 1978) and its [[seating capacity]] was 32,500.\n\nThe new stadium was the first modern stadium built specifically for an NFL franchise.

It was to be paid for partly by the team via the 1997\u201398 stock sale, which netted more than $20&nbsp;million. Most of the proceeds were to be paid through a 0.5% sales tax in [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] and [[personal seat license]] fees on [[season ticket]] holders. After their plan won approval by the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]], it was ratified by Brown County voters on September 12, 2000 by a 53%\u201347% margin. Construction began early in 2001.

The system is also used in some soccer stadiums where shade from stands and partial roofs are a problem for the turf, not the cold and short growing season found in Green Bay.<ref name=\"Branch, John\"/>\n\n===Titletown, USA===\nMore famously a nickname for the city than its football field, \"Titletown, USA\" became popularized in 1961, even before [[Vince Lombardi]] won any of his championships. At the [[1961 NFL Championship Game]] against the [[New York Giants]], which the Packers won 37\u20130, fans hung up signs around the stadium that read ''Welcome to Titletown, USA''. Then-Giants quarterback [[Y. A. Tittle]] joked that the honor was for him, just that his name was misspelled. By the mid-60s, Titletown, USA was registered as a trademark of the Green Bay Packers, Inc. Lambeau Field has been home to seven NFL world championship seasons, five under Lombardi, one under [[Mike Holmgren]] and one under [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], surpassing the six world championship seasons witnessed by its predecessor, [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]], under Curly Lambeau.\n\n==Postseason==\n[[Image:LambeauFieldAtriumInside.jpg|thumb|right|The Atrium inside Lambeau Field]]\nLambeau Field has frequently given a significant postseason [[home-field advantage]] for the Packers. Playoff games at Lambeau Field typically feature cold Wisconsin winters. The most famous example is the aforementioned [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]]. More recently, in the [[NFL playoffs, 1997|1997 NFL playoffs]] both the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the divisional playoffs and the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] in the [[NFL playoffs, 1996-97#Conference championships|NFC Championship Game]] struggled to adapt to the muddy and the cold conditions respectively. The temperatures during the [[National Football League playoffs, 2007-08#NFC: New York Giants 23, Green Bay Packers 20 (OT)|2007]] [[NFC Championship Game]] (in which the Packers lost in OT, 23\u201320, to the [[New York Giants]]) reached as low as {{convert|-4|F}}, with a wind chill of {{convert|-24|F|}}. From its opening in [[1957 Green Bay Packers season|1957]] until January 2003, when they fell 27\u20137 to the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], the Packers had never lost a postseason game at Lambeau Field. However, the Packers hosted just one postseason game (in the ad-hoc round-of-16 in the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]) during a lean stretch of 27 years between the [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]] of [[1967 NFL season|1967]] and a wild-card game in December 1994. Although the Packers have won only six of their last ten playoff games at Lambeau Field, their overall home post-season record is a respectable 17\u20135. The stadium has hosted five championship contests: three NFL title games in [[NFL Championship Game, 1961|1961]], [[NFL Championship Game, 1965|1965]] and [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|1967]] (the \"Ice Bowl\"); two NFC championships after the 1996 and 2007 seasons.\n\n==Traditions==\n===The \"Lambeau Leap\"===\n[[File:James Stark doing the Lambeau Leap (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[James Starks]] doing the \"Lambeau Leap\"]]\nMany Packer players will jump into the end zone stands after scoring a touchdown, in a celebration affectionately known as the \"Lambeau Leap\". The Lambeau Leap was invented by safety [[LeRoy Butler]], who scored after a [[Reggie White]] fumble recovery and lateral against the [[Oakland Raiders|L.A. Raiders]] on December 26, [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|1993]]. It was later popularized by wide receiver [[Robert Brooks]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://uscsports.cstv.com/trads/scar-hof.html|publisher=University of South Carolina Athletics|accessdate=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716190211/http://uscsports.cstv.com/trads/scar-hof.html|archive-date=July 16, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.packersnews.com/print/print_11238108.shtml Lambeau Field Timeline] Green Bay Packers news</ref>\n\nIt's not known precisely when the celebration was first coined the \"Lambeau Leap\", but one of the first possible mentions was by broadcaster [[Al Michaels]], who mentioned during a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1996, \"It's a new tradition in Green Bay, Robert Brooks ''leaping'' into the stands.\"\n\nWhen the NFL banned [[Touchdown celebration|excessive celebrations]] in 2000, the Lambeau Leap was [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] into the new rules, permitting it to continue.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10671807/nfl-penalize-goal-post-dunk-next-season \"Goalpost dunks will draw flags\"].

The live band has been replaced by recorded music.\n\nThe Packers intro music for when they are introduced before each game is \"[[Get Ready for This]]\" by [[2 Unlimited]]. [[Public address|PA announcer]] Bill Jartz (also the main [[news anchor]] for [[WBAY-TV]] (Channel 2)), accompanies this by saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen, here are your 13-time World Champion Green Bay Packers.\"\n\nWhenever the Packers score a touchdown, the [[Todd Rundgren]] hit \"[[Bang the Drum All Day]]\" is played. This tradition began in 1985.\n\nThe \"Go Pack Go\" jingle is usually played when the team is on defense or during the start of a drive on offense. A song built around this jingle is \"Go Pack Go!\" by The 6 Packers.\n\nThe [[House of Pain]] hit \"[[Jump Around]]\" is often played during one time-out at Lambeau, resulting in widespread jumping around by the crowd. This tradition began due to the popularity of the same song/[[Jump Around#University of Wisconsin-Madison|crowd-participation tradition]] at [[Wisconsin Badgers football|University of Wisconsin]] football games.\n\nThe [[Papa Roach]] hit \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\" is played twice during every home game.\n\nThe [[polka]] standard \"[[Beer Barrel Polka]]\" (also known as \"Roll Out The Barrel\") is also played at Lambeau Field, usually in the fourth quarter of games. \"[[I Gotta Feeling]]\" by [[the Black Eyed Peas]] is played when the Packers win a game.\n\n===Packers shareholders meeting===\nWith the 1997\u201398 sale of stock in the [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.|Packers corporation]], swelling the number of owners to over 112,000, a large venue was needed for the annual shareholders meeting. The event returned to Lambeau Field in 2006 after several thousand people were turned away from the 2005 meeting at the nearby [[Resch Center]].\n\n===High school and college football===\nWhen built, Lambeau Field was also slated to be used by schools of the [[Green Bay Area Public School District]], as old City Stadium had been. However, a key [[1962 NFL season|1962]] game between the [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] and [[1962 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] was affected when two high schools played in the rain the preceding Friday, damaging the field. After that, Lombardi asked the schools to avoid using Lambeau, though [[Green Bay Southwest High School|Southwest]] and [[Green Bay West High School|West]] continued to play there until a west side high school stadium was built in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, the championship game for the Wisconsin Independent Schools Athletic Association (until 2000, the [[Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association|WIAA]]-equivalent organization for the state's private and religious high schools) was played at Lambeau. The last high school game played at Lambeau was a WIAA semifinal between Green Bay West and [[Waukesha North High School|Waukesha North]], with the latter team the victor and going on to [[Camp Randall Stadium|Madison]] for the divisional championship game. In 1982 and 1983, [[St. Norbert College]] hosted [[Fordham University]] (Lombardi's [[alma mater]]) in two [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] tilts, benefitting the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation.<ref name=\"nytcarmexclassic\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/lambeau-field-gives-college-football-a-try.html|title=Lambeau Field Gives Football the Old College Try|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=September 1, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}</ref> The first was held on November 20, 1982 and the second was November 19, 1983.

In 2005 the snowmobile racing event took place over the grass, with the right amount of snow cover.\n\n===Concerts===\nDue to the small size of the surrounding population, not many concerts are held at Lambeau Field because the primary use of the stadium is football.

While [[Soldier Field]] in [[Chicago]] is older, it was not the home of the Bears until [[1971 Chicago Bears season|1971]] and the team did not play there during stadium renovations in 2002. Only the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[Fenway Park]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]] at Wrigley Field have longer active home-field tenures in American professional sports.\n\n==History==\n===Packers seek a modern facility===\nSince 1925, the Packers had played at 25,000-seat [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]], located behind [[Green Bay East High School]]. However, by the 1950s, it was considered inadequate for the times. It was built almost entirely of wood, and East High's locker room facilities were considered inadequate even in the 1920s; visiting teams often dressed before the game at the [[Hotel Northland]], where the Packers' opponents stayed at the time. The stadium could not be expanded. East High's location ruled out any expansion to the south, and it could not be expanded to the north or east due to its location along the [[East River (Wisconsin)|East River]]. \n\nOfficials in [[Milwaukee]], {{convert|120|mi}} to the south, where the Packers had played part of their schedule since 1933, knew that City Stadium was less than ideal as an NFL venue. They built [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in 1953 in hopes of luring the Packers there full-time. As originally built, County Stadium was double the size of City Stadium.\n\nSoon after County Stadium opened, the other NFL owners threatened to force the Packers to move to Milwaukee unless they built a new stadium. In August 1955, the Packers announced plans for a new stadium in Green Bay, with a seating capacity of 32,000.<ref name=ngspbpk>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SAkkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qCUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7079%2C4861047 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=United Press |title=New grid stadium planned by Packers |date=August 25, 1955 |page=18\u2013part 2}}</ref> In April 1956, Green Bay voters responded by approving (70.3%) a bond issue to finance the new stadium.<ref name=bvabyos>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nAQqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rSYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5155%2C2261763 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=United Press |title=Bay votes a big 'yes' on stadium |date=April 4, 1956 |page=17\u2013part 2}}</ref><ref name=gbdytns>{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1956/04/04/page/53/article/green-bay-says-yes-to-new-stadium |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Green Bay says yes to new stadium |date=April 4, 1956 |page=3, part 4 }}</ref> The original cost in 1957 was $960,000 (paid off in 1978) and its [[seating capacity]] was 32,500.\n\nThe new stadium was the first modern stadium built specifically for an NFL franchise. At the time, the eleven other NFL teams were playing either in facilities shared with [[Major League Baseball|major league]] [[baseball]] teams, or in other pre-existing shared facilities.\n\nThe site, now bordered on three sides by the village of [[Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin|Ashwaubenon]], was selected because it had a natural slope, ideal for creating the bowl shape, along with expansive parking.

Starting in [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|1995]], expansions to Lambeau Field (see below) made it financially realistic for the Packers to play their entire regular season in Green Bay for the first time in over 60 years. Former Milwaukee ticket holders receive tickets to a [[preseason]] game and games 2 and 5 of the regular season home schedule, in what is referred to as the \"[[Gold (color)|Gold]] package\".

Rather than build a new stadium, Chairman/CEO [[Bob Harlan]] and President/COO John Jones unveiled a $295 million plan to renovate Lambeau Field in January 2000. It was to be paid for partly by the team via the 1997\u201398 stock sale, which netted more than $20 million. Most of the proceeds were to be paid through a 0.5% sales tax in [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] and [[personal seat license]] fees on [[season ticket]] holders. After their plan won approval by the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]], it was ratified by Brown County voters on September 12, 2000 by a 53%\u201347% margin. Construction began early in 2001.

The new setup was made to be easier for fans to get to Curly's as it was difficult for fans in the past.\n\nPhase II also included the following:\n\n*The Oneida Nation gate was given an expanded plaza extending into the east parking lot. A tunnel under the plaza leads to a player parking area immediately east of the player facilities.

The system is also used in some soccer stadiums where shade from stands and partial roofs are a problem for the turf, not the cold and short growing season found in Green Bay.<ref name=\"Branch, John\"/>\n\n===Titletown, USA===\nMore famously a nickname for the city than its football field, \"Titletown, USA\" became popularized in 1961, even before [[Vince Lombardi]] won any of his championships. At the [[1961 NFL Championship Game]] against the [[New York Giants]], which the Packers won 37\u20130, fans hung up signs around the stadium that read ''Welcome to Titletown, USA''. Then-Giants quarterback [[Y. A. Tittle]] joked that the honor was for him, just that his name was misspelled. By the mid-60s, Titletown, USA was registered as a trademark of the Green Bay Packers, Inc. Lambeau Field has been home to seven NFL world championship seasons, five under Lombardi, one under [[Mike Holmgren]] and one under [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], surpassing the six world championship seasons witnessed by its predecessor, [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]], under Curly Lambeau.\n\n==Postseason==\n[[Image:LambeauFieldAtriumInside.jpg|thumb|right|The Atrium inside Lambeau Field]]\nLambeau Field has frequently given a significant postseason [[home-field advantage]] for the Packers. Playoff games at Lambeau Field typically feature cold Wisconsin winters. The most famous example is the aforementioned [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]]. More recently, in the [[NFL playoffs, 1997|1997 NFL playoffs]] both the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the divisional playoffs and the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] in the [[NFL playoffs, 1996-97#Conference championships|NFC Championship Game]] struggled to adapt to the muddy and the cold conditions respectively. The temperatures during the [[National Football League playoffs, 2007-08#NFC: New York Giants 23, Green Bay Packers 20 (OT)|2007]] [[NFC Championship Game]] (in which the Packers lost in OT, 23\u201320, to the [[New York Giants]]) reached as low as {{convert|-4|F}}, with a wind chill of {{convert|-24|F|}}. From its opening in [[1957 Green Bay Packers season|1957]] until January 2003, when they fell 27\u20137 to the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], the Packers had never lost a postseason game at Lambeau Field. However, the Packers hosted just one postseason game (in the ad-hoc round-of-16 in the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]) during a lean stretch of 27 years between the [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]] of [[1967 NFL season|1967]] and a wild-card game in December 1994. Although the Packers have won only six of their last ten playoff games at Lambeau Field, their overall home post-season record is a respectable 17\u20135. The stadium has hosted five championship contests: three NFL title games in [[NFL Championship Game, 1961|1961]], [[NFL Championship Game, 1965|1965]] and [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|1967]] (the \"Ice Bowl\"); two NFC championships after the 1996 and 2007 seasons.\n\n==Traditions==\n===The \"Lambeau Leap\"===\n[[File:James Stark doing the Lambeau Leap (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[James Starks]] doing the \"Lambeau Leap\"]]\nMany Packer players will jump into the end zone stands after scoring a touchdown, in a celebration affectionately known as the \"Lambeau Leap\". The Lambeau Leap was invented by safety [[LeRoy Butler]], who scored after a [[Reggie White]] fumble recovery and lateral against the [[Oakland Raiders|L.A. Raiders]] on December 26, [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|1993]]. It was later popularized by wide receiver [[Robert Brooks]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://uscsports.cstv.com/trads/scar-hof.html|publisher=University of South Carolina Athletics|accessdate=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716190211/http://uscsports.cstv.com/trads/scar-hof.html|archive-date=July 16, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.packersnews.com/print/print_11238108.shtml Lambeau Field Timeline] Green Bay Packers news</ref>\n\nIt's not known precisely when the celebration was first coined the \"Lambeau Leap\", but one of the first possible mentions was by broadcaster [[Al Michaels]], who mentioned during a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1996, \"It's a new tradition in Green Bay, Robert Brooks ''leaping'' into the stands.\"\n\nWhen the NFL banned [[Touchdown celebration|excessive celebrations]] in 2000, the Lambeau Leap was [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] into the new rules, permitting it to continue.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10671807/nfl-penalize-goal-post-dunk-next-season \"Goalpost dunks will draw flags\"].

Packers.com.</ref>\n\nThe [[NFL Network]] countdown program, NFL Top 10, named the Lambeau Leap the 3rd greatest touchdown celebration of all time.\n\n===Stadium music===\n[[Image:LambeauFieldWelcome2007.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome sign]]\nOriginally, music at Lambeau Field was provided by the Packers' [[Lumberjack Band]]. The live band has been replaced by recorded music.\n\nThe Packers intro music for when they are introduced before each game is \"[[Get Ready for This]]\" by [[2 Unlimited]]. [[Public address|PA announcer]] Bill Jartz (also the main [[news anchor]] for [[WBAY-TV]] (Channel 2)), accompanies this by saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen, here are your 13-time World Champion Green Bay Packers.\"\n\nWhenever the Packers score a touchdown, the [[Todd Rundgren]] hit \"[[Bang the Drum All Day]]\" is played. This tradition began in 1985.\n\nThe \"Go Pack Go\" jingle is usually played when the team is on defense or during the start of a drive on offense. A song built around this jingle is \"Go Pack Go!\" by The 6 Packers.\n\nThe [[House of Pain]] hit \"[[Jump Around]]\" is often played during one time-out at Lambeau, resulting in widespread jumping around by the crowd. This tradition began due to the popularity of the same song/[[Jump Around#University of Wisconsin-Madison|crowd-participation tradition]] at [[Wisconsin Badgers football|University of Wisconsin]] football games.\n\nThe [[Papa Roach]] hit \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\" is played twice during every home game.\n\nThe [[polka]] standard \"[[Beer Barrel Polka]]\" (also known as \"Roll Out The Barrel\") is also played at Lambeau Field, usually in the fourth quarter of games. \"[[I Gotta Feeling]]\" by [[the Black Eyed Peas]] is played when the Packers win a game.\n\n===Packers shareholders meeting===\nWith the 1997\u201398 sale of stock in the [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.|Packers corporation]], swelling the number of owners to over 112,000, a large venue was needed for the annual shareholders meeting. The event returned to Lambeau Field in 2006 after several thousand people were turned away from the 2005 meeting at the nearby [[Resch Center]].\n\n===High school and college football===\nWhen built, Lambeau Field was also slated to be used by schools of the [[Green Bay Area Public School District]], as old City Stadium had been. However, a key [[1962 NFL season|1962]] game between the [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] and [[1962 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] was affected when two high schools played in the rain the preceding Friday, damaging the field. After that, Lombardi asked the schools to avoid using Lambeau, though [[Green Bay Southwest High School|Southwest]] and [[Green Bay West High School|West]] continued to play there until a west side high school stadium was built in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, the championship game for the Wisconsin Independent Schools Athletic Association (until 2000, the [[Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association|WIAA]]-equivalent organization for the state's private and religious high schools) was played at Lambeau. The last high school game played at Lambeau was a WIAA semifinal between Green Bay West and [[Waukesha North High School|Waukesha North]], with the latter team the victor and going on to [[Camp Randall Stadium|Madison]] for the divisional championship game. In 1982 and 1983, [[St. Norbert College]] hosted [[Fordham University]] (Lombardi's [[alma mater]]) in two [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] tilts, benefitting the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation.<ref name=\"nytcarmexclassic\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/lambeau-field-gives-college-football-a-try.html|title=Lambeau Field Gives Football the Old College Try|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=September 1, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}</ref> The first was held on November 20, 1982 and the second was November 19, 1983.

The Badgers defeated the Buckeyes 4\u20132 before a capacity crowd of 40,890. There were some problems as the ice began to crack during play, but overall it was a success, ending with the Badgers doing the Lambeau Leap following their victory.\n\n===Snowmobile racing===\nIn 2004 a snowmobile racing event was held in the parking lot due to a lack of snow. In 2005 the snowmobile racing event took place over the grass, with the right amount of snow cover.\n\n===Concerts===\nDue to the small size of the surrounding population, not many concerts are held at Lambeau Field because the primary use of the stadium is football.

{"title_page": "La Hija del Mariachi", "text_new": "\n\n'''''La hija del mariachi''''' ''(The Daughter of the Mariachi)'' is a [[Colombia]]n [[telenovela]] produced by [[RCN TV|RCN Television]] and written by M\u00f3nica Aguledo.\n\nOne night, ranchera singer Rosario Guerrero sees Emiliano at the doors of Plaza Garibaldi, a mariachi bar. He has an air of vulnerability and signs of having been robbed, so she decides to help him. What she does not know is that he is a wealthy young Mexican who has reached [[Bogot\u00e1]] fleeing from justice for a crime he did not commit.\n \nThe friendship they develop completely transforms their lives. He is astounded by Rosario\u2019s selfless support, a rare commodity in the world of wealth he comes from. Thanks to her, he manages to survive as a mariachi singer in the bar while eluding the zealous pursuit of [[Interpol]] and the police in [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]. In this world, he discovers the widespread influence of mariachi music in Colombia. Above all, in Rosario he finds the great love of his life.\n \nShe also finds love thanks to Emiliano. With him, she begins to fit together the scattered pieces of her life. The happiest and yet most painful parts of Rosario\u2019s life are related to the memory of her father. He was a mariachi singer, bohemian and passionate, and an affectionate man. Yet he filled his family\u2019s life with sadness because he spent his nights with work, liquor, and women. In a desperate attempt to erase the memory of a turbulent childhood, Rosario is struggling to earn a degree in Business Management.\n \nDespite the sadness, the image of her father is linked to joy and passion, so preserved as a relic of mariachi attire. A dress without a master, a pain that only fades when Rosario unwittingly falls in love with Emiliano and lends him the suit for him to sing in the bar Plaza Garibaldi.\n \nEmiliano S\u00e1nchez-Gallardo, a member of one of the most powerful families in Mexico, never imagined he would end up as a singer in a Mexican music bar, middle class, in the Colombian capital. He believed that his legal status in Mexico would be cleared in a few weeks, so he never told Rosario the truth. But the trouble is serious: they are blaming him for a massive money laundering operation actually operated by his partners.\n \n<br />\nThe uncertainty of trying to be someone else and the distress that it causes, causes the collapse of his family and his life, need to add the little control he has over his own feelings, to withstand the fierce opposition of their opponents, and the pitfalls put in his path by other women who desire Emiliano and want to separate him from Rosario.\n\n== Criticisms of the two versions ==\nThe telenovela garnered a big audience in Colombia and Latin America. Given these facts, Colombia decided to record more chapters. Criticism of U.S. and Chilean versions have not been too positive, because the story is resolved in a fast manner, leaving some unfinished business. On the other hand, the Colombian version explained in more detail the resolution of the plot and keeps the spirit that took the soap during its course.\n \n==Versions==\nThere are two versions of this telenovela. Both share the script and actors, as well as the main plot. The difference is found between the version issued in Colombia and issued in Chile and the United States. Up to episode 118 both versions are identical. In Colombia, due to the success, decided to extend the story in twenty episodes.\n \nThe show was sold to other countries while still in the process of recording, with a number of episodes. To fulfill this contract, the producer made two final stories. The version issued in Chile and the U.S. has 124 episodes in the story resolved only six episodes from the aforementioned 118. However, in Colombia the story is much more delayed up to 146.\n \n==Remake==\n*In 2012, [[Televisa]] produced ''[[Qu\u00e9 bonito amor (telenovela)|Qu\u00e9 bonito amor]]'', a Mexican remake, written by the executive producer [[Salvador Mej\u00eda Alexandre]]. [[Jorge Salinas]] and [[Danna Garc\u00eda]] are the main protagonists. [[Pablo Montero]] and Mallilany Marin are the main antagonists. This remake soap opera wasn't successful and in many countries was cut off or even taken off from television due low ratings.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{no references|date=February 2020}}\n{{RCN Telenovelas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hija del Mariachi}}\n[[Category:Colombian telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2006 telenovelas]]\n[[Category:2006 Colombian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 Colombian television series endings]]\n[[Category:RCN Televisi\u00f3n telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Mexico]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n'''''La hija del mariachi''''' ''(The Daughter of the Mariachi)'' is a [[Colombia]]n [[telenovela]] produced by [[RCN TV|RCN Television]] and written by M\u00f3nica Aguledo.\n\nOne night, ranchera singer Rosario Guerrero sees Emiliano at the doors of Plaza Garibaldi, a mariachi bar.

Out of 543 constituencies in India's parliament, a total of 131 seats (24.16%) are Reserved or blocked for Representatives from [[Scheduled Castes]] (84) and  [[Scheduled Tribes]] (47) only. This is different from separate electorate practiced in other countries.

M\u0101ori electorates were introduced in 1867, but have undergone several changes since then. M\u0101ori may enrol either in a M\u0101ori electorate or on the general roll, but not both. Since 1967 there has not been any specific requirement for candidates in M\u0101ori electorates to be M\u0101ori themselves, and anyone on either the M\u0101ori roll or the General roll can stand as a candidate. Technically, therefore, these seats should not be described as \"reserved\" as there is no legal or constitutional guarantee that the successful candidate will themselves be of M\u0101ori descent. So far, however, every MP from a M\u0101ori electorate has been M\u0101ori. Also to note, is that under New Zealand's [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) electoral system, it is the party vote that is most important. All voters, including M\u0101ori, are deemed to be on the same master roll in terms of voting for [[Closed list|party lists]].\n\n====Pakistan====\n{{Main|Reserved political positions in Pakistan}}\n[[Pakistan]] reserves a fixed number of parliamentary seats for non-[[Muslim]]s and women.\n\n====Slovenia====\nThe [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]] of [[Slovenia]], has 88 members elected by [[party-list proportional representation]].

The Q35 was formerly privately operated by [[Green Bus Lines]], under a subsidized franchise with the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] (NYCDOT). The route is now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[MTA Bus Company]] brand. The bus provides service between [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] in central Brooklyn to [[Rockaway Park, Queens|Rockaway Park]] on the Rockaway Peninsula in southern [[Queens]], running mainly along [[Flatbush Avenue]] in Brooklyn and Newport Avenue on the Rockaway Peninsula. The route utilizes the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] to cross between Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThe Q35 began operations under Green Bus Lines on July 3, 1937, the day the Marine Parkway Bridge was opened, to connect Brooklyn with the newly-renovated [[Jacob Riis Park]] in the Rockaways. In August 1937, the route was extended east to its current terminus at [[Rockaway Park\u2013Beach 116th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|Beach 116th Street]]. Due to franchise restrictions with the city, buses originally made no stops in Brooklyn between Flatbush Avenue station and the bridge. Additional stops in Brooklyn were added by 1940, and by 1976 buses were allowed to pick up and drop off passengers in both directions in Brooklyn. Following MTA takeover in 2006, several stops in Brooklyn were eliminated to streamline service. Essentially, the Q35 makes limited-stops in Brooklyn, while operating as a local in Queens.\n\n==Route description==\nThe Q35 bus route operates between [[Midwood, Brooklyn]] at the [[Flatbush Avenue\u2013Brooklyn College (IRT Nostrand Avenue Line)|Flatbush Avenue\u2013Brooklyn College]] subway station, served by the {{NYCS trains|Nostrand}}, and [[Rockaway Park, Queens]] at the [[Rockaway Park\u2013Beach 116th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|Rockaway Park\u2013Beach 116th Street]] subway station, served by the {{NYCS trains|Rockaway Park}}. The route primarily operates on [[Flatbush Avenue]] in Brooklyn, and Newport Avenue in the western Rockaways. It uses the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] to travel across the [[Rockaway Inlet]] of [[Jamaica Bay]] between Brooklyn and the Rockaway peninsula.<ref name=\"MTABus-Committee-Q35-Feb2012\"/><ref name=Q35/><ref name=\"MTABusTime-Q35\">{{cite web|title=MTA Bus Time: Q35 Rockaway Park - Brooklyn College|url=http://bustime.mta.info/#Q35|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[MTA Bus Time]]}}</ref><ref name=MTA-QnsBusMap-Current>{{Cite NYC bus map|Q}}</ref><ref name=MTA-BklynBusMap-Current>{{Cite NYC bus map|B}}</ref> In Brooklyn the Q35 route parallels the B41 local and limited-stop routes that operate on Flatbush Avenue between [[Kings Plaza]] and [[Downtown Brooklyn]], making limited-stops on Flatbush Avenue.<ref name=\"MTA-BklynBusMap-Current\" /> In the Rockaways between [[Fort Tilden]] and Beach 116th Street, the Q35 parallels the Q22 route, which runs across the Rockaway peninsula to [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]] via [[Rockaway Beach Boulevard]].<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current\" /><ref name=\"MTA-Transit&Bus-Jul2018\"/>\n\nThe Q35 route serves several sections of the [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] around Jamaica Bay, including [[Floyd Bennett Field]] and [[Dead Horse Bay]] in Brooklyn, and Fort Tilden and [[Jacob Riis Park]] in Queens.<ref name=\"Q35\" /><ref name=\"NPCA-Gateway-March2017\" /><ref name=\"NPS-FloydBennett-Directions\"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Serena |title=Explore New York City's Abandoned Places |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131213/port-morris/how-explore-abandoned-new-york-city-ruins/ |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |work=[[DNAinfo]] |date=December 13, 2013 |location=[[New York City]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fractenberg |first1=Ben |title=Brooklyn's Dead Horse Bay Attracts Urban Explorers |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120509/marine-park/brooklyns-dead-horse-bay-attracts-urban-explorers/ |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |work=[[DNAinfo]] |date=May 9, 2012 |location=[[Marine Park, Brooklyn]]}}</ref>\n\n===Rockaway-bound===\nQueens-bound Q35 buses enter service at Avenue H between [[Nostrand Avenue]] and [[Flatbush Avenue]] in Midwood, Brooklyn, just east of the [[Brooklyn College]] campus, and one block south of the entrance to the Flatbush Avenue subway station at \"The Junction\" of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues.<ref name=\"MTABus-Committee-Q35-Feb2012\"/><ref name=\"NPS-FloydBennett-Directions\">{{cite web |title=Directions to Floyd Bennett Field |url=https://www.nps.gov/gate/planyourvisit/upload/Directions-to-FBF-2.pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\nProposal to widen traffic lanes would be a decongestant for clogged Flatbush Ave. passage|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/plan-decongest-clogged-flatbush-ave-traffic-article-1.1472189|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=May 12, 2014|author=Blau, Reuven|work=[[Daily News (New York)|NY Daily News]]|quote=...and at the major Nostrand Ave. intersection [with Flatbush Avenue], known as the Junction...}}</ref>  Buses proceed south along Flatbush Avenue through the [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]] and [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] neighborhoods to Avenue U at the [[Kings Plaza]] shopping mall, where several bus routes including the B41 terminate.<ref name=\"MTABus-Committee-Q35-Feb2012\"/><ref name=Q35/><ref name=\"MTABusTime-Q35\"/> South of Avenue U the route continues down Flatbush Avenue, passing the [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] Golf Course and the former Floyd Bennett Field airport (now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area) to the south end of the street, before entering the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] towards Rockaway, Queens.<ref name=Q35/><ref name=\"MTABusTime-Q35\"/><ref name=MTA-BklynBusMap-Current/> The Q35 is the only route to travel on Flatbush south of Avenue U and cross the bridge between Brooklyn and Queens.<ref name=MTA-QnsBusMap-Current/><ref name=MTA-BklynBusMap-Current/>\n\nUpon entering the Rockaways, the Q35 route makes its first stop on the off-ramp of the Marine Parkway Bridge, in order to access Fort Tilden, the Riis Landing ferry terminal, and the [[Roxbury, Queens|Roxbury]] and [[Breezy Point, Queens|Breezy Point]] neighborhoods at the west end of the peninsula.

The rerouting of the Q35 and Q22 routes was protested due to potential traffic issues on Beach 116th Street, with the two routes along with the Q53 all using the street.<ref name=\"Rockawave-Q22-Q35-CB14-Oct2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mancini |first1=Ralph |title=Destined To Fail: CB14 rejects MTA\u2019s bus stop reduction plan |url=https://www.rockawave.com/articles/destined-to-fail/ |accessdate=July 26, 2018 |work=[[Wave of Long Island]] |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"MTA-Transit&Bus-Jul2018\"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Agard |first1=Kami-Leigh |title=Fireworks at CB 14 Meeting |url=http://rockawaytimes.com/index.php/news/9-news/3006-fireworks-at-cb-14-meeting |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |work=The Rockaway Times |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> On May 23, 2018, the MTA held an open house at the Rockaway YMCA in [[Arverne, Queens|Arverne]] to discuss the changes to Q22 and Q35 service proposed in October 2017, including the potential route adjustment for the Q35 from Newport Avenue to Rockaway Beach Boulevard.<ref name=\"MTA-Transit&Bus-Jul2018\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/180723_1030_Transit.pdf#page=218|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting|date=July 23, 2018|accessdate=July 23, 2018|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|pages=218\u2013225}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Q22/Q35 Rockaways Open House |url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/busplan_rockways_Q22Q35.htm |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |date=2018}}</ref> Following the open house, however, the plans to alter the Q35 route were cancelled.<ref name=\"MTA-Transit&Bus-Jul2018\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[B41 (New York City bus)]]\n*[[Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards buses]]\n<!--*[[Q21 (New York City bus)]]\n*[[Q22 (New York City bus)]]-->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201937-1938%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201937-1938%2520-%25200266.pdf Green Lines cancel Q35, Rockawave, August 12, 1937]\n*[http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%25205%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Eagle%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Eagle%25201940%2520Grayscale%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Eagle%25201940%2520Grayscale%2520-%25200223.pdf Q35 Franchise, 1940]\n*[http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%25205%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Eagle%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Eagle%25201946%2520Grayscale%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Daily%2520Eagle%25201946%2520Grayscale%2520-%25205331.pdf Bus Map, Bklyn Eagle, 1946]\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n*{{commons category-inline|Q35 (New York City bus)}}\n{{Queens bus routes}}\n\n[[Category:MTA Regional Bus routes|Q035]]\n[[Category:Bus routes in Queens, New York|035]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|additional information on the current bus services|List of bus routes in Queens#Q35}}\n{{short description|Bus route in New York City}}\n{{Infobox bus line\n|box_width     = 300px \n|number        = {{NYC bus infobox header |title=q35}}\n|logo          = <!-- bus logo (ex: Image_name.png) -->\n|logo_width    = <!-- width of bus logo -->\n|logo_alt      = <!-- logo image alternate text (only works if logo_width is supplied) -->\n|bgcolor       = <!-- background color for infobox title (hex codes need a '#', i.e. #00ff33 not 00ff33) -->\n|titlecolor    = <!-- color of the title text (hex codes need a '#') -->\n|subheader     = Brooklyn\u2212Rockaway Park\n|operatorlogo  = File:MTA NYC logo.svg\n|oplogo_width  = 37px\n|image         = File:MTA Flatbush South 25.jpg\n|image_width   = 300px\n|image_alt     = <!--This image cannot be displayed.-->\n|caption       = A Rockaway-bound [[List of bus routes in Queens#Q35|Q35]] bus on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn\n|system        = [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]]\n|operator      = [[MTA Bus Company]]\n|garage        = [[Bus depots of MTA Regional Bus Operations#Far Rockaway Depot|Far Rockaway Depot]]\n|vehicle       = \n* [[Nova Bus]] [[Rapid Transit Series|RTS-06]]\n* [[Orion International|Orion VII]]\n* Orion VII Next Generation\n|livery        =\n|pvr           =\n|status        =\n|open          = July 3, 1937<ref name=NYTimes-GBLQ35-1937/>\n|close         =\n|predecessors  =\n|night         =\n|locale        = [[Queens]];

The Q35 was formerly privately operated by [[Green Bus Lines]], under a subsidized franchise with the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] (NYCDOT). The route is now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[MTA Bus Company]] brand. The bus provides service between [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] in central Brooklyn to [[Rockaway Park, Queens|Rockaway Park]] on the Rockaway Peninsula in southern [[Queens]], running mainly along [[Flatbush Avenue]] in Brooklyn and Newport Avenue on the Rockaway Peninsula. The route utilizes the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] to cross between Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThe Q35 began operations under Green Bus Lines on July 3, 1937, the day the Marine Parkway Bridge was opened, to connect Brooklyn with the newly-renovated [[Jacob Riis Park]] in the Rockaways. In August 1937, the route was extended east to its current terminus at [[Rockaway Park\u2013Beach 116th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|Beach 116th Street]]. Due to franchise restrictions with the city, buses originally made no stops in Brooklyn between Flatbush Avenue station and the bridge. Additional stops in Brooklyn were added by 1940, and by 1976 buses were allowed to pick up and drop off passengers in both directions in Brooklyn. Following MTA takeover in 2006, several stops in Brooklyn were eliminated to streamline service. Essentially, the Q35 makes limited-stops in Brooklyn, while operating as a local in Queens.\n\n==Route description==\nThe Q35 bus route operates between [[Midwood, Brooklyn]] at the [[Flatbush Avenue\u2013Brooklyn College (IRT Nostrand Avenue Line)|Flatbush Avenue\u2013Brooklyn College]] subway station, served by the {{NYCS trains|Nostrand}}, and [[Rockaway Park, Queens]] at the [[Rockaway Park\u2013Beach 116th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|Rockaway Park\u2013Beach 116th Street]] subway station, served by the {{NYCS trains|Rockaway Park}}. The route primarily operates on [[Flatbush Avenue]] in Brooklyn, and Newport Avenue in the western Rockaways. It uses the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] to travel across the [[Rockaway Inlet]] of [[Jamaica Bay]] between Brooklyn and the Rockaway peninsula.<ref name=\"MTABus-Committee-Q35-Feb2012\"/><ref name=Q35/><ref name=\"MTABusTime-Q35\">{{cite web|title=MTA Bus Time: Q35 Rockaway Park - Brooklyn College|url=http://bustime.mta.info/#Q35|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[MTA Bus Time]]}}</ref><ref name=MTA-QnsBusMap-Current>{{Cite NYC bus map|Q}}</ref><ref name=MTA-BklynBusMap-Current>{{Cite NYC bus map|B}}</ref> In Brooklyn the Q35 route parallels the B41 local and limited-stop routes that operate on Flatbush Avenue between [[Kings Plaza]] and [[Downtown Brooklyn]], making limited-stops on Flatbush Avenue.<ref name=\"MTA-BklynBusMap-Current\" /> In the Rockaways between [[Fort Tilden]] and Beach 116th Street, the Q35 parallels the Q22 route, which runs across the Rockaway peninsula to [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]] via [[Rockaway Beach Boulevard]].<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current\" /><ref name=\"MTA-Transit&Bus-Jul2018\"/>\n\nThe Q35 route serves several sections of the [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] around Jamaica Bay, including [[Floyd Bennett Field]] and [[Dead Horse Bay]] in Brooklyn, and Fort Tilden and [[Jacob Riis Park]] in Queens.<ref name=\"Q35\" /><ref name=\"NPCA-Gateway-March2017\" /><ref name=\"NPS-FloydBennett-Directions\"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Serena |title=Explore New York City's Abandoned Places |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131213/port-morris/how-explore-abandoned-new-york-city-ruins/ |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |work=[[DNAinfo]] |date=December 13, 2013 |location=[[New York City]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fractenberg |first1=Ben |title=Brooklyn's Dead Horse Bay Attracts Urban Explorers |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120509/marine-park/brooklyns-dead-horse-bay-attracts-urban-explorers/ |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |work=[[DNAinfo]] |date=May 9, 2012 |location=[[Marine Park, Brooklyn]]}}</ref>\n\n===Rockaway-bound===\nQueens-bound Q35 buses enter service at Avenue H between [[Nostrand Avenue]] and [[Flatbush Avenue]] in Midwood, Brooklyn, just east of the [[Brooklyn College]] campus, and one block south of the entrance to the Flatbush Avenue subway station at \"The Junction\" of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues.<ref name=\"MTABus-Committee-Q35-Feb2012\"/><ref name=\"NPS-FloydBennett-Directions\">{{cite web |title=Directions to Floyd Bennett Field |url=https://www.nps.gov/gate/planyourvisit/upload/Directions-to-FBF-2.pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\nProposal to widen traffic lanes would be a decongestant for clogged Flatbush Ave. passage|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/plan-decongest-clogged-flatbush-ave-traffic-article-1.1472189|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=May 12, 2014|author=Blau, Reuven|work=[[Daily News (New York)|NY Daily News]]|quote=...and at the major Nostrand Ave. intersection [with Flatbush Avenue], known as the Junction...}}</ref>  Buses proceed south along Flatbush Avenue through the [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]] and [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] neighborhoods to Avenue U at the [[Kings Plaza]] shopping mall, where several bus routes including the B41 terminate.<ref name=\"MTABus-Committee-Q35-Feb2012\"/><ref name=Q35/><ref name=\"MTABusTime-Q35\"/> South of Avenue U the route continues down Flatbush Avenue, passing the [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] Golf Course and the former Floyd Bennett Field airport (now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area) to the south end of the street, before entering the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] towards Rockaway, Queens.<ref name=Q35/><ref name=\"MTABusTime-Q35\"/><ref name=MTA-BklynBusMap-Current/> The Q35 is the only route to travel on Flatbush south of Avenue U and cross the bridge between Brooklyn and Queens.<ref name=MTA-QnsBusMap-Current/><ref name=MTA-BklynBusMap-Current/>\n\nUpon entering the Rockaways, the Q35 route makes its first stop on the off-ramp of the Marine Parkway Bridge, in order to access Fort Tilden, the Riis Landing ferry terminal, and the [[Roxbury, Queens|Roxbury]] and [[Breezy Point, Queens|Breezy Point]] neighborhoods at the west end of the peninsula.
