He also consistently lands low on the [[strike zone]] below the catcher's knees, causing batters to chase the ball even when it is clearly going to hit the dirt. Out of the [[Pitching position|windup]], Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate.

{"title_page": "List of oldest trees", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n[[File:FallPando02.jpg|thumb|[[Pando (tree)|Pando]], an 80,000-year-old colony of [[quaking aspen]], is the oldest-known clonal tree, located in [[Utah]], United States]]\n\nThis is a list of the '''oldest-known trees''', as reported in reliable sources. Definitions of what constitutes an individual tree vary. In addition, tree ages are derived from a variety of sources, including documented \"tree-ring\" count core samples, and from estimates. For these reasons, this article presents three lists of \"oldest trees,\" each using varying criteria.\n\nThere are three tables of trees, which are listed by [[age]] and [[species]]. The first table includes trees for which a minimum age has been directly determined, either through counting or cross-referencing [[tree rings]] or through [[radiocarbon dating]]. Many of these trees may be even older than their listed ages, but the oldest wood in the tree has rotted away. For some old trees, so much of the centre is missing that their age cannot be directly determined. Instead, estimates are made based on the tree's size and presumed growth rate. The second table includes trees with these estimated ages. The last table lists [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] in which no individual tree trunks may be remarkably old but in which the organism as a whole is thought to be very old.\n\nThe current record-holders for individual, non-clonal trees are the [[Pinus longaeva|Great Basin bristlecone pine]] trees from [[California]] and [[Nevada]], in the United States. Through tree-ring cross-referencing, they have been shown to be almost five millennia old.\n\nA clonal colony can survive for much longer than an individual tree. A colony of 47,000 [[Quaking Aspen|quaking aspen]] trees (nicknamed [[Pando (tree)|Pando]]), covering {{convert|106|acre}} in the [[Fishlake National Forest]] of [[Utah]], is considered one of the oldest and largest organisms in the world.

Definitions of what constitutes an individual tree vary. In addition, tree ages are derived from a variety of sources, including documented \"tree-ring\" count core samples, and from estimates. For these reasons, this article presents three lists of \"oldest trees,\" each using varying criteria.\n\nThere are three tables of trees, which are listed by age and [[species]]. The first table includes trees for which a minimum age has been directly determined, either through counting or cross-referencing [[tree rings]] or through [[radiocarbon dating]]. Many of these trees may be even older than their listed ages, but the oldest wood in the tree has rotted away. For some old trees, so much of the centre is missing that their age cannot be directly determined. Instead, estimates are made based on the tree's size and presumed growth rate. The second table includes trees with these estimated ages. The last table lists [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] in which no individual tree trunks may be remarkably old but in which the organism as a whole is thought to be very old.\n\nThe current record-holders for individual, non-clonal trees are the [[Pinus longaeva|Great Basin bristlecone pine]] trees from [[California]] and [[Nevada]], in the United States. Through tree-ring cross-referencing, they have been shown to be almost five millennia old.\n\nA clonal colony can survive for much longer than an individual tree. A colony of 47,000 [[Quaking Aspen|quaking aspen]] trees (nicknamed [[Pando (tree)|Pando]]), covering {{convert|106|acre}} in the [[Fishlake National Forest]] of [[Utah]], is considered one of the oldest and largest organisms in the world. The colony has been estimated to be 80,000 years old, although tree ring samples date individual, above-ground, trees at only an average of about 130 years.<ref name=\"discovery\">{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1993/oct/thetremblinggian285 |title=''The Trembling Giant'' |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=Discover Magazine |date=1 October 1993 |author=Grant, Michael C. |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67MwmS7Kk?url=http://discovermagazine.com/1993/oct/thetremblinggian285 |archive-date=2 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ww0601.htm#massive |title=''Botanical Record-Breakers'' |accessdate=7 May 2008 |publisher=W.P Armstrong |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219095825/http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ww0601.htm |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm |title=''Quaking Aspen'' |accessdate=7 May 2008 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] - [[Bryce Canyon]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210111518/http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm |archive-date=10 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html#BOTANICAL%20AND%20ECOLOGICAL%20CHARACTERISTICS |title=''SPECIES: Populus tremuloides'' |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=[[USDA]] - [[United States Forest Service]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AN4D4ART?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html#BOTANICAL%20AND%20ECOLOGICAL%20CHARACTERISTICS |archive-date=2 September 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> A colony of [[Huon pine]] trees covering {{convert|2.5|acre}} on [[Mount Read (Tasmania)]] is estimated to be around 10,000 years old, as determined by [[DNA]] samples taken from [[pollen]] collected from the sediment of a nearby lake.

Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient, integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.\n\nA podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to totally improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] [[journalism]]. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and even a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.\n\nThe cost to the consumer is low. While many podcasts are free to download, others are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could also be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale.\n\nPeople are motivated to create a podcast for a number of reasons. The podcast producer, who is often the podcast host as well, may wish to express a personal passion, increase professional visibility, enter into a social network of influencers or influential ideas, cultivate a community of like-minded viewership, or put forward pedagogical or ideological ideas (possibly under philanthropic support). \n\nBecause podcast content is often free or, at the very least, affordable for the average podcast consumer, podcasting is often classified as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] [[Media (communication)|medium]], which is adverse to the maintenance of traditional [[Revenue model|revenue models]].

Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient, integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.\n\nA podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to totally improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] [[journalism]]. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and even a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.\n\nThe cost to the consumer is low. While many podcasts are free to download, others are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could also be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale.\n\nPeople are motivated to create a podcast for a number of reasons. The podcast producer, who is often the podcast host as well, may wish to express a personal passion, increase professional visibility, enter into a social network of influencers or influential ideas, cultivate a community of like-minded viewership, or put forward pedagogical or ideological ideas (possibly under philanthropic support). \n\nBecause podcast content is often free or, at the very least, affordable for the average podcast consumer, podcasting is often classified as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] [[Media (communication)|medium]], which is adverse to the maintenance of traditional [[Revenue model|revenue models]].
