In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

A ball of dough is taken with one hand and smeared into a heated large flat metal plate greased with oil until a very thin circular film of it adheres to the pan and fries.

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots.

They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

The spider belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Ascyltus]]'', a group of jumping spiders easily identified both by their relatively large size.\n\n==Description==\n\nA. pterygodes can be differentiated from other fissidentate Pacific genera by the antero-lateral \"cheek\" areas of the carapace. These areas are filled with iridescent scales. These areas are often larger than other Pacific genera. They usually begin to be detectable in half-grown juveniles. Other identifying features include the absence of lateral spines on the first metatarsi, first coxae separated by more than the diameter of one of them, eyes in normal three rows instead of four (the second row midway between the first and third), pedicel concealed by abdomen in dorsal view, and cheliceral promargin in males with a large multicusped tooth. Species limits are not clear and the actual number of distinct species is unknown. Palpal structures are rather similar in all species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=James |title=Salticidae of the pacific islands. II.

The spider belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Ascyltus]]'', a group of jumping spiders easily identified both by their relatively large size.\n\n==Description==\n\nA. pterygodes can be differentiated from other fissidentate Pacific genera by the antero-lateral \"cheek\" areas of the carapace. These areas are filled with iridescent scales. These areas are often larger than other Pacific genera. They usually begin to be detectable in half-grown juveniles. Other identifying features include the absence of lateral spines on the first metatarsi, first coxae separated by more than the diameter of one of them, eyes in normal three rows instead of four (the second row midway between the first and third), pedicel concealed by abdomen in dorsal view, and cheliceral promargin in males with a large multicusped tooth. Species limits are not clear and the actual number of distinct species is unknown. Palpal structures are rather similar in all species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=James |title=Salticidae of the pacific islands. II.

Maori tribes inhabited the area, but were decimated by wars and finally succumbed to the newly acquired guns of Hongi Hika. In 1844 the area was sold to the Government and became deserted. One of the first settlers in the district established an orchard near Soldier\u2019s Bay and as the kauri trees were gradually removed from the land, it was found to be an ideal place for fruit growing, especially grapes and strawberries. Most of the kauri trees taken out were used by boat builders for masts and spurs.<ref name=\"kauripark.school.nz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kauripark.school.nz/information/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208050330/http://www.kauripark.school.nz/information/history |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe first European settlers arrived in the 1860s and by the 1880s the area was a popular summer resort, with many city dwellers making the trip across the harbour to Island Bay for excursions and holidays.<ref name=\"kauripark.school.nz\"/>\n\nUp until the 1920s the area was rural, largely made up of market gardens growing fruit (mostly strawberries) and vegetables for the growing city across the harbour. Most of this produce was transported by water. There were also sawmills in the area, the evidence of which could be seen for decades in the form of abandoned machinery and mounds of sawdust.<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Penny|title=So you want to live in: Beach Haven|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/beach-haven/news/article.cfm?l_id=382&objectid=10630724|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=8 March 2010}}</ref> The area was always popular as a holiday destination, evidence of which can still be seen today in some of the remaining [[bach (New Zealand)|baches]].<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>\n\nIn 1923, the Birkdale Land Company bought and surveyed the land around where the wharf is now and it was then marketed as the Beach Haven Estate, \"the Gem of the Waitemata.\"<ref name=\"Place Names of New Zealand\">{{cite book|last=Reed|first=A.W.|title=Place Names of New Zealand|date=2010|publisher=Penguin|location=New Zealand|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nAfter the construction of the Harbour Bridge in 1959, housing subdivisions completed the transformation into an urban area.\n\n==Administration==\n\nBeach Haven forms part of the [[North Shore ward]] and [[Kaipatiki Local Board]] under the [[Auckland Council]]. Prior to 2010, the area had been administered as part of the Birkenhead Borough Council and then as part of North Shore City Council.\n\nUnder the voting district for elections to the Parliament of New Zealand it forms part of the [[Northcote (New Zealand electorate)|Northcote electorate]].\n\n==Facilities, services and amenities==\n\nBeach Haven has one main shopping area with a variety of shops, including a French cafe, two bakeries, a post office, a gym and a police community constable office. There are several preschools and one primary school that serve the area. Churches in the area include the Anglican, Catholic, Orthodox, Mormon and Assembly Of God.\n\nBeach Haven is surrounded by many beaches which are suitable for swimming, including Charcoal Bay which is considered one of the most beautiful bays in the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Clement|first=Diana|title=Auckland: Ten of the best secret beaches|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/beach-haven/news/article.cfm?l_id=382&objectid=10791480|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=12 March 2012}}</ref>  The area also has a wharf which is a very popular feature of Beach Haven. The biggest park in Beach Haven is Shepherd's Park which has a 1.6&nbsp;km walk through native bush beside Oruamo/Hellyers Creek, as well as squash, bowling and tennis facilities. It also has rugby and soccer grounds and is home to [[Birkenhead United]] AFC. \n \nBeach Haven is well serviced by bus connections to Takapuna and the CBD.  In August 2012 after years of delays, Auckland Transport announced that it would spend NZ$1.35m to upgrade the wharf at Beach Haven, allowing a ferry service to the city to begin at the start of 2013 to coincide with a new service to [[Hobsonville]].

Maori tribes inhabited the area, but were decimated by wars and finally succumbed to the newly acquired guns of Hongi Hika. In 1844 the area was sold to the Government and became deserted. One of the first settlers in the district established an orchard near Soldier\u2019s Bay and as the kauri trees were gradually removed from the land, it was found to be an ideal place for fruit growing, especially grapes and strawberries. Most of the kauri trees taken out were used by boat builders for masts and spurs.<ref name=\"kauripark.school.nz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kauripark.school.nz/information/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208050330/http://www.kauripark.school.nz/information/history |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe first European settlers arrived in the 1860s and by the 1880s the area was a popular summer resort, with many city dwellers making the trip across the harbour to Island Bay for excursions and holidays.<ref name=\"kauripark.school.nz\"/>\n\nUp until the 1920s the area was rural, largely made up of market gardens growing fruit (mostly strawberries) and vegetables for the growing city across the harbour. Most of this produce was transported by water. There were also sawmills in the area, the evidence of which could be seen for decades in the form of abandoned machinery and mounds of sawdust.<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Penny|title=So you want to live in: Beach Haven|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/beach-haven/news/article.cfm?l_id=382&objectid=10630724|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=8 March 2010}}</ref> The area was always popular as a holiday destination, evidence of which can still be seen today in some of the remaining [[bach (New Zealand)|baches]].<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>\n\nIn 1923, the Birkdale Land Company bought and surveyed the land around where the wharf is now and it was then marketed as the Beach Haven Estate, \"the Gem of the Waitemata.\"<ref name=\"Place Names of New Zealand\">{{cite book|last=Reed|first=A.W.|title=Place Names of New Zealand|date=2010|publisher=Penguin|location=New Zealand|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nAfter the construction of the Harbour Bridge in 1959, housing subdivisions completed the transformation into an urban area.\n\n==Administration==\n\nBeach Haven forms part of the [[North Shore ward]] and [[Kaipatiki Local Board]] under the [[Auckland Council]]. Prior to 2010, the area had been administered as part of the Birkenhead Borough Council and then as part of North Shore City Council.\n\nUnder the voting district for elections to the Parliament of New Zealand it forms part of the [[Northcote (New Zealand electorate)|Northcote electorate]].\n\n==Facilities, services and amenities==\n\nBeach Haven has one main shopping area with a variety of shops, including a French cafe, two bakeries, a post office, a gym and a police community constable office. There are several preschools and one primary school that serve the area. Churches in the area include the Anglican, Catholic, Orthodox, Mormon and Assembly Of God.\n\nBeach Haven is surrounded by many beaches which are suitable for swimming, including Charcoal Bay which is considered one of the most beautiful bays in the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Clement|first=Diana|title=Auckland: Ten of the best secret beaches|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/beach-haven/news/article.cfm?l_id=382&objectid=10791480|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=12 March 2012}}</ref>  The area also has a wharf which is a very popular feature of Beach Haven. The biggest park in Beach Haven is Shepherd's Park which has a 1.6&nbsp;km walk through native bush beside Oruamo/Hellyers Creek, as well as squash, bowling and tennis facilities. It also has rugby and soccer grounds and is home to [[Birkenhead United]] AFC. \n \nBeach Haven is well serviced by bus connections to Takapuna and the CBD.  In August 2012 after years of delays, Auckland Transport announced that it would spend NZ$1.35m to upgrade the wharf at Beach Haven, allowing a ferry service to the city to begin at the start of 2013 to coincide with a new service to [[Hobsonville]].

''Gish'' fared better than expected, but the follow-up, ''[[Siamese Dream]]'', released on [[Virgin Records]] in 1993, became a multi-platinum hit. The band became known for internal drama during this period, with Corgan frequently characterized in the music press as a \"[[control freak]]\" due to rumors that Corgan played all the guitar and bass parts on ''Siamese Dream'' (a rumor that Corgan later confirmed as true). Despite this, the album was well received by critics, and the songs \"[[Today (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Today]]\", \"[[Cherub Rock]]\", and \"[[Disarm]]\" became hits.\n\nThe band's 1995 follow-up effort, the double album ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'', was more successful, spawning a string of hit singles.

That guitar was used on the recordings for \"[[Bullet with Butterfly Wings]]\" and also \"[[Muzzle (song)|Muzzle]]\", because the heavier wood gave it the basic Strat sound with a bit more bottom.\n\n[[File:Billy Corgan 24.05.07.JPG|thumb|upright|On May 24, 2007, at [[den Atelier]], [[Luxembourg City]]]]\n\nDuring the recording and tour of the album ''Zeitgeist'', Corgan used a [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] C-1 EX baritone, finished in black with Tony Iommi signature pickups.\n\nCorgan also endorsed [[Reverend Guitars]] in his [[Zwan]] era, most notably playing a Reverend Slingshot.\n\nIn 2008 Corgan released to the market his own Fender Stratocaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0115002806|title=Fender Artist Series \u2013 Billy Corgan Stratocaster|date=|accessdate=2015-10-08|website=[[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]]|publisher=|last=|first=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702072711/http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0115002806|archivedate=2008-07-02}}</ref> This new guitar was made to Corgan's exact specs to create his famous mid-'90s buzzsaw tone; the instrument features three DiMarzio pickups (two custom for this instrument), a string-through hardtail bridge and a satin nitrocellulose lacquer finish.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars: An Identification Guide for American Fretted Instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-3HoVgxFBIC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=billy+corgan+%252757+Reissue+strat&source=bl&ots=l7hcPpPsYi&sig=yVcQkuHw8fAvJYiymyATRxiftXo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwiFiaDUgbLIAhXDFT4KHQOIAFY#v=onepage&q=billy%2520corgan%2520'57%2520Reissue%2520strat&f=false|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=2010-01-01|isbn=9780879309442|first=George|last=Gruhn|first2=Walter|last2=Carter}}</ref> When playing live, he uses both his signature Strats as well as two other Fender Strats, one in red with a white pick guard and one in silver-grey with a black pick guard; a Gibson [[Tony Iommi]] signature [[Gibson SG|SG]]; and his Schecter C-1 (only used on the ''Zeitgeist'' song \"United States\").\n\nA video called 'Stompland' on the official Smashing Pumpkins YouTube channel is informative on Corgan's choice of effects pedals.

Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called [[Zwan]], and after their demise, he released a solo album, ''[[TheFutureEmbrace]]'', in 2005 and a collection of poetry, ''[[Blinking with Fists]]'', before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nThe new version of The Smashing Pumpkins, consisting of Corgan and [[List of The Smashing Pumpkins band members|a revolving lineup]], has released and toured new albums extensively since 2007.

''Gish'' fared better than expected, but the follow-up, ''[[Siamese Dream]]'', released on [[Virgin Records]] in 1993, became a multi-platinum hit. The band became known for internal drama during this period, with Corgan frequently characterized in the music press as a \"[[control freak]]\" due to rumors that Corgan played all the guitar and bass parts on ''Siamese Dream'' (a rumor that Corgan later confirmed as true). Despite this, the album was well received by critics, and the songs \"[[Today (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Today]]\", \"[[Cherub Rock]]\", and \"[[Disarm]]\" became hits.\n\nThe band's 1995 follow-up effort, the double album ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'', was more successful, spawning a string of hit singles.

It also has a five-position pickup selector switch which he installed himself. This battered Strat became his number one guitar by default. He owned a '74 Strat that was stolen shortly after ''Gish'' was completed. Corgan was reunited with this guitar in early 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Smashing Pumpkins - Return of the Gish Guitar|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyjBDmEcKAE|language=en|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\nCorgan also used a wide variety of guitars on ''Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness''. On \"Where Boys Fear to Tread\", Corgan used a [[Les Paul Junior]] Reissue, and on \"[[Tonight, Tonight (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Tonight Tonight]]\" he used a '72 [[Gibson ES-335]]. He is also known to use a '74 Strat which has since been painted baby blue. That guitar was used on the recordings for \"[[Bullet with Butterfly Wings]]\" and also \"[[Muzzle (song)|Muzzle]]\", because the heavier wood gave it the basic Strat sound with a bit more bottom.\n\n[[File:Billy Corgan 24.05.07.JPG|thumb|upright|On May 24, 2007, at [[den Atelier]], [[Luxembourg City]]]]\n\nDuring the recording and tour of the album ''Zeitgeist'', Corgan used a [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] C-1 EX baritone, finished in black with Tony Iommi signature pickups.\n\nCorgan also endorsed [[Reverend Guitars]] in his [[Zwan]] era, most notably playing a Reverend Slingshot.\n\nIn 2008 Corgan released to the market his own Fender Stratocaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0115002806|title=Fender Artist Series \u2013 Billy Corgan Stratocaster|date=|accessdate=2015-10-08|website=[[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]]|publisher=|last=|first=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702072711/http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0115002806|archivedate=2008-07-02}}</ref> This new guitar was made to Corgan's exact specs to create his famous mid-'90s buzzsaw tone; the instrument features three DiMarzio pickups (two custom for this instrument), a string-through hardtail bridge and a satin nitrocellulose lacquer finish.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars: An Identification Guide for American Fretted Instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-3HoVgxFBIC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=billy+corgan+%252757+Reissue+strat&source=bl&ots=l7hcPpPsYi&sig=yVcQkuHw8fAvJYiymyATRxiftXo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwiFiaDUgbLIAhXDFT4KHQOIAFY#v=onepage&q=billy%2520corgan%2520'57%2520Reissue%2520strat&f=false|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=2010-01-01|isbn=9780879309442|first=George|last=Gruhn|first2=Walter|last2=Carter}}</ref> When playing live, he uses both his signature Strats as well as two other Fender Strats, one in red with a white pick guard and one in silver-grey with a black pick guard; a Gibson [[Tony Iommi]] signature [[Gibson SG|SG]]; and his Schecter C-1 (only used on the ''Zeitgeist'' song \"United States\").\n\nA video called 'Stompland' on the official Smashing Pumpkins YouTube channel is informative on Corgan's choice of effects pedals.

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then. Their lineup stable, Phish performed together for 15 years before beginning a two-year hiatus in October 2000. The band regrouped in late 2002, but disbanded in August 2004 after a farewell performance at their [[Phish festivals#Coventry|Coventry Festival]] in Vermont. They reunited in March 2009 for a series of three consecutive concerts at [[Hampton Coliseum]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], and have since resumed performing regularly.\n\nPhish's music blends elements of a wide variety of genres,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phish.net/faq/whatisphish|title= What Is Phish? |accessdate=2011-02-09 |work=FAQ Files|publisher=Phish.net}}</ref> including [[funk]], [[progressive rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[Pop music|pop]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/183259-phish-fuego/ | title=Phish - Fuego | magazine=[[PopMatters]] | date=July 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 3, 2015 | author=Conaton, Chris}}</ref> The band was part of a movement of improvisational rock groups, inspired by the [[Grateful Dead]] and colloquially known as \"[[jam band]]s\", which gained considerable popularity as touring concert acts in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=8 Bands Carrying on Jerry Garcia's Legacy |url=http://www.legacy.com/news/culture-and-trends/article/8-bands-carrying-on-jerry-garcias-legacy |website=Legacy.com |accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hyden |first1=Steven |title=Is Phish a Great Band? |url=http://grantland.com/features/after-30-years-consider-phish-great-band/ |website=Grantland |accessdate=14 December 2018 |date=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nPhish has developed a large and dedicated following by word of mouth, the exchange of live recordings, and selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States.<ref name=\"news\">{{cite web | title = News Archives | url = http://phish.com/#/news/index.php?year=2009&hash=story460 |publisher=Phish.com | accessdate = 2011-01-28}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Phish as \"the most important band of the '90s.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perella |first1=Dominic |title=Anastasio puts Phish behind him with strong solo effort |url=https://azdailysun.com/anastasio-puts-phish-behind-him-with-strong-solo-effort/article_2ef6ced0-1eb1-500c-85c4-35c5433b3c6e.html |website=Arizona Daily Sun |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The magazine later wrote that the band helped to \"spawn a new wave of bands oriented around group improvisation and extended instrumental [[groove (music)|groove]]s\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|title=Phish|accessdate=2008-05-11|work=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414030730/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|archive-date=2009-04-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''The White Tape'': 1983\u20131986===\nPhish was formed at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists [[Trey Anastasio]] and [[Jeff Holdsworth]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], and drummer [[Jon Fishman]].

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

Among the first was ''Analyze Phish'' which was hosted by comedians [[Harris Wittels]] and [[Scott Aukerman]] for the [[Earwolf]] podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish 101, episode #1 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/phish-101/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fuego, episode #10 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/fuego/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harris Wittels: The Parks and Rec Writer Gets to \"Analyze Phish\" (Throwback) |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/harris-wittels-the-parks-and-rec-writer-gets-to-analyze-phish/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=26 February 2015}}</ref> Despite its truncated run, ''Analyze Phish'' inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, ''Under the Scales'', in 2016.<ref name=\"osiris\">{{cite web |last1=Greenhaus |first1=Mike |title=Interview: Tom Marshall and RJ Bee on New Podcast Network Osiris |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_tom_marshall_and_rj_bee_on_new_podcast_network_osiris/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=22 February 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts ''Under the Scales'' and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands.<ref name=\"osiris\"/> On 15 September 2019, C13Originals debuted ''Long May They Run'', a music documentary podcast series.

Voiced by American actress [[Linda Larkin]]{{Snd}} with a singing voice provided by Filipina singer [[Lea Salonga]]{{Snd}} Jasmine is the spirited Princess of Agrabah, who has grown weary of her life of palace confinement. Despite an age-old law stipulating that the princess must marry a prince in time for her upcoming birthday, Jasmine is instead determined to marry someone she loves for who he is as opposed to what he owns. Created by directors [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] with screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], Jasmine is based on [[Badroulbadour]], a princess who appears in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' folktale \"[[Aladdin|Aladdin and the Magical Lamp]]\".\n\nOriginally conceived as a spoiled, [[Materialism|materialistic]] princess, the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Lea Salonga was cast as Jasmine's [[Playback singer|singing voice]] based on her performance in the musical ''[[Miss Saigon]]''; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney Princess to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actresses. Animated by [[Mark Henn]], Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's own sister, and actress [[Jennifer Connelly]].\n\nUnlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine is a supporting character in her own film, taking the secondary role of the [[love interest]]. The character has garnered mixed-to-positive reviews, with much of her character arc compared unfavorably to her predecessors [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]] and [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991) but has been praised for her personality and her chemistry with Aladdin. As the sixth [[Disney Princess]] and the franchise's first [[Person of color|non-European member]], the character is credited with introducing [[Cultural diversity|racial diversity]] to Disney's princess genre. Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in ''Aladdin''<nowiki/>'s [[sequel]]s ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994) and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), as well as its [[Aladdin (TV series)|television series]] and a [[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Broadway musical adaption of the film]]. Both Larkin and Salonga have been awarded [[Disney Legends]] for their contributions to the role.

Frustrated with constantly having decisions made for her and being pressured into [[Arranged marriage|marrying a prince by law]], Jasmine disguises herself as a peasant and escapes the palace. In the nearby marketplace, Jasmine befriends street thief Aladdin after he rescues her from an angry vendor who very nearly chops her hand off. Escaping to Aladdin's hideout, the pair bonds over the realization that they both feel trapped in their own environments and long for better lives. When Aladdin is soon arrested by the palace guards, Jasmine demands his immediate release only to find her orders overruled by Jafar, the Sultan's scheming [[Grand Vizier|grand vizier]]. When the princess confronts Jafar, he lies and tells her that Aladdin has already been executed, leaving Jasmine distraught and blaming herself for his death; in reality, Jafar is using Aladdin to retrieve a magical lamp containing a genie. When the Genie, who saves and befriends Aladdin, grants his wish to be transformed into a prince to better his chances of wooing Jasmine, Aladdin introduces himself to her as \"Prince Ali\". Although initially unimpressed, Jasmine is charmed after joining him on a [[magic carpet]] ride, at the end of which she discovers that the prince is, in fact, the same peasant she met in the marketplace. However, Aladdin convinces Jasmine that he truly is a prince who, much like her, only occasionally disguises himself as a commoner. When Jafar learns the truth about Aladdin, he steals the lamp and becomes the Genie's master, banishing Aladdin and forcing the Genie to make him Sultan, while enslaving both Jasmine and her father. After refusing to marry him, Jasmine kisses Jafar to distract him while Aladdin returns in time to trick Jafar into wishing himself into a genie and thus trapping himself within the lamp. Jasmine and the Sultan are finally freed, and she and Aladdin become engaged after the Sultan abolishes the law so that Jasmine can legally marry whomever she chooses.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Aladdin'', Jasmine appears in the film's two [[direct-to-video]] sequels, in both of which Larkin reprises her role as the character, with [[Liz Callaway]] replacing Salonga as her singing voice. The first, ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), features Jasmine as she begins to question her trust in Aladdin after he defends Jafar's former pet parrot, [[Iago (Disney character)|Iago]], who escapes Jafar's lamp and rescues Aladdin from bandits, hoping to make amends with the royal family. However, Iago manages to convince the princess that she still very much trusts Aladdin. Jasmine eventually befriends Iago after he helps mend her and Aladdin's relationship, frees the Genie, and ultimately risks his life to destroy Jafar once and for all, who has returned seeking vengeance. In the second, ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), Jasmine's long-awaited wedding to Aladdin is interrupted by the Forty Thieves. The Oracle, which the thieves are attempting to steal, reveals that Aladdin's father [[Cassim (Aladdin)|Cassim]] is still alive and is their leader. Encouraging Aladdin to pursue his father, Jasmine agrees to postpone the wedding but can't help but worry for him during his absence. When Aladdin finally returns to Agrabah with Cassim and introduces him, Jasmine and the Sultan take an immediate liking to him. However, Cassim is soon imprisoned by the Sultan after he attempts to steal the Oracle again. Aladdin frees Cassim and accepts punishment for his actions until Jasmine convinces her father that he was only helping is father out of love. Iago returns to inform them that Cassim has been captured by [[Sa'luk]] and the remaining Thieves. Jasmine goes with Aladdin to rescue his father, and afterward they return for their wedding, which Cassim attends from the shadows. They go for a ride on Carpet, waving good-bye to the Merchant from the first film and Iago and Cassim as they ride off. Jasmine appears in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|animated television series based on the film]], which originally aired from 1994 to 1995.\n\nJasmine, alongside the other Disney Princesses, appears in the film ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1681010/wreck-it-ralph-2-is-bringing-the-original-disney-princesses-back|title=Wreck-It Ralph 2 Is Bringing The Original Disney Princesses Back|last=Holmes|first=Adam|publisher=CinemaBlend|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=July 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716061218/http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1681010/wreck-it-ralph-2-is-bringing-the-original-disney-princesses-back|archive-date=July 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Naomi Scott]] portrays Jasmine in a [[Aladdin (2019 film)|live action adaptation]] of the 1992 film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/869385-disneys-live-action-aladdin-cast-revealed |title=Disney's Live-Action Aladdin Cast Revealed! |publisher=comingsoon.net |last=Perry |first=Spencer |date=15 July 2017 |access-date=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810194321/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/869385-disneys-live-action-aladdin-cast-revealed |archive-date=10 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film's storyline depicts her mother to originate from Agrabah's neighboring kingdom of Sherebad, desiring to improve her people's lives as sultana despite traditions and Jafar manipulating the Sultan for his own ends.

Voiced by American actress [[Linda Larkin]]{{Snd}} with a singing voice provided by Filipina singer [[Lea Salonga]]{{Snd}} Jasmine is the spirited Princess of Agrabah, who has grown weary of her life of palace confinement. Despite an age-old law stipulating that the princess must marry a prince in time for her upcoming birthday, Jasmine is instead determined to marry someone she loves for who he is as opposed to what he owns. Created by directors [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] with screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], Jasmine is based on [[Badroulbadour]], a princess who appears in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' folktale \"[[Aladdin|Aladdin and the Magical Lamp]]\".\n\nOriginally conceived as a spoiled, [[Materialism|materialistic]] princess, the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Lea Salonga was cast as Jasmine's [[Playback singer|singing voice]] based on her performance in the musical ''[[Miss Saigon]]''; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney Princess to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actresses. Animated by [[Mark Henn]], Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's own sister, and actress [[Jennifer Connelly]].\n\nUnlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine is a supporting character in her own film, taking the secondary role of the [[love interest]]. The character has garnered mixed-to-positive reviews, with much of her character arc compared unfavorably to her predecessors [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]] and [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991) but has been praised for her personality and her chemistry with Aladdin. As the sixth [[Disney Princess]] and the franchise's first [[Person of color|non-European member]], the character is credited with introducing [[Cultural diversity|racial diversity]] to Disney's princess genre. Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in ''Aladdin''<nowiki/>'s [[sequel]]s ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994) and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), as well as its [[Aladdin (TV series)|television series]] and a [[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Broadway musical adaption of the film]]. Both Larkin and Salonga have been awarded [[Disney Legends]] for their contributions to the role. [[Naomi Scott]] played a live-action version of the character in the [[Aladdin (2019 film)|2019 live-action adaptation]] of the original 1992 film.\n\n==Development==\n\n=== Conception and writing

Frustrated with constantly having decisions made for her and being pressured into [[Arranged marriage|marrying a prince by law]], Jasmine disguises herself as a peasant and escapes the palace. In the nearby marketplace, Jasmine befriends street thief Aladdin after he rescues her from an angry vendor who very nearly chops her hand off. Escaping to Aladdin's hideout, the pair bonds over the realization that they both feel trapped in their own environments and long for better lives. When Aladdin is soon arrested by the palace guards, Jasmine demands his immediate release only to find her orders overruled by Jafar, the Sultan's scheming [[Grand Vizier|grand vizier]]. When the princess confronts Jafar, he lies and tells her that Aladdin has already been executed, leaving Jasmine distraught and blaming herself for his death; in reality, Jafar is using Aladdin to retrieve a magical lamp containing a genie. When the Genie, who saves and befriends Aladdin, grants his wish to be transformed into a prince to better his chances of wooing Jasmine, Aladdin introduces himself to her as \"Prince Ali\". Although initially unimpressed, Jasmine is charmed after joining him on a [[magic carpet]] ride, at the end of which she discovers that the prince is, in fact, the same peasant she met in the marketplace. However, Aladdin convinces Jasmine that he truly is a prince who, much like her, only occasionally disguises himself as a commoner. When Jafar learns the truth about Aladdin, he steals the lamp and becomes the Genie's master, banishing Aladdin and forcing the Genie to make him Sultan, while enslaving both Jasmine and her father. After refusing to marry him, Jasmine kisses Jafar to distract him while Aladdin returns in time to trick Jafar into wishing himself into a genie and thus trapping himself within the lamp. Jasmine and the Sultan are finally freed, and she and Aladdin become engaged after the Sultan abolishes the law so that Jasmine can legally marry whomever she chooses.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Aladdin'', Jasmine appears in the film's two [[direct-to-video]] sequels, in both of which Larkin reprises her role as the character, with [[Liz Callaway]] replacing Salonga as her singing voice. The first, ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), features Jasmine as she begins to question her trust in Aladdin after he defends Jafar's former pet parrot, [[Iago (Disney character)|Iago]], who escapes Jafar's lamp and rescues Aladdin from bandits, hoping to make amends with the royal family. However, Iago manages to convince the princess that she still very much trusts Aladdin. Jasmine eventually befriends Iago after he helps mend her and Aladdin's relationship, frees the Genie, and ultimately risks his life to destroy Jafar once and for all, who has returned seeking vengeance. In the second, ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), Jasmine's long-awaited wedding to Aladdin is interrupted by the Forty Thieves. The Oracle, which the thieves are attempting to steal, reveals that Aladdin's father [[Cassim (Aladdin)|Cassim]] is still alive and is their leader. Encouraging Aladdin to pursue his father, Jasmine agrees to postpone the wedding but can't help but worry for him during his absence. When Aladdin finally returns to Agrabah with Cassim and introduces him, Jasmine and the Sultan take an immediate liking to him. However, Cassim is soon imprisoned by the Sultan after he attempts to steal the Oracle again. Aladdin frees Cassim and accepts punishment for his actions until Jasmine convinces her father that he was only helping is father out of love. Iago returns to inform them that Cassim has been captured by [[Sa'luk]] and the remaining Thieves. Jasmine goes with Aladdin to rescue his father, and afterward they return for their wedding, which Cassim attends from the shadows. They go for a ride on Carpet, waving good-bye to the Merchant from the first film and Iago and Cassim as they ride off. Jasmine appears in the [[Aladdin (TV series)|animated television series based on the film]], which originally aired from 1994 to 1995.\n\nJasmine, alongside the other Disney Princesses, appears in the film ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1681010/wreck-it-ralph-2-is-bringing-the-original-disney-princesses-back|title=Wreck-It Ralph 2 Is Bringing The Original Disney Princesses Back|last=Holmes|first=Adam|publisher=CinemaBlend|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=July 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716061218/http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1681010/wreck-it-ralph-2-is-bringing-the-original-disney-princesses-back|archive-date=July 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Naomi Scott]] portrays Jasmine in a [[Aladdin (2019 film)|live action adaptation]] of the 1992 film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/869385-disneys-live-action-aladdin-cast-revealed |title=Disney's Live-Action Aladdin Cast Revealed! |publisher=comingsoon.net |last=Perry |first=Spencer |date=15 July 2017 |access-date=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810194321/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/869385-disneys-live-action-aladdin-cast-revealed |archive-date=10 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film's storyline depicts her mother to originate from Agrabah's neighboring kingdom of Sherebad, desiring to improve her people's lives as sultana despite traditions and Jafar manipulating the Sultan for his own ends.

The team followed their footprints and after about a kilometer, found a group of 18 [[lean-to]] huts made from grass and leaves that showed signs of recent occupation as evidenced by the still-burning fires at the corners of the hut. The team also discovered raw honey, skeletal remains of pigs, wild fruits, an [[adze]], a multi-pronged wooden spear, bows, arrows, cane baskets, fishing nets, bamboo pots and wooden buckets. Metal-working was evident. The team failed to establish any contact and withdrew after leaving gifts.{{Sfn|Pandit|1990|p=17-20}}\n\nThe government was aware that leaving the Sentinelese (and the area) completely isolated and ceasing to claim any control would lead to rampant illegal exploitation of the natural resources by the numerous mercenary outlaws who took refuge in those regions, and probably contribute to the Sentinelese's extinction. Accordingly, in 1970, an official surveying party landed at an isolated spot on the island and erected a stone tablet, atop a disused native hearth, that declared the island part of India.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Pandit undertook several visits to the island, sometimes as an \"expert advisor\" in tour parties including dignitaries who wished to encounter an aboriginal tribe.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":02\" /> Beginning in 1981, he regularly led official expeditions with the purpose of establishing friendly contact.{{Sfn|Pandit|1990|p=13}} Many of these got a friendly reception, with hordes of gifts left for them,<ref name=\":12\" /> but some ended in violent encounters, which were mostly suppressed.<ref name=\":02\" />{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=357}} Some of the expeditions (1987, 1992, et al.) were entirely documented on film.<ref name=\":12\" /> Sometimes the Sentinelese waved and sometimes they turned their backs and assumed a \"defecating\" posture, which Pandit took as a sign of their not being welcome.

They planned to spread the operation of gift-giving over the course of three days and attempt to establish friendly contact. When the motorboat broke through the barrier reefs, the locals emerged from the jungle and shot arrows at it. The crew landed at a safe point on the coast and left gifts in the sand, including a miniature plastic car, some coconuts, a live pig, a doll, and aluminum cookware.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=357}}\n\nThe Sentinelese followed up by launching another volley of arrows, one of which struck the documentary director in his thigh.

They collected coconuts that were offered but retreated to the shore as the team gestured for them to come closer. The team returned to the main ship, ''MV Tarmugli''. It returned to the island in the afternoon to find at least two dozen Sentinelese on the shoreline, one of whom pointed a bow and arrow at the party. Once a woman pushed the arrow down, the man buried his weapons in the beach and the Sentinelese approached quite close to the dinghies for the first time. The Director of Tribal Welfare distributed five bags of coconuts hand-to-hand.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPandya comments:{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=331}} {{block quote|Those present in the defining moment of physical contact now wished to extract professional mileage from the fact of being actually 'touched' by the Sentinelese during the gift giving exercise. Every participating member of the contact party wanted to take the credit of being the first to 'touch the Sentinelese,' as if it were a great mystical moment of transubstantiation wherein the savage hostile reciprocated a gesture of civilized friendship. Who touched and who was touched during the contact event became an emotionally charged issue within various sectors of the administration where claims and counter-claims were sought to be established with earnestness and vigor...it is interesting to note the range of political and cultural significance invested in this specific event of contact.}} Pandit and Madhumala took part in a second expedition on 24 February. The Sentinelese again appeared without weapons, jumped on the dinghies and took coconut sacks. They were also curious about a rifle hidden in the boat, which Chattopadhay believed they saw as a source of iron.<ref name=\"poult1\" /><ref name=\"pandit\" />\n\nIn light of the friendly exchanges with the scrap dealers' team and Portman's observations in 1890, Pandya believes that the Sentinelese used to be visited by other tribes.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=343}}\n\n====Later contact====\nThe series of contact expeditions continued until 1994, with some of them even attempting to plant coconut trees on the island.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=332}} The programs were then abandoned<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> for nearly nine years.<ref name=\":12\" /> The Indian government maintained a policy of no deliberate contact, intervening only in cases of natural calamities that might pose an existential threat or to thwart poachers.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=333}}\n\nA likely reason for the termination of these missions was that the Sentinelese did not let most of the post-Pandit contact teams get near them.<ref name=\":3\" /> The teams usually waited until the armed Sentinelese retreated, then left gifts on the beach or set them adrift toward shore.<ref name=\":02\" /> The government was also quite concerned about the possibility of harm to the Sentinelese by an influx of outsiders\u2014a result of them projecting a relatively friendly image.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=333}} Photos of the 1991 expedition were removed from public display and use of them was restricted by the government.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=333}}\n\nThe next expedition occurred in April 2003, when a canoe built by the Onges was gifted to the visitors.<ref name=\":12\" /> There were further expeditions (some aerial) in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the effects of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], which caused massive tectonic changes to the island: it was enlarged by a merger with nearby small islands, and the sea floor was raised by about {{convert|1.5|m}}, exposing the surrounding coral reefs to air and destroying the shallow lagoons, which were the Sentinelese's fishing grounds.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=347}} The expeditions counted a total of 32 Sentinelese scattered over three places but did not find any bodies.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=362}} The Sentinelese responded to these aerial expeditions with hostile gestures, which led many to conclude that the community was mostly unaffected and had survived the calamity. Pandya argues that Sentinelese hostility is a sign of the physical as well as the cultural resilience of the community.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=336}}\n\nThe Sentinelese generally received the post-tsunami expeditions in a friendly manner. They approached the visiting parties, which carried no arms or shields as they had in earlier expeditions, unarmed.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nIn 2014, an aerial expedition followed by a circumnavigation investigated the effects of a forest fire. Important data was gathered and the expedition recorded that the fire did not seem to have affected the populace. They exhibited a balance of ages and sexes, with a number of young children. Friendly hand gestures were noted but the visitors did not go very close to the island.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The 2014 expedition also recorded that the Sentinelese had adapted to the changes to their fishing grounds, and were using their canoes to travel up to half a kilometre (a third of a mile) from the shore.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Deaths of two fishermen (2006)===\n\nOn 27 January 2006, Indian fishermen Sunder Raj and Pandit Tiwari, who had been attempting to illegally harvest crabs off North Sentinel Island, drifted towards the island after their boat's makeshift anchor failed during the night.

They were also curious about a rifle hidden in the boat, which Chattopadhay believed they saw as a source of iron.<ref name=\"poult1\" /><ref name=\"pandit\" />\n\nIn light of the friendly exchanges with the scrap dealers' team and Portman's observations in 1890, Pandya believes that the Sentinelese used to be visited by other tribes.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=343}}\n\n====Later contact====\nThe series of contact expeditions continued until 1994, with some of them even attempting to plant coconut trees on the island.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=332}} The programs were then abandoned<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> for nearly nine years.<ref name=\":12\" /> The Indian government maintained a policy of no deliberate contact, intervening only in cases of natural calamities that might pose an existential threat or to thwart poachers.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=333}}\n\nA likely reason for the termination of these missions was that the Sentinelese did not let most of the post-Pandit contact teams get near them.<ref name=\":3\" /> The teams usually waited until the armed Sentinelese retreated, then left gifts on the beach or set them adrift toward shore.<ref name=\":02\" /> The government was also quite concerned about the possibility of harm to the Sentinelese by an influx of outsiders\u2014a result of them projecting a relatively friendly image.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=333}} Photos of the 1991 expedition were removed from public display and use of them was restricted by the government.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=333}}\n\nThe next expedition occurred in April 2003, when a canoe built by the Onges was gifted to the visitors.<ref name=\":12\" /> There were further expeditions (some aerial) in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the effects of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], which caused massive tectonic changes to the island: it was enlarged by a merger with nearby small islands, and the sea floor was raised by about {{convert|1.5|m}}, exposing the surrounding coral reefs to air and destroying the shallow lagoons, which were the Sentinelese's fishing grounds.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=347}} The expeditions counted a total of 32 Sentinelese scattered over three places but did not find any bodies.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=362}} The Sentinelese responded to these aerial expeditions with hostile gestures, which led many to conclude that the community was mostly unaffected and had survived the calamity. Pandya argues that Sentinelese hostility is a sign of the physical as well as the cultural resilience of the community.{{Sfn|Pandya|2009|p=336}}\n\nThe Sentinelese generally received the post-tsunami expeditions in a friendly manner. They approached the visiting parties, which carried no arms or shields as they had in earlier expeditions, unarmed.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nIn 2014, an aerial expedition followed by a circumnavigation investigated the effects of a forest fire. Important data was gathered and the expedition recorded that the fire did not seem to have affected the populace. They exhibited a balance of ages and sexes, with a number of young children. Friendly hand gestures were noted but the visitors did not go very close to the island.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The 2014 expedition also recorded that the Sentinelese had adapted to the changes to their fishing grounds, and were using their canoes to travel up to half a kilometre (a third of a mile) from the shore.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Deaths of two fishermen (2006)===\n\nOn 27 January 2006, Indian fishermen Sunder Raj and Pandit Tiwari, who had been attempting to illegally harvest crabs off North Sentinel Island, drifted towards the island after their boat's makeshift anchor failed during the night.
