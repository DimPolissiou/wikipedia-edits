He was created [[Prince of Wales]] on his sixteenth birthday, nine weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and the [[British Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]].\n\nEdward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|constitutional crisis]] by proposing to [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective [[queen consort]]. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the [[Church of England]], which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral [[constitutional monarch]]. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he [[abdicated]]. He was succeeded by his younger brother, [[George VI]]. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|shortest-reigning monarchs in British history]].\n\nAfter his abdication, Edward was created [[Duke of Windsor]]. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple [[Duke and Duchess of Windsor's 1937 tour of Germany|toured Germany]]. During the [[Second World War]], Edward was at first stationed with the [[British Military Mission to France]], but after private accusations that he was a [[Nazi sympathiser]], he was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death in 1972. Wallis died 14 years later.\n== Early life ==\n[[File:George, Duke of York, and his children.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Edward (second from left) with [[George V|his father]] and younger siblings ([[George VI|Albert]] and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary]]), photograph by his grandmother [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], 1899]]\nEdward was born on 23 June 1894 at [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]], on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Windsor, p. 1</ref> He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]).

In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.\n# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.\n# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis.

Edward, Duke of Windsor''' (Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David; 23 June 1894 \u2013 28 May 1972), was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]], and [[Emperor of India]], from 20 January 1936 until [[Abdication of Edward VIII|his abdication]] on 11 December of that year.\n\nEdward was born during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]] as the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] on his sixteenth birthday, nine weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and the [[British Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]].\n\nEdward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|constitutional crisis]] by proposing to [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective [[queen consort]]. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the [[Church of England]], which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral [[constitutional monarch]]. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he [[abdicated]]. He was succeeded by his younger brother, [[George VI]]. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|shortest-reigning monarchs in British history]].\n\nAfter his abdication, Edward was created [[Duke of Windsor]]. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple [[Duke and Duchess of Windsor's 1937 tour of Germany|toured Germany]]. During the [[Second World War]], Edward was at first stationed with the [[British Military Mission to France]], but after private accusations that he was a [[Nazi sympathiser]], he was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death in 1972. Wallis died 14 years later.\n== Early life ==\n[[File:George, Duke of York, and his children.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Edward (second from left) with [[George V|his father]] and younger siblings ([[George VI|Albert]] and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary]]), photograph by his grandmother [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], 1899]]\nEdward was born on 23 June 1894 at [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]], on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Windsor, p. 1</ref> He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]).

In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.\n# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.\n# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.<ref>Attorney General to Home Secretary (14 April 1937) National Archives file HO 144/22945 quoted in Velde, Fran\u00e7ois (6 February 2006) [http://heraldica.org/topics/britain/drafting_lp1937.htm#documents_ The drafting of the letters patent of 1937].

In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Hector said the basic idea for the song came to him while on a break from working on a [[hip hop]] session with Ezi Cut in [[Los Angeles]]: <blockquote>I came up with a couple of lines for the first verse and then phoned my mama's house, left it on the answering machine, and said, \u201cDon't get rid of this!\u201d<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Wayne_Hector_Interview.html \"Interview With Wayne Hector\"], ''[[HitQuarters]]'', 1 Feb 2010.</ref></blockquote> Upon returning to England, Hector went into the studio to work on the idea with long-time songwriting partner and producer Steve Mac.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> When the two discussed what the song was about they agreed that \"this is about our wives. This is about the things that make our lives complete.\"<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> According to Hector the lyrics were completed in about half an hour.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> He added, \"Flying Without Wings was a life-changing moment, and a song he says he is particularly proud of. A big moment for me was when Flying Without Wings came out, I\u2019d had a few Number 1s at that point, but that convinced people I could write good pop songs. After that, I started working with bigger acts and over a more diverse range of genres, including country and rock, which helped me pick up some credibility.\" The band's manager later revealed the song had been planned as the first solo single for [[Boyzone]]'s [[Stephen Gately]]. \"Stephen did the demo and he thought it was going to be his song,\" Walsh recalls. \"I'll be quite honest, I missed it, but as soon as [[Simon Cowell|Simon]] heard it he just went bananas.

In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Hector said the basic idea for the song came to him while on a break from working on a [[hip hop]] session with Ezi Cut in [[Los Angeles]]: <blockquote>I came up with a couple of lines for the first verse and then phoned my mama's house, left it on the answering machine, and said, \u201cDon't get rid of this!\u201d<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Wayne_Hector_Interview.html \"Interview With Wayne Hector\"], ''[[HitQuarters]]'', 1 Feb 2010.</ref></blockquote> Upon returning to England, Hector went into the studio to work on the idea with long-time songwriting partner and producer Steve Mac.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> When the two discussed what the song was about they agreed that \"this is about our wives. This is about the things that make our lives complete.\"<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> According to Hector the lyrics were completed in about half an hour.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> He added, \"Flying Without Wings was a life-changing moment, and a song he says he is particularly proud of. A big moment for me was when Flying Without Wings came out, I\u2019d had a few Number 1s at that point, but that convinced people I could write good pop songs. After that, I started working with bigger acts and over a more diverse range of genres, including country and rock, which helped me pick up some credibility.\" The band's manager later revealed the song had been planned as the first solo single for [[Boyzone]]'s [[Stephen Gately]]. \"Stephen did the demo and he thought it was going to be his song,\" Walsh recalls. \"I'll be quite honest, I missed it, but as soon as [[Simon Cowell|Simon]] heard it he just went bananas. It was really difficult because Westlife were on tour with Boyzone, as the support act.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/20/westlife-bow-out-ballad-career|title=Westlife bow out after 15-year ballad career based on hit formula|first=Peter|last=Robinson|date=20 June 2012|website=the Guardian}}</ref> \n\nIn a documentary aired on [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] called ''Westlife Back Home'', band member Shane Filan said it is probably the best song of their career, while former [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] (band member [[Nicky Byrne]]'s father-in-law) revealed it is his favourite tune from the chart-topping band. The song also won the band their first of four ''[[The Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]'' prizes on the annual televised [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] music awards on 11 December 1999, scoring a total of 159,590 votes to beat Boyzone's [[Ronan Keating]] to the title.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/560705.stm|title=Westlife win song award|date=12 December 1999|website=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Official Charts Company]] stated, \"Flying Without Wings wasn't the first boyband ballad, nor is it the biggest selling, but it was certainly influential.
