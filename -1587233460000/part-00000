Thus, at the [[seminary]] of [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], the Romanian language was a compulsory subject, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the Department of Romanian was closed. At the High School No.1 in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], students had the right to choose among Romanian, [[German language|German]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] until 9 February 1866, when the State Counselor of the Russian Empire forbade teaching of the Romanian language, with the following justification: \"the pupils know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals\".<ref name=\"heitmann\" />\n\nAround 1871, the tsar published an ''[[ukase]]'' \"On the suspension of teaching the Romanian language in the schools of Bessarabia,\" because \"local speech is not taught in the Russian Empire\".<ref name=\"heitmann\" />\n\nThe linguistic situation in Bessarabia from 1812 to 1918 was the gradual development of [[bilingualism]]. [[Russian language|Russian]] continued to develop as the official language of privilege, whereas [[Romanian language|Romanian]] remained the principal vernacular. The evolution of this linguistic situation can be divided into five phases.<ref name=\"lidia\">Colesnic-Codreanca, Lidia. ''Limba Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een Basarabia. Studiu sociolingvistic pe baza materialelor de arhiv\u0103 (1812\u20131918)'' (\"The Romanian language in Bessarabia. A sociolinguistic study based on archival materials (1812-1918)\"). Chi\u0219in\u0103u: Editorial Museum, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe period from 1812 to 1828 was one of neutral or functional bilingualism. Whereas Russian had official dominance, Romanian was not without influence, especially in the spheres of public administration, education (particularly religious education) and culture. In the years immediately following the annexation, loyalty to Romanian language and customs became important. The [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Seminary|Theological Seminary]] (''Seminarul Teologic'') and Lancaster Schools were opened in 1813 and 1824 respectively, Romanian grammar books were published, and the printing press at Chi\u0219in\u0103u began producing religious books.<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nThe period from 1828 to 1843 was one of partial ''[[Diglossia|diglossic]]'' bilingualism. During this time, use of Romanian was forbidden in the sphere of administration. This was carried out through negative means: Romanian was excluded from the [[civil code]]. Romanian continued to be used in education, but only as a separate subject. Bilingual manuals, such as the Russian-Romanian ''Bucoavne'' grammar of Iacob Ghinculov, were published to meet the new need for bilingualism. Religious books and Sunday [[sermon]]s remained the only monolingual public outlet for Romanian. By 1843, the removal of Romanian from public administration was complete.<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nAccording to the [[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]] of 1828, the Moldovan language was also the official language of Ottoman-dominated Moldavia.\n\nThe period from 1843 to 1871 was one of assimilation. Romanian continued to be a school subject at the Liceul Regional ([[high school]]) until 1866, at the Theological Seminary until 1867, and at regional schools until 1871, when all teaching of the language was forbidden by law.<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nThe period from 1871 to 1905 was one of official [[Monoglottism|monolingualism]] in Russian. All public use of Romanian was phased out, and substituted with Russian. Romanian continued to be used as the colloquial language of home and family. This was the era of the highest level of assimilation in the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1872, the priest Pavel Lebedev ordered that all church documents be written in Russian, and, in 1882, the press at Chi\u0219in\u0103u was closed by order of the [[Holy Synod]].<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova md077cvs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Via\u021ba Basarabiei]]'' on a 2007 [[Moldova]]n stamp]]\nThe period from 1905 to 1917 was one of increasing linguistic conflict, with the re-awakening of Romanian national consciousness. In 1905 and 1906, the Bessarabian ''[[zemstvo|zemstva]]'' asked for the re-introduction of Romanian in schools as a \"compulsory language\", and the \"liberty to teach in the mother language (Romanian language)\". At the same time, the first Romanian language newspapers and journals began to appear: ''[[Basarabia (journal)|Basarabia]]'' (1906), ''[[Via\u021ba Basarabiei]]'' (1907), ''[[Moldovanul]]'' (1907), ''[[Lumin\u0103torul]]'' (1908), ''[[Cuv\u00eent moldovenesc]]'' (1913), ''[[Glasul Basarabiei]]'' (1913). From 1913, the synod permitted that \"the churches in Besserabia use the Romanian language\".<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nThe term \"Moldovan language\" (''limb\u0103 moldoveneasc\u0103'') was newly employed to create a state-sponsored ''[[Ausbausprache]]'' to distinguish it from 'Romanian' Romanian. Thus, [[\u0219t. Margeal\u0103]], in 1827, stated that the aim of his book was to \"offer the 800,000 Romanians who live in Bessarabia,... as well as to the millions of Romanians from the other part of [[Prut]], the possibility of knowing the Russian language, and also for the Russians who want to study the Romanian language\". In 1865 [[Ioan Doncev]], editing his Romanian primer and grammar, affirmed that Moldovan is ''valaho-rom\u00e2no'', or Romanian. However, after this date, the label \"Romanian language\" appears only sporadically in the correspondence of the educational authorities. Gradually, ''Moldovan'' became the sole label for the language: a situation that proved useful to those who wished for a cultural separation of Bessarabia from Romania. Although referring to another historical period, [[Kl. Heitmann]] stated that the \"theory of two languages \u2014 Romanian and Moldovan \u2014 was served both in Moscow as well as in Chi\u0219in\u0103u to combat the nationalistic veleities of the Republic of Moldova, being, in fact, an action against Romanian nationalism\". (Heitmann, 1965). The objective of the Russian language policies in Bessarabia was the ''dialectization'' of the Romanian language. A. Ar\u021bimovici, official of the Education Department based in [[Odessa]], wrote a letter, dated 11 February 1863, to the Minister of Public Instructions stating: \"I have the opinion that it will be hard to stop the Romanian population of Bessarabia using the language of the neighbouring principalities, where the concentrated Romanian population may develop the language based on its Latin elements, not good for Slavic language.  The government's directions pertaining to this case aim to make a new dialect in Bessarabia, more closely based on Slavic language, will be, as it will be seen, of no use: we cannot direct the teachers to teach a language that will soon be dead in Moldova and Wallachia... parents will not want their children to learn a different language to the one they currently speak\". Although some clerks, like Ar\u021bimovici, realised that the creation of a dialect apart from the Romanian spoken in the [[United Principalities]] could never be truly effective, most of them \"with the aim of fulfilling governmental policy, tendentiously called the majority language ''Moldovan'', even in the context where ''Romanian'' had always been used previously\".<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\n==Internal history==\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2008}}\nThis section presents the [[sound change]]s that happened from [[Latin]] to '''[[Romanian language|Romanian]]'''. The order in which the sound changes are listed here is not necessarily chronological.\n\n===Up to Proto-Romanian===\n\n====Vowels====\n\n=====In the Vulgar Latin period=====\nClassical Latin had ten pure vowels ([[monophthong]]s), along with three diphthongs.  By the 1st century AD, if not earlier, Latin diphthong {{sm|ae}} became {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, with the quality of short {{sm|e}} but longer; and {{sm|oe}} soon afterwards became {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, merging with long {{sm|\u0113}}.  This left {{sm|au}}.  An early trend in the urban Latin of Rome, already during [[Cicero]]'s time ({{circa}} 50&nbsp;BC), merged it with {{sm|\u014d}}, and a few common words reflect this in Romanian, e.g. ''coad\u0103'' \"tail\" < {{sm|c\u014dda}} < Classical {{sm|cauda}}; similarly ''ureche'' \"ear\" < {{sm|\u014dricla}} < Classical {{sm|auricula}}.  But in general, the territories outside of Rome were unaffected by this change; {{IPA|/au/}} remained everywhere for centuries afterward, and continues to this day in Romanian.\n\nLong and short {{sm|e, i, o, u}} differed in both quality and quantity, with the shorter versions lower and laxer (e.g. {{sm|e}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}} vs. {{sm|\u0113}} {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}).  Long and short {{sm|a}} differed only in quantity.  At a certain point, quantity ceased being phonemic, with all vowels long in stressed [[open syllable]]s and short elsewhere.  This automatically caused long and short {{sm|a}} to merge, but the remaining vowels took two different paths:\n*In the [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] scheme, long and short pairs of vowels simply merge, with the quality difference erased.\n*In the [[Western Romance]] scheme, the quality difference remains, but original short {{sm|i, u}} {{IPA|[\u026a], [\u028a]}} are lowered and merge with original long {{sm|\u0113, \u014d}} {{IPA|[e], [o]}}.  Subsequent to this, unstressed low-mid vowels are raised to become high-mid.\nRomanian and other [[Eastern Romance languages]] follow a mixed scheme, with the back vowels {{sm|o, u}} following the Sardinian scheme but the front vowels {{sm|e, i}} following the Western Romance scheme.  This produces a six-vowel system (contrast the Sardinian five-vowel system and Western Romance seven-vowel system).\n\nShort and long back vowels merged, for example:\n* Lat. ''mare'' > Rom. ''mare'' ('sea')\n* Lat. ''p\u0101lum'' > *''paru'' > Rom. ''par'' ('pole')\n* Lat. ''focum'' > *''focu'' > Rom. ''foc'' ('fire')\n* Lat. ''p\u014dmum'' > *''pomu'' > Rom. ''pom'' ('fruit-bearing tree')\n* Lat. ''multum'' > *''multu'' > Rom. ''mult'' ('much')\n* Lat. ''t\u016b'' > Rom. ''tu'' ('thou')\n\nLatin short {{sm|u}} seems to have been lowered to ''o'' when stressed and before ''m'' or ''b'' in some words:\n\n* Lat. ''autumna'' (from ''autumnus'') > *''tomna'' > Rom. ''toamn\u0103'' ('autumn')\n* Lat. ''rubeum'' > *''robi\u032fu'' > Rom. ''roib''\n\nAlso, Latin long {{sm|\u014d}} was changed to ''u'' in a few words:\n\n* Lat. ''cohortem'' > *''c\u014drtem'' > Rom. ''curte''\n\nFront vowels changed as follows:\n* {{sm|\u0113}}/{{sm|oe}} and {{sm|i}} became {{IPA|/e/}}.\n* {{sm|\u012b}} became {{IPA|/i/}}.\n* {{sm|e}}/{{sm|ae}} became:\n** {{IPA|/\u025b/}} in stressed syllables\n** {{IPA|/e/}} in unstressed syllables\n* Subsequent to this, stressed {{IPA|/\u025b/}} diphthongized to {{IPA|/je/}}.\nExamples:\n: Lat. ''pellem'' > *''{{IPA|p\u025blle}}'' > Rom. ''piele'' {{IPA|/pjele/}} ('skin')\n: Lat. ''signum'' > *''semnu'' > Rom. ''semn'' ('sign')\n: Lat. ''v\u012bnum'' > *''vinu'' > Rom. ''vin'' ('wine')\n\n=====Breaking of stressed open ''e''=====\nIn Romanian, as in a number of other Romance languages, stressed {{IPA|/\u025b/}} (including from original {{sm|ae}}) [[vowel breaking|broke]] (diphthongized) to {{IPA|*/je/}}. This happened in all syllables, whether open or closed, similarly to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but unlike [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[French language|French]], where this breaking only happened in [[open syllable]]s (those followed by only a single consonant).\n\n* Lat. ''pellem'' > *''{{IPA|p\u025blle}}'' > Rom. ''piele'' {{IPA|/pjele/}} 'skin'\n\nFrequently, the {{IPA|/j/}} was later absorbed by a preceding consonant, by the operation of [[#Second palatalization|second palatalization]].\n\n* Lat. ''decem'' > *''{{IPA|d\u025bce}}'' > *''di\u032fece'' > *''dzece'' > Rom. ''zece'' 'ten'\n\nThe {{IPA|/e/}} was later affected by other changes in certain circumstances, e.g. breaking to {{IPA|/e\u032fa/}} or lowering to {{IPA|/a/}}:\n\n* Lat. ''equa'' > *''{{IPA|\u025bpa}}'' > *''i\u032fepa'' > Rom. ''iap\u0103'' 'mare'\n* Lat. ''terra'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025brra}}'' > *''ti\u032fera'' > *''\u021bera'' > archaic ''\u021bear\u0103'' > Rom. ''\u021bar\u0103'' 'land'\n* Lat. ''testa'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025bsta}}'' > *''ti\u032festa'' > *''\u021besta'' > Rom. ''\u021beast\u0103'' 'skull'\n\n=====Backing of ''e''=====\nThe vowel ''e'' was changed to ''\u0103'' \u2013 and the diphthong ''ea'' was reduced to ''a'' \u2013 when preceded by a labial consonant and followed by a [[back vowel]] in the next syllable (i.e. it stayed ''e'' \u2013 and the diphthong changed back to ''e'' \u2013 when the following vowel was ''i'' or ''e''):\n\n* Lat. ''pilus'' > ''peru'' > Rom. ''p\u0103r'' 'hair', but\n* Lat. ''pil\u012b'' > Rom. ''peri'' 'hairs'\n* Lat. ''p\u0113ra'' > ''pear\u0103'' > Rom. ''par\u0103'' 'pear', but\n* Lat. ''p\u0113rae'' > ''peare'' > Rom. ''pere'' 'pears'\n* Lat. ''m\u0113nsam'' > *''mesa'' > ''meas\u0103'' > Rom. ''mas\u0103'' 'table', but\n* Lat. ''m\u0113nsae'' > ''mease'' > Rom. ''mese'' 'tables'\n* Lat. ''v\u0113nd\u014d'' > *''vendu'' > *''v\u0103ndu'' > *''v\u00e2ndu'' > Rom. ''v\u00e2nd'' 'I sell', but\n* Lat. ''v\u0113ndis'' > *''vend\u012b'' > *''vendzi'' > ''vindzi'' > Rom. ''vinzi'' 'you sell'\n\nThis phonetic change is characteristic for standard Romanian, but it did not affect the dialect spoken in [[\u021aara Ha\u021begului]].\n\n=====Breaking of ''e'' and ''o''=====\nThe vowel ''o'' was [[vowel breaking|broken]] (diphthongized) to ''oa'' before a non-high vowel:\n\n* Lat. ''fl\u014drem'' > Rom. ''floare'' 'flower'\n* Lat. ''h\u014dram'' > Rom. ''oar\u0103'' 'time' as in \"a treia oar\u0103\" 'the third time' \n\nThe vowel ''e'' was broken to ''ea'' in similar circumstances when not changed to ''\u0103''/''a'' (see above). The ''e'' was often absorbed by a preceding palatal sound:\n\n* Lat. ''equa'' > *''{{IPA|\u025bpa}}'' > *''i\u032fepa'' > *''i\u032feapa'' > Rom. ''iap\u0103'' 'mare'\n* Lat. ''terra'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025brra}}'' > *''ti\u032fera'' > *''\u021bera'' > archaic ''\u021bear\u0103'' > Rom. ''\u021bar\u0103'' 'land'\n* Lat. ''testa'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025bsta}}'' > *''ti\u032festa'' > *''\u021besta'' > Rom. ''\u021beast\u0103'' 'skull'\n\n=====Vowel reduction=====\nUnstressed ''a'' became ''\u0103'' (except when at the beginning of the word) and unstressed ''o'' was [[vowel reduction|reduced]] to ''u''. Then ''\u0103'' became ''e'' after [[palatal consonant]]s. Unstressed ''o'' was kept in some words due to analogy.\n\n* Lat. ''capra'' > Rom. ''capr\u0103'' \u2018goat\u2019\n* Lat. ''v\u012bnea'' > *''vinja'' > *''vi\u0272\u0103'' (Megleno-Romanian) > *''vi\u0272e'' (Aromanian)<ref>Alexandru Cior\u0103nescu, ''Dic\u0163ionarul etimologic al limbii rom\u00e2ne'' (Bucharest: Saeculum I. O., 2002), 834.</ref> > Rom. ''vie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8vije/}} \u2018vineyard\u2019\n* Lat. ''form\u014dsus'' > Rom. ''frumos'' \u2018beautiful\u2019\n\n====Consonants====\n\n=====Labiovelars=====\nIn the Vulgar Latin period, the [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] {{angbr|qu gu}} {{IPA|/k\u02b7 \u0261\u02b7/}} were reduced to simple velars {{IPA|/k \u0261/}} before front vowels. These were subsequently palatalized to {{IPA|/t\u0283 d\u0292/}} by the [[#Second palatalization|second palatalization]] (see below):\n*Lat. ''quaerere'' \"to seek\" > *''k\u025brere'' > Rom. ''cere'' 'ask'\n\nThe labiovelars originally remained before ''a'', but were subsequently changed to labials {{IPA|/p b/}}, although in question words beginning with ''qu-'', this was never changed to ''p-'' (presumably through analogy with words beginning ''que-, qui-, quo-'' in Latin):\n* Lat. ''quattuor'' > *''quattro'' > Rom. ''patru'' 'four'\n* Lat. ''equa'' > *''{{IPA|\u025bpa}}'' > *''i\u032fepa'' > Rom. ''iap\u0103'' 'mare'\n* Lat. ''lingua'' > Rom. ''limb\u0103'' 'tongue'\n*But Lat. ''quand\u014d'' > *''kando'' > ''k\u0103ndu'' ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]]) > Rom. ''c\u00e2nd'' 'when'\n\n=====Labialization of velars=====\nAnother important change is the labialization of velars before dentals, which includes the changes ''ct'' > ''pt'', ''gn'' {{IPA|[\u014bn]}} > ''mn'', and ''x'' {{IPA|[ks]}} > ''ps''. Later, ''ps'' assimilated to ''ss'', then to ''s'' ~ ''\u0219'' in most words.\n\n* Lat. ''factum'' > *''faptu'' > Rom. ''fapt'' 'fact; deed'\n* Lat. ''signum'' > *''semnu'' > Rom. ''semn'' 'sign'\n* Lat. ''coxa'' > *''copsa'' > Rom. ''coaps\u0103'' 'thigh', but:\n* Lat. ''fraxinus'' > ''frapsinu'' (Aromanian) > Rom. ''frasin'' 'ash tree' (vs. Banat ''fraps\u0103n'', ''frapsine'')\n* Lat. ''lax\u014d'' > *''lapso'' > *''lassu'' > Rom. ''las'' 'I let'\n\n=====Final consonants=====\nIn both Romanian and Italian, virtually all final consonants were lost. As a consequence, there was a period in the history of Romanian in which all words ended with vowels. In addition, final ''-s'' produced a new final ''-i'',{{dubious|all such cases have traditionally been explained as analogical, e.g. st\u00f2 <- stao, stai like v\u00f2 <- vao <- vado, vai <- vadi, and va <- vae <- vade like sta. Are there any forms of the supposed \"!duolei <- doles\" type attested?|date=June 2013}} as in Lat. ''nos'' > Rom. ''noi'' 'we' and Lat. ''stas'' > Rom. ''stai'' 'you stand'.\n\n=====Palatalization=====\nIn [[Vulgar Latin]], short {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} followed by another vowel were changed to a glide {{IPA|/j/}}. Later, {{IPA|/j/}} [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] preceding {{lcons|coronal}} and {{lcons|velar}} consonants, changing its quality. For dentals, the outcome depended on whether word stress precedes or follows:\n*dentals:\n** after stress\n*** Lat. ''puteus'' > *''p\u00fati\u032fu'' > ''pu\u021bu'' > Rom. ''pu\u021b'' 'well, pit',\n*** Lat. ''hordeum'' > *''\u00f3rdi\u032fu'' > ''ordzu'' > Rom. ''orz'' 'barley', \n** before stress\n*** Lat. ''r\u014dg\u0101ti\u014dnem'' > *''rogati\u032f\u00f3ne'' > *''roga\u010done'' > Rom. ''rug\u0103ciune'' 'prayer'\n*** VLat. ''deosum'' > *''di\u032f\u00f3su'' > *''djosu'' > Rom. ''jos'' 'down'\n* other consonants:\n** Lat. ''socium'' > *''s\u00f3ki\u032fu'' > ''so\u021bu'' > Rom. ''so\u021b'' 'companion; husband'\n** Lat. ''c\u0101seus'' > *''kasi\u032fu'' > Rom. ''ca\u0219'' 'fresh, unripened cheese'\n** Lat. ''v\u012bnea'' > *''vini\u032fa'' > *''{{IPA|vi\u0272e}}'' > standard Rom. ''vie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8vije/}}\n** Lat. ''mulierem'' > *''muli\u032fere'' > *''{{IPA|mu\u028eere}}'' > Rom. ''muiere'' {{IPA|/mu\u02c8jere/}} 'woman'\n\nNotice that the twofold outcome for dentals is still productive in modern Romanian:\n*''cred\u00edn\u021b\u0103'' 'faith' \u2014 ''credinci\u00f3s'' 'faithful'\n*''ogl\u00ednd\u0103'' 'mirror' \u2014 ''oglinjo\u00e1r\u0103'' 'small mirror'.\n\nThe above palatalizations occurred in all of the [[Romance languages]], although with slightly differing outcomes in different languages.  [[Labial consonant]]s, however, were unaffected by the above palatalizations.  Instead, at a later time, the {{IPA|/j/}} underwent [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]:\n\n* Lat. ''rubeum'' > *''robi\u032fu'' > Rom. ''roib''\n\n=====Palatalization of ''cl'' clusters=====\nThe Latin cluster ''cl'' was palatalized to {{IPA|/k\u028e/}}:\n\n* Vulgar Latin ''oricla'' > *''urecli\u032fa'' > *''urecli\u032fe'' (Aromanian ''ureaclje'') > Rom. ''ureche'' 'ear'\n\n=====''l''-rhotacism=====\n\nAt some point, Latin [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] ''l'' developed into ''r''. From the evolution of certain words, it is clear that this happened after the above-mentioned [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], but before the simplification of [[gemination|double consonants]] (as ''ll'' did not rhotacize) and also before ''i''-palatalization. Some examples:\n\n* Lat. ''gelu'' > Rom. ''ger'' 'frost'\n* Lat. ''sal\u012bre'' > Rom. ''a s\u0103ri'' (''s\u0103rire'') 'to jump'\n\n=====Second palatalization=====\n\nThe dental consonants ''t'', ''d'', ''s'', ''l'' were palatalized again by a following ''i'' or ''i\u032f'' (from the combination ''i\u032fe/i\u032fa'' < ''{{IPA|\u025b}}'' < stressed ''e''):\n\n* Lat. ''testa'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025bsta}}'' > *''ti\u032festa'' > *''\u021besta'' > Rom. ''\u021beast\u0103'' 'skull'\n* Lat. ''decem'' > *''{{IPA|d\u025bce}}'' > *''di\u032fece'' > *''dzece'' > Rom.

''gall\u012bna'' > *''{{IPA|\u0261alina}}'' > *''{{IPA|\u0261\u0103\u028ein\u0103}}'' (= Arom. ''g\u00e3ljin\u00e3'') > Rom. ''g\u0103in\u0103'' 'hen'\n\nThe velar consonants {{IPA|/k \u0261/}} (from Latin labiovelars ''qu gu'') were palatalized to {{IPA|/t\u0283 d\u0292/}} before front vowels:\n* Lat. ''quid'' > *''ki'' > Rom. ''ce'' 'what'\n* Lat. ''qu\u012bnque'' > Vulgar Latin ''*c\u012bnque'' (Italian ''cinque'') > Rom. ''cinci'' \"five\"\n* Lat. ''quaerere'' \"to seek\" > *''k\u025brere'' > Rom. ''cere'' 'ask'\n* Lat. ''sanguine'' > *''sangin'' > Rom. ''s\u00e2nge'' 'blood'\n\n===Modern changes===\nThese are changes that did not happen in all [[Eastern Romance languages]]. Some occur in standard Romanian; some do not.\n\n====Spirantization====\nIn southern dialects, and in the standard language, ''dz'' is lost as a phoneme, becoming ''z'' in all environments:\n\n* ''dzic'' > ''zic'' ('I say')\n* ''lucredzi'' > ''lucrezi'' ('you work')\n\nThe affricate {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} became ''j'' {{IPA|/\u0292/}} only when hard (i.e. followed by a back vowel):\n\n* ''gioc'' {{IPA|/d\u0292ok/}} > ''joc'' ('game'), but:\n* ''deget'' {{IPA|/\u02c8ded\u0292et/}} ('finger') did not change.\n\n====Lenition of resonants====\nFormer palatal resonants {{IPA|/\u028e \u0272/}} were both [[lenition|lenited]] (weakened) to {{IPA|/j/}}, which was subsequently lost next to {{IPA|/i/}}:\n* Lat. ''leporem'' > *''{{IPA|l\u025bpore}}'' > *''li\u032fepure'' > *''{{IPA|\u028eepure}}'' > Rom. ''iepure'' 'hare'\n* Lat. ''l\u012bnum'' > *''{{IPA|\u028einu}}'' > *''{{IPA|\u028ein}}'' > Rom.

''pellem, pell\u012bs'' > *''{{IPA|p\u025blle, p\u025blli}}'' > *''{{IPA|pi\u032fele, pi\u032feli}}'' > *''{{IPA|pi\u032fele, pi\u032fe\u028ei}}'' > Rom. ''piele, piei'' 'skin, skins'\n* Lat. ''v\u012bnea'' > *''vinja'' > *''vi\u0272\u0103'' > *''vi\u0272e'' > Rom. ''vie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8vije/}} 'vineyard'\n\nFormer intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} from Latin {{sm|-ll-}} was lost entirely before {{IPA|/a/}} by first [[l-vocalization|vocalizing]] to {{IPA|/w/}}:\n* Lat ''st\u0113lla'' > *''stela'' > archaic ''steal\u0103'' > colloquial ''steau\u0103'' > standard Rom. ''stea'' 'star'\n* Lat ''sella'' > *''s\u025blla'' > *''si\u032fela'' > *''\u0219ela'' > *''\u0219eu\u0103'' > Muntenian ''\u0219ea'' > standard Rom. ''\u0219a'' 'saddle'\n\nFormer intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} from Latin {{sm|-ll-}} was preserved before other vowels:\n* Lat ''caballum'' > *''cavallu'' > *''caalu'' > Rom. ''cal'' 'horse'\n* Lat ''callem'' > Rom. ''cale'' 'way'\n\nFormer intervocalic {{IPA|/v/}} (from Latin {{sm|-b-,-v-}}) was lost, perhaps first weakened to {{IPA|/w/}}:\n* Lat ''b\u016bbalus'' > *''buvalu'' > *''buwaru'' > archaic ''buar'', ''boar'' > standard Rom. ''bour'' '[[aurochs]]'\n* Lat ''v\u012bvere'' > *''vivere'' > *''viwe'' > Muntenian ''vie'' > standard Rom. ''a via'' 'to live'\n\n====''n''-epenthesis====\nRelatively recently, stressed ''u'' preceded by ''n'' lengthens and nasalizes, producing a following ''n'' ([[epenthesis]]).\n* Lat ''genuculus'' > ''*genuclus'' > western ''genuchi'' > Rom. ''genunchi'' 'knee'\n* Lat ''manuplus'' > ''*manuclus'' > western ''m\u0103nuchi'' > Rom. ''m\u0103nunchi'' 'bouquet'\n* Lat ''minutus'' > ''minut'' (Aromanian) > (Banat, Moldavia) ''m\u0103nunt'' > Rom. ''m\u0103runt'' 'minute, small'\n* the reverse process:\n** Lat ''ranunculus'' 'tadpole; crowfoot, buttercup' > ''*ranunclus'' > archaic ''r\u0103nunchi'' > Rom. ''r\u0103runchi'' 'kidney; (dial.) buttercup' > dialectal ''r\u0103ruchi''\n\n====''j''-epenthesis====\nIn some words, the semivowel {{IPA|/j/}} was inserted between ''\u00e2'' and soft ''n'':\n\n* ''p\u00e2ne'' > ''p\u00e2ine'' ('bread')\n* ''c\u00e2ne'' > ''c\u00e2ine'' ('dog')\n\nIt also explains the plural ''m\u00e2n\u0103'' - ''m\u00e2ini'' ('hand, hands'). This is also specific to southern dialects and the standard language; in other regions one may hear ''c\u00e2ne'' etc.\n\nIt may be [[compensatory lengthening]] followed by [[dissimilation]]: ''p\u00e2ne'' > ''p\u00e2\u00e2ne'' > ''p\u00e2ine''. It has spread from the [[Oltenia]]n dialect to literary Romanian. It has alternatively been explained as palatalization followed by [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]: ''c\u00e2ne'' > *''c\u00e2ni\u032fe'' > ''c\u00e2ine''. Oltenian has ''c\u00e2ine''; all other dialects have ''c\u00e2ni\u032fe''.\n\n====Hardening====\nBacking of vowels after ''\u0219'', ''\u021b'' and ''dz'' is specific to northern dialects. Because those consonants can be followed only by back vowels, any front vowel is changed to a back one:\n\n* ''\u0219i'' > ''\u0219\u00ee'' 'and'\n* ''\u021bine'' > ''\u021b\u00e2ni\u032fe'' 'holds'\n* ''zic'' > ''dz\u00e2c'' 'I say'\n\nIt is similar to vowel backing after hard consonants in [[Russian language|Russian]] (see {{section link|Russian phonology|Front vowels}}).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Legacy of the Roman Empire]]\n* [[Romance languages]]\n* [[Albanian-Romanian linguistic relationship]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*''Procopius: History of the Wars (Books VI.16&ndash;VII.35.)''

Thus, at the [[seminary]] of [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], the Romanian language was a compulsory subject, with 10 hours weekly, until 1863, when the Department of Romanian was closed. At the High School No.1 in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], students had the right to choose among Romanian, [[German language|German]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] until 9 February 1866, when the State Counselor of the Russian Empire forbade teaching of the Romanian language, with the following justification: \"the pupils know this language in the practical mode, and its teaching follows other goals\".<ref name=\"heitmann\" />\n\nAround 1871, the tsar published an ''[[ukase]]'' \"On the suspension of teaching the Romanian language in the schools of Bessarabia,\" because \"local speech is not taught in the Russian Empire\".<ref name=\"heitmann\" />\n\nThe linguistic situation in Bessarabia from 1812 to 1918 was the gradual development of [[bilingualism]]. [[Russian language|Russian]] continued to develop as the official language of privilege, whereas [[Romanian language|Romanian]] remained the principal vernacular. The evolution of this linguistic situation can be divided into five phases.<ref name=\"lidia\">Colesnic-Codreanca, Lidia. ''Limba Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een Basarabia. Studiu sociolingvistic pe baza materialelor de arhiv\u0103 (1812\u20131918)'' (\"The Romanian language in Bessarabia. A sociolinguistic study based on archival materials (1812-1918)\"). Chi\u0219in\u0103u: Editorial Museum, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe period from 1812 to 1828 was one of neutral or functional bilingualism. Whereas Russian had official dominance, Romanian was not without influence, especially in the spheres of public administration, education (particularly religious education) and culture. In the years immediately following the annexation, loyalty to Romanian language and customs became important. The [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Seminary|Theological Seminary]] (''Seminarul Teologic'') and Lancaster Schools were opened in 1813 and 1824 respectively, Romanian grammar books were published, and the printing press at Chi\u0219in\u0103u began producing religious books.<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nThe period from 1828 to 1843 was one of partial ''[[Diglossia|diglossic]]'' bilingualism. During this time, use of Romanian was forbidden in the sphere of administration. This was carried out through negative means: Romanian was excluded from the [[civil code]]. Romanian continued to be used in education, but only as a separate subject. Bilingual manuals, such as the Russian-Romanian ''Bucoavne'' grammar of Iacob Ghinculov, were published to meet the new need for bilingualism. Religious books and Sunday [[sermon]]s remained the only monolingual public outlet for Romanian. By 1843, the removal of Romanian from public administration was complete.<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nAccording to the [[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]] of 1828, the Moldovan language was also the official language of Ottoman-dominated Moldavia.\n\nThe period from 1843 to 1871 was one of assimilation. Romanian continued to be a school subject at the Liceul Regional ([[high school]]) until 1866, at the Theological Seminary until 1867, and at regional schools until 1871, when all teaching of the language was forbidden by law.<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nThe period from 1871 to 1905 was one of official [[Monoglottism|monolingualism]] in Russian. All public use of Romanian was phased out, and substituted with Russian. Romanian continued to be used as the colloquial language of home and family. This was the era of the highest level of assimilation in the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1872, the priest Pavel Lebedev ordered that all church documents be written in Russian, and, in 1882, the press at Chi\u0219in\u0103u was closed by order of the [[Holy Synod]].<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova md077cvs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Via\u021ba Basarabiei]]'' on a 2007 [[Moldova]]n stamp]]\nThe period from 1905 to 1917 was one of increasing linguistic conflict, with the re-awakening of Romanian national consciousness. In 1905 and 1906, the Bessarabian ''[[zemstvo|zemstva]]'' asked for the re-introduction of Romanian in schools as a \"compulsory language\", and the \"liberty to teach in the mother language (Romanian language)\". At the same time, the first Romanian language newspapers and journals began to appear: ''[[Basarabia (journal)|Basarabia]]'' (1906), ''[[Via\u021ba Basarabiei]]'' (1907), ''[[Moldovanul]]'' (1907), ''[[Lumin\u0103torul]]'' (1908), ''[[Cuv\u00eent moldovenesc]]'' (1913), ''[[Glasul Basarabiei]]'' (1913). From 1913, the synod permitted that \"the churches in Besserabia use the Romanian language\".<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\nThe term \"Moldovan language\" (''limb\u0103 moldoveneasc\u0103'') was newly employed to create a state-sponsored ''[[Ausbausprache]]'' to distinguish it from 'Romanian' Romanian. Thus, [[\u0219t. Margeal\u0103]], in 1827, stated that the aim of his book was to \"offer the 800,000 Romanians who live in Bessarabia,... as well as to the millions of Romanians from the other part of [[Prut]], the possibility of knowing the Russian language, and also for the Russians who want to study the Romanian language\". In 1865 [[Ioan Doncev]], editing his Romanian primer and grammar, affirmed that Moldovan is ''valaho-rom\u00e2no'', or Romanian. However, after this date, the label \"Romanian language\" appears only sporadically in the correspondence of the educational authorities. Gradually, ''Moldovan'' became the sole label for the language: a situation that proved useful to those who wished for a cultural separation of Bessarabia from Romania. Although referring to another historical period, [[Kl. Heitmann]] stated that the \"theory of two languages \u2014 Romanian and Moldovan \u2014 was served both in Moscow as well as in Chi\u0219in\u0103u to combat the nationalistic veleities of the Republic of Moldova, being, in fact, an action against Romanian nationalism\". (Heitmann, 1965). The objective of the Russian language policies in Bessarabia was the ''dialectization'' of the Romanian language. A. Ar\u021bimovici, official of the Education Department based in [[Odessa]], wrote a letter, dated 11 February 1863, to the Minister of Public Instructions stating: \"I have the opinion that it will be hard to stop the Romanian population of Bessarabia using the language of the neighbouring principalities, where the concentrated Romanian population may develop the language based on its Latin elements, not good for Slavic language.  The government's directions pertaining to this case aim to make a new dialect in Bessarabia, more closely based on Slavic language, will be, as it will be seen, of no use: we cannot direct the teachers to teach a language that will soon be dead in Moldova and Wallachia... parents will not want their children to learn a different language to the one they currently speak\". Although some clerks, like Ar\u021bimovici, realised that the creation of a dialect apart from the Romanian spoken in the [[United Principalities]] could never be truly effective, most of them \"with the aim of fulfilling governmental policy, tendentiously called the majority language ''Moldovan'', even in the context where ''Romanian'' had always been used previously\".<ref name=\"lidia\" />\n\n==Internal history==\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2008}}\nThis section presents the [[sound change]]s that happened from [[Latin]] to '''[[Romanian language|Romanian]]'''. The order in which the sound changes are listed here is not necessarily chronological.\n\n===Up to Proto-Romanian===\n\n====Vowels====\n\n=====In the Vulgar Latin period=====\nClassical Latin had ten pure vowels ([[monophthong]]s), along with three diphthongs.  By the 1st century AD, if not earlier, Latin diphthong {{sm|ae}} became {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, with the quality of short {{sm|e}} but longer; and {{sm|oe}} soon afterwards became {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, merging with long {{sm|\u0113}}.  This left {{sm|au}}.  An early trend in the urban Latin of Rome, already during [[Cicero]]'s time ({{circa}} 50&nbsp;BC), merged it with {{sm|\u014d}}, and a few common words reflect this in Romanian, e.g. ''coad\u0103'' \"tail\" < {{sm|c\u014dda}} < Classical {{sm|cauda}}; similarly ''ureche'' \"ear\" < {{sm|\u014dricla}} < Classical {{sm|auricula}}.  But in general, the territories outside of Rome were unaffected by this change; {{IPA|/au/}} remained everywhere for centuries afterward, and continues to this day in Romanian.\n\nLong and short {{sm|e, i, o, u}} differed in both quality and quantity, with the shorter versions lower and laxer (e.g. {{sm|e}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}} vs. {{sm|\u0113}} {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}).  Long and short {{sm|a}} differed only in quantity.  At a certain point, quantity ceased being phonemic, with all vowels long in stressed [[open syllable]]s and short elsewhere.  This automatically caused long and short {{sm|a}} to merge, but the remaining vowels took two different paths:\n*In the [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] scheme, long and short pairs of vowels simply merge, with the quality difference erased.\n*In the [[Western Romance]] scheme, the quality difference remains, but original short {{sm|i, u}} {{IPA|[\u026a], [\u028a]}} are lowered and merge with original long {{sm|\u0113, \u014d}} {{IPA|[e], [o]}}.  Subsequent to this, unstressed low-mid vowels are raised to become high-mid.\nRomanian and other [[Eastern Romance languages]] follow a mixed scheme, with the back vowels {{sm|o, u}} following the Sardinian scheme but the front vowels {{sm|e, i}} following the Western Romance scheme.  This produces a six-vowel system (contrast the Sardinian five-vowel system and Western Romance seven-vowel system).\n\nShort and long back vowels merged, for example:\n* Lat. ''mare'' > Rom. ''mare'' ('sea')\n* Lat. ''p\u0101lum'' > *''paru'' > Rom. ''par'' ('pole')\n* Lat. ''focum'' > *''focu'' > Rom. ''foc'' ('fire')\n* Lat. ''p\u014dmum'' > *''pomu'' > Rom. ''pom'' ('fruit-bearing tree')\n* Lat. ''multum'' > *''multu'' > Rom. ''mult'' ('much')\n* Lat. ''t\u016b'' > Rom. ''tu'' ('thou')\n\nLatin short {{sm|u}} seems to have been lowered to ''o'' when stressed and before ''m'' or ''b'' in some words:\n\n* Lat. ''autumna'' (from ''autumnus'') > *''tomna'' > Rom. ''toamn\u0103'' ('autumn')\n* Lat. ''rubeum'' > *''robi\u032fu'' > Rom. ''roib''\n\nAlso, Latin long {{sm|\u014d}} was changed to ''u'' in a few words:\n\n* Lat. ''cohortem'' > *''c\u014drtem'' > Rom. ''curte''\n\nFront vowels changed as follows:\n* {{sm|\u0113}}/{{sm|oe}} and {{sm|i}} became {{IPA|/e/}}.\n* {{sm|\u012b}} became {{IPA|/i/}}.\n* {{sm|e}}/{{sm|ae}} became:\n** {{IPA|/\u025b/}} in stressed syllables\n** {{IPA|/e/}} in unstressed syllables\n* Subsequent to this, stressed {{IPA|/\u025b/}} diphthongized to {{IPA|/je/}}.\nExamples:\n: Lat. ''pellem'' > *''{{IPA|p\u025blle}}'' > Rom. ''piele'' {{IPA|/pjele/}} ('skin')\n: Lat. ''signum'' > *''semnu'' > Rom. ''semn'' ('sign')\n: Lat. ''v\u012bnum'' > *''vinu'' > Rom. ''vin'' ('wine')\n\n=====Breaking of stressed open ''e''=====\nIn Romanian, as in a number of other Romance languages, stressed {{IPA|/\u025b/}} (including from original {{sm|ae}}) [[vowel breaking|broke]] (diphthongized) to {{IPA|*/je/}}. This happened in all syllables, whether open or closed, similarly to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but unlike [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[French language|French]], where this breaking only happened in [[open syllable]]s (those followed by only a single consonant).\n\n* Lat. ''pellem'' > *''{{IPA|p\u025blle}}'' > Rom. ''piele'' {{IPA|/pjele/}} 'skin'\n\nFrequently, the {{IPA|/j/}} was later absorbed by a preceding consonant, by the operation of [[#Second palatalization|second palatalization]].\n\n* Lat. ''decem'' > *''{{IPA|d\u025bce}}'' > *''di\u032fece'' > *''dzece'' > Rom. ''zece'' 'ten'\n\nThe {{IPA|/e/}} was later affected by other changes in certain circumstances, e.g. breaking to {{IPA|/e\u032fa/}} or lowering to {{IPA|/a/}}:\n\n* Lat. ''equa'' > *''{{IPA|\u025bpa}}'' > *''i\u032fepa'' > Rom. ''iap\u0103'' 'mare'\n* Lat. ''terra'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025brra}}'' > *''ti\u032fera'' > *''\u021bera'' > archaic ''\u021bear\u0103'' > Rom. ''\u021bar\u0103'' 'land'\n* Lat. ''testa'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025bsta}}'' > *''ti\u032festa'' > *''\u021besta'' > Rom. ''\u021beast\u0103'' 'skull'\n\n=====Backing of ''e''=====\nThe vowel ''e'' was changed to ''\u0103'' \u2013 and the diphthong ''ea'' was reduced to ''a'' \u2013 when preceded by a labial consonant and followed by a [[back vowel]] in the next syllable (i.e. it stayed ''e'' \u2013 and the diphthong changed back to ''e'' \u2013 when the following vowel was ''i'' or ''e''):\n\n* Lat. ''pilus'' > ''peru'' > Rom. ''p\u0103r'' 'hair', but\n* Lat. ''pil\u012b'' > Rom. ''peri'' 'hairs'\n* Lat. ''p\u0113ra'' > ''pear\u0103'' > Rom. ''par\u0103'' 'pear', but\n* Lat. ''p\u0113rae'' > ''peare'' > Rom. ''pere'' 'pears'\n* Lat. ''m\u0113nsam'' > *''mesa'' > ''meas\u0103'' > Rom. ''mas\u0103'' 'table', but\n* Lat. ''m\u0113nsae'' > ''mease'' > Rom. ''mese'' 'tables'\n* Lat. ''v\u0113nd\u014d'' > *''vendu'' > *''v\u0103ndu'' > *''v\u00e2ndu'' > Rom. ''v\u00e2nd'' 'I sell', but\n* Lat. ''v\u0113ndis'' > *''vend\u012b'' > *''vendzi'' > ''vindzi'' > Rom. ''vinzi'' 'you sell'\n\nThis phonetic change is characteristic for standard Romanian, but it did not affect the dialect spoken in [[\u021aara Ha\u021begului]].\n\n=====Breaking of ''e'' and ''o''=====\nThe vowel ''o'' was [[vowel breaking|broken]] (diphthongized) to ''oa'' before a non-high vowel:\n\n* Lat. ''fl\u014drem'' > Rom. ''floare'' 'flower'\n* Lat. ''h\u014dram'' > Rom. ''oar\u0103'' 'time' as in \"a treia oar\u0103\" 'the third time' \n\nThe vowel ''e'' was broken to ''ea'' in similar circumstances when not changed to ''\u0103''/''a'' (see above). The ''e'' was often absorbed by a preceding palatal sound:\n\n* Lat. ''equa'' > *''{{IPA|\u025bpa}}'' > *''i\u032fepa'' > *''i\u032feapa'' > Rom. ''iap\u0103'' 'mare'\n* Lat. ''terra'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025brra}}'' > *''ti\u032fera'' > *''\u021bera'' > archaic ''\u021bear\u0103'' > Rom. ''\u021bar\u0103'' 'land'\n* Lat. ''testa'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025bsta}}'' > *''ti\u032festa'' > *''\u021besta'' > Rom. ''\u021beast\u0103'' 'skull'\n\n=====Vowel reduction=====\nUnstressed ''a'' became ''\u0103'' (except when at the beginning of the word) and unstressed ''o'' was [[vowel reduction|reduced]] to ''u''. Then ''\u0103'' became ''e'' after [[palatal consonant]]s. Unstressed ''o'' was kept in some words due to analogy.\n\n* Lat. ''capra'' > Rom. ''capr\u0103'' \u2018goat\u2019\n* Lat. ''v\u012bnea'' > *''vinja'' > *''vi\u0272\u0103'' (Megleno-Romanian) > *''vi\u0272e'' (Aromanian)<ref>Alexandru Cior\u0103nescu, ''Dic\u0163ionarul etimologic al limbii rom\u00e2ne'' (Bucharest: Saeculum I. O., 2002), 834.</ref> > Rom. ''vie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8vije/}} \u2018vineyard\u2019\n* Lat. ''form\u014dsus'' > Rom. ''frumos'' \u2018beautiful\u2019\n\n====Consonants====\n\n=====Labiovelars=====\nIn the Vulgar Latin period, the [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] {{angbr|qu gu}} {{IPA|/k\u02b7 \u0261\u02b7/}} were reduced to simple velars {{IPA|/k \u0261/}} before front vowels. These were subsequently palatalized to {{IPA|/t\u0283 d\u0292/}} by the [[#Second palatalization|second palatalization]] (see below):\n*Lat. ''quaerere'' \"to seek\" > *''k\u025brere'' > Rom. ''cere'' 'ask'\n\nThe labiovelars originally remained before ''a'', but were subsequently changed to labials {{IPA|/p b/}}, although in question words beginning with ''qu-'', this was never changed to ''p-'' (presumably through analogy with words beginning ''que-, qui-, quo-'' in Latin):\n* Lat. ''quattuor'' > *''quattro'' > Rom. ''patru'' 'four'\n* Lat. ''equa'' > *''{{IPA|\u025bpa}}'' > *''i\u032fepa'' > Rom. ''iap\u0103'' 'mare'\n* Lat. ''lingua'' > Rom. ''limb\u0103'' 'tongue'\n*But Lat. ''quand\u014d'' > *''kando'' > ''k\u0103ndu'' ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]]) > Rom. ''c\u00e2nd'' 'when'\n\n=====Labialization of velars=====\nAnother important change is the labialization of velars before dentals, which includes the changes ''ct'' > ''pt'', ''gn'' {{IPA|[\u014bn]}} > ''mn'', and ''x'' {{IPA|[ks]}} > ''ps''. Later, ''ps'' assimilated to ''ss'', then to ''s'' ~ ''\u0219'' in most words.\n\n* Lat. ''factum'' > *''faptu'' > Rom. ''fapt'' 'fact; deed'\n* Lat. ''signum'' > *''semnu'' > Rom. ''semn'' 'sign'\n* Lat. ''coxa'' > *''copsa'' > Rom. ''coaps\u0103'' 'thigh', but:\n* Lat. ''fraxinus'' > ''frapsinu'' (Aromanian) > Rom. ''frasin'' 'ash tree' (vs. Banat ''fraps\u0103n'', ''frapsine'')\n* Lat. ''lax\u014d'' > *''lapso'' > *''lassu'' > Rom. ''las'' 'I let'\n\n=====Final consonants=====\nIn both Romanian and Italian, virtually all final consonants were lost. As a consequence, there was a period in the history of Romanian in which all words ended with vowels. In addition, final ''-s'' produced a new final ''-i'',{{dubious|all such cases have traditionally been explained as analogical, e.g. st\u00f2 <- stao, stai like v\u00f2 <- vao <- vado, vai <- vadi, and va <- vae <- vade like sta. Are there any forms of the supposed \"!duolei <- doles\" type attested?|date=June 2013}} as in Lat. ''nos'' > Rom. ''noi'' 'we' and Lat. ''stas'' > Rom. ''stai'' 'you stand'.\n\n=====Palatalization=====\nIn [[Vulgar Latin]], short {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} followed by another vowel were changed to a glide {{IPA|/j/}}. Later, {{IPA|/j/}} [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] preceding {{lcons|coronal}} and {{lcons|velar}} consonants, changing its quality. For dentals, the outcome depended on whether word stress precedes or follows:\n*dentals:\n** after stress\n*** Lat. ''puteus'' > *''p\u00fati\u032fu'' > ''pu\u021bu'' > Rom. ''pu\u021b'' 'well, pit',\n*** Lat. ''hordeum'' > *''\u00f3rdi\u032fu'' > ''ordzu'' > Rom. ''orz'' 'barley', \n** before stress\n*** Lat. ''r\u014dg\u0101ti\u014dnem'' > *''rogati\u032f\u00f3ne'' > *''roga\u010done'' > Rom. ''rug\u0103ciune'' 'prayer'\n*** VLat. ''deosum'' > *''di\u032f\u00f3su'' > *''djosu'' > Rom. ''jos'' 'down'\n* other consonants:\n** Lat. ''socium'' > *''s\u00f3ki\u032fu'' > ''so\u021bu'' > Rom. ''so\u021b'' 'companion; husband'\n** Lat. ''c\u0101seus'' > *''kasi\u032fu'' > Rom. ''ca\u0219'' 'fresh, unripened cheese'\n** Lat. ''v\u012bnea'' > *''vini\u032fa'' > *''{{IPA|vi\u0272e}}'' > standard Rom. ''vie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8vije/}}\n** Lat. ''mulierem'' > *''muli\u032fere'' > *''{{IPA|mu\u028eere}}'' > Rom. ''muiere'' {{IPA|/mu\u02c8jere/}} 'woman'\n\nNotice that the twofold outcome for dentals is still productive in modern Romanian:\n*''cred\u00edn\u021b\u0103'' 'faith' \u2014 ''credinci\u00f3s'' 'faithful'\n*''ogl\u00ednd\u0103'' 'mirror' \u2014 ''oglinjo\u00e1r\u0103'' 'small mirror'.\n\nThe above palatalizations occurred in all of the [[Romance languages]], although with slightly differing outcomes in different languages.  [[Labial consonant]]s, however, were unaffected by the above palatalizations.  Instead, at a later time, the {{IPA|/j/}} underwent [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]:\n\n* Lat. ''rubeum'' > *''robi\u032fu'' > Rom. ''roib''\n\n=====Palatalization of ''cl'' clusters=====\nThe Latin cluster ''cl'' was palatalized to {{IPA|/k\u028e/}}:\n\n* Vulgar Latin ''oricla'' > *''urecli\u032fa'' > *''urecli\u032fe'' (Aromanian ''ureaclje'') > Rom. ''ureche'' 'ear'\n\n=====''l''-rhotacism=====\n\nAt some point, Latin [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] ''l'' developed into ''r''. From the evolution of certain words, it is clear that this happened after the above-mentioned [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], but before the simplification of [[gemination|double consonants]] (as ''ll'' did not rhotacize) and also before ''i''-palatalization. Some examples:\n\n* Lat. ''gelu'' > Rom. ''ger'' 'frost'\n* Lat. ''sal\u012bre'' > Rom. ''a s\u0103ri'' (''s\u0103rire'') 'to jump'\n\n=====Second palatalization=====\n\nThe dental consonants ''t'', ''d'', ''s'', ''l'' were palatalized again by a following ''i'' or ''i\u032f'' (from the combination ''i\u032fe/i\u032fa'' < ''{{IPA|\u025b}}'' < stressed ''e''):\n\n* Lat. ''testa'' > *''{{IPA|t\u025bsta}}'' > *''ti\u032festa'' > *''\u021besta'' > Rom. ''\u021beast\u0103'' 'skull'\n* Lat. ''decem'' > *''{{IPA|d\u025bce}}'' > *''di\u032fece'' > *''dzece'' > Rom. ''zece'' 'ten'\n* Lat. ''servum'' > *''{{IPA|s\u025brbu}}'' > *''si\u032ferbu'' > Rom. ''\u0219erb'' 'serf'\n* Lat. ''sex'' > *''{{IPA|s\u025bkse}}'' > *''si\u032fasse'' > Rom. ''\u0219ase'' 'six'\n* Lat. ''leporem'' > *''{{IPA|l\u025bpore}}'' > *''li\u032f\u025bpure'' > *''{{IPA|\u028e\u025bpure}}'' (= Arom. ''ljepure'') > Rom. ''iepure'' 'hare'\n* Lat. ''d\u012bc\u014d'' > *''dziku'' > Rom. ''zic'' 'I say'\n* Lat. ''l\u012bnum'' > *''{{IPA|\u028einu}}'' (= Arom. ''ljinu'') > *''{{IPA|\u028ein}}'' > Rom. ''in'' 'flax'\n* Lat. ''gall\u012bna'' > *''{{IPA|\u0261alina}}'' > *''{{IPA|\u0261\u0103\u028ein\u0103}}'' (= Arom. ''g\u00e3ljin\u00e3'') > Rom. ''g\u0103in\u0103'' 'hen'\n\nThe velar consonants {{IPA|/k \u0261/}} (from Latin labiovelars ''qu gu'') were palatalized to {{IPA|/t\u0283 d\u0292/}} before front vowels:\n* Lat. ''quid'' > *''ki'' > Rom. ''ce'' 'what'\n* Lat. ''qu\u012bnque'' > Vulgar Latin ''*c\u012bnque'' (Italian ''cinque'') > Rom. ''cinci'' \"five\"\n* Lat. ''quaerere'' \"to seek\" > *''k\u025brere'' > Rom. ''cere'' 'ask'\n* Lat. ''sanguine'' > *''sangin'' > Rom. ''s\u00e2nge'' 'blood'\n\n===Modern changes===\nThese are changes that did not happen in all [[Eastern Romance languages]]. Some occur in standard Romanian; some do not.\n\n====Spirantization====\nIn southern dialects, and in the standard language, ''dz'' is lost as a phoneme, becoming ''z'' in all environments:\n\n* ''dzic'' > ''zic'' ('I say')\n* ''lucredzi'' > ''lucrezi'' ('you work')\n\nThe affricate {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} became ''j'' {{IPA|/\u0292/}} only when hard (i.e. followed by a back vowel):\n\n* ''gioc'' {{IPA|/d\u0292ok/}} > ''joc'' ('game'), but:\n* ''deget'' {{IPA|/\u02c8ded\u0292et/}} ('finger') did not change.\n\n====Lenition of resonants====\nFormer palatal resonants {{IPA|/\u028e \u0272/}} were both [[lenition|lenited]] (weakened) to {{IPA|/j/}}, which was subsequently lost next to {{IPA|/i/}}:\n* Lat. ''leporem'' > *''{{IPA|l\u025bpore}}'' > *''li\u032fepure'' > *''{{IPA|\u028eepure}}'' > Rom. ''iepure'' 'hare'\n* Lat. ''l\u012bnum'' > *''{{IPA|\u028einu}}'' > *''{{IPA|\u028ein}}'' > Rom. ''in'' 'flax'\n* Lat. ''gall\u012bna'' > *''{{IPA|\u0261allina}}'' > *''{{IPA|\u0261alina}}'' > *''{{IPA|\u0261\u0103\u028ein\u0103}}'' > Rom. ''g\u0103in\u0103'' 'hen'\n* Lat. ''pellem, pell\u012bs'' > *''{{IPA|p\u025blle, p\u025blli}}'' > *''{{IPA|pi\u032fele, pi\u032feli}}'' > *''{{IPA|pi\u032fele, pi\u032fe\u028ei}}'' > Rom. ''piele, piei'' 'skin, skins'\n* Lat. ''v\u012bnea'' > *''vinja'' > *''vi\u0272\u0103'' > *''vi\u0272e'' > Rom. ''vie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8vije/}} 'vineyard'\n\nFormer intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} from Latin {{sm|-ll-}} was lost entirely before {{IPA|/a/}} by first [[l-vocalization|vocalizing]] to {{IPA|/w/}}:\n* Lat ''st\u0113lla'' > *''stela'' > archaic ''steal\u0103'' > colloquial ''steau\u0103'' > standard Rom. ''stea'' 'star'\n* Lat ''sella'' > *''s\u025blla'' > *''si\u032fela'' > *''\u0219ela'' > *''\u0219eu\u0103'' > Muntenian ''\u0219ea'' > standard Rom. ''\u0219a'' 'saddle'\n\nFormer intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} from Latin {{sm|-ll-}} was preserved before other vowels:\n* Lat ''caballum'' > *''cavallu'' > *''caalu'' > Rom. ''cal'' 'horse'\n* Lat ''callem'' > Rom. ''cale'' 'way'\n\nFormer intervocalic {{IPA|/v/}} (from Latin {{sm|-b-,-v-}}) was lost, perhaps first weakened to {{IPA|/w/}}:\n* Lat ''b\u016bbalus'' > *''buvalu'' > *''buwaru'' > archaic ''buar'', ''boar'' > standard Rom. ''bour'' '[[aurochs]]'\n* Lat ''v\u012bvere'' > *''vivere'' > *''viwe'' > Muntenian ''vie'' > standard Rom. ''a via'' 'to live'\n\n====''n''-epenthesis====\nRelatively recently, stressed ''u'' preceded by ''n'' lengthens and nasalizes, producing a following ''n'' ([[epenthesis]]).\n* Lat ''genuculus'' > ''*genuclus'' > western ''genuchi'' > Rom. ''genunchi'' 'knee'\n* Lat ''manuplus'' > ''*manuclus'' > western ''m\u0103nuchi'' > Rom. ''m\u0103nunchi'' 'bouquet'\n* Lat ''minutus'' > ''minut'' (Aromanian) > (Banat, Moldavia) ''m\u0103nunt'' > Rom. ''m\u0103runt'' 'minute, small'\n* the reverse process:\n** Lat ''ranunculus'' 'tadpole; crowfoot, buttercup' > ''*ranunclus'' > archaic ''r\u0103nunchi'' > Rom. ''r\u0103runchi'' 'kidney; (dial.) buttercup' > dialectal ''r\u0103ruchi''\n\n====''j''-epenthesis====\nIn some words, the semivowel {{IPA|/j/}} was inserted between ''\u00e2'' and soft ''n'':\n\n* ''p\u00e2ne'' > ''p\u00e2ine'' ('bread')\n* ''c\u00e2ne'' > ''c\u00e2ine'' ('dog')\n\nIt also explains the plural ''m\u00e2n\u0103'' - ''m\u00e2ini'' ('hand, hands'). This is also specific to southern dialects and the standard language; in other regions one may hear ''c\u00e2ne'' etc.\n\nIt may be [[compensatory lengthening]] followed by [[dissimilation]]: ''p\u00e2ne'' > ''p\u00e2\u00e2ne'' > ''p\u00e2ine''. It has spread from the [[Oltenia]]n dialect to literary Romanian. It has alternatively been explained as palatalization followed by [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]: ''c\u00e2ne'' > *''c\u00e2ni\u032fe'' > ''c\u00e2ine''. Oltenian has ''c\u00e2ine''; all other dialects have ''c\u00e2ni\u032fe''.\n\n====Hardening====\nBacking of vowels after ''\u0219'', ''\u021b'' and ''dz'' is specific to northern dialects. Because those consonants can be followed only by back vowels, any front vowel is changed to a back one:\n\n* ''\u0219i'' > ''\u0219\u00ee'' 'and'\n* ''\u021bine'' > ''\u021b\u00e2ni\u032fe'' 'holds'\n* ''zic'' > ''dz\u00e2c'' 'I say'\n\nIt is similar to vowel backing after hard consonants in [[Russian language|Russian]] (see {{section link|Russian phonology|Front vowels}}).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Legacy of the Roman Empire]]\n* [[Romance languages]]\n* [[Albanian-Romanian linguistic relationship]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*''Procopius: History of the Wars (Books VI.16&ndash;VII.35.)''

One of which was the Natchez in Southern Mississippi. In the 1720s trouble developed between the French and the Natchez Indians that would be called the Natchez War or [[Natchez revolt|Natchez Revolt]]. 230 colonists were killed and the fort and homes were burned to the ground.\n\nThe conflict between the two parties was a direct result of Lieutenant d\u2019Etcheparre (more commonly known as [[Natchez revolt|Sieur de Ch\u00e9part]]), the commandant at the settlement near the Natchez, decided in 1729 that the Natchez Indians should surrender both their cultivated crop lands and their town of White Apple to the French. The Natchez pretended to surrender and actually worked for the French in the hunting game, but as soon as they were weaponized, they struck back and killed several men, resulting in the colonists fleeing downriver to New Orleans. The fleeing colonist sought protection from what they feared might be a colony-wide Indian uprising. The Natchez, however, did not press on after their surprise attack, leaving them vulnerable enough for King Louis XV's appointed governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]] to reclaim the settlement.\n\nRelations with Louisiana's Indians, a problem inherited from Bienville, remained a concern for the next governor, [[Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Marquis de Vaudreuil]]<nowiki/>. In the early 1740s traders from the British colonies of the Atlantic coast crossed into the Appalachian Mountains. The Native nations in between the French colonials and British colonials would now operate dependent on which of the two colonies would most benefit them. Several of these tribes and especially the [[Chickasaw|Chicksaw]] and [[Choctaw]] would trade goods and gifts for their loyalty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Louisiana : a history|last=Cummins, Light Townsend|isbn=978-1118619292|oclc=861648007|year= 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe economic problems under Vaudreuil would not allow the French to outcompete the British and resulted in many of Louisiana's Native American revolts. In 1747 and 1748 the Chicksaw would raid along the east bank of the Mississippi all the way south to Baton Rouge. These actions supported by the British colonials would force residents of French Louisiana to take refuge in New Orleans.\n\n=== Slavery in French Louisiana ===\nInability to find labor was the most pressing issue in the early French colony. Colonists turned to African slavery to make their investments in Louisiana profitable. In the late 1710s the international slave trade imported enslaved Africans. This led to the biggest shipment in 1716 where several trading ships appeared with slaves as cargo to the local residents in a one-year span.\n\nBy 1724, the large number of blacks in Louisiana prompted the institutionalizing of laws governing slavery within the colony. These laws required that slaves be baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, slaves be married in the Church, and gave slaves no legal rights. The slave law formed in the 1720s is known as the [[Code Noir]], which would bleed into the antebellum period of the American South as well. Louisiana slave culture had its own distinct Afro-Creole society that called on past cultures and the situation for slaves in the New World. Afro-Creole was present in religious beliefs and the Louisiana Creole dialect. The religion most associated with this period for was called [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]].\n\n=== Religion and architecture from across the world ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn the city of New Orleans an inspiring mixture of foreign influences created a melting pot of culture that is still celebrated today. By the end of French colonization in Louisiana, New Orleans was recognized commercially in the Atlantic world. Its inhabitants traded across the French commercial system. New Orleans was a hub for this trade both physically and culturally because it served as the exit point to the rest of the globe for the interior of the North American continent.\n\nIn one instance the French government established a chapter house of sisters in New Orleans. The [[History of the Ursulines in New Orleans|Ursuline sisters]] after being sponsored by the [[Company of the Indies]], founded a convent in the city in 1727. At the end of the colonial era, the Ursuline Academy maintained a house of seventy boarding and one hundred day students. Today numerous schools in New Orleans can trace their lineage from this academy.\n[[File:Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer - Louisiane - Adrien de Pauger - 1724 - 001.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer \u2013 Louisiane \u2013 Adrien de Pauger \u2013 1724 \u2013 001]]\nAnother notable example is the streetplan and architecture still distinguishing New Orleans today. French Louisiana had early architects in the province who were trained as military engineers and were now assigned to design government buildings. Pierre Le Blond de Tour and [[Adrien de Pauger]], for example, planned many early fortifications, along with the street plan for the city of New Orleans. After them in the 1740s, Ignace Fran\u00e7ois Broutin, as engineer-in-chief of Louisiana, reworked the architecture of New Orleans with an extensive public works program.\n\nFrench policy-makers in Paris attempted to set political and economic norms for New Orleans. It acted autonomously in much of its cultural and physical aspects, but also stayed in communication with the foreign trends as well.\n\n=== Post-Treaty of Paris ===\nAfter the French relinquished West Louisiana to the Spanish, New Orleans merchants attempted to ignore Spanish rule and even re-institute French control on the colony. The citizens of New Orleans held a series of public meetings during 1765 to keep the populace in opposition of the establishment of Spanish rule. Anti-Spanish passions in New Orleans reached their highest level after two years of Spanish administration in Louisiana. On October 27, 1768, a mob of local residents, spiked the guns guarding New Orleans and took control of the city from the Spanish. The rebellion organized a group to sail for Paris, where it met with officials of the French government. This group brought with them a long memorial to summarize the abuses the colony had endured from the Spanish. King Louis XV and his ministers reaffirmed Spain's sovereignty over Louisiana.\n\n===United States territory===\n[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. Thereafter, the city grew rapidly with influxes of Americans, [[French people|French]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and [[Demographics of Africa|Africans]]. Later immigrants were [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans]], [[Poles]] and [[Italians]]. Major [[commodity crops]] of [[sugar cane|sugar]] and [[cotton]] were cultivated with [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor on nearby large [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]].\n\nThousands of [[refugee]]s from the 1804 [[Haitian Revolution]], both [[White people|whites]] and [[free people of color]] (''affranchis'' or ''gens de couleur libres''), arrived in New Orleans; a number brought their slaves with them, many of whom were native Africans or of full-blood descent. While Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne|Claiborne]] and other officials wanted to keep out additional [[Free negro|free black]] people, the French Creoles wanted to increase the French-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed into the [[Territory of Orleans]], Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived.<ref name=\"AAM\"/> Many of the white [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophones]] had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for [[Bonapartist]] schemes.{{sfn|Gitlin |2009|p= 54}}\n\nNearly 90 percent of these immigrants settled in New Orleans.

The port handled commodities for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries, which were warehoused and transferred in New Orleans to smaller vessels and distributed along the Mississippi River watershed. The river was filled with steamboats, flatboats and sailing ships.

The market expanded after the United States ended the international [[Atlantic slave trade|trade]] in 1808. Two-thirds of the more than one million slaves brought to the [[Deep South]] arrived via [[forced migration]] in the domestic [[slave trade]]. The money generated by the sale of slaves in the [[Upper South]] has been estimated at 15 percent of the value of the staple crop economy. The [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] were collectively valued at half a billion dollars. The trade spawned an ancillary economy\u2014transportation, housing and clothing, fees, etc., estimated at 13.5% of the price per person, amounting to tens of billions of dollars (2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) during the [[Plantation era|antebellum period]], with New Orleans as a prime beneficiary.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2, 6</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Paul Lachance,\n\n{{quote|the addition of white immigrants [from Saint-Domingue] to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain a majority of the white population until almost 1830.

In 1862, following the occupation by the Navy after the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], led by [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], a respected state lawyer of the Massachusetts militia, Northern forces occupied the city. Later New Orleans residents nicknamed him \"Beast\" Butler, because of a military order he issued. After his troops had been assaulted and harassed in the streets by Southern women, his order warned that such future occurrences would result in his men treating such \"ladies\" as those \"plying their avocation in the streets\", implying that they would treat the women like prostitutes. Accounts of this spread widely. He also came to be called \"Spoons\" Butler because of the alleged looting that his troops did while occupying the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nButler abolished French language instruction in city schools. Statewide measures in 1864 and, after the war, 1868 further strengthened the English-only policy imposed by federal representatives. With the predominance of English speakers, that language had already become dominant in business and government.{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 166}} By the end of the 19th century, French usage had faded.

The [[Union Army]] eventually extended its control north along the [[Mississippi River]] and along the coastal areas. As a result, most of the southern portion of Louisiana was originally exempted from the liberating provisions of the 1863 \"[[Emancipation Proclamation]]\" issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Large numbers of rural ex-slaves and some free people of color from the city volunteered for the first regiments of Black troops in the War. Led by Brigadier General [[Daniel Ullman]] (1810\u20131892), of the 78th Regiment of New York State Volunteers Militia, they were known as the \"[[United States Colored Troops|Corps d'Afrique]].\" While that name had been used by a militia before the war, that group was composed of [[free people of color]]. The new group was made up mostly of former slaves. They were supplemented in the last two years of the War by newly organized [[United States Colored Troops]], who played an increasingly important part in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustica.org/san_bartolomeo/catalog/civilwar.htm|title=Usticesi in the United States Civil War|publisher=The Ustica Connection|date=March 22, 2003|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\nViolence throughout the South, especially the [[Memphis Riots of 1866]] followed by the [[New Orleans Riot]] in the same year, led Congress to pass the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], extending the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color. Louisiana and [[Texas]] were put under the authority of the \"[[Fifth Military District]]\" of the United States during Reconstruction. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868. Its Constitution of 1868 granted [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal male suffrage]] and established universal [[State school|public education]]. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, lieutenant governor [[P.B.S. Pinchback]], who was of [[mixed race]], succeeded [[Henry C. Warmouth|Henry Clay Warmouth]] for a brief period as Republican governor of [[Louisiana]], becoming the first governor of African descent of an [[U.S. state|American state]] (the next African American to serve as governor of an American state was [[Douglas Wilder]], elected in Virginia in 1989). New Orleans operated a racially integrated [[New Orleans Public Schools|public school system]] during this period.\n\nWartime damage to [[levees]] and cities along the Mississippi River adversely affected southern crops and trade. The federal government contributed to restoring infrastructure. The nationwide financial recession and [[Panic of 1873]] adversely affected businesses and slowed economic recovery.\n\nFrom 1868, elections in Louisiana were marked by violence, as white insurgents tried to suppress black voting and disrupt [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] gatherings. The disputed 1872 gubernatorial election resulted in conflicts that ran for years. The \"[[White League]]\", an insurgent paramilitary group that supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was organized in 1874 and operated in the open, violently suppressing the black vote and running off Republican officeholders. In 1874, in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]], 5,000 members of the White League fought with city police to take over the state offices for the Democratic candidate for governor, holding them for three days. By 1876, such tactics resulted in the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the so-called [[Redeemers]], regaining political control of the state legislature. The federal government gave up and withdrew its troops in 1877, ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].\n\n===Jim Crow era===\nWhite Democrats passed [[Jim Crow]] laws, establishing [[racial segregation]] in public facilities. In 1889, the legislature passed a [[constitutional amendment]] incorporating a \"[[grandfather clause]]\" that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] freedmen as well as the propertied people of color manumitted before the war. Unable to vote, African Americans could not serve on juries or in local office, and were closed out of formal politics for generations. The South was ruled by a white Democratic Party. Public schools were [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] and remained so until 1960.\n\nNew Orleans' large community of well-educated, often French-speaking [[free persons of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who had been free prior to the Civil War, fought against Jim Crow. They organized the ''Comit\u00e9 des Citoyens'' (Citizens Committee) to work for civil rights. As part of their legal campaign, they recruited one of their own, [[Homer Plessy]], to test whether Louisiana's newly enacted Separate Car Act was constitutional. Plessy boarded a commuter train departing New Orleans for [[Covington, Louisiana]], sat in the car reserved for whites only, and was arrested. The case resulting from this incident, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1896. The court ruled that \"[[separate but equal]]\" accommodations were constitutional, effectively upholding Jim Crow measures. In practice, African-American public schools and facilities were underfunded across the South. The Supreme Court ruling contributed to this period as the [[Nadir of American race relations|nadir of race relations]] in the United States. The rate of [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] of black men was high across the South, as other states also disfranchised blacks and sought to impose Jim Crow. Nativist prejudices also surfaced. [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|Anti-Italian]] sentiment in 1891 contributed to the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynchings of 11 Italians]], some of whom had been acquitted of the murder of the police chief. Some were shot and killed in the jail where they were detained. It was the largest mass lynching in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Library of Congress}}|title=Immigration / Italian|website=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Gambino2000\">{{cite book|last=Gambino|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Gambino |title=Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=jA9-dmAsoMwC}}|year=2000|publisher=Guernica Editions|isbn=978-1-55071-103-5|ref=harv}}</ref> In July 1900 the city was swept by white mobs rioting after Robert Charles, a young African American, killed a policeman and temporarily escaped. The mob killed him and an estimated 20 other blacks; seven whites died in the days-long conflict, until a [[Militia (United States)|state militia]] suppressed it.\n\nThroughout New Orleans' history, until the early 20th Century when medical and scientific advances ameliorated the situation, the city suffered repeated [[epidemic]]s of [[yellow fever]] and other tropical and [[Infection|infectious diseases]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:EsplanadeBurgundy1900.jpg|right|thumb|[[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]] at Burgundy Street, looking lakewards north towards [[Lake Ponchartrain]] (1900)]]\n[[File:RationingBoardNOLAVachonC.jpg|right|thumb|1943 waiting line at wartime Rationing Board office in New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans' economic and population zenith in relation to other American cities occurred in the antebellum period. It was the nation's fifth-largest city in 1860 (after [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]]) and was significantly larger than all other southern cities.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\">Lewis, Peirce F., ''New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape'', Santa Fe, 2003, p. 175.</ref> From the mid-19th century onward rapid economic growth shifted to other areas, while New Orleans' relative importance steadily declined. The growth of railways and highways decreased river traffic, diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> Thousands of the most ambitious [[Person of color|people of color]] left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] around [[World War II]] and after, many for [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] destinations. From the late 1800s, most censuses recorded New Orleans slipping down the ranks in the list of largest American cities (New Orleans' population still continued to increase throughout the period, but at a slower rate than before the Civil War).\n\nBy the mid-20th Century, New Orleanians recognized that their city was no longer the leading urban area in the [[Southern United States|South]]. By 1950, [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], and [[Atlanta]] exceeded New Orleans in size, and in 1960 [[Miami]] eclipsed New Orleans, even as the latter's population reached its historic peak.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> As with other older American cities, highway construction and suburban development drew residents from the center city to newer housing outside. The 1970 census recorded the first absolute decline in population since the city became part of the United States in 1803. The [[New Orleans metropolitan area]] continued expanding in population, albeit more slowly than other major Sun Belt cities. While the [[Port of New Orleans|port]] remained one of the nation's largest, automation and [[containerization]] cost many jobs. The city's former role as banker to the South was supplanted by larger peer cities. New Orleans' economy had always been based more on trade and financial services than on manufacturing, but the city's relatively small manufacturing sector also shrank after World War II. Despite some economic development successes under the administrations of [[DeLesseps Story Morrison|DeLesseps \"Chep\" Morrison]] (1946\u20131961) and [[Victor H. Schiro|Victor \"Vic\" Schiro]] (1961\u20131970), metropolitan New Orleans' growth rate consistently lagged behind more vigorous cities.\n\n====Civil Rights Movement====\nDuring the later years of Morrison's administration, and for the entirety of Schiro's, the city was a center of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] was founded in New Orleans, and lunch counter sit-ins were held in [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] department stores. A prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954). When six-year-old [[Ruby Bridges]] integrated [[William Frantz Elementary School]] in the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|Ninth Ward]], she was the first child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the South.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement's success in gaining federal passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] renewed constitutional rights, including voting for blacks. Together, these resulted in the most far-reaching changes in New Orleans' 20th century history.<ref>Germany, Kent B., ''New Orleans After the Promises: Poverty, Citizenship and the Search for the Great Society'', Athens, 2007, pp. 3\u20135</ref> Though legal and civil equality were re-established by the end of the 1960s, a large gap in income levels and educational attainment persisted between the city's White and African-American communities.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glassman, James K., \"New Orleans: I have Seen the Future, and It's Houston\", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', July 1978</ref> As the middle class and wealthier members of both races left the center city, its population's income level dropped, and it became proportionately more African American. From 1980, the African-American majority elected primarily officials from its own community. They struggled to narrow the gap by creating conditions conducive to the economic uplift of the African-American community.\n\nNew Orleans became increasingly dependent on tourism as an economic mainstay during the administrations of [[Sidney Barthelemy]] (1986\u20131994) and [[Marc Morial]] (1994\u20132002). Relatively low levels of educational attainment, high rates of household poverty, and rising crime threatened the city's prosperity in the later decades of the century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions aligned poorly with the changes in the late-20th century to the economy of the United States, which reflected a post-industrial, knowledge-based paradigm in which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills.\n\n====Drainage and flood control====\n{{See also|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\n[[File:LPD18USSNewOrleansPassingNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A view of the [[New Orleans Central Business District]] as seen from the [[Mississippi River]]. {{USS|New Orleans|LPD-18}} in foreground (2007)]]\n\nIn the 20th century, New Orleans' government and business leaders believed they needed to drain and develop outlying areas to provide for the city's expansion. The most ambitious development during this period was a drainage plan devised by engineer and inventor [[A. Baldwin Wood]], designed to break the surrounding swamp's stranglehold on the city's geographic expansion. Until then, urban development in New Orleans was largely limited to higher ground along the natural river levees and [[bayou]]s.\n\nWood's pump system allowed the city to drain huge tracts of swamp and marshland and expand into low-lying areas. Over the 20th century, rapid [[subsidence]], both natural and human-induced, resulted in these newly populated areas subsiding to several feet below sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Kusky, Timothy M. |title=Why is New Orleans Sinking? |publisher=Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Saint Louis University |date=December 29, 2005 |url=http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |accessdate=June 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623092455/http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |archivedate=June 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | first=Larry\n  | last=O'Hanlon\n  | url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html\n  | title=New Orleans Sits Atop Giant Landslide\n  | publisher=Discovery Channel\n  | date=March 31, 2006\n  | accessdate=June 17, 2006\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614211349/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 14, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNew Orleans was vulnerable to flooding even before the city's footprint departed from the natural high ground near the Mississippi River. In the late 20th century, however, scientists and New Orleans residents gradually became aware of the city's increased vulnerability. In 1965, flooding from [[Hurricane Betsy]] killed dozens of residents, although the majority of the city remained dry. The rain-induced [[May 8th 1995 Louisiana Flood|flood of May 8, 1995]], demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system. After that event, measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade pumping capacity. By the 1980s and 1990s, scientists observed that extensive, rapid, and ongoing [[Coastal erosion|erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding New Orleans]], especially that related to the [[Mississippi River \u2013 Gulf Outlet Canal]], had the unintended result of leaving the city more vulnerable than before to hurricane-induced catastrophic [[storm surge]]s.\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Hurricane Katrina====\n[[File:Katrina 2nd landfall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Katrina]] at its New Orleans landfall]]\n{{See also|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\nNew Orleans was catastrophically affected by what Raymond B.

Major streets include [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], Poydras Street, Tulane Avenue and Loyola Avenue. Canal Street divides the traditional \"[[Downtown New Orleans|downtown]]\" area from the \"[[Uptown New Orleans|uptown]]\" area.\n\nEvery street crossing Canal Street between the Mississippi River and [[Rampart Street]], which is the northern edge of the French Quarter, has a different name for the \"uptown\" and \"downtown\" portions.

''New Orleans'', Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina (1999), pp. 108\u201309.</ref> Elsewhere in the city, Canal Street serves as the dividing point between the \"South\" and \"North\" portions of various streets. In the local [[wikt:parlance|parlance]] ''downtown'' means \"downriver from Canal Street\", while ''uptown'' means \"upriver from Canal Street\".

Creole cottages and townhouses, notable for their large courtyards and intricate iron balconies, line the streets of the French Quarter. American townhouses, double-gallery houses, and Raised Center-Hall Cottages are notable. [[St. Charles Avenue]] is famed for its large [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum homes]]. Its mansions are in various styles, such as [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[American colonial architecture|American Colonial]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles of [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] and [[Italianate architecture]].

The soft soils are susceptible to subsidence, and there was doubt about the feasibility of constructing high rises. Developments in engineering throughout the 20th century eventually made it possible to build sturdy foundations in the foundations that underlie the structures. In the 1960s, the [[2 Canal Street|World Trade Center New Orleans]] and [[Plaza Tower]] demonstrated skyscrapers' viability. [[One Shell Square]] became the city's tallest building in 1972.

The most well known is [[Carnival]], or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]. Carnival officially begins on the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]], also known in some Christian traditions as the \"[[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]\" of Christams. ''Mardi Gras'' (French for \"Fat Tuesday\"), the final and grandest day of traditional Catholic festivities, is the last Tuesday before the [[Christianity|Christian]] liturgical season of [[Lent]], which commences on [[Ash Wednesday]].\n\nThe largest of the city's many music festivals is the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]]. Commonly referred to simply as \"Jazz Fest\", it is one of the nation's largest music festivals. The festival features a variety of music, including both native Louisiana and international artists. Along with Jazz Fest, New Orleans' [[Voodoo Experience]] (\"Voodoo Fest\") and the [[Essence Music Festival]] also feature local and international artists.\n\nOther major festivals include [[Southern Decadence]], the French Quarter Festival, and the [[Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival]]. The American playwright lived and wrote in New Orleans early in his career, and set his play, ''[[Streetcar Named Desire]],'' there.\n\nIn 2002, Louisiana began offering tax incentives for film and television production. This has resulted in a substantial increase in activity and brought the nickname of \"Hollywood South\" for New Orleans. Films produced in and around the city include ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'', ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'', ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]'', ''[[Deja Vu (2006 film)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', ''[[Last Holiday (2006 film)|Last Holiday]]'', ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'' and ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]''.

The first opera in New Orleans was performed there in 1796. In the nineteenth century, the city was the home of two of America's most important venues for [[French opera]], the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orl\u00e9ans]] and later the [[French Opera House]]. Today, opera is performed by the [[New Orleans Opera]]. The [[Marigny Opera House]] is home to the Marigny Opera Ballet and also hosts opera, jazz, and classical music performances. [[File:Frank Ocean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Ocean]] is a musician from New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans has long been a significant center for music, showcasing its intertwined European, African and Latin American cultures. The city's unique musical heritage was born in its colonial and early American days from a unique blending of European musical instruments with African rhythms. As the only North American city to have allowed [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] to gather in public and play their native music (largely in [[Congo Square]], now located within [[Louis Armstrong Park (New Orleans)|Louis Armstrong Park]]), New Orleans gave birth in the early 20th century to an epochal indigenous music: [[jazz]]. Soon, African-American [[brass band]]s formed, beginning a century-long tradition. The Louis Armstrong Park area, near the French Quarter in [[Trem\u00e9]], contains the [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]]. The city's music was later also significantly influenced by [[Acadiana]], home of [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] music, and by [[blues|Delta blues]].\n\nNew Orleans' unique musical culture is on display in its traditional funerals. A spin on military funerals, New Orleans' traditional funerals feature sad music (mostly [[dirge]]s and [[hymn]]s) in processions on the way to the cemetery and happier music (hot jazz) on the way back. Until the 1990s, most locals preferred to call these \"funerals with music.\" Visitors to the city have long dubbed them \"[[jazz funeral]]s.\"\n\nMuch later in its musical development, New Orleans was home to a distinctive brand of [[rhythm and blues]] that contributed greatly to the growth of [[rock and roll]]. An example of the New Orleans' sound in the 1960s is the #1 US hit \"[[Chapel of Love]]\" by [[the Dixie Cups]], a song which knocked [[the Beatles]] out of the top spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. New Orleans became a hotbed for [[funk]] music in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the late 1980s, it had developed its own localized variant of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], called [[bounce music]]. While not commercially successful outside of the [[Deep South]], bounce music was immensely popular in poorer neighborhoods throughout the 1990s.\n\nA cousin of bounce, [[southern hip hop|New Orleans hip hop]] achieved commercial success locally and internationally, producing [[Lil Wayne]], [[Master P]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[No Limit Records]]. Additionally, the popularity of [[cowpunk]], a fast form of [[southern rock]], originated with the help of several local bands, such as [[The Radiators (US)|The Radiators]], [[Better Than Ezra]], [[Cowboy Mouth]] and [[Dash Rip Rock]]. Throughout the 1990s, many [[sludge metal]] bands started.

The indigenous cuisine is distinctive and influential. New Orleans food combined local Creole, haute Creole and New Orleans French cuisines. Local ingredients, French, Spanish, Italian, African, Native American, Cajun, Chinese, and a hint of Cuban traditions combine to produce a truly unique and easily recognizable New Orleans flavor.\n\nNew Orleans is known for specialties including [[beignet]]s (locally pronounced like \"ben-yays\"), square-shaped fried dough that could be called \"French doughnuts\" (served with ''[[caf\u00e9 au lait]]'' made with a blend of coffee and chicory rather than only coffee); and [[po' boy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.neworleans.com/restaurants/traditional-new-orleans-foods/po-boys/|title=New Orleans Po-Boy|website=www.neworleans.com}}</ref> and Italian [[muffuletta]] sandwiches; Gulf oysters on the half-shell, fried oysters, boiled [[crayfish|crawfish]] and other [[seafood]]; [[\u00e9touff\u00e9e]], [[jambalaya]], [[gumbo]] and other Creole dishes; and the Monday favorite of [[red beans and rice]] ([[Louis Armstrong]] often signed his letters, \"Red beans and ricely yours\").

Like earlier Southern Englishes, feature frequent [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|deletion of the pre-consonantal \"r\"]]. This dialect is quite similar to New York City area accents such as \"[[New York City English|Brooklynese]]\", to people unfamiliar with either.<ref>Liebling, A. J. (1970). ''The Earl of Louisiana''. Baton Rouge: LSU.</ref>  No consensus describes how it came to be, but it likely resulted from New Orleans' geographic isolation by water and the fact that the city was a major immigration port throughout the 19th century. As a result, many of the ethnic groups who reside in Brooklyn also reside in New Orleans, such as the [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italians]] (especially [[Sicilian American|Sicilians]]), [[German American|Germans]] and a [[Jewish American|Jewish]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|title=Newcomers' Incentive Extension|publisher=Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans|accessdate=March 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524200300/http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|archivedate=May 24, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the strongest varieties of the New Orleans accent is sometimes identified as the [[Yat dialect]], from the greeting \"Where y'at?\" This distinctive accent is dying out in the city, but remains strong in the surrounding parishes.\n\nLess visibly, various ethnic groups throughout the area have retained distinct language traditions. Although rare, languages still spoken include [[Cajun French|Cajun]], the [[Louisiana Creole French|Kreyol Lwiziyen]] spoken by the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and an archaic Louisiana-Canarian Spanish dialect spoken by the [[Isle\u00f1o]] people and older members of the population.\n\n=== Voodoo ===\nReliable documentation of Voodoo does not exist because of the definitive claim that it is secretive. Voodoo existed in New Orleans-in some of its facets it probably still exists in the modern-day. The likelihood that the slave-developed religion possessed many white followers alongside its black participants is high. Voodoo as described by the distinguished novelist [[George Washington Cable]] is \"the name of an imaginary being of vast supernatural powers residing in the form of a harmless snake\". Followers to these powers are known as the voodoos.\n\n=== History and Origins ===\n[[File:Voodoo.jpg|thumb|Voodoo]]\nMultiple origins come from around the world and converge in pre-antebellum and antebellum New Orleans. ''Vodu'' as used by the Ewes of West Africa means fear of the gods. ''Vodun'' in Dahomy, West Africa, is a name for all deities. In French ''Vaudis'' referred to a witch. Throughout its history in New Orleans, Voodoo and Southern Negro shared folklore, superstitions, language and customs, and had their counterparts in West Africa.\n\nScholars have the noted the use of Roman Catholic saints and liturgies in voodoo worship including black cats, serpents and the color red. These European and African motifs signify evil, the devil, blood, sin, sacrifice, harlotry. After existing in New Orleans for decades, in 1800 when Haitian and West Indian blacks were forced to Louisiana the hexes and secret revenges were incorporated into the system of slavery.\n\nWhite southerners thought Voodoo to be primarily African in origin, and they fitted the practice of it into their beliefs that black men were primitive and inferior. In reality the Voodoo religion/culture is a mixture of African, Caribbean, and European influences.\n\nFor further information [[Saint John's Eve|St. John's Eve]] has had an important relationship to Voodoo in its openness during celebrations.\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sports in New Orleans}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Club\n!Sport\n!League\n!Venue (capacity)\n!Founded\n!Titles\n!Record Attendance\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Saints]]\n| [[American football]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Football League|NFL]]\n| [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] (73,208)\n| align=center | 1967\n| align=center | 1\n| align=center | 73,373\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Pelicans]]\n| [[Basketball]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]\n| [[Smoothie King Center]] (16,867)\n| align=center | 2002\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 18,444\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Jesters]]\n| [[Soccer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Premier Soccer League|NPSL]]\n| [[Pan American Stadium (New Orleans)|Pan American Stadium]] (5,000)\n| align=center | 2003\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 5,000\n|}\n\n[[File:Fleur de lys (or).svg|right|upright=0.45|thumb|The [[fleur-de-lis]] is often a symbol of New Orleans and its sports teams.]]\n\nNew Orleans' professional sports teams include the 2009 [[Super Bowl XLIV]] champion [[New Orleans Saints]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]) and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] ([[National Basketball Association|NBA]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/voodoo/index.ssf/2010/09/the_new_orleans_voodoo_and_the.html|title=The New Orleans VooDoo and the Arena Football League are returning}}</ref> It is also home to the [[Big Easy Rollergirls]], an all-female [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association|flat track roller derby]] team, and the [[New Orleans Blaze]], a [[National Women's Football Association|women's football]] team.<ref name=\"BlazeFootball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001171600/http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 1, 2008|title=History of the New Orleans Blaze|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans Blaze|date=April 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"BERG\">{{cite web|last=Vargas|first=Ramon|url=http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963|title=Big Easy Rollergirls deliver bruising derby action|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans CityBusiness|date=May 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622064720/http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963 |archivedate=June 22, 2007}}</ref> New Orleans is also home to two [[NCAA Division I]] athletic programs, the [[Tulane Green Wave]] of the [[American Athletic Conference]] and the [[UNO Privateers]] of the [[Southland Conference]].\n\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] is the home of the Saints, the Sugar Bowl, and other prominent events.

The paper made headlines of its own in 2012 when owner [[Advance Publications]] cut its print schedule to three days each week, instead focusing its efforts on its website, NOLA.com. That action briefly made New Orleans the largest city in the country without a daily newspaper, until the [[Baton Rouge]] newspaper ''[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]'' began a New Orleans edition in September 2012. In June 2013, the ''Times-Picayune'' resumed daily printing with a condensed [[newsstand]] [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] edition, nicknamed ''TP Street'', which is published on the three days each week that its namesake [[broadsheet]] edition is not printed (the Picayune has not returned to daily delivery). With the resumption of daily print editions from the ''Times-Picayune'' and the launch of the New Orleans edition of ''The Advocate'', now ''The New Orleans Advocate'', the city had two daily newspapers for the first time since the afternoon States-Item ceased publication on May 31, 1980.

I-10 travels east\u2013west through the city as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]]. In [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] it is known as the Eastern Expressway. I-610 provides a direct shortcut for traffic passing through New Orleans via I-10, allowing that traffic to bypass I-10's southward curve.\n\nIn addition to the interstates, [[U.S. Route 90|U.S. 90]] travels through the city, while [[U.S. Route 61|U.S. 61]] terminates downtown. In addition, [[U.S. Route 11|U.S. 11]] terminates in the eastern portion of the city.\n\nNew Orleans is home to many bridges; [[Crescent City Connection]] is perhaps the most notable. It serves as New Orleans' major bridge across the Mississippi, providing a connection between the city's downtown on the eastbank and its westbank suburbs. Other Mississippi crossings are the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], carrying U.S. 90 and the [[Luling Bridge|Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge]], carrying [[Interstate 310 (Louisiana)|Interstate 310]].\n\nThe [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Twin Span Bridge]], a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) [[causeway]] in eastern New Orleans, carries I-10 across Lake Pontchartrain. Also in eastern New Orleans, [[Interstate 510]]/[[Louisiana Highway 47|LA 47]] travels across the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]/[[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] via the [[Green Bridge (New Orleans)|Paris Road Bridge]], connecting [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] and suburban [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]].\n\nThe tolled [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]], consisting of two parallel bridges are, at {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} long, the longest bridges in the world. Built in the 1950s (southbound span) and 1960s (northbound span), the bridges connect New Orleans with its suburbs on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain via [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].\n\n===Taxi service===\nUnited Cab is the city's largest taxi service, with a fleet of over 300 cabs.<ref name=\"4WWL\">{{cite news |last1=Farris |first1=Meg |title=BREAKING LIVE VIDEO LIVE @ 11:30 AM: Update on Canal St mass shooting from NOPD  LOCAL Cab companies: City regulations will force us to close |url=https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/cab-companies-city-regulations-will-force-us-to-close/289-593532684 |accessdate=December 2, 2019 |work=4WWL TV |date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> It has operated 365 days a year since its establishment in 1938, with the exception of the month after [[Hurricane Katrina]], in which operations were temporarily shut down due to disruptions in radio service.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Robert |date=March 10, 2016 |title=Danae Columbus: United Cab says business down 50 percent since arrival of Uber, and now Lyft |url=http://uptownmessenger.com/2016/03/danae-columbus-united-cab-says-business-down-50-percent-since-arrival-of-uber-and-now-lyft/ |newspaper=Uptown Messenger |accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnited Cab's fleet was once larger than 450 cabs, but has been reduced in recent years due to competition from services like [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]], according to owner Syed Kazmi.<ref name=\"4WWL\"/> In January 2016, New Orleans-based sweet shop Sucr\u00e9 approached United Cab with to deliver its [[king cake]]s locally on-demand.

Up until August 2005 (when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck), the ''Sunset Limited's'' route continued east to Orlando.\n\nWith the strategic benefits of both the port and its double-track Mississippi River crossings, the city attracted six of the seven [[Class I railroad]]s in North America: [[Union Pacific Railroad]], [[BNSF Railway]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[Kansas City Southern Railway]], [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Canadian National Railway]]. The [[New Orleans Public Belt Railroad]] provides interchange services between the railroads.\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nAccording to the 2016 [[American Community Survey]], 67.4% of working city of New Orleans residents commuted by driving alone, 9.7% carpooled, 7.3% used public transportation, and 4.9% walked.

One of which was the Natchez in Southern Mississippi. In the 1720s trouble developed between the French and the Natchez Indians that would be called the Natchez War or [[Natchez revolt|Natchez Revolt]]. 230 colonists were killed and the fort and homes were burned to the ground.\n\nThe conflict between the two parties was a direct result of Lieutenant d\u2019Etcheparre (more commonly known as [[Natchez revolt|Sieur de Ch\u00e9part]]), the commandant at the settlement near the Natchez, decided in 1729 that the Natchez Indians should surrender both their cultivated crop lands and their town of White Apple to the French. The Natchez pretended to surrender and actually worked for the French in the hunting game, but as soon as they were weaponized, they struck back and killed several men, resulting in the colonists fleeing downriver to New Orleans. The fleeing colonist sought protection from what they feared might be a colony-wide Indian uprising. The Natchez, however, did not press on after their surprise attack, leaving them vulnerable enough for King Louis XV's appointed governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]] to reclaim the settlement.\n\nRelations with Louisiana's Indians, a problem inherited from Bienville, remained a concern for the next governor, [[Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Marquis de Vaudreuil]]<nowiki/>. In the early 1740s traders from the British colonies of the Atlantic coast crossed into the Appalachian Mountains. The Native nations in between the French colonials and British colonials would now operate dependent on which of the two colonies would most benefit them. Several of these tribes and especially the [[Chickasaw|Chicksaw]] and [[Choctaw]] would trade goods and gifts for their loyalty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Louisiana : a history|last=Cummins, Light Townsend|isbn=978-1118619292|oclc=861648007|year= 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe economic problems under Vaudreuil would not allow the French to outcompete the British and resulted in many of Louisiana's Native American revolts. In 1747 and 1748 the Chicksaw would raid along the east bank of the Mississippi all the way south to Baton Rouge. These actions supported by the British colonials would force residents of French Louisiana to take refuge in New Orleans.\n\n=== Slavery in French Louisiana ===\nInability to find labor was the most pressing issue in the early French colony. Colonists turned to African slavery to make their investments in Louisiana profitable. In the late 1710s the international slave trade imported enslaved Africans. This led to the biggest shipment in 1716 where several trading ships appeared with slaves as cargo to the local residents in a one-year span.\n\nBy 1724, the large number of blacks in Louisiana prompted the institutionalizing of laws governing slavery within the colony. These laws required that slaves be baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, slaves be married in the Church, and gave slaves no legal rights. The slave law formed in the 1720s is known as the [[Code Noir]], which would bleed into the antebellum period of the American South as well. Louisiana slave culture had its own distinct Afro-Creole society that called on past cultures and the situation for slaves in the New World. Afro-Creole was present in religious beliefs and the Louisiana Creole dialect. The religion most associated with this period for was called [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]].\n\n=== Religion and architecture from across the world ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn the city of New Orleans an inspiring mixture of foreign influences created a melting pot of culture that is still celebrated today. By the end of French colonization in Louisiana, New Orleans was recognized commercially in the Atlantic world. Its inhabitants traded across the French commercial system. New Orleans was a hub for this trade both physically and culturally because it served as the exit point to the rest of the globe for the interior of the North American continent.\n\nIn one instance the French government established a chapter house of sisters in New Orleans. The [[History of the Ursulines in New Orleans|Ursuline sisters]] after being sponsored by the [[Company of the Indies]], founded a convent in the city in 1727. At the end of the colonial era, the Ursuline Academy maintained a house of seventy boarding and one hundred day students. Today numerous schools in New Orleans can trace their lineage from this academy.\n[[File:Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer - Louisiane - Adrien de Pauger - 1724 - 001.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer \u2013 Louisiane \u2013 Adrien de Pauger \u2013 1724 \u2013 001]]\nAnother notable example is the streetplan and architecture still distinguishing New Orleans today. French Louisiana had early architects in the province who were trained as military engineers and were now assigned to design government buildings. Pierre Le Blond de Tour and [[Adrien de Pauger]], for example, planned many early fortifications, along with the street plan for the city of New Orleans. After them in the 1740s, Ignace Fran\u00e7ois Broutin, as engineer-in-chief of Louisiana, reworked the architecture of New Orleans with an extensive public works program.\n\nFrench policy-makers in Paris attempted to set political and economic norms for New Orleans. It acted autonomously in much of its cultural and physical aspects, but also stayed in communication with the foreign trends as well.\n\n=== Post-Treaty of Paris ===\nAfter the French relinquished West Louisiana to the Spanish, New Orleans merchants attempted to ignore Spanish rule and even re-institute French control on the colony. The citizens of New Orleans held a series of public meetings during 1765 to keep the populace in opposition of the establishment of Spanish rule. Anti-Spanish passions in New Orleans reached their highest level after two years of Spanish administration in Louisiana. On October 27, 1768, a mob of local residents, spiked the guns guarding New Orleans and took control of the city from the Spanish. The rebellion organized a group to sail for Paris, where it met with officials of the French government. This group brought with them a long memorial to summarize the abuses the colony had endured from the Spanish. King Louis XV and his ministers reaffirmed Spain's sovereignty over Louisiana.\n\n===United States territory===\n[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. Thereafter, the city grew rapidly with influxes of Americans, [[French people|French]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and [[Demographics of Africa|Africans]]. Later immigrants were [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans]], [[Poles]] and [[Italians]]. Major [[commodity crops]] of [[sugar cane|sugar]] and [[cotton]] were cultivated with [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor on nearby large [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]].\n\nThousands of [[refugee]]s from the 1804 [[Haitian Revolution]], both [[White people|whites]] and [[free people of color]] (''affranchis'' or ''gens de couleur libres''), arrived in New Orleans; a number brought their slaves with them, many of whom were native Africans or of full-blood descent. While Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne|Claiborne]] and other officials wanted to keep out additional [[Free negro|free black]] people, the French Creoles wanted to increase the French-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed into the [[Territory of Orleans]], Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived.<ref name=\"AAM\"/> Many of the white [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophones]] had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for [[Bonapartist]] schemes.{{sfn|Gitlin |2009|p= 54}}\n\nNearly 90 percent of these immigrants settled in New Orleans. The 1809 migration brought 2,731 whites, 3,102 free people of color (of [[mixed-race]] European and African descent), and 3,226 slaves of primarily African descent, doubling the city's population.

The port handled commodities for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries, which were warehoused and transferred in New Orleans to smaller vessels and distributed along the Mississippi River watershed. The river was filled with steamboats, flatboats and sailing ships.

The market expanded after the United States ended the international [[Atlantic slave trade|trade]] in 1808. Two-thirds of the more than one million slaves brought to the [[Deep South]] arrived via [[forced migration]] in the domestic [[slave trade]]. The money generated by the sale of slaves in the [[Upper South]] has been estimated at 15 percent of the value of the staple crop economy. The [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] were collectively valued at half a billion dollars. The trade spawned an ancillary economy\u2014transportation, housing and clothing, fees, etc., estimated at 13.5% of the price per person, amounting to tens of billions of dollars (2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) during the [[Plantation era|antebellum period]], with New Orleans as a prime beneficiary.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2, 6</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Paul Lachance,\n\n{{quote|the addition of white immigrants [from Saint-Domingue] to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain a majority of the white population until almost 1830.

In 1862, following the occupation by the Navy after the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], led by [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], a respected state lawyer of the Massachusetts militia, Northern forces occupied the city. Later New Orleans residents nicknamed him \"Beast\" Butler, because of a military order he issued. After his troops had been assaulted and harassed in the streets by Southern women, his order warned that such future occurrences would result in his men treating such \"ladies\" as those \"plying their avocation in the streets\", implying that they would treat the women like prostitutes. Accounts of this spread widely. He also came to be called \"Spoons\" Butler because of the alleged looting that his troops did while occupying the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nButler abolished French language instruction in city schools. Statewide measures in 1864 and, after the war, 1868 further strengthened the English-only policy imposed by federal representatives. With the predominance of English speakers, that language had already become dominant in business and government.{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 166}} By the end of the 19th century, French usage had faded.

The [[Union Army]] eventually extended its control north along the [[Mississippi River]] and along the coastal areas. As a result, most of the southern portion of Louisiana was originally exempted from the liberating provisions of the 1863 \"[[Emancipation Proclamation]]\" issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Large numbers of rural ex-slaves and some free people of color from the city volunteered for the first regiments of Black troops in the War. Led by Brigadier General [[Daniel Ullman]] (1810\u20131892), of the 78th Regiment of New York State Volunteers Militia, they were known as the \"[[United States Colored Troops|Corps d'Afrique]].\" While that name had been used by a militia before the war, that group was composed of [[free people of color]]. The new group was made up mostly of former slaves. They were supplemented in the last two years of the War by newly organized [[United States Colored Troops]], who played an increasingly important part in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustica.org/san_bartolomeo/catalog/civilwar.htm|title=Usticesi in the United States Civil War|publisher=The Ustica Connection|date=March 22, 2003|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\nViolence throughout the South, especially the [[Memphis Riots of 1866]] followed by the [[New Orleans Riot]] in the same year, led Congress to pass the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], extending the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color. Louisiana and [[Texas]] were put under the authority of the \"[[Fifth Military District]]\" of the United States during Reconstruction. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868. Its Constitution of 1868 granted [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal male suffrage]] and established universal [[State school|public education]]. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, lieutenant governor [[P.B.S. Pinchback]], who was of [[mixed race]], succeeded [[Henry C. Warmouth|Henry Clay Warmouth]] for a brief period as Republican governor of [[Louisiana]], becoming the first governor of African descent of an [[U.S. state|American state]] (the next African American to serve as governor of an American state was [[Douglas Wilder]], elected in Virginia in 1989). New Orleans operated a racially integrated [[New Orleans Public Schools|public school system]] during this period.\n\nWartime damage to [[levees]] and cities along the Mississippi River adversely affected southern crops and trade. The federal government contributed to restoring infrastructure. The nationwide financial recession and [[Panic of 1873]] adversely affected businesses and slowed economic recovery.\n\nFrom 1868, elections in Louisiana were marked by violence, as white insurgents tried to suppress black voting and disrupt [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] gatherings. The disputed 1872 gubernatorial election resulted in conflicts that ran for years. The \"[[White League]]\", an insurgent paramilitary group that supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was organized in 1874 and operated in the open, violently suppressing the black vote and running off Republican officeholders. In 1874, in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]], 5,000 members of the White League fought with city police to take over the state offices for the Democratic candidate for governor, holding them for three days. By 1876, such tactics resulted in the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the so-called [[Redeemers]], regaining political control of the state legislature. The federal government gave up and withdrew its troops in 1877, ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].\n\n===Jim Crow era===\nWhite Democrats passed [[Jim Crow]] laws, establishing [[racial segregation]] in public facilities. In 1889, the legislature passed a [[constitutional amendment]] incorporating a \"[[grandfather clause]]\" that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] freedmen as well as the propertied people of color manumitted before the war. Unable to vote, African Americans could not serve on juries or in local office, and were closed out of formal politics for generations. The South was ruled by a white Democratic Party. Public schools were [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] and remained so until 1960.\n\nNew Orleans' large community of well-educated, often French-speaking [[free persons of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who had been free prior to the Civil War, fought against Jim Crow. They organized the ''Comit\u00e9 des Citoyens'' (Citizens Committee) to work for civil rights. As part of their legal campaign, they recruited one of their own, [[Homer Plessy]], to test whether Louisiana's newly enacted Separate Car Act was constitutional. Plessy boarded a commuter train departing New Orleans for [[Covington, Louisiana]], sat in the car reserved for whites only, and was arrested. The case resulting from this incident, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1896. The court ruled that \"[[separate but equal]]\" accommodations were constitutional, effectively upholding Jim Crow measures. In practice, African-American public schools and facilities were underfunded across the South. The Supreme Court ruling contributed to this period as the [[Nadir of American race relations|nadir of race relations]] in the United States. The rate of [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] of black men was high across the South, as other states also disfranchised blacks and sought to impose Jim Crow. Nativist prejudices also surfaced. [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|Anti-Italian]] sentiment in 1891 contributed to the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynchings of 11 Italians]], some of whom had been acquitted of the murder of the police chief. Some were shot and killed in the jail where they were detained. It was the largest mass lynching in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Library of Congress}}|title=Immigration / Italian|website=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Gambino2000\">{{cite book|last=Gambino|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Gambino |title=Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=jA9-dmAsoMwC}}|year=2000|publisher=Guernica Editions|isbn=978-1-55071-103-5|ref=harv}}</ref> In July 1900 the city was swept by white mobs rioting after Robert Charles, a young African American, killed a policeman and temporarily escaped. The mob killed him and an estimated 20 other blacks; seven whites died in the days-long conflict, until a [[Militia (United States)|state militia]] suppressed it.\n\nThroughout New Orleans' history, until the early 20th Century when medical and scientific advances ameliorated the situation, the city suffered repeated [[epidemic]]s of [[yellow fever]] and other tropical and [[Infection|infectious diseases]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:EsplanadeBurgundy1900.jpg|right|thumb|[[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]] at Burgundy Street, looking lakewards north towards [[Lake Ponchartrain]] (1900)]]\n[[File:RationingBoardNOLAVachonC.jpg|right|thumb|1943 waiting line at wartime Rationing Board office in New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans' economic and population zenith in relation to other American cities occurred in the antebellum period. It was the nation's fifth-largest city in 1860 (after [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]]) and was significantly larger than all other southern cities.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\">Lewis, Peirce F., ''New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape'', Santa Fe, 2003, p. 175.</ref> From the mid-19th century onward rapid economic growth shifted to other areas, while New Orleans' relative importance steadily declined. The growth of railways and highways decreased river traffic, diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> Thousands of the most ambitious [[Person of color|people of color]] left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] around [[World War II]] and after, many for [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] destinations. From the late 1800s, most censuses recorded New Orleans slipping down the ranks in the list of largest American cities (New Orleans' population still continued to increase throughout the period, but at a slower rate than before the Civil War).\n\nBy the mid-20th Century, New Orleanians recognized that their city was no longer the leading urban area in the [[Southern United States|South]]. By 1950, [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], and [[Atlanta]] exceeded New Orleans in size, and in 1960 [[Miami]] eclipsed New Orleans, even as the latter's population reached its historic peak.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> As with other older American cities, highway construction and suburban development drew residents from the center city to newer housing outside. The 1970 census recorded the first absolute decline in population since the city became part of the United States in 1803. The [[New Orleans metropolitan area]] continued expanding in population, albeit more slowly than other major Sun Belt cities. While the [[Port of New Orleans|port]] remained one of the nation's largest, automation and [[containerization]] cost many jobs. The city's former role as banker to the South was supplanted by larger peer cities. New Orleans' economy had always been based more on trade and financial services than on manufacturing, but the city's relatively small manufacturing sector also shrank after World War II. Despite some economic development successes under the administrations of [[DeLesseps Story Morrison|DeLesseps \"Chep\" Morrison]] (1946\u20131961) and [[Victor H. Schiro|Victor \"Vic\" Schiro]] (1961\u20131970), metropolitan New Orleans' growth rate consistently lagged behind more vigorous cities.\n\n====Civil Rights Movement====\nDuring the later years of Morrison's administration, and for the entirety of Schiro's, the city was a center of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] was founded in New Orleans, and lunch counter sit-ins were held in [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] department stores. A prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954). When six-year-old [[Ruby Bridges]] integrated [[William Frantz Elementary School]] in the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|Ninth Ward]], she was the first child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the South.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement's success in gaining federal passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] renewed constitutional rights, including voting for blacks. Together, these resulted in the most far-reaching changes in New Orleans' 20th century history.<ref>Germany, Kent B., ''New Orleans After the Promises: Poverty, Citizenship and the Search for the Great Society'', Athens, 2007, pp. 3\u20135</ref> Though legal and civil equality were re-established by the end of the 1960s, a large gap in income levels and educational attainment persisted between the city's White and African-American communities.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glassman, James K., \"New Orleans: I have Seen the Future, and It's Houston\", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', July 1978</ref> As the middle class and wealthier members of both races left the center city, its population's income level dropped, and it became proportionately more African American. From 1980, the African-American majority elected primarily officials from its own community. They struggled to narrow the gap by creating conditions conducive to the economic uplift of the African-American community.\n\nNew Orleans became increasingly dependent on tourism as an economic mainstay during the administrations of [[Sidney Barthelemy]] (1986\u20131994) and [[Marc Morial]] (1994\u20132002). Relatively low levels of educational attainment, high rates of household poverty, and rising crime threatened the city's prosperity in the later decades of the century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions aligned poorly with the changes in the late-20th century to the economy of the United States, which reflected a post-industrial, knowledge-based paradigm in which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills.\n\n====Drainage and flood control====\n{{See also|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\n[[File:LPD18USSNewOrleansPassingNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A view of the [[New Orleans Central Business District]] as seen from the [[Mississippi River]]. {{USS|New Orleans|LPD-18}} in foreground (2007)]]\n\nIn the 20th century, New Orleans' government and business leaders believed they needed to drain and develop outlying areas to provide for the city's expansion. The most ambitious development during this period was a drainage plan devised by engineer and inventor [[A. Baldwin Wood]], designed to break the surrounding swamp's stranglehold on the city's geographic expansion. Until then, urban development in New Orleans was largely limited to higher ground along the natural river levees and [[bayou]]s.\n\nWood's pump system allowed the city to drain huge tracts of swamp and marshland and expand into low-lying areas. Over the 20th century, rapid [[subsidence]], both natural and human-induced, resulted in these newly populated areas subsiding to several feet below sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Kusky, Timothy M. |title=Why is New Orleans Sinking? |publisher=Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Saint Louis University |date=December 29, 2005 |url=http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |accessdate=June 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623092455/http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |archivedate=June 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | first=Larry\n  | last=O'Hanlon\n  | url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html\n  | title=New Orleans Sits Atop Giant Landslide\n  | publisher=Discovery Channel\n  | date=March 31, 2006\n  | accessdate=June 17, 2006\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614211349/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 14, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNew Orleans was vulnerable to flooding even before the city's footprint departed from the natural high ground near the Mississippi River. In the late 20th century, however, scientists and New Orleans residents gradually became aware of the city's increased vulnerability. In 1965, flooding from [[Hurricane Betsy]] killed dozens of residents, although the majority of the city remained dry. The rain-induced [[May 8th 1995 Louisiana Flood|flood of May 8, 1995]], demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system. After that event, measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade pumping capacity. By the 1980s and 1990s, scientists observed that extensive, rapid, and ongoing [[Coastal erosion|erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding New Orleans]], especially that related to the [[Mississippi River \u2013 Gulf Outlet Canal]], had the unintended result of leaving the city more vulnerable than before to hurricane-induced catastrophic [[storm surge]]s.\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Hurricane Katrina====\n[[File:Katrina 2nd landfall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Katrina]] at its New Orleans landfall]]\n{{See also|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\nNew Orleans was catastrophically affected by what Raymond B.

Major streets include [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], Poydras Street, Tulane Avenue and Loyola Avenue. Canal Street divides the traditional \"[[Downtown New Orleans|downtown]]\" area from the \"[[Uptown New Orleans|uptown]]\" area.\n\nEvery street crossing Canal Street between the Mississippi River and [[Rampart Street]], which is the northern edge of the French Quarter, has a different name for the \"uptown\" and \"downtown\" portions.

''New Orleans'', Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina (1999), pp. 108\u201309.</ref> Elsewhere in the city, Canal Street serves as the dividing point between the \"South\" and \"North\" portions of various streets. In the local [[wikt:parlance|parlance]] ''downtown'' means \"downriver from Canal Street\", while ''uptown'' means \"upriver from Canal Street\".

Creole cottages and townhouses, notable for their large courtyards and intricate iron balconies, line the streets of the French Quarter. American townhouses, double-gallery houses, and Raised Center-Hall Cottages are notable. [[St. Charles Avenue]] is famed for its large [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum homes]]. Its mansions are in various styles, such as [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[American colonial architecture|American Colonial]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles of [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] and [[Italianate architecture]].

The soft soils are susceptible to subsidence, and there was doubt about the feasibility of constructing high rises. Developments in engineering throughout the 20th century eventually made it possible to build sturdy foundations in the foundations that underlie the structures. In the 1960s, the [[2 Canal Street|World Trade Center New Orleans]] and [[Plaza Tower]] demonstrated skyscrapers' viability. [[One Shell Square]] became the city's tallest building in 1972.

The most well known is [[Carnival]], or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]. Carnival officially begins on the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]], also known in some Christian traditions as the \"[[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]\" of Christams. ''Mardi Gras'' (French for \"Fat Tuesday\"), the final and grandest day of traditional Catholic festivities, is the last Tuesday before the [[Christianity|Christian]] liturgical season of [[Lent]], which commences on [[Ash Wednesday]].\n\nThe largest of the city's many music festivals is the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]]. Commonly referred to simply as \"Jazz Fest\", it is one of the nation's largest music festivals. The festival features a variety of music, including both native Louisiana and international artists. Along with Jazz Fest, New Orleans' [[Voodoo Experience]] (\"Voodoo Fest\") and the [[Essence Music Festival]] also feature local and international artists.\n\nOther major festivals include [[Southern Decadence]], the French Quarter Festival, and the [[Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival]]. The American playwright lived and wrote in New Orleans early in his career, and set his play, ''[[Streetcar Named Desire]],'' there.\n\nIn 2002, Louisiana began offering tax incentives for film and television production. This has resulted in a substantial increase in activity and brought the nickname of \"Hollywood South\" for New Orleans. Films produced in and around the city include ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'', ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'', ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]'', ''[[Deja Vu (2006 film)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', ''[[Last Holiday (2006 film)|Last Holiday]]'', ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'' and ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]''.

The first opera in New Orleans was performed there in 1796. In the nineteenth century, the city was the home of two of America's most important venues for [[French opera]], the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orl\u00e9ans]] and later the [[French Opera House]]. Today, opera is performed by the [[New Orleans Opera]]. The [[Marigny Opera House]] is home to the Marigny Opera Ballet and also hosts opera, jazz, and classical music performances. [[File:Frank Ocean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Ocean]] is a musician from New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans has long been a significant center for music, showcasing its intertwined European, African and Latin American cultures. The city's unique musical heritage was born in its colonial and early American days from a unique blending of European musical instruments with African rhythms. As the only North American city to have allowed [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] to gather in public and play their native music (largely in [[Congo Square]], now located within [[Louis Armstrong Park (New Orleans)|Louis Armstrong Park]]), New Orleans gave birth in the early 20th century to an epochal indigenous music: [[jazz]]. Soon, African-American [[brass band]]s formed, beginning a century-long tradition. The Louis Armstrong Park area, near the French Quarter in [[Trem\u00e9]], contains the [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]]. The city's music was later also significantly influenced by [[Acadiana]], home of [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] music, and by [[blues|Delta blues]].\n\nNew Orleans' unique musical culture is on display in its traditional funerals. A spin on military funerals, New Orleans' traditional funerals feature sad music (mostly [[dirge]]s and [[hymn]]s) in processions on the way to the cemetery and happier music (hot jazz) on the way back. Until the 1990s, most locals preferred to call these \"funerals with music.\" Visitors to the city have long dubbed them \"[[jazz funeral]]s.\"\n\nMuch later in its musical development, New Orleans was home to a distinctive brand of [[rhythm and blues]] that contributed greatly to the growth of [[rock and roll]]. An example of the New Orleans' sound in the 1960s is the #1 US hit \"[[Chapel of Love]]\" by [[the Dixie Cups]], a song which knocked [[the Beatles]] out of the top spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. New Orleans became a hotbed for [[funk]] music in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the late 1980s, it had developed its own localized variant of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], called [[bounce music]]. While not commercially successful outside of the [[Deep South]], bounce music was immensely popular in poorer neighborhoods throughout the 1990s.\n\nA cousin of bounce, [[southern hip hop|New Orleans hip hop]] achieved commercial success locally and internationally, producing [[Lil Wayne]], [[Master P]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[No Limit Records]]. Additionally, the popularity of [[cowpunk]], a fast form of [[southern rock]], originated with the help of several local bands, such as [[The Radiators (US)|The Radiators]], [[Better Than Ezra]], [[Cowboy Mouth]] and [[Dash Rip Rock]]. Throughout the 1990s, many [[sludge metal]] bands started.

The indigenous cuisine is distinctive and influential. New Orleans food combined local Creole, haute Creole and New Orleans French cuisines. Local ingredients, French, Spanish, Italian, African, Native American, Cajun, Chinese, and a hint of Cuban traditions combine to produce a truly unique and easily recognizable New Orleans flavor.\n\nNew Orleans is known for specialties including [[beignet]]s (locally pronounced like \"ben-yays\"), square-shaped fried dough that could be called \"French doughnuts\" (served with ''[[caf\u00e9 au lait]]'' made with a blend of coffee and chicory rather than only coffee); and [[po' boy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.neworleans.com/restaurants/traditional-new-orleans-foods/po-boys/|title=New Orleans Po-Boy|website=www.neworleans.com}}</ref> and Italian [[muffuletta]] sandwiches; Gulf oysters on the half-shell, fried oysters, boiled [[crayfish|crawfish]] and other [[seafood]]; [[\u00e9touff\u00e9e]], [[jambalaya]], [[gumbo]] and other Creole dishes; and the Monday favorite of [[red beans and rice]] ([[Louis Armstrong]] often signed his letters, \"Red beans and ricely yours\").

Like earlier Southern Englishes, feature frequent [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|deletion of the pre-consonantal \"r\"]]. This dialect is quite similar to New York City area accents such as \"[[New York City English|Brooklynese]]\", to people unfamiliar with either.<ref>Liebling, A. J. (1970). ''The Earl of Louisiana''. Baton Rouge: LSU.</ref>  No consensus describes how it came to be, but it likely resulted from New Orleans' geographic isolation by water and the fact that the city was a major immigration port throughout the 19th century. As a result, many of the ethnic groups who reside in Brooklyn also reside in New Orleans, such as the [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italians]] (especially [[Sicilian American|Sicilians]]), [[German American|Germans]] and a [[Jewish American|Jewish]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|title=Newcomers' Incentive Extension|publisher=Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans|accessdate=March 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524200300/http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|archivedate=May 24, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the strongest varieties of the New Orleans accent is sometimes identified as the [[Yat dialect]], from the greeting \"Where y'at?\" This distinctive accent is dying out in the city, but remains strong in the surrounding parishes.\n\nLess visibly, various ethnic groups throughout the area have retained distinct language traditions. Although rare, languages still spoken include [[Cajun French|Cajun]], the [[Louisiana Creole French|Kreyol Lwiziyen]] spoken by the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and an archaic Louisiana-Canarian Spanish dialect spoken by the [[Isle\u00f1o]] people and older members of the population.\n\n=== Voodoo ===\nReliable documentation of Voodoo does not exist because of the definitive claim that it is secretive. Voodoo existed in New Orleans-in some of its facets it probably still exists in the modern-day. The likelihood that the slave-developed religion possessed many white followers alongside its black participants is high. Voodoo as described by the distinguished novelist [[George Washington Cable]] is \"the name of an imaginary being of vast supernatural powers residing in the form of a harmless snake\". Followers to these powers are known as the voodoos.\n\n=== History and Origins ===\n[[File:Voodoo.jpg|thumb|Voodoo]]\nMultiple origins come from around the world and converge in pre-antebellum and antebellum New Orleans. ''Vodu'' as used by the Ewes of West Africa means fear of the gods. ''Vodun'' in Dahomy, West Africa, is a name for all deities. In French ''Vaudis'' referred to a witch. Throughout its history in New Orleans, Voodoo and Southern Negro shared folklore, superstitions, language and customs, and had their counterparts in West Africa.\n\nScholars have the noted the use of Roman Catholic saints and liturgies in voodoo worship including black cats, serpents and the color red. These European and African motifs signify evil, the devil, blood, sin, sacrifice, harlotry. After existing in New Orleans for decades, in 1800 when Haitian and West Indian blacks were forced to Louisiana the hexes and secret revenges were incorporated into the system of slavery.\n\nWhite southerners thought Voodoo to be primarily African in origin, and they fitted the practice of it into their beliefs that black men were primitive and inferior. In reality the Voodoo religion/culture is a mixture of African, Caribbean, and European influences.\n\nFor further information [[Saint John's Eve|St. John's Eve]] has had an important relationship to Voodoo in its openness during celebrations.\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sports in New Orleans}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Club\n!Sport\n!League\n!Venue (capacity)\n!Founded\n!Titles\n!Record Attendance\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Saints]]\n| [[American football]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Football League|NFL]]\n| [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] (73,208)\n| align=center | 1967\n| align=center | 1\n| align=center | 73,373\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Pelicans]]\n| [[Basketball]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]\n| [[Smoothie King Center]] (16,867)\n| align=center | 2002\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 18,444\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Jesters]]\n| [[Soccer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Premier Soccer League|NPSL]]\n| [[Pan American Stadium (New Orleans)|Pan American Stadium]] (5,000)\n| align=center | 2003\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 5,000\n|}\n\n[[File:Fleur de lys (or).svg|right|upright=0.45|thumb|The [[fleur-de-lis]] is often a symbol of New Orleans and its sports teams.]]\n\nNew Orleans' professional sports teams include the 2009 [[Super Bowl XLIV]] champion [[New Orleans Saints]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]) and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] ([[National Basketball Association|NBA]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/voodoo/index.ssf/2010/09/the_new_orleans_voodoo_and_the.html|title=The New Orleans VooDoo and the Arena Football League are returning}}</ref> It is also home to the [[Big Easy Rollergirls]], an all-female [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association|flat track roller derby]] team, and the [[New Orleans Blaze]], a [[National Women's Football Association|women's football]] team.<ref name=\"BlazeFootball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001171600/http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 1, 2008|title=History of the New Orleans Blaze|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans Blaze|date=April 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"BERG\">{{cite web|last=Vargas|first=Ramon|url=http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963|title=Big Easy Rollergirls deliver bruising derby action|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans CityBusiness|date=May 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622064720/http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963 |archivedate=June 22, 2007}}</ref> New Orleans is also home to two [[NCAA Division I]] athletic programs, the [[Tulane Green Wave]] of the [[American Athletic Conference]] and the [[UNO Privateers]] of the [[Southland Conference]].\n\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] is the home of the Saints, the Sugar Bowl, and other prominent events.

The paper made headlines of its own in 2012 when owner [[Advance Publications]] cut its print schedule to three days each week, instead focusing its efforts on its website, NOLA.com. That action briefly made New Orleans the largest city in the country without a daily newspaper, until the [[Baton Rouge]] newspaper ''[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]'' began a New Orleans edition in September 2012. In June 2013, the ''Times-Picayune'' resumed daily printing with a condensed [[newsstand]] [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] edition, nicknamed ''TP Street'', which is published on the three days each week that its namesake [[broadsheet]] edition is not printed (the Picayune has not returned to daily delivery). With the resumption of daily print editions from the ''Times-Picayune'' and the launch of the New Orleans edition of ''The Advocate'', now ''The New Orleans Advocate'', the city had two daily newspapers for the first time since the afternoon States-Item ceased publication on May 31, 1980.

I-10 travels east\u2013west through the city as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]]. In [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] it is known as the Eastern Expressway. I-610 provides a direct shortcut for traffic passing through New Orleans via I-10, allowing that traffic to bypass I-10's southward curve.\n\nIn addition to the interstates, [[U.S. Route 90|U.S. 90]] travels through the city, while [[U.S. Route 61|U.S. 61]] terminates downtown. In addition, [[U.S. Route 11|U.S. 11]] terminates in the eastern portion of the city.\n\nNew Orleans is home to many bridges; [[Crescent City Connection]] is perhaps the most notable. It serves as New Orleans' major bridge across the Mississippi, providing a connection between the city's downtown on the eastbank and its westbank suburbs. Other Mississippi crossings are the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], carrying U.S. 90 and the [[Luling Bridge|Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge]], carrying [[Interstate 310 (Louisiana)|Interstate 310]].\n\nThe [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Twin Span Bridge]], a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) [[causeway]] in eastern New Orleans, carries I-10 across Lake Pontchartrain. Also in eastern New Orleans, [[Interstate 510]]/[[Louisiana Highway 47|LA 47]] travels across the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]/[[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] via the [[Green Bridge (New Orleans)|Paris Road Bridge]], connecting [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] and suburban [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]].\n\nThe tolled [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]], consisting of two parallel bridges are, at {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} long, the longest bridges in the world. Built in the 1950s (southbound span) and 1960s (northbound span), the bridges connect New Orleans with its suburbs on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain via [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].\n\n===Taxi service===\nUnited Cab is the city's largest taxi service, with a fleet of over 300 cabs.<ref name=\"4WWL\">{{cite news |last1=Farris |first1=Meg |title=BREAKING LIVE VIDEO LIVE @ 11:30 AM: Update on Canal St mass shooting from NOPD  LOCAL Cab companies: City regulations will force us to close |url=https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/cab-companies-city-regulations-will-force-us-to-close/289-593532684 |accessdate=December 2, 2019 |work=4WWL TV |date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> It has operated 365 days a year since its establishment in 1938, with the exception of the month after [[Hurricane Katrina]], in which operations were temporarily shut down due to disruptions in radio service.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Robert |date=March 10, 2016 |title=Danae Columbus: United Cab says business down 50 percent since arrival of Uber, and now Lyft |url=http://uptownmessenger.com/2016/03/danae-columbus-united-cab-says-business-down-50-percent-since-arrival-of-uber-and-now-lyft/ |newspaper=Uptown Messenger |accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnited Cab's fleet was once larger than 450 cabs, but has been reduced in recent years due to competition from services like [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]], according to owner Syed Kazmi.<ref name=\"4WWL\"/> In January 2016, New Orleans-based sweet shop Sucr\u00e9 approached United Cab with to deliver its [[king cake]]s locally on-demand.

Up until August 2005 (when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck), the ''Sunset Limited's'' route continued east to Orlando.\n\nWith the strategic benefits of both the port and its double-track Mississippi River crossings, the city attracted six of the seven [[Class I railroad]]s in North America: [[Union Pacific Railroad]], [[BNSF Railway]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[Kansas City Southern Railway]], [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Canadian National Railway]]. The [[New Orleans Public Belt Railroad]] provides interchange services between the railroads.\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nAccording to the 2016 [[American Community Survey]], 67.4% of working city of New Orleans residents commuted by driving alone, 9.7% carpooled, 7.3% used public transportation, and 4.9% walked.

The town is believed to have been founded in the 5th century BC by colonists from [[Colchis]], as mentioned in the 3rd century BC poem by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]. Illyrians lived in the region at the time as there are traces of immense [[Cyclopean walls]] still visible in the old Citadel.<ref name= Rellie/>\n\nAll the way in the pre-medieval period, Ulcinj was known as one of the pirate capitals of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. This is also seen during the later period of [[Illyrian Kingdom]]. Inhabitants of Ulcinj were known before time of [[Christ]], especially from 20 BC to around 300 AD, to be very confrontational to those who were foreigners to their land; they were especially meticulous about border disputes as well.\n\n=== Roman ===\n[[File:Roman_Doclea.gif|thumb|Roman Doclea]]\nIn 168 BC, during the [[Third Illyrian War]], Olcinium broke with [[Gentius]] and defected to the Romans ([[Livy]] 45:26:2). Under Roman rule the town received the status of ''oppidum civium Romanorum'' (settlement of Roman citizens), only to be later granted ''[[municipium]]'' (independent town) status. A section of their re-fortification can be distinguished from the Illyrio-Greek by the rustication of the walls.<ref name= Rellie/>\n\nThe ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus Maris Erythraei]]'' names several Indian ports [[Indian_maritime_history#Early_Common_Era\u2014High_Middle_Ages|from where large ships sailed]] in an easterly direction to ''[[Ulcinj|Khruse]]'' (Kru\u010de - seaside village in Ulcinj).<ref>Donkin, Robin A.

From Medieval times, and quiet likely earlier, it was regarded as an important trading and maritime center and still maintained the status of city autonomy.<ref name= Rellie/> From circa 820, the city was the see of a [[Diocese of Ulcinj]], which was only suppressed in 1532, and would be revived as a Latin [[titular bishopric]].\n\n=== Medieval period and South Slavic rule ===\nIn the 9th century, it was in the [[Dyrrhachium (theme)|Dyrrhachium theme]], a military governorate of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 1010, ''Tsar'' [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] (r. 997-1014\u2020) failed to conquer the town during the [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars#Sviatoslav.27s invasion and the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|war against the Byzantines]].\n \nBy 1040, ''archon'' [[Vojislav of Duklja|Stefan Vojislav]] of [[Duklja]] conquered the region. In 1183, [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbian Prince]] [[Stefan Nemanja]] conquered Olcinium and the town prospered as one of the most significant coastal towns. Ulcinj remained in Nemanji\u0107 hands in their [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]], and after the death of [[Emperor Du\u0161an]] (r. 1331-1355\u2020), the region, known as ''Lower [[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]'', was under the supervision of ''gospodin'' [[\u017darko (nobleman)|\u017darko]], a ''voivode'' of Emperor [[Uro\u0161 the Weak]] until his death in 1360. \u017darko's lands were then held by the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]] family. Under Bal\u0161i\u0107 control, Ulcinj continued to be an important town and also [[Mint (coin)|minted coins]]. The Bal\u0161i\u0107 Tower in the upper part of the Old Town was built by the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]] in the late 14th century.\n\n=== Venetian and Ottoman rule ===\n[[File:Dulcingo Pinargenti 1573.jpg|thumb|Map of Dulcigno (now Ulcinj) in 1573 by Simon Pinargenti]]\nIn 1405 the Venetians conquered the town. Under Venetian control, the city was renamed ''Dulcigno'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], and it was incorporated in the [[Albania Veneta]]. The Venetians maintained control until 1571, when the [[Ottoman Turks]] conquered Dulcigno with the help of [[Barbary pirates]], who didn't leave the town after conquering. It remained within the Ottoman domain for over 300 years, during which time its far-reaching reputation as a lair of pirates was established.<ref name= Rellie/>\n\nIn the 17th century a self-proclaimed Jewish [[Messiah]] named [[Sabbatai Zevi]] caused turmoil throughout the Turkish Empire with his evangelizing, which attracted thousands of followers. He was eventually captured and exiled to Ulcinj in 1666, where he died quietly ten years later. He was buried in the courtyard of a Muslim house which is still preserved as a mausoleum; along with two Jewish altars in the Bal\u0161ic Tower.<ref name= Rellie/>\n\nIn 1867, Ulcinj became a [[township|kaza]] of the [[Sanjak of Scutari|\u0130\u015fkodra sanjak]] of [[Rumeli]] veyalet. After the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, borders between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire were redrawn, with [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] being ceded to Montenegro. But Muslim Albanian resistance prevented the Montenegrins from taking over Plav and Gusinje, so the Great Powers in 1880 decided to reverse the territorial transfer and offered Ulcinj to Montenegro as compensation.\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\n[[File:Fish-market in Ulcinj (1908).jpg|thumb|Ulcinj fish market in 1908]]\nUlcinj became a part of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] from 1878 until 1918 when Montenegro was absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] for a short time before all would be incorporated into the first of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] federations at the end of the year. Ulcinj remained within a Montenegrin entity whilst a South Slavic state had existed until 2006 when which it became part of an independent Montenegro following a referendum.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Ulcinj survived heavy declines and new ascents. Ulcinj was the second biggest town of Montenegro when it joined the kingdom in 1880. In just three decades, it backslided to 6th place for economic development and number of inhabitants (after Podgorica, Niksic, Cetinje, Tivar and Plava). During World War I Ulcinj was conquered by Austria-Hungary in 1916 and Italy on November 4, 1918,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://augusto.digitpa.gov.it/gazzette/index/download/id/1918261_PM|title=Gazzetta Ufficiale del Regno d'Italia N. 261 del 6 Novembre 1918|last=|first=|date=6 November 1918|work=Gazzetta Ufficiale del Regno d'Italia|accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref> and since 1920 it was part of the Serbo-Croatian-Slovenian Kingdom, later known as the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nAs the southernmost city of the coast of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Ulcinj had a strong turnaround in the 1930s with the development of the tourist industry. At that time hotels were built such as Kri\u0161tja, Republic, Jadran and Koop (later Galeb). \nWorld War II halted economic momentum. From 1941 to 1944, Ulcinj was under the Albanian administration. On November 7, 1943, Ulcinj was bombarded by Allied forces, with over 46 people  killed and many more injured. The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] took Ulcinj on November 26, 1944, and the city become part of [[Socialist Yugoslavia]]. <ref>[[#LTKU-1989|LTKU (1989)]], fq. 46</ref><ref>[http://www.cdm.me/politika/cetkovic-dps-i-forca-hoce-da-brisu-istoriju-ulcinja \u0106etkovi\u0107: DPS i Forca ho\u0107e da bri\u0161u istoriju Ulcinja]</ref><ref>[http://www.visit-ulcinj.com/blog/2014/03/19/ruzna-strana-lepote-ulcinja/ Ru\u017ena strana lepote Ulcinja]</ref>\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s marked the gratest period of economic development for Ulcinj, with the construction of a range of modern hotels in the city and the Great Plain, as well as major economic collectives (NHT \"Riviera of Ulcinj\", \"Agroulqini\", Primary Building Company, \"Otrantkomerc\", \"Ultep\" and others). In the catastrophic earthquake on April 15, 1979, the city was severely damaged, but after only a few years, with the solidarity of the citizens of entire Yugoslavia, it was quickly renovated. Ulcinj at the end of the eighties had about 40 percent of the tourist turnover in Montenegro, while two-thirds of the guests were foreign, mostly German.\n\nDuring the Kosovo War, in 1998 and 1999, thousands of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Ulcinj and its surroundings, where they were welcomed in the best possible conditions by the ethnic Albanian population of Ulcinj and the surrounding area.\n\n== Population ==\n{{Historical populations\n| 1948|4385\n| 1953|4919\n| 1961|5705\n| 1971|7459\n| 1981|9140\n| 1991|10025\n| 2003|10828\n| 2011|10707\n|footnote=\n}}\nUlcinj is the administrative centre of [[Ulcinj Municipality]], which has a population of 19,921.

It is most famous for its sandy beaches.{{fact|date=March 2019}} The most valuable resource of the Ulcinj riviera is [[Velika pla\u017ea]] (Albanian: Plazha e Madhe, English: Long Beach), which is a {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} long stretch of sandy beach and the longest beach on the Montenegrin coast. There is a small pebble beach called [[Ladies Beach, Ulcinj|Ladies Beach]] which folk tradition holds to have qualities conducive to fertility. \n\nThere is also a beach called ''[[Mala Pla\u017ea]]'' (Albanian: Plazha e Vog\u00ebl, English: Small Beach) which is much smaller in size, but is located in the centre of town and very popular with visitors. \"The Korzo\", as it is called by locals, is a [[promenade]] which separates a street lined with coffee shops from Mala pla\u017ea. At night during the summer months, the Korzo is pedestrianised and families and young people gather. There are many more less known smaller beaches that serve as get-aways from the main tourist areas. Ulcinj has also a large number of religious buildings like [[mosques]], [[T\u00fcrbe|tyrbes]] and [[Church (building)|churches]], including: [[Pasha's Mosque]], [[Sailors' Mosque]] and St. Nicholas' Church.\n\nUlcinj's old town is a well preserved [[castle]]-looking community that is left over from medieval times. The old town sits atop a mountain overlooking the shore and is a tourist attraction on its own. [[Ada Bojana]] (Albanian: ''Buna'') is popular among foreign tourists from [[Western Europe]] for its peace and atmosphere.{{fact|date=March 2019}} A large [[naturist]] campsite is located in Ada Bojana. [[Lake \u0160as|\u0160a\u0161ko lake]] and Ulcinj's salt pond are visited by birdwatchers, because Ulcinj and its surroundings are major resting points for over 200 bird species on their migration paths.

The town is believed to have been founded in the 5th century BC by colonists from [[Colchis]], as mentioned in the 3rd century BC poem by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]].

Inhabitants of Ulcinj were known before time of [[Christ]], especially from 20 BC to around 300 AD, to be very confrontational to those who were foreigners to their land; they were especially meticulous about border disputes as well.\n\n=== Roman ===\n[[File:Roman_Doclea.gif|thumb|Roman Doclea]]\nIn 168 BC, during the [[Third Illyrian War]], Olcinium broke with [[Gentius]] and defected to the Romans ([[Livy]] 45:26:2). Under Roman rule the town received the status of ''oppidum civium Romanorum'' (settlement of Roman citizens), only to be later granted ''[[municipium]]'' (independent town) status.

From Medieval times, and quiet likely earlier, it was regarded as an important trading and maritime center and still maintained the status of city autonomy.<ref name= Rellie/> From circa 820, the city was the see of a [[Diocese of Ulcinj]], which was only suppressed in 1532, and would be revived as a Latin [[titular bishopric]].\n\n=== Medieval period and South Slavic rule ===\nIn the 9th century, it was in the [[Dyrrhachium (theme)|Dyrrhachium theme]], a military governorate of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 1010, ''Tsar'' [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] (r. 997-1014\u2020) failed to conquer the town during the [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars#Sviatoslav.27s invasion and the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|war against the Byzantines]].\n \nBy 1040, ''archon'' [[Vojislav of Duklja|Stefan Vojislav]] of [[Duklja]] conquered the region. In 1183, [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbian Prince]] [[Stefan Nemanja]] conquered Olcinium and the town prospered as one of the most significant coastal towns. Ulcinj remained in Nemanji\u0107 hands in their [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]], and after the death of [[Emperor Du\u0161an]] (r. 1331-1355\u2020), the region, known as ''Lower [[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]'', was under the supervision of ''gospodin'' [[\u017darko (nobleman)|\u017darko]], a ''voivode'' of Emperor [[Uro\u0161 the Weak]] until his death in 1360. \u017darko's lands were then held by the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]] family.

The Bal\u0161i\u0107 Tower in the upper part of the Old Town was built by the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]] in the late 14th century.\n\n=== Venetian and Ottoman rule ===\n[[File:Dulcingo Pinargenti 1573.jpg|thumb|Map of Dulcigno (now Ulcinj) in 1573 by Simon Pinargenti]]\nIn 1405 the Venetians conquered the town. Under Venetian control, the city was renamed ''Dulcigno'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], and it was incorporated in the [[Albania Veneta]]. The Venetians maintained control until 1571, when the [[Ottoman Turks]] conquered Dulcigno with the help of [[Barbary pirates]], who didn't leave the town after conquering. It remained within the Ottoman domain for over 300 years, during which time its far-reaching reputation as a lair of pirates was established.<ref name= Rellie/>\n\nIn the 17th century a self-proclaimed Jewish [[Messiah]] named [[Sabbatai Zevi]] caused turmoil throughout the Turkish Empire with his evangelizing, which attracted thousands of followers. He was eventually captured and exiled to Ulcinj in 1666, where he died quietly ten years later. He was buried in the courtyard of a Muslim house which is still preserved as a mausoleum; along with two Jewish altars in the Bal\u0161ic Tower.<ref name= Rellie/>\n\nIn 1867, Ulcinj became a [[township|kaza]] of the [[Sanjak of Scutari|\u0130\u015fkodra sanjak]] of [[Rumeli]] veyalet. After the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, borders between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire were redrawn, with [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] being ceded to Montenegro. But Muslim Albanian resistance prevented the Montenegrins from taking over Plav and Gusinje, so the Great Powers in 1880 decided to reverse the territorial transfer and offered Ulcinj to Montenegro as compensation.\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\n[[File:Fish-market in Ulcinj (1908).jpg|thumb|Ulcinj fish market in 1908]]\nUlcinj became a part of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] from 1878 until 1918 when Montenegro was absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] for a short time before all would be incorporated into the first of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] federations at the end of the year. Ulcinj remained within a Montenegrin entity whilst a South Slavic state had existed until 2006 when which it became part of an independent Montenegro following a referendum.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Ulcinj survived heavy declines and new ascents. Ulcinj was the second biggest town of Montenegro when it joined the kingdom in 1880. In just three decades, it backslided to 6th place for economic development and number of inhabitants (after Podgorica, Niksic, Cetinje, Tivar and Plava). During World War I Ulcinj was conquered by Austria-Hungary in 1916 and Italy on November 4, 1918,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://augusto.digitpa.gov.it/gazzette/index/download/id/1918261_PM|title=Gazzetta Ufficiale del Regno d'Italia N. 261 del 6 Novembre 1918|last=|first=|date=6 November 1918|work=Gazzetta Ufficiale del Regno d'Italia|accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref> and since 1920 it was part of the Serbo-Croatian-Slovenian Kingdom, later known as the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nAs the southernmost city of the coast of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Ulcinj had a strong turnaround in the 1930s with the development of the tourist industry. At that time hotels were built such as Kri\u0161tja, Republic, Jadran and Koop (later Galeb). \nWorld War II halted economic momentum. From 1941 to 1944, Ulcinj was under the Albanian administration. On November 7, 1943, Ulcinj was bombarded by Allied forces, with over 46 people  killed and many more injured. The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] took Ulcinj on November 26, 1944, and the city become part of [[Socialist Yugoslavia]]. <ref>[[#LTKU-1989|LTKU (1989)]], fq. 46</ref><ref>[http://www.cdm.me/politika/cetkovic-dps-i-forca-hoce-da-brisu-istoriju-ulcinja \u0106etkovi\u0107: DPS i Forca ho\u0107e da bri\u0161u istoriju Ulcinja]</ref><ref>[http://www.visit-ulcinj.com/blog/2014/03/19/ruzna-strana-lepote-ulcinja/ Ru\u017ena strana lepote Ulcinja]</ref>\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s marked the gratest period of economic development for Ulcinj, with the construction of a range of modern hotels in the city and the Great Plain, as well as major economic collectives (NHT \"Riviera of Ulcinj\", \"Agroulqini\", Primary Building Company, \"Otrantkomerc\", \"Ultep\" and others). In the catastrophic earthquake on April 15, 1979, the city was severely damaged, but after only a few years, with the solidarity of the citizens of entire Yugoslavia, it was quickly renovated. Ulcinj at the end of the eighties had about 40 percent of the tourist turnover in Montenegro, while two-thirds of the guests were foreign, mostly German.\n\nDuring the Kosovo War, in 1998 and 1999, thousands of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Ulcinj and its surroundings, where they were welcomed in the best possible conditions by the ethnic Albanian population of Ulcinj and the surrounding area.\n\n== Population ==\n{{Historical populations\n| 1948|4385\n| 1953|4919\n| 1961|5705\n| 1971|7459\n| 1981|9140\n| 1991|10025\n| 2003|10828\n| 2011|10707\n|footnote=\n}}\nUlcinj is the administrative centre of [[Ulcinj Municipality]], which has a population of 19,921.

It is most famous for its sandy beaches.{{fact|date=March 2019}} The most valuable resource of the Ulcinj riviera is [[Velika pla\u017ea]] (Albanian: Plazha e Madhe, English: Long Beach), which is a {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} long stretch of sandy beach and the longest beach on the Montenegrin coast. There is a small pebble beach called [[Ladies Beach, Ulcinj|Ladies Beach]] which folk tradition holds to have qualities conducive to fertility. \n\nThere is also a beach called ''[[Mala Pla\u017ea]]'' (Albanian: Plazha e Vog\u00ebl, English: Small Beach) which is much smaller in size, but is located in the centre of town and very popular with visitors. \"The Korzo\", as it is called by locals, is a [[promenade]] which separates a street lined with coffee shops from Mala pla\u017ea. At night during the summer months, the Korzo is pedestrianised and families and young people gather. There are many more less known smaller beaches that serve as get-aways from the main tourist areas. Ulcinj has also a large number of religious buildings like [[mosques]], [[T\u00fcrbe|tyrbes]] and [[Church (building)|churches]], including: [[Pasha's Mosque]], [[Sailors' Mosque]] and St. Nicholas' Church.\n\nUlcinj's old town is a well preserved [[castle]]-looking community that is left over from medieval times. The old town sits atop a mountain overlooking the shore and is a tourist attraction on its own. [[Ada Bojana]] (Albanian: ''Buna'') is popular among foreign tourists from [[Western Europe]] for its peace and atmosphere.{{fact|date=March 2019}} A large [[naturist]] campsite is located in Ada Bojana. [[Lake \u0160as|\u0160a\u0161ko lake]] and Ulcinj's salt pond are visited by birdwatchers, because Ulcinj and its surroundings are major resting points for over 200 bird species on their migration paths. There are numerous caf\u00e9s, discos, and bars that dot the city that are usually filled to capacity throughout the summer. The majority of tourists that visit Ulcinj are [[Albanians]], Serbians, Croatians, Bosnians, Slovenians, Macedonians, Russians, Ukrainians, and other Europeans.\n{{wide image|Montenegrin South Coast banner.jpg|1000px|Ulcinj Panorama}}\n\n== Education ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"center\" | Montenegrin name\n!align=\"center\" | Albanian name\n!align=\"center\" | Location\n!align=\"center\" | Language(s)\n|-\n|align=\"left\" colspan=4 |'''Elementary schools'''\n|-\n|Osnovna \u0161kola ''\"Bo\u0161ko Strugar\"''\n|Shkolla Fillore  ''\"Boshko Strugar\"''\n|Ulcinj\n| [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] & [[Albanian language|Albanian]]\n|-\n|Osnovna \u0161kola ''\"Mar\u0161al Tito\"''\n|Shkolla Fillore ''\"Marshal Tito\"''\n|Ulcinj\n| Montenegrin & Albanian\n|-\n|Osnovna \u0161kola ''\"Bedri Elezaga\"''\n|Shkolla Fillore ''\"Bedri Elezaga\"''\n|Vladimir\n| Albanian\n|-\n|Osnovna \u0161kola ''\"Marko Nuculovi\u0107\"''\n|Shkolla Fillore ''\"Mark Nuculloviq\"''\n|Donji \u0160toj\n| Montenegrin & Albanian\n|-\n|align=\"left\" colspan=4 |'''High schools'''\n|-\n|Srednja mje\u0161ovita \u0161kola ''\"Bratstvo i jedinstvo\"''\n|Shkolla e Mesme e Kombinuar  ''\"V\u00ebllaz\u00ebrim Bashkim\"''\n|Ulcinj\n| Montenegrin & Albanian\n|-\n|Gimnazija ''\"Drita\"''\n|Gjimnazi ''\"Drita\"''\n|Ulcinj\n|Albanian\n|}\n\n== Sports and recreation==\nThe Ulcinj \"south coast\" region is well known for its active sports, recreation possibilities and hunting .

It consists of one or more [[electrical conductor|conductors]] (commonly multiples of three) suspended by [[Transmission tower|towers]] or [[Utility pole|poles]]. Since most of the [[electrical insulation|insulation]] is provided by air, overhead power lines are generally the lowest-cost method of power transmission for large quantities of electric energy.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u041b\u042d\u041f 330 \u043a\u0412 Crossing electricity pylon 330 kV.jpg|thumb|upright|Overhead powerline [[Dnieper]] crossing, [[Ukraine]]]]\n\nTowers for support of the lines are made of wood either grown or laminated, steel or aluminum (either lattice structures or tubular poles), concrete, and occasionally reinforced plastics.  The bare wire conductors on the line are generally made of aluminum (either plain or [[ACSR|reinforced with steel]] or composite materials such as carbon and glass fiber), though some copper wires are used in medium-voltage distribution and low-voltage connections to customer premises. A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilience to storms, ice loads, earthquakes and other potential damage causes.<ref name=\"Fink78\">[[Donald G.

Structures may be as simple as wood [[Utility pole|poles]] directly set in the earth, carrying one or more cross-arm beams to support conductors, or \"armless\" construction with conductors supported on insulators attached to the side of the pole.  Tubular steel poles are typically used in urban areas.  High-voltage lines are often carried on lattice-type [[Electricity pylon|steel towers]] or pylons. For remote areas, aluminum towers may be placed by [[helicopter]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004113042/http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp|title=Powering Up - Vertical Magazine - The Pulse of the Helicopter Industry|archive-date=4 October 2015|work=verticalmag.com |accessdate=4 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|GBWHUdPQCH8|Sunrise Powerlink Helicopter Operations}}</ref> Concrete poles have also been used.<ref name=Fink78/> Poles made of reinforced plastics are also available, but their high cost restricts application.\n\nEach structure must be designed for the loads imposed on it by the conductors.<ref name=Fink78/> The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. Where conductors are in a straight line, towers need only resist the weight since the tension in the conductors approximately balances with no resultant force on the structure.  Flexible conductors supported at their ends approximate the form of a [[catenary]], and much of the analysis for construction of transmission lines relies on the properties of this form.<ref name=Fink78/>\n\nA large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with \"tangent\" (\"suspension\" or \"line\" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings.  Depending on the design criteria for a particular line, semi-flexible type structures may rely on the weight of the conductors to be balanced on both sides of each tower.  More rigid structures may be intended to remain standing even if one or more conductors is broken.  Such structures may be installed at intervals in power lines to limit the scale of cascading tower failures.<ref name=Fink78/>\n\nFoundations for tower structures may be large and costly, particularly if the ground conditions are poor, such as in wetlands.  Each structure may be stabilized considerably by the use of [[guy wires]] to counteract some of the forces applied by the conductors.\n[[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|low-profile power lines near an [[airfield]]]]\nPower lines and supporting structures can be a form of [[visual pollution]]. In some cases the lines are buried to avoid this, but this \"[[undergrounding]]\" is more expensive and therefore not common.\n\nFor a single wood [[utility pole]] structure, a pole is placed in the ground, then three crossarms extend from this, either staggered or all to one side. The insulators are attached to the crossarms. For an \"H\"-type wood pole structure, two poles are placed in the ground, then a crossbar is placed on top of these, extending to both sides. The insulators are attached at the ends and in the middle. [[Lattice tower]] structures have two common forms. One has a pyramidal base, then a vertical section, where three crossarms extend out, typically staggered. The [[strain insulator]]s are attached to the crossarms. Another has a pyramidal base, which extends to four support points. On top of this a horizontal truss-like structure is placed.\n\nA grounded wire is sometimes strung along the tops of the towers to provide lightning protection. An [[optical ground wire]] is a more advanced version with embedded [[optical fiber]]s for communication. [[Overhead wire marker]]s can be mounted on the ground wire to meet [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avaids.com/icao.pdf|title=Chapter 6.

For a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] system, this implies that each tower supports three conductors.\n\nA ''double-circuit transmission line''  has two circuits. For three-phase systems, each tower supports and insulates six conductors. Single phase AC-power lines as used for [[Railway electrification system|traction current]] have four conductors for two circuits. Usually both circuits operate at the same voltage.\n\nIn HVDC systems typically two conductors are carried per line, but in rare cases only one pole of the system is carried on a set of towers.\n\nIn some countries, such as Germany, most power lines with voltages above 100 kV are implemented as double, quadruple or in rare cases even hextuple power line as [[rights of way]] are rare. Sometimes all conductors are installed with the erection of the pylons; often some circuits are installed later. A disadvantage of double circuit transmission lines is that maintenance can be difficult, as either work in close proximity of high voltage or switch-off of two circuits is required.  In case of failure, both systems can be affected.\n\nThe largest double-circuit transmission line is the [[Kita-Iwaki Powerline]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"230\" heights=\"230\">\nFile:\u041e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u041b\u042d\u041f 330\u043a\u0412.jpg|A single-circuit 330 kV line\nFile:Anchor tower of overhead powerline.jpg|A double-circuit 35 kV line in [[Dnipro]]\nFile:Pyl\u00f4ne haute tension.JPG|A double-circuit line in [[Montreal]]\nFile:Img0289SCE 500kV lines close.JPG|Parallel single-circuit lines\nFile:Hamilton Beach Pylon (2).JPG|Four circuits on one tower line\nFile:Wernau Double Pylon1.JPG|Six circuits of three different types\nFile:Stromtrasse bei Mannheim-Seckenheim.jpg|Various powerlines (110/220 kV) in [[Germany]] with double and quadruple circuits\nFile:Pylon in the wind.jpg|The effects of wind on a pylon, as seen through the angle of the conductors.\n</gallery>\n\n==Insulators==\n[[File:Power line with ceramic insulators.jpg|thumb|Medium-voltage power lines with ceramic insulators in California]]\n[[File:Pylon.detail.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Modular suspension insulators are used for high-voltage lines.]]\n[[Electrical insulation#High-voltage insulators|Insulators]] must support the conductors and withstand both the normal operating voltage and surges due to switching and [[lightning]].  Insulators are broadly classified as either pin-type,  which support the conductor above the structure, or suspension type, where the conductor hangs below the structure. The invention of the [[strain insulator]] was a critical factor in allowing higher voltages to be used.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the limited electrical strength of [[telegraph]]-style [[pin insulator]]s limited the voltage to no more than 69,000 [[volt]]s. Up to about 33 kV (69 kV in North America) both types are commonly used.<ref name=Fink78/> At higher voltages only suspension-type insulators are common for overhead conductors.\n\nInsulators are usually made of wet-process [[porcelain]] or [[toughened glass]], with increasing use of glass-reinforced polymer insulators. However, with rising voltage levels, polymer insulators ([[silicone rubber]] based) are seeing increasing usage.<ref>[http://www.ngk-locke.com/polymer.html NGK-Locke] Polymer insulator manufacturer</ref> China has already developed polymer insulators having a highest system voltage of 1100 kV and India is currently developing a 1200 kV (highest system voltage) line which will initially be charged with 400 kV to be upgraded to a 1200 kV line.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldenergynews.com/news/abb-energizes-transformer-record-mln-volts-651995 |title=ABB Energizes Transformer At Record 1.2 Mln Volts|work=World Energy News|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nSuspension insulators are made of multiple units, with the number of unit insulator disks increasing at higher voltages.  The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand  requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. In cases where these conditions are suboptimal, longer insulators must be used. Longer insulators with longer creepage distance for leakage current, are required in these cases. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.<ref>[http://www.arp-hivoltageinsulators.com/suspension-insulators.html Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators]</ref>\n\nPorcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator.  This warms the surface slightly and reduces the effect of fog and dirt accumulation.  The semiconducting glaze also ensures a more even distribution of voltage along the length of the chain of insulator units.\n\nPolymer insulators by nature have hydrophobic characteristics providing for improved wet performance. Also, studies have shown that the specific creepage distance required in polymer insulators is much lower than that required in porcelain or glass. Additionally, the mass of polymer insulators (especially in higher voltages) is approximately 50% to 30% less than that of a comparative porcelain or glass string. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators.\n\nInsulators for very high voltages, exceeding 200 kV, may have [[grading ring]]s installed at their terminals.  This improves the electric field distribution around the insulator and makes it more resistant to flash-over during voltage surges.\n\n==Conductors==\n[[File:Sample cross-section of high tension power (pylon) line.jpg|thumb|Sample cross-section of ACSR power line]]\n\nThe most common conductor in use for transmission today is [[Aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable|aluminum conductor steel reinforced]] (ACSR). Also seeing much use is [[all-aluminum-alloy conductor]] (AAAC). Aluminum is used because it has about half the weight and lower cost of a comparable resistance copper cable.  It does, however, require a larger diameter than copper because of lower [[specific conductivity]]<ref name=Fink78/>. \nCopper was more popular in the past and is still in use, especially at lower voltages and for grounding.\n\nWhile larger conductors lose less energy because of their lower [[electrical resistance]], they cost more than smaller conductors.  An optimization rule called ''[[Lord Kelvin|Kelvin's Law]]'' states that the optimum size of conductor for a line is found when the cost of the energy wasted in a smaller conductor is equal to the annual interest paid on that additional cost of the line construction for a larger conductor. The optimization problem is made more complex by additional factors such as varying annual load, varying cost of installation, and the discrete sizes of cable that are commonly made.<ref name=Fink78/>\n\nSince a conductor is a flexible object with uniform weight per unit length, the shape of a conductor hanging between two towers approximates that of a [[catenary]]. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. A minimum overhead clearance must be maintained for safety. Since the length of the conductor increases with increasing heat produced by the current through it, it is sometimes possible to increase the power handling capacity (uprate) by changing the conductors for a type with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] or a higher allowable [[operating temperature]].\n\n[[File:ACSR and ACCC.JPG|thumb|Conventional ACSR (left) and modern carbon core (right) conductors]]\n\nTwo such conductors that offer reduced thermal sag are known as composite core conductors (ACCR and [[ACCC conductor]]).  In lieu of steel core strands that are often used to increase overall conductor strength, the ACCC conductor uses a carbon and glass fiber core that offers a coefficient of thermal expansion about 1/10 of that of steel.  While the composite core is nonconductive, it is substantially lighter and stronger than steel, which allows the incorporation of 28% more aluminum (using compact trapezoidal-shaped strands) without any diameter or weight penalty.  The added aluminum content helps reduce line losses by 25 to 40% compared to other conductors of the same diameter and weight, depending upon electric current.  The carbon core conductor's reduced thermal sag allows it to carry up to twice the current (\"ampacity\") compared to all-aluminum conductor (AAC) or ACSR.\n\nThe power lines and their surroundings must be [[Live-line working|maintained]] by [[Lineman (technician)|linemen]], sometimes assisted by [[helicopter]]s with [[pressure washer]]s or [[circular saw]]s which may work three times faster. However this work often occurs in the dangerous areas of the [[Helicopter height\u2013velocity diagram]],<ref name=vert2015-04>{{cite news |first=Elan |last=Head |url=http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/82.html |title=High-value cargo |pages=80\u201390 |work=Vertical Magazine |date=April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419023320/http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/82.html |archive-date=19 April 2015 |df= }}</ref><ref name=vert2015-04b>{{cite news |first=Guy R. |last=Maher |url=http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/94.html |title=A cut above |pages=92\u201398 |work=Vertical Magazine |date=April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160639/http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/ACutAbove |archive-date=12 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Harnesk, Tommy. \"[http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/fordon_motor/flygplan/article3874611.ece Helikoptermonterad motors\u00e5g snabbkapar tr\u00e4den]\" ''[[Ny Teknik]]'', 9 January 2015.

Transmission higher than 132&nbsp;kV poses the problem of [[corona discharge]], which causes significant power loss and interference with communication circuits. To reduce this corona effect, it is preferable to use more than one conductor per phase, or bundled conductors.<ref name=\"Grainger, John J 1994\">Grainger, John J. and W. D. Stevenson Jr. Power System Analysis and Design, 2nd edition. McGraw Hill (1994).</ref> In addition to reducing corona, audible and radio noise (and associated electrical losses), bundled conductors also increase the amount of current that can be carried compared to a single conductor of equal aluminum content due to the [[skin effect]] (for AC lines).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://studyelectrical.com/2019/01/bundled-conductors.html|title=Bundled Conductors in Transmission Lines|date=2019-01-13|website=StudyElectrical.Com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>\n\nBundle conductors consist of several parallel cables connected at intervals by spacers, often in a cylindrical configuration. The optimum number of conductors depends on the current rating, but typically higher-voltage lines also have higher current. [[American Electric Power]]<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/six-wire-solution |title=Six Wire Solution] |journal=Transmission & Distribution World |first=Bruce |last=Freimark |date=October 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2007}}</ref> is building 765&nbsp;kV lines using six conductors per phase in a bundle. Spacers must resist the forces due to wind, and magnetic forces during a short-circuit.\n\n[[File:Spacer damper for four-conductor bundles.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spacer damper for four-conductor bundles]]\n[[File:Pyl\u00f4ne_\u00e9lectrique_d\u00e9tail_2011-4.JPG|thumb|Bundle conductor attachment]]\n\nBundled conductors reduce the voltage gradient in the vicinity of the line. This reduces the possibility of corona discharge. At [[extra high voltage]], the electric field [[gradient]] at the surface of a single conductor is high enough to ionize air, which wastes power, generates unwanted audible noise and [[Electromagnetic interference|interferes]] with [[communication system]]s.  The field surrounding a bundle of conductors is similar to the field that would surround a single, very large conductor\u2014this produces lower gradients which mitigates issues associated with high field strength. The transmission efficiency is improved as loss due to corona effect is countered.\n\nBundled conductors cool themselves more efficiently due to the increased surface area of the conductors, further reducing line losses. When transmitting alternating current, bundle conductors also avoid the reduction in [[ampacity]] of a single large conductor due to the skin effect. A bundle conductor also has lower [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], compared to a single conductor.\n\nWhile wind resistance is higher, wind-induced oscillation can be damped at bundle spacers. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors. [https://studyelectrical.com/2019/07/aeolian-vibration-of-transmission-conductors.html Aeolian vibration] is generally less pronounced on bundled conductors due to the effect of spacers and spacer dampers installed at relatively close intervals along the line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://studyelectrical.com/2019/01/bundled-conductors.html|title=Bundled Conductors in Transmission Lines|date=2019-01-13|website=StudyElectrical.Com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n===Ground wires===\n[[File:Al OC.jpg|thumb|Aluminum conductor crosslinked polyethylene insulation wire. It is used for 6600V power lines.]]\nOverhead power lines are often equipped with a ground conductor (shield wire, static wire, or overhead earth wire). The ground conductor is usually grounded (earthed) at the top of the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Art and Science of Lightning Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KO7fVcqispQC&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In circuits with [[earthed neutral]], it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two ground conductors. These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use [[surge arrester]]s every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. Shield wires on transmission lines may include optical fibers ([[optical ground wire]]s/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system.\n\n[[File:Fenno-Skan HVDC power line.jpg|thumb|HVDC Fenno-Skan with ground wires used as electrode line]]\nAt some HVDC converter stations, the ground wire is used also as the electrode line to connect to a distant grounding electrode. This allows the HVDC system to use the earth as one conductor. The ground conductor is mounted on small insulators bridged by lightning arrestors above the phase conductors. The insulation prevents electrochemical corrosion of the pylon.\n\nMedium-voltage distribution lines may also use one or two shield wires, or may have the grounded conductor strung below the phase conductors to provide some measure of protection against tall vehicles or equipment touching the energized line, as well as to provide a neutral line in Wye wired systems.\n\nOn some power lines for very high voltages in the former Soviet Union, the ground wire is used for [[Power-line communication|PLC-radio]] systems and mounted on insulators at the pylons.\n\n===Insulated conductors and cable===\nOverhead insulated cables are rarely used, usually for short distances (less than a kilometer). Insulated cables can be directly fastened to structures without insulating supports.  An overhead line with bare conductors insulated by air is typically less costly than a cable with insulated conductors.\n\nA more common approach is \"covered\" line wire. It is treated as bare cable, but often is safer for wildlife, as the insulation on the cables increases the likelihood of a large-wing-span raptor to survive a brush with the lines, and reduces the overall danger of the lines slightly. These types of lines are often seen in the eastern United States and in heavily wooded areas, where tree-line contact is likely. The only pitfall is cost, as insulated wire is often costlier than its bare counterpart. Many utility companies implement covered line wire as jumper material where the wires are often closer to each other on the pole, such as an underground riser/[[pothead]],<!--not [[Cannabis smoking]]--> and on reclosers, cutouts and the like.\n\n==Compact transmission lines==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:\u0e16.\u0e01\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e27 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Medium-voltage compact overhead power line mounted on a concrete pole in Thailand. The appearance is similar to a bundle conductor, but this line consists of three conductors, which are attached to a single, cross-shaped porcellain insulator.]]\nA compact overhead transmission line requires a smaller right of way than a standard overhead powerline. Conductors must not get too close to each other. This can be achieved either by short span lengths and insulating crossbars, or by separating the conductors in the span with insulators. The first type is easier to build as it does not require insulators in the span, which may be difficult to install and to maintain.\n\nExamples of compact lines are:\n* [[Lutsk compact overhead powerline]] {{coord|50.774673|N|25.385215|E|type:landmark|name=Startpoint of Lutsk Compact Overhead Powerline}}\n* [[Hilpertsau-Weisenbach compact overhead line]] {{coord|48.737898|N|8.355660|E|type:landmark|name=Startpoint of Hilpertsau-Weisenbach Powerline}}\n\nCompact transmission lines may be designed for voltage upgrade of existing lines to increase the power that can be transmitted on an existing right of way.<ref>Beaty, H. Wayne; Fink, Donald G. , ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th Edition)''\nMcGraw-Hill, 2007  978-0-07-144146-9 pages 14-105 through 14-106</ref>\n\n==Low voltage==\n[[File:ABC TQ3157 064.JPG|thumb|Aerial bundled cable in [[Old Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]]]]\nLow voltage overhead lines may use either bare conductors carried on glass or ceramic insulators or an [[aerial bundled cable]] system. The number of conductors may be anywhere between two (most likely a phase and neutral) up to as many as six (three phase conductors, separate neutral and earth plus street lighting supplied by a common switch); a common case is four (three phase and neutral, where the neutral might also serve as a protective earthing conductor).\n\n==Train power==\n{{main|Overhead line}}\n\nOverhead lines or overhead wires are used to transmit electrical energy to trams, trolleybuses or trains. Overhead line is designed on the principle of one or more overhead wires situated over rail tracks. Feeder stations at regular intervals along the overhead line supply power from the high-voltage grid. For some cases low-frequency AC is used, and distributed by a special [[traction current]] network.\n\n==Further applications==\nOverhead lines are also occasionally used to supply transmitting antennas, especially for efficient transmission of long, medium and short waves. For this purpose a staggered array line is often used. Along a staggered array line the conductor cables for the supply of the earth net of the transmitting antenna are attached on the exterior of a ring, while the conductor inside the ring, is fastened to insulators leading to the high-voltage standing feeder of the antenna.\n\n==Use of area under overhead power lines==\nUse of the area below an overhead line is limited because objects must not come too close to the energized conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Radio reception can be impaired under a power line, due both to shielding of a receiver antenna by the overhead conductors, and by partial discharge at insulators and sharp points of the conductors which creates radio noise.\n\nIn the area surrounding the overhead lines, it is dangerous to risk interference, e.g. flying kites or balloons, using ladders, or operating machinery.\n\nOverhead distribution and transmission lines near [[airfield]]s are often marked on maps, and the lines themselves marked with conspicuous plastic reflectors, to warn pilots of the presence of conductors.\n\nConstruction of overhead power lines, especially in [[wilderness area]]s, may have significant [[human impact on the environment|environmental effects]]. Environmental studies for such projects may consider the effect of [[clearing (geography)|bush clearing]], changed migration routes for migratory animals, possible access by predators and humans along transmission corridors, disturbances of fish habitat at stream crossings, and other effects.\n\n[[Linear park]]s may occupy the area under overhead power lines.\n\n==Aviation accidents ==\n[[File:High voltage transmission line aviation obstruction marker.jpg|thumb|An aviation obstruction marker on a high-voltage overhead transmission line reminds pilots of the presence of an overhead line. Some markers are lit at night or have strobe lights.]]\n[[File:Power line 1150 kV.jpg|thumb|The [[Ekibastuz\u2013Kokshetau high-voltage line]] in [[Kazakhstan]]. It was the first commercially used power line which operated at 1150 kV, the highest transmission line voltage in the world.]]\n\nGeneral aviation, hang gliding, paragliding, skydiving, balloon, and kite flying must avoid accidental contact with power lines. Nearly every kite product warns users to stay away from power lines. Deaths occur when aircraft crash into power lines. Some power lines are marked with obstruction makers, especially near air strips or over waterways that may support floatplane operations. The placement of power lines sometimes use up sites that would otherwise be used by hang gliders.<ref>[http://retasite.wordpress.com/2014/09/10/aircraft-accidents-due-to-overhead-power-lines-updated/ Aircraft Accidents Due to Overhead Power Lines]</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Pacific+Gas+and+Electric+Company+Reminds+Customers+About+Flying+Kites...-a084267973 Pacific Gas and Electric Company Reminds Customers About Flying Kites Safely.]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first transmission of electrical impulses over an extended distance was demonstrated on July 14, 1729 by the physicist [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The demonstration used damp hemp cords suspended by silk threads (the low resistance of metallic conductors not being appreciated at the time).\n\nHowever the first practical use of overhead lines was in the context of [[electrical telegraph|telegraphy]]. By 1837 experimental commercial telegraph systems ran as far as  20&nbsp;km (13 miles).   Electric power transmission was accomplished in 1882 with the first high-voltage transmission between [[Miesbach\u2013Munich Power Transmission|Munich and Miesbach]] (60&nbsp;km). 1891 saw the construction of the first three-phase [[alternating current]] overhead line on the occasion of the International Electricity Exhibition in [[Frankfurt]], between [[Lauffen]] and Frankfurt.\n\nIn 1912 the first 110 kV-overhead power line entered service followed by the first 220 kV-overhead power line in 1923. In the 1920s [[RWE]] AG built the first overhead line for this voltage and in 1926 built a [[Rhine]] crossing with the pylons of [[Voerde]], two masts 138 meters high.\n\n<!-- Milestones of years and voltages table here -->\nIn 1953, the first 345 kV line was put into service by [[American Electric Power]] in the [[United States]]. In Germany in 1957 the first 380 kV overhead power line was commissioned (between the transformer station and Rommerskirchen). In the same year the overhead line traversing of the Strait of Messina went into service in Italy, whose [[Pylons of Messina|pylons]] served the Elbe crossing 1. This was used as the model for the building of the Elbe crossing 2 in the second half of the 1970s which saw the construction of the highest overhead line pylons of the world. Earlier, in 1952, the first 380 kV line was put into service in [[Sweden]], in 1000&nbsp;km (625 miles) between the more populated areas in the south and the largest hydroelectric power stations in the north.\nStarting from 1967 in Russia, and also in the US and Canada, overhead lines for voltage of 765 kV were built. In 1982 overhead power lines were built in Soviet Union between [[Elektrostal]] and the power station at [[Ekibastuz]], this was a three-phase alternating current line at 1150 kV ([[Powerline Ekibastuz-Kokshetau]]). In 1999, in Japan the first powerline designed for 1000 kV with 2 circuits were built, the [[Kita-Iwaki Powerline]]. In 2003 the building of the highest overhead line commenced in China, the [[Yangtze River Crossing]].\n\n==Mathematical analysis==\nAn overhead power line is one example of a [[transmission line]]. At power system frequencies, many useful simplifications can be made for lines of typical lengths. For analysis of power systems, the distributed resistance, series inductance, shunt leakage resistance and shunt capacitance can be replaced with suitable lumped values or simplified networks.\n\n===Short and medium line model===\nA short length of a power line (less than 80&nbsp;km) can be approximated with a resistance in series with an inductance and ignoring the shunt admittances. This value is not the total impedance of the line, but rather the series impedance per unit length of line. For a longer length of line (80\u2013250&nbsp;km), a shunt capacitance is added to the model. In this case it is common to distribute half of the total capacitance to each side of the line. As a result, the power line can be represented as a [[two-port network]], such as with ABCD parameters.<ref name=Glover21>J. Glover, M. Sarma, and T.

Structures may be as simple as wood [[Utility pole|poles]] directly set in the earth, carrying one or more cross-arm beams to support conductors, or \"armless\" construction with conductors supported on insulators attached to the side of the pole.  Tubular steel poles are typically used in urban areas.  High-voltage lines are often carried on lattice-type [[Electricity pylon|steel towers]] or pylons. For remote areas, aluminum towers may be placed by [[helicopter]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004113042/http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp|title=Powering Up - Vertical Magazine - The Pulse of the Helicopter Industry|archive-date=4 October 2015|work=verticalmag.com |accessdate=4 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|GBWHUdPQCH8|Sunrise Powerlink Helicopter Operations}}</ref> Concrete poles have also been used.<ref name=Fink78/> Poles made of reinforced plastics are also available, but their high cost restricts application.\n\nEach structure must be designed for the loads imposed on it by the conductors.<ref name=Fink78/> The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. Where conductors are in a straight line, towers need only resist the weight since the tension in the conductors approximately balances with no resultant force on the structure.  Flexible conductors supported at their ends approximate the form of a [[catenary]], and much of the analysis for construction of transmission lines relies on the properties of this form.<ref name=Fink78/>\n\nA large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with \"tangent\" (\"suspension\" or \"line\" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings.  Depending on the design criteria for a particular line, semi-flexible type structures may rely on the weight of the conductors to be balanced on both sides of each tower.  More rigid structures may be intended to remain standing even if one or more conductors is broken.  Such structures may be installed at intervals in power lines to limit the scale of cascading tower failures.<ref name=Fink78/>\n\nFoundations for tower structures may be large and costly, particularly if the ground conditions are poor, such as in wetlands.  Each structure may be stabilized considerably by the use of [[guy wires]] to counteract some of the forces applied by the conductors.\n[[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|low-profile power lines near an [[airfield]]]]\nPower lines and supporting structures can be a form of [[visual pollution]]. In some cases the lines are buried to avoid this, but this \"[[undergrounding]]\" is more expensive and therefore not common.\n\nFor a single wood [[utility pole]] structure, a pole is placed in the ground, then three crossarms extend from this, either staggered or all to one side. The insulators are attached to the crossarms. For an \"H\"-type wood pole structure, two poles are placed in the ground, then a crossbar is placed on top of these, extending to both sides. The insulators are attached at the ends and in the middle. [[Lattice tower]] structures have two common forms. One has a pyramidal base, then a vertical section, where three crossarms extend out, typically staggered. The [[strain insulator]]s are attached to the crossarms. Another has a pyramidal base, which extends to four support points. On top of this a horizontal truss-like structure is placed.\n\nA grounded wire is sometimes strung along the tops of the towers to provide lightning protection. An [[optical ground wire]] is a more advanced version with embedded [[optical fiber]]s for communication. [[Overhead wire marker]]s can be mounted on the ground wire to meet [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avaids.com/icao.pdf|title=Chapter 6.

For a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] system, this implies that each tower supports three conductors.\n\nA ''double-circuit transmission line''  has two circuits. For three-phase systems, each tower supports and insulates six conductors. Single phase AC-power lines as used for [[Railway electrification system|traction current]] have four conductors for two circuits. Usually both circuits operate at the same voltage.\n\nIn HVDC systems typically two conductors are carried per line, but in rare cases only one pole of the system is carried on a set of towers.\n\nIn some countries, such as Germany, most power lines with voltages above 100 kV are implemented as double, quadruple or in rare cases even hextuple power line as [[rights of way]] are rare. Sometimes all conductors are installed with the erection of the pylons; often some circuits are installed later. A disadvantage of double circuit transmission lines is that maintenance can be difficult, as either work in close proximity of high voltage or switch-off of two circuits is required.  In case of failure, both systems can be affected.\n\nThe largest double-circuit transmission line is the [[Kita-Iwaki Powerline]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"230\" heights=\"230\">\nFile:\u041e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u041b\u042d\u041f 330\u043a\u0412.jpg|A single-circuit 330 kV line\nFile:Anchor tower of overhead powerline.jpg|A double-circuit 35 kV line in [[Dnipro]]\nFile:Pyl\u00f4ne haute tension.JPG|A double-circuit line in [[Montreal]]\nFile:Img0289SCE 500kV lines close.JPG|Parallel single-circuit lines\nFile:Hamilton Beach Pylon (2).JPG|Four circuits on one tower line\nFile:Wernau Double Pylon1.JPG|Six circuits of three different types\nFile:Stromtrasse bei Mannheim-Seckenheim.jpg|Various powerlines (110/220 kV) in [[Germany]] with double and quadruple circuits\nFile:Pylon in the wind.jpg|The effects of wind on a pylon, as seen through the angle of the conductors.\n</gallery>\n\n==Insulators==\n[[File:Power line with ceramic insulators.jpg|thumb|Medium-voltage power lines with ceramic insulators in California]]\n[[File:Pylon.detail.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Modular suspension insulators are used for high-voltage lines.]]\n[[Electrical insulation#High-voltage insulators|Insulators]] must support the conductors and withstand both the normal operating voltage and surges due to switching and [[lightning]].  Insulators are broadly classified as either pin-type,  which support the conductor above the structure, or suspension type, where the conductor hangs below the structure. The invention of the [[strain insulator]] was a critical factor in allowing higher voltages to be used.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the limited electrical strength of [[telegraph]]-style [[pin insulator]]s limited the voltage to no more than 69,000 [[volt]]s. Up to about 33 kV (69 kV in North America) both types are commonly used.<ref name=Fink78/> At higher voltages only suspension-type insulators are common for overhead conductors.\n\nInsulators are usually made of wet-process [[porcelain]] or [[toughened glass]], with increasing use of glass-reinforced polymer insulators. However, with rising voltage levels, polymer insulators ([[silicone rubber]] based) are seeing increasing usage.<ref>[http://www.ngk-locke.com/polymer.html NGK-Locke] Polymer insulator manufacturer</ref> China has already developed polymer insulators having a highest system voltage of 1100 kV and India is currently developing a 1200 kV (highest system voltage) line which will initially be charged with 400 kV to be upgraded to a 1200 kV line.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldenergynews.com/news/abb-energizes-transformer-record-mln-volts-651995 |title=ABB Energizes Transformer At Record 1.2 Mln Volts|work=World Energy News|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nSuspension insulators are made of multiple units, with the number of unit insulator disks increasing at higher voltages.  The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand  requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. In cases where these conditions are suboptimal, longer insulators must be used. Longer insulators with longer creepage distance for leakage current, are required in these cases. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.<ref>[http://www.arp-hivoltageinsulators.com/suspension-insulators.html Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators]</ref>\n\nPorcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator.  This warms the surface slightly and reduces the effect of fog and dirt accumulation.  The semiconducting glaze also ensures a more even distribution of voltage along the length of the chain of insulator units.\n\nPolymer insulators by nature have hydrophobic characteristics providing for improved wet performance. Also, studies have shown that the specific creepage distance required in polymer insulators is much lower than that required in porcelain or glass. Additionally, the mass of polymer insulators (especially in higher voltages) is approximately 50% to 30% less than that of a comparative porcelain or glass string. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators.\n\nInsulators for very high voltages, exceeding 200 kV, may have [[grading ring]]s installed at their terminals.  This improves the electric field distribution around the insulator and makes it more resistant to flash-over during voltage surges.\n\n==Conductors==\n[[File:Sample cross-section of high tension power (pylon) line.jpg|thumb|Sample cross-section of ACSR power line]]\n\nThe most common conductor in use for transmission today is [[Aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable|aluminum conductor steel reinforced]] (ACSR). Also seeing much use is [[all-aluminum-alloy conductor]] (AAAC). Aluminum is used because it has about half the weight and lower cost of a comparable resistance copper cable.  It does, however, require a larger diameter than copper because of lower [[specific conductivity]]<ref name=Fink78/>. \nCopper was more popular in the past and is still in use, especially at lower voltages and for grounding.\n\nWhile larger conductors lose less energy because of their lower [[electrical resistance]], they cost more than smaller conductors.  An optimization rule called ''[[Lord Kelvin|Kelvin's Law]]'' states that the optimum size of conductor for a line is found when the cost of the energy wasted in a smaller conductor is equal to the annual interest paid on that additional cost of the line construction for a larger conductor. The optimization problem is made more complex by additional factors such as varying annual load, varying cost of installation, and the discrete sizes of cable that are commonly made.<ref name=Fink78/>\n\nSince a conductor is a flexible object with uniform weight per unit length, the shape of a conductor hanging between two towers approximates that of a [[catenary]]. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. A minimum overhead clearance must be maintained for safety. Since the length of the conductor increases with increasing heat produced by the current through it, it is sometimes possible to increase the power handling capacity (uprate) by changing the conductors for a type with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] or a higher allowable [[operating temperature]].\n\n[[File:ACSR and ACCC.JPG|thumb|Conventional ACSR (left) and modern carbon core (right) conductors]]\n\nTwo such conductors that offer reduced thermal sag are known as composite core conductors (ACCR and [[ACCC conductor]]).  In lieu of steel core strands that are often used to increase overall conductor strength, the ACCC conductor uses a carbon and glass fiber core that offers a coefficient of thermal expansion about 1/10 of that of steel.  While the composite core is nonconductive, it is substantially lighter and stronger than steel, which allows the incorporation of 28% more aluminum (using compact trapezoidal-shaped strands) without any diameter or weight penalty.  The added aluminum content helps reduce line losses by 25 to 40% compared to other conductors of the same diameter and weight, depending upon electric current.  The carbon core conductor's reduced thermal sag allows it to carry up to twice the current (\"ampacity\") compared to all-aluminum conductor (AAC) or ACSR.\n\nThe power lines and their surroundings must be [[Live-line working|maintained]] by [[Lineman (technician)|linemen]], sometimes assisted by [[helicopter]]s with [[pressure washer]]s or [[circular saw]]s which may work three times faster.

Transmission higher than 132&nbsp;kV poses the problem of [[corona discharge]], which causes significant power loss and interference with communication circuits. To reduce this corona effect, it is preferable to use more than one conductor per phase, or bundled conductors.<ref name=\"Grainger, John J 1994\">Grainger, John J. and W. D. Stevenson Jr. Power System Analysis and Design, 2nd edition. McGraw Hill (1994).</ref> In addition to reducing corona, audible and radio noise (and associated electrical losses), bundled conductors also increase the amount of current that can be carried compared to a single conductor of equal aluminum content due to the [[skin effect]] (for AC lines).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://studyelectrical.com/2019/01/bundled-conductors.html|title=Bundled Conductors in Transmission Lines|date=2019-01-13|website=StudyElectrical.Com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>\n\nBundle conductors consist of several parallel cables connected at intervals by spacers, often in a cylindrical configuration. The optimum number of conductors depends on the current rating, but typically higher-voltage lines also have higher current. [[American Electric Power]]<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/six-wire-solution |title=Six Wire Solution] |journal=Transmission & Distribution World |first=Bruce |last=Freimark |date=October 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2007}}</ref> is building 765&nbsp;kV lines using six conductors per phase in a bundle. Spacers must resist the forces due to wind, and magnetic forces during a short-circuit.\n\n[[File:Spacer damper for four-conductor bundles.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spacer damper for four-conductor bundles]]\n[[File:Pyl\u00f4ne_\u00e9lectrique_d\u00e9tail_2011-4.JPG|thumb|Bundle conductor attachment]]\n\nBundled conductors reduce the voltage gradient in the vicinity of the line. This reduces the possibility of corona discharge. At [[extra high voltage]], the electric field [[gradient]] at the surface of a single conductor is high enough to ionize air, which wastes power, generates unwanted audible noise and [[Electromagnetic interference|interferes]] with [[communication system]]s.  The field surrounding a bundle of conductors is similar to the field that would surround a single, very large conductor\u2014this produces lower gradients which mitigates issues associated with high field strength. The transmission efficiency is improved as loss due to corona effect is countered.\n\nBundled conductors cool themselves more efficiently due to the increased surface area of the conductors, further reducing line losses. When transmitting alternating current, bundle conductors also avoid the reduction in [[ampacity]] of a single large conductor due to the skin effect. A bundle conductor also has lower [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], compared to a single conductor.\n\nWhile wind resistance is higher, wind-induced oscillation can be damped at bundle spacers. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors. [https://studyelectrical.com/2019/07/aeolian-vibration-of-transmission-conductors.html Aeolian vibration] is generally less pronounced on bundled conductors due to the effect of spacers and spacer dampers installed at relatively close intervals along the line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://studyelectrical.com/2019/01/bundled-conductors.html|title=Bundled Conductors in Transmission Lines|date=2019-01-13|website=StudyElectrical.Com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n===Ground wires===\n[[File:Al OC.jpg|thumb|Aluminum conductor crosslinked polyethylene insulation wire. It is used for 6600V power lines.]]\nOverhead power lines are often equipped with a ground conductor (shield wire, static wire, or overhead earth wire). The ground conductor is usually grounded (earthed) at the top of the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Art and Science of Lightning Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KO7fVcqispQC&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In circuits with [[earthed neutral]], it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two ground conductors. These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use [[surge arrester]]s every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. Shield wires on transmission lines may include optical fibers ([[optical ground wire]]s/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system.\n\n[[File:Fenno-Skan HVDC power line.jpg|thumb|HVDC Fenno-Skan with ground wires used as electrode line]]\nAt some HVDC converter stations, the ground wire is used also as the electrode line to connect to a distant grounding electrode. This allows the HVDC system to use the earth as one conductor. The ground conductor is mounted on small insulators bridged by lightning arrestors above the phase conductors. The insulation prevents electrochemical corrosion of the pylon.\n\nMedium-voltage distribution lines may also use one or two shield wires, or may have the grounded conductor strung below the phase conductors to provide some measure of protection against tall vehicles or equipment touching the energized line, as well as to provide a neutral line in Wye wired systems.\n\nOn some power lines for very high voltages in the former Soviet Union, the ground wire is used for [[Power-line communication|PLC-radio]] systems and mounted on insulators at the pylons.\n\n===Insulated conductors and cable===\nOverhead insulated cables are rarely used, usually for short distances (less than a kilometer). Insulated cables can be directly fastened to structures without insulating supports.  An overhead line with bare conductors insulated by air is typically less costly than a cable with insulated conductors.\n\nA more common approach is \"covered\" line wire. It is treated as bare cable, but often is safer for wildlife, as the insulation on the cables increases the likelihood of a large-wing-span raptor to survive a brush with the lines, and reduces the overall danger of the lines slightly. These types of lines are often seen in the eastern United States and in heavily wooded areas, where tree-line contact is likely. The only pitfall is cost, as insulated wire is often costlier than its bare counterpart. Many utility companies implement covered line wire as jumper material where the wires are often closer to each other on the pole, such as an underground riser/[[pothead]],<!--not [[Cannabis smoking]]--> and on reclosers, cutouts and the like.\n\n==Compact transmission lines==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:\u0e16.\u0e01\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e27 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Medium-voltage compact overhead power line mounted on a concrete pole in Thailand. The appearance is similar to a bundle conductor, but this line consists of three conductors, which are attached to a single, cross-shaped porcellain insulator.]]\nA compact overhead transmission line requires a smaller right of way than a standard overhead powerline. Conductors must not get too close to each other. This can be achieved either by short span lengths and insulating crossbars, or by separating the conductors in the span with insulators. The first type is easier to build as it does not require insulators in the span, which may be difficult to install and to maintain.\n\nExamples of compact lines are:\n* [[Lutsk compact overhead powerline]] {{coord|50.774673|N|25.385215|E|type:landmark|name=Startpoint of Lutsk Compact Overhead Powerline}}\n* [[Hilpertsau-Weisenbach compact overhead line]] {{coord|48.737898|N|8.355660|E|type:landmark|name=Startpoint of Hilpertsau-Weisenbach Powerline}}\n\nCompact transmission lines may be designed for voltage upgrade of existing lines to increase the power that can be transmitted on an existing right of way.<ref>Beaty, H. Wayne; Fink, Donald G. , ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th Edition)''\nMcGraw-Hill, 2007  978-0-07-144146-9 pages 14-105 through 14-106</ref>\n\n==Low voltage==\n[[File:ABC TQ3157 064.JPG|thumb|Aerial bundled cable in [[Old Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]]]]\nLow voltage overhead lines may use either bare conductors carried on glass or ceramic insulators or an [[aerial bundled cable]] system. The number of conductors may be anywhere between two (most likely a phase and neutral) up to as many as six (three phase conductors, separate neutral and earth plus street lighting supplied by a common switch); a common case is four (three phase and neutral, where the neutral might also serve as a protective earthing conductor).\n\n==Train power==\n{{main|Overhead line}}\n\nOverhead lines or overhead wires are used to transmit electrical energy to trams, trolleybuses or trains. Overhead line is designed on the principle of one or more overhead wires situated over rail tracks. Feeder stations at regular intervals along the overhead line supply power from the high-voltage grid. For some cases low-frequency AC is used, and distributed by a special [[traction current]] network.\n\n==Further applications==\nOverhead lines are also occasionally used to supply transmitting antennas, especially for efficient transmission of long, medium and short waves. For this purpose a staggered array line is often used. Along a staggered array line the conductor cables for the supply of the earth net of the transmitting antenna are attached on the exterior of a ring, while the conductor inside the ring, is fastened to insulators leading to the high-voltage standing feeder of the antenna.\n\n==Use of area under overhead power lines==\nUse of the area below an overhead line is limited because objects must not come too close to the energized conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Radio reception can be impaired under a power line, due both to shielding of a receiver antenna by the overhead conductors, and by partial discharge at insulators and sharp points of the conductors which creates radio noise.\n\nIn the area surrounding the overhead lines, it is dangerous to risk interference, e.g. flying kites or balloons, using ladders, or operating machinery.\n\nOverhead distribution and transmission lines near [[airfield]]s are often marked on maps, and the lines themselves marked with conspicuous plastic reflectors, to warn pilots of the presence of conductors.\n\nConstruction of overhead power lines, especially in [[wilderness area]]s, may have significant [[human impact on the environment|environmental effects]]. Environmental studies for such projects may consider the effect of [[clearing (geography)|bush clearing]], changed migration routes for migratory animals, possible access by predators and humans along transmission corridors, disturbances of fish habitat at stream crossings, and other effects.\n\n[[Linear park]]s may occupy the area under overhead power lines.\n\n==Aviation accidents ==\n[[File:High voltage transmission line aviation obstruction marker.jpg|thumb|An aviation obstruction marker on a high-voltage overhead transmission line reminds pilots of the presence of an overhead line.

Nearly every kite product warns users to stay away from power lines. Deaths occur when aircraft crash into power lines. Some power lines are marked with obstruction makers, especially near air strips or over waterways that may support floatplane operations.

Electric power transmission was accomplished in 1882 with the first high-voltage transmission between [[Miesbach\u2013Munich Power Transmission|Munich and Miesbach]] (60&nbsp;km). 1891 saw the construction of the first three-phase [[alternating current]] overhead line on the occasion of the International Electricity Exhibition in [[Frankfurt]], between [[Lauffen]] and Frankfurt.\n\nIn 1912 the first 110 kV-overhead power line entered service followed by the first 220 kV-overhead power line in 1923. In the 1920s [[RWE]] AG built the first overhead line for this voltage and in 1926 built a [[Rhine]] crossing with the pylons of [[Voerde]], two masts 138 meters high.\n\n<!-- Milestones of years and voltages table here -->\nIn 1953, the first 345 kV line was put into service by [[American Electric Power]] in the [[United States]]. In Germany in 1957 the first 380 kV overhead power line was commissioned (between the transformer station and Rommerskirchen). In the same year the overhead line traversing of the Strait of Messina went into service in Italy, whose [[Pylons of Messina|pylons]] served the Elbe crossing 1. This was used as the model for the building of the Elbe crossing 2 in the second half of the 1970s which saw the construction of the highest overhead line pylons of the world. Earlier, in 1952, the first 380 kV line was put into service in [[Sweden]], in 1000&nbsp;km (625 miles) between the more populated areas in the south and the largest hydroelectric power stations in the north.\nStarting from 1967 in Russia, and also in the US and Canada, overhead lines for voltage of 765 kV were built. In 1982 overhead power lines were built in Soviet Union between [[Elektrostal]] and the power station at [[Ekibastuz]], this was a three-phase alternating current line at 1150 kV ([[Powerline Ekibastuz-Kokshetau]]). In 1999, in Japan the first powerline designed for 1000 kV with 2 circuits were built, the [[Kita-Iwaki Powerline]]. In 2003 the building of the highest overhead line commenced in China, the [[Yangtze River Crossing]].\n\n==Mathematical analysis==\nAn overhead power line is one example of a [[transmission line]]. At power system frequencies, many useful simplifications can be made for lines of typical lengths. For analysis of power systems, the distributed resistance, series inductance, shunt leakage resistance and shunt capacitance can be replaced with suitable lumped values or simplified networks.\n\n===Short and medium line model===\nA short length of a power line (less than 80&nbsp;km) can be approximated with a resistance in series with an inductance and ignoring the shunt admittances. This value is not the total impedance of the line, but rather the series impedance per unit length of line. For a longer length of line (80\u2013250&nbsp;km), a shunt capacitance is added to the model. In this case it is common to distribute half of the total capacitance to each side of the line. As a result, the power line can be represented as a [[two-port network]], such as with ABCD parameters.<ref name=Glover21>J. Glover, M. Sarma, and T.

Jin's Chunzhi Yangyan was so strong that Tushan couldn't fight against him. However, Dongfang Yuechu asked Tushan Honghong to use her hand through his heart and he kissed her immediately. Honghong got strong spirit power from that and finally Jin failed. After the attack. Yuechu used his diluted blood to wash her hands so that she was not afraid of Chunzhi Yangyan. Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival. When Yuechu arrived there, he just saw Honghong walked into an icy cave and sat in front of a dead little Taoist body. Honghong knew he was nearby and said something to him on propose. Then Yuechu knew that she and Rongrong were caught by two Taoists when they were young. But while the elder one sleeping, the little one wanted to save these two fox spirits. Honghong reminded of something that be told by an elder fox spirit, she just thought the little one would kill her so she used her hand through his heart but she understood his real motivation at that moment. The little Taoist told her his thoughts and died soon. Honghong was very guilty and it left a shadow in her heart. She couldn't do what she wanted even couldn't love others. Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people believe the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it is a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of black fox spirit showed up. Honghong finally realized his real idea and was moved. Yuechu left Tushan 50 years ago just wanted to achieve her dream, a dream about the peace between humans and spirits. Until this moment, Honghong expressed her love to Yuechu and Yuechu got his magic item, Xukong Zhilei(\u865a\u7a7a\u4e4b\u6cea, means the tears of void) because of his guilt. The Queen really wanted to get it, she seriously hurt Yuechu. But the magic item had become Yuechu and Honghong's magic item of love continuation in their heart. The Queen couldn't kill them if she wanted the complete item. Honghong started the love continuation, making a wish that they meet each other in the next life. Dongfang Yuechu was dead and Tushan Honghong lost her spirit power and memory, become Tushan Susu.\n\nIn Tushan Theater, people knew what happened 500 years ago in Bai Yuechu's reincarnation and Tushan Susu. But Tushan was attacked by black fox spirits, Beishan Yaodi(real name is Shi Kuan(\u77f3\u5bbd)) and Tushan Meimei(\u6d82\u5c71\u7f8e\u7f8e, a member of black fox spirits). Tushan Susu became Honghong temporarily but was controlled by Meimei. To save her, Bai and Rongrong came into her dream and finally saw Honghong and Dongfang Yuechu's soul. Susu became back. With the help of Bai and Susu's help, Shi Kuan was back to normal and accepted a girl whose reincarnation was the Princess of Yuyao Guo(\u5fa1\u5996\u56fd) and Shi was her lover in their former life.\n\nAll of spirits in Tushan and people in Yiqi Taoist League wanted Tushan Honghong could really be back, so Tushan Yaya asked Bai to marry Susu. At the wedding ceremony. Bai sightly asked Susu whether she wanted to be a real excellent matchmaker or not. Susu was exhausted but finally she expressed her real idea that she didn't want to marry, she just wanted to be an excellent matchmaker. Bai kissed her and she became Honghong flying away. Yaya wanted to catch her but Bai said if she did that he would die again. \"If you don't force us to marry right now, I can promise you, I will bring her back, and as she becomes the best matchmaker, I'll woo her, and make her truly fall in love with me.\"\n\n===Qianyan Chapter (Season 4)===\nEpisode: 49-63\n\nOP: Mingji(\u94ed\u8bb0, means remember)\n\nED: Keyin(\u523b\u5370, means put something into your heart deeply)\n\nThis chapter mainly tells the story of Yan Ruyu(\u989c\u5982\u7389) and Lv Jiewen(\u5f8b\u7b3a\u6587). Yan was Tushan Rongrong's only one student. She taught him how to transfiguration by changing face. Yan learned it very fast and soon left her. He was a bad guy when he came to humans' life. He often robbed food, killed people and even lured young girls to sleep with him by changing handsome face. People hated him very much. Soon a new captor officer Lv came and she wanted to catch him. Yan liked to find girls but he don't know why he was appealed deeply. Yan found himself that whatever he did, Lv always respond to catch him. He was sad and asked his master Rongrong about it. Rongrong had guessed that he fell in love with a girl, so he told him his mistakes he made and some basis among humans. He was determined to change himself. After that, some bad spirits escaped from Huntiandian Prison(\u6df7\u5929\u5178\u72f1, a prison built by Yiqi Taoist League). Lv and other captors had task to catch them. When they met difficulty, Yan came to help them. Although he helped them, Lv still insisted on catching him just for he was a criminal. When Yan was sent to Huntiandian Prison, Lv came, asked him some questions and left. However, Yan was surprised that his magic item was shining light. He realized her meaning immediately. The answer he replied was a sentence for promise of love continuation. He was so happy to know that Lv loved him. But black fox spirits found him and told that humans' life was short and if he willed and believed them, Lv could forget her pain. Soon Yan escaped but didn't know what to do next. He could only remember something but not clearly. He sat at the top of a snow mountain, seeing Lv built house, married, became old and died.\n\nIn modern times, Lv is an actress and she wanted Yan to help her in a performance. But they unfortunately met the bad spirits again and Lv was caught away. Yan came to save her and he let her go away because he didn't want her to know the real him. When the moon became round, he would lose his spirit power and showed the real him. They were found but Bai and Susu came there. They helped Yan and Lv fight bad spirits. Finally, Yan and Lv knew the truth and remembered anything about love continuation.\n\n== Anime ==\nThe Japanese version was broadcast in [[Tokyo MX]] between 2017-7-1 and 2017-12-16.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://enmusuyouko.com/news-01/|title=\u7e01\u7d50\u3073\u306e\u5996\u72d0\u3061\u3083\u3093-2017\u5e747\u67081\u65e5\u30aa\u30f3\u30a8\u30a2\u958b\u59cb\uff01\uff01 {{!}} \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 \u300c\u7e01\u7d50\u3073\u306e\u5996\u72d0\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300d \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|language=ja|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nSince Zhuye Chapter, the broadcasting rights only belong to Tencent Video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnKiAqD|title=\u56fd\u6f2b\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300b\"\u7af9\u4e1a\u7bc7\"\u817e\u8baf\u72ec\u5bb6\u5f00\u64ad|website=ent.huanqiu.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Mobile Game ==\nThe game was operated by [[Tencent Game]] Aurora Studios and tested publicly in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.9game.cn/hyxhn/3907653.html|title=\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300b\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u516c\u6d4b \u5168\u5e73\u53f0\u516c\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u516c\u5e03_\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u624b\u6e38_\u4e5d\u6e38\u624b\u673a\u6e38\u620f|website=www.9game.cn|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> It uses [[Unity3D]] as its engine and game type is [[MMORPG]] with traditional Chinese style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/news/510964|title=\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u624b\u6e38\uff1a\u56fd\u6f2b\u98ce\u683c\u7684RPG\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\u8d85\u5f3a\uff01 - \u4e91+\u793e\u533a - \u817e\u8baf\u4e91|website=cloud.tencent.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nWhen Fox Spirit Matchmaker was appeared, it has had a lot of impact, there have high clicks on many major platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/322224170_565158|title=\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u64ad\u653e\u91cf\u7a81\u783450\u4ebf\uff0c\u9605\u6587\u52a8\u753b\u70b9\u51fb\u91cf\u7834\u767e\u4ebf\uff0c\u56fd\u6f2bIP\u664b\u7ea7\u4e0b\u4e00\u7ad9\uff1aIP\u884d\u751f\u6388\u6743\u5e02\u573a_\u4e2d\u56fd|website=www.sohu.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> To enrich Chinese culture industry and improve cultural travel level, Tencent has carried out many multi-faceted cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://k.sina.cn/article_6216747334_1728c094601900j6oe.html|title=\u5e03\u5c40\u5168\u56fd\u3001\u64ac\u52a8\u5168\u7f51\uff0c\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300bIP\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5230\u5e95\u6709\u591a\u5f3a\uff1f|last=sina_mobile|date=2019-05-17|website=k.sina.cn|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, Hangzhou Animation Bus officially joined hands with Tencent Animation to launch No.51 \"pure love bus\".
