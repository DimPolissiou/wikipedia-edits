The publication was founded by [[Walt Grealis]] in February 1964, supported through its existence by record label owner [[Stan Klees]]. ''RPM'' ceased publication in November 2000.\n\n''RPM'' stood for \"Records, Promotion, Music\". The magazine was reported to have variations in its title over the years such as ''RPM Weekly'' and ''RPM Magazine''. ''RPM'' maintained several format charts, including Top Singles (all genres), Adult Contemporary, [[Canadian Dance chart|Dance]], Urban, [[Canadian Rock/Alternative chart|Rock/Alternative]] and Country Tracks (a.k.a. Top Country Tracks) for country music. On 21 March 1966, ''RPM'' expanded its Top Singles chart from 40 positions to 100. On December 6, 1980 the main chart became a Top 50 chart and remained this way until August 4, 1984 whereupon it returned to being a Top 100 Singles chart.\n\nFor the first several weeks of its existence, the magazine did not compile a national chart, but simply printed the current airplay lists of several major market Top 40 stations. A national chart was introduced beginning with the June 22, 1964 issue, with its first-ever national No. 1 single being \"[[Chapel of Love]]\" by [[The Dixie Cups]]. Prior to the introduction of ''RPM's'' national chart, the [[CHUM Chart]] from [[Toronto]] radio station [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]] was considered the ''de facto'' national chart. The final No. 1 single in the magazine was \"[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].\n\nSince the closure of the RPM Music Publication, RPM Magazine (est 1999) a Street Machine, Race Car, Grudge Race car magazine has been in business and currently owns the copyright to the name RPM Magazine.  \n\n==The RPM Awards==\nThe modern [[Juno Award]]s had their origins in an annual survey conducted by ''RPM'' since its founding year. Readers of the magazine were invited to mail in survey ballots to indicate their choices under various categories of people or companies.\n\nThe RPM Awards poll was transformed into a formal awards ceremony, [[Gold Leaf Awards of 1970|The Gold Leaf Awards]] in 1970. These became the [[Juno Award]]s in following years.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Canadian Journal of Communication | pages=343\u2013365 | url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=1005 | title=The CBC and the Juno Awards | first=David | last=Young | year=2005 | volume=30 | issue=3 | accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref>\n\n===1964 RPM Awards===\nThe RPM Awards for 1964 were announced in the 28 December 1964 issue:<ref>{{cite journal | title=The RPM Awards | date=28 December 1964 | publisher=RPM | journal=RPM | volume=2 | issue=18 | pages=1, 6}}</ref>\n\n* Top male vocalist: [[Terry Black]]\n* Top female singer: [[Shirley Matthews]]\n* Most promising male vocalist: [[Jack London (musician)|Jack London]]\n* Most promising female vocalist: [[Linda Layne]]\n* Top vocal instrumental group: [[The Esquires (Canadian band)|The Esquires]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/E/Esquires_Ottawa.html | publisher=[[Jam!]] | accessdate=2008-01-01 | work=The Canadian Pop Encyclopedia | title=Esquires, The (Ottawa) | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709072452/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/E/Esquires_Ottawa.html | archivedate=9 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Top female vocal group: [[Girlfriends (band)|Girlfriends]]\n* Top instrumental group: [[Wes Dakus]] & The Rebels\n* Top folk group: [[The Courriers]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallery.ca/exhibitions/exhibitions/sixties/english/events/index.html | accessdate=2008-01-01 | publisher=[[National Gallery of Canada]] | title=Events and Activities | date=4 February \u2013 24 April 2005 | quote=The Courriers were Ottawa\u2019s answer to Peter, Paul and Mary... |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071115033403/http://www.gallery.ca/exhibitions/exhibitions/sixties/english/events/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-15}} See event listing for 21 April 2005.</ref>\n* Top country male singer: [[Gary Buck]]\n* Top country female singer: [[Pat Hervey]]\n* Industry man of the year: Johnny Murphy of Cashbox Canada\n* Top record company: [[Capitol Records#Canada|Capitol Records of Canada]]\n* Top Canadian Content record company: [[Capitol Records#Canada|Capitol Records of Canada]]\n* Top national record promoter: Paul White, Capitol Records of Canada\n* Top regional record promoter: Ed Lawson, [[Quality Records]]\n* Top album of the year (GMP): ''That Girl'' by [[Phyllis Marshall]]\n\nA column on page 6 of that issue noted that the actual vote winner for Top Canadian Content record company was disqualified due to a conflict of interest involving an employee of that company who was also working for ''RPM''.
