Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019. In 2020 the Carbon boom and spinnaker pole were approved as well. <ref name=\"Classrules\" /><ref name=\"Boom\" /> In 2020 the [[Soling North American Championship]] in [[Annapolis]], [[United States]], the Friendship League Championship in [[Brazil]] and many other Soling regatta's word wide were postponed due to [[COVID-19]]. <ref name=\"COVID-19\" />\n|}\n\n==Solings Built==\nOver the years about 4500 Solings were built. About 3700 of them were registered. The growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s was high. Then it stabilized. Since 2000 hardly any boats were built. <ref name=\"Guide1970\" /><ref name=\"Guide1971\" /><ref name=\"Guide1972\" /><ref name=\"Guide1973\" /><ref name=\"Guide1974\" /><ref name=\"Guide1975\" /><ref name=\"Guide1976\" /><ref name=\"Guide1977\" /><ref name=\"Guide1978\" /><ref name=\"Guide1981\" /><ref name=\"Guide1984\" /><ref name=\"Guide1988\" /><ref name=\"Guide1992\" /><ref name=\"Guide1996\" />\n[[File:Solings Built 1965 - 2020.png|left|Soling Built between 1965 - 2020]]\n{{clear}}\nThe following 36 boat builders were over the years licensed to built Solings:\n{| {{Table}}\n! # !!

Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019. In 2020 the Carbon boom and spinnaker pole were approved as well. <ref name=\"Classrules\" /><ref name=\"Boom\" /> In 2020 the [[Soling North American Championship]] in [[Annapolis]], [[United States]], the Friendship League Championship in [[Brazil]] and many other Soling regatta's word wide were postponed due to [[COVID-19]]. <ref name=\"COVID-19\" />\n|}\n\n==Solings Built==\nOver the years about 4500 Solings were built. About 3700 of them were registered. The growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s was high. Then it stabilized. Since 2000 hardly any boats were built. <ref name=\"Guide1970\" /><ref name=\"Guide1971\" /><ref name=\"Guide1972\" /><ref name=\"Guide1973\" /><ref name=\"Guide1974\" /><ref name=\"Guide1975\" /><ref name=\"Guide1976\" /><ref name=\"Guide1977\" /><ref name=\"Guide1978\" /><ref name=\"Guide1981\" /><ref name=\"Guide1984\" /><ref name=\"Guide1988\" /><ref name=\"Guide1992\" /><ref name=\"Guide1996\" />\n[[File:Solings Built 1965 - 2020.png|left|Soling Built between 1965 - 2020]]\n{{clear}}\nThe following 36 boat builders were over the years licensed to built Solings:\n{| {{Table}}\n! # !!

offensive ways of describing [[COVID-19]]. These terms are linked to [[Wuhan]], where the virus was first detected, or China in general, via [[portmanteau]] with terms from traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]], ''Wushu'' and ''Kung Fu''. Use of these terms (popularised in social media and [[alt-right]] sources) not only downplays the seriousness of the deadly disease but also misinforms by suggesting it is a strain of [[influenza]] (when it is ''not'' a [[flu]]), while simultaneously mocking Chinese culture. It also implies that the pandemic is China's aggressive gift to the world, when actually thousands of Chinese suffered and died from COVID-19, especially in Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|title=Trump doubles down on 'China virus', demands to know who in White House used phrase 'Kung Flu'|date=2020-03-18|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329102358/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|title=A last, desperate pivot: Trump and his allies go full racist on coronavirus|date=2020-03-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329202750/https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Misinformation===\n{{main|Misinformation related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\nThe disease does not spread by shop items that have the name of \"Corona\" on them and products from China are not necessarily at risk of giving the disease either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|title=Coronavirus Is Not The 'Corona Beer Virus', What People Are Googling|last=Lee|first=Bruce Y.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316122432/https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|archive-date=16 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/can-i-get-coronavirus-from-a-package-being-delivered-from-china|title=Can I get coronavirus from a package delivered from China?|date=2020-02-26|website=Daily Breeze|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nBecause of its key role in the transmission and progression of SARS-CoV-2, [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2|ACE2]] has been the focus of a significant proportion of research and various [[Therapy|therapeutic]] approaches have been suggested.<ref name=\"Xu Zhong Deng Peng p.\"/> Personal hygiene, and a healthy lifestyle and [[Healthy diet|diet]] have been recommended to improve immunity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Li-sheng |last2=Wang |first2=Yi-ru |last3=Ye |first3=Da-wei |last4=Liu |first4=Qing-quan |title=A review of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) based on current evidence |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |date=19 March 2020 |page=105948 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105948 |pmid=32201353 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |language=en |issn=0924-8579 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327232545/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn order to improve and accelerate the exchange of data among researchers globally, the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] has started developing the European COVID-19 Data Platform. Understanding the biology, epidemiology, transmission, and evolution of the virus puts the scientific community one step closer to creating diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. One of the greatest challenges at this stage is finding ways to rapidly access and share data and results. The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to address this challenge by providing an open, trusted, and scalable platform where researchers can store and share relevant datasets. It will also create a shared computational space where scientists and public health workers can collaborate. The European COVID-19 Data Platform consists of two connected components: SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, which will organise the flow of sequence data from the outbreak and provide comprehensive open data sharing for the European and global research communities and COVID-19 Portal, which will bring together and continuously update relevant COVID-19 datasets and tools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/corona-updates/|title=EMBL\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-leads-international-collaboration-to-share-covid-19-research-data/?_ga=2.135566577.1552695299.1585763730-859685221.1575360586|title=EMBL-EBI leads International collaboration to share COVID-19 research data}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/covid-19|title=EMBL-EBI COVID-19 Data Platform}}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

Understanding the biology, epidemiology, transmission, and evolution of the virus puts the scientific community one step closer to creating diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. One of the greatest challenges at this stage is finding ways to rapidly access and share data and results. The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to address this challenge by providing an open, trusted, and scalable platform where researchers can store and share relevant datasets. It will also create a shared computational space where scientists and public health workers can collaborate. The European COVID-19 Data Platform consists of two connected components: SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, which will organise the flow of sequence data from the outbreak and provide comprehensive open data sharing for the European and global research communities and COVID-19 Portal, which will bring together and continuously update relevant COVID-19 datasets and tools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/corona-updates/|title=EMBL\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-leads-international-collaboration-to-share-covid-19-research-data/?_ga=2.135566577.1552695299.1585763730-859685221.1575360586|title=EMBL-EBI leads International collaboration to share COVID-19 research data}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/covid-19|title=EMBL-EBI COVID-19 Data Platform}}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Both were recurring characters during her time on SNL. She had [[dyslexia]] and was the only ''SNL'' cast member to have a learning disability. According to [[Al Franken]] in the book ''Live from New York: The Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live,'' she had trouble memorizing lines and reading cue cards, though this was not made apparent in most cases and, in one case, ad-libbing covered it up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nVance appeared on ''SNL'' during a time of great transition for the show outside her roles, while she herself became frustrated over being put into roles that were stereotypically associated with young, black women:<ref name=\":0\" /> such as waitresses; nurses; secretaries; unwed, welfare-dependent mothers (her recurring character, Cabrini Green Jackson, easily fell into this category); and \"mammy\"-style maids/house slaves in Civil War-based sketches. The last type of role was made evident during the episode hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]] in spring of 1986 where in the cold opening, Vance played [[Lorne Michaels]]' personal slave (supposedly as Celie from the movie ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'') who convinces Michaels to force Oprah into performing stereotypically black roles by beating her, only to have Oprah choke Lorne in a headlock while opening the show with its opening line, \"Live from New York, it's ''Saturday Night!\"'' In a short musical sketch on the same episode, Vance sang \"I Play The Maids\" (a spin on \"[[I Write the Songs]]\"), a satirical song that expressed frustration over black actresses (and herself) being typecast as maids in films and on television shows.  Ironically, one of Danitra Vance's celebrity impersonations was of [[Cicely Tyson]] (in The [[Pee Wee Herman]] Thanksgiving Special sketch), who avoided film or TV roles that stereotyped black women, and, during her hosting stint on the fourth season (1978\u20131979), was shocked and disgusted that [[Garrett Morris]] was put in lesser roles on the show.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nVance ultimately was let go ''SNL'' at the end of the 1986 season along with many other cast members from that season who were dismissed, including [[Joan Cusack]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], and [[Terry Sweeney]], the other first [[LGBT]] member of the SNL cast.\n\n===Recurring characters on ''SNL''===\n*''That Black Girl,'' a black actress looking to hit the big time, despite being passed up because of her race (parody of [[Marlo Thomas]]'s ''[[That Girl]])''\n*Cabrini Green Jackson, a professional teenage mother and motivational speaker who gives advice on teen pregnancy\n\n====Celebrity impersonations====\n*[[Diahann Carroll]] (as Dominique Deveraux on ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'')\n*[[Lola Falana]]\n*[[Cicely Tyson]]\n*[[Leslie Uggams]]\n\n==Late career==\nShe was awarded an [[NAACP Image Award]] in 1986 and later won an [[Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress]] for her performance in the theatrical adaptation of ''[[Spunk (novel)|Spunk]]'', a collection of short stories written by [[Zora Neale Hurston]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.obieawards.com/events/1990s/|title=1990s|website=Obie Awards|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref> That same year, Vance was also in the original cast of [[George C. Wolfe|George C.

She had small roles in ''[[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' and ''[[Little Man Tate]]'' and a more significant role in ''[[Jumpin' at the Boneyard]]'', for which she was nominated for an [[Independent Spirit Award]].\n\n==Death==\nDiagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in 1990, Vance underwent a single [[mastectomy]] and incorporated the experience into a solo skit, \"The Radical Girl's Guide to Radical Mastectomy\". She expanded on her experiences in a second, autobiographical show, titled \"Pre-Shrunk\" which was to be performed at [[The Public Theater]]. However, she was unable to perform as her cancer recurred in 1993. She died of the disease the following year in [[Markham, Illinois]].<ref name=\"obit\" /> She requested her funeral be held at an amusement park, and her family threw her a \"going-away party\" with [[apple bobbing]] and [[Cornhole|bean bag tossing]] to respect her wishes.<ref name=\":0\" /> She was survived by her partner, Jones Miller.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==Filmography==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Film\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Year\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Film\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Role\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1988\n| ''Sticky Fingers''\n| Evanston \n|-\n| rowspan=2|1989\n| ''[[Limit Up (film)|Limit Up]]''\n| Nike\n|-\n| ''[[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]''\n| Manicurist Trainee \n|-\n| rowspan=2|1991\n| ''[[Hangin' with the Homeboys]]''\n| Pool hall couple \n|-\n| ''[[Little Man Tate]]''\n| Clinic doctor\n|-\n| 1992\n| ''[[Jumpin' at the Boneyard]]''\n| Jeanette \n|-\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Television\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Year\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Title\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Role\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1985\u20131986\n| ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''\n| Various\n| 18 episodes\n|-\n| 1987\n| ''[[Miami Vice]]''\n| Annette McAllister\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| rowspan=2|1989\n| ''The Cover Girl and the Cop''\n|\n| Television movie\n|-\n| ''Trying Times''\n| Emma St. John\n| 1 episode\n|-\n| 1990\n| ''Sisters''\n| Brenda \n| Television movie\n|-\n| 1991\n| ''[[Great Performances]]: [[The Colored Museum]]''\n| Miss Pat/The Woman/Normal Jean Reynolds\n| 1 episode\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* {{iobdb name|7884}}\n* {{IMDb name|id=0888503}}\n* {{AllMovie name|72949}}\n* [http://www.lawtf.com/artists/vance.htm Biography] from the website of the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival\n* {{Find a Grave|5935483}}\n* [http://catalog.lamama.org/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/13226 Danitra Vance's artist page on La MaMa's Digital Collections website].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vance, Dinitra}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American actresses]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]]\n[[Category:American film actresses]]\n[[Category:American stage actresses]]\n[[Category:American television actresses]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Deaths from breast cancer]]\n[[Category:Lesbian actresses]]\n[[Category:LGBT African Americans]]\n[[Category:LGBT comedians]]\n[[Category:LGBT entertainers from the United States]]\n[[Category:LGBT people from Illinois]]\n[[Category:Actresses from Chicago]]\n[[Category:Roosevelt University alumni]]\n[[Category:American women comedians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American actresses]]\n[[Category:American sketch comedians]]\n[[Category:Comedians from Illinois]]\n[[Category:20th-century American comedians]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American actress and comedian}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Danitra Vance\n| image              = Danitra Vance.jpg\n| alt                = Black and white headshot of Danitra Vance mid-smile\n| caption            = \n| birth_name         = \n| birth_date         = {{Birth date|1954|7|13|mf=y}}\n| birth_place        = [[Chicago, Illinois]], U.S.\n| death_date         = {{Death date and age|1994|8|21|1954|7|13|mf=y}}\n| death_place        = [[Markham, Illinois]], U.S.\n| other_names        = Dan Vance\n| education          = [[Roosevelt University]], [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]] <small>([[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]])</small>\n| occupation         = Comedian, actress\n| years_active       = 1972\u20131994\n| partner            = Jones Miller\n| awards             = [[Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress]]\n}}\n\n'''Danitra Vance''' (July 13, 1954&nbsp;\u2013 August 21, 1994) was an American comedian and actress best known as a [[Saturday Night Live cast|cast member]] on the [[NBC]] sketch show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) during its [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]] and for work in feature films like ''[[Sticky Fingers (1988 film)|Sticky Fingers]]'' (1988), ''[[Limit Up]]'' (1990) and ''[[Jumpin' at the Boneyard]]'' (1992).

According to [[Al Franken]] in the book ''Live from New York: The Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live,'' she had trouble memorizing lines and reading cue cards, though this was not made apparent in most cases and, in one case, ad-libbing covered it up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nVance appeared on ''SNL'' during a time of great transition for the show outside her roles, while she herself became frustrated over being put into roles that were stereotypically associated with young, black women:<ref name=\":0\" /> such as waitresses; nurses; secretaries; unwed, welfare-dependent mothers (her recurring character, Cabrini Green Jackson, easily fell into this category); and \"mammy\"-style maids/house slaves in Civil War-based sketches. The last type of role was made evident during the episode hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]] in spring of 1986 where in the cold opening, Vance played [[Lorne Michaels]]' personal slave (supposedly as Celie from the movie ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'') who convinces Michaels to force Oprah into performing stereotypically black roles by beating her, only to have Oprah choke Lorne in a headlock while opening the show with its opening line, \"Live from New York, it's ''Saturday Night!\"'' In a short musical sketch on the same episode, Vance sang \"I Play The Maids\" (a spin on \"[[I Write the Songs]]\"), a satirical song that expressed frustration over black actresses (and herself) being typecast as maids in films and on television shows.  Ironically, one of Danitra Vance's celebrity impersonations was of [[Cicely Tyson]] (in The [[Pee Wee Herman]] Thanksgiving Special sketch), who avoided film or TV roles that stereotyped black women, and, during her hosting stint on the fourth season (1978\u20131979), was shocked and disgusted that [[Garrett Morris]] was put in lesser roles on the show.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nVance ultimately was let go ''SNL'' at the end of the 1986 season along with many other cast members from that season who were dismissed, including [[Joan Cusack]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], and [[Terry Sweeney]], the other first [[LGBT]] member of the SNL cast.\n\n===Recurring characters on ''SNL''===\n*''That Black Girl,'' a black actress looking to hit the big time, despite being passed up because of her race (parody of [[Marlo Thomas]]'s ''[[That Girl]])''\n*Cabrini Green Jackson, a professional teenage mother and motivational speaker who gives advice on teen pregnancy\n\n====Celebrity impersonations====\n*[[Diahann Carroll]] (as Dominique Deveraux on ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'')\n*[[Lola Falana]]\n*[[Cicely Tyson]]\n*[[Leslie Uggams]]\n\n==Late career==\nShe was awarded an [[NAACP Image Award]] in 1986 and later won an [[Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress]] for her performance in the theatrical adaptation of ''[[Spunk (novel)|Spunk]]'', a collection of short stories written by [[Zora Neale Hurston]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.obieawards.com/events/1990s/|title=1990s|website=Obie Awards|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref> That same year, Vance was also in the original cast of [[George C.

The strike price may be set by reference to the [[spot price]] (market price) of the underlying security or commodity on the day an option is taken out, or it may be fixed at a discount or at a premium. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction \u2013 to sell or buy \u2013 if the buyer (owner) \"exercises\" the option. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy at a specific price is referred to as a [[call option|call]]; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell at a specific price is referred to as a [[put option|put]]. Both are commonly traded, but the call option is more frequently discussed.\n\nThe seller may grant an option to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue or as part of an employee incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.\n\nThe owner of an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a [[secondary market]], in either an [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] transaction or on an [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchange]], depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock being the difference between the market price of the stock and the strike price of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.\n\n==History==\n\n===Historical uses of options===\nContracts similar to options have been used since ancient times.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/history-options-futures.asp|title = History of Financial Options - Investopedia|date = May 13, 2010|accessdate = Jun 2, 2014|website = Investopedia|publisher = |last = Abraham|first = Stephan}}</ref> The first reputed option buyer was the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mathematician and philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]].

Their exercise price was fixed at a rounded-off market price on the day or week that the option was bought, and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase. They were not traded in secondary markets.\n\nIn the [[real estate]] market, call options have long been used to assemble large parcels of land from separate owners; e.g., a developer pays for the right to buy several adjacent plots, but is not obligated to buy these plots and might not unless he can buy all the plots in the entire parcel.\n\nIn the motion picture industry, film or theatrical producers often buy the right&nbsp;\u2014 but not the obligation&nbsp;\u2014 to dramatize a specific book or script.\n\n[[Line of credit|Lines of credit]] give the potential borrower the right&nbsp;\u2014 but not the obligation&nbsp;\u2014 to borrow within a specified time period.\n\nMany choices, or embedded options, have traditionally been included in [[bond (finance)|bond]] contracts. For example, many bonds are [[Convertible bond|convertible]] into common stock at the buyer's option, or may be called (bought back) at specified prices at the issuer's option. [[Mortgage loan|Mortgage]] borrowers have long had the option to repay the loan early, which corresponds to a callable bond option.\n\n===Modern stock options===\nOptions contracts have been known for decades. The [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] was established in 1973, which set up a regime using standardized forms and terms and trade through a guaranteed clearing house. Trading activity and academic interest has increased since then.\n\nToday, many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchanges]], while other [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] options are written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may be a dealer or market-maker.

Exchange-traded options have standardized contracts, and are settled through a [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] with fulfillment guaranteed by the [[Options Clearing Corporation]] (OCC). Since the contracts are standardized, accurate pricing models are often available. Exchange-traded options include:<ref>{{Citation | title=Trade CME Products | url=http://www.cme.com/trading/ | publisher=Chicago Mercantile Exchange | accessdate=June 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title=ISE Traded Products | publisher=International Securities Exchange | url=http://www.iseoptions.com/products_traded.aspx | accessdate=June 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070511003741/http://www.iseoptions.com/products_traded.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 11, 2007}}</ref>\n* Stock options\n* [[Bond option]]s and other [[interest rate derivative|interest rate options]]\n* [[Stock market index option]]s or, simply, index options and\n* [[Options on futures contracts]]\n* [[Callable bull/bear contract]]\n\n====Over-the-counter options====\n[[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] options (OTC options, also called \"dealer options\") are traded between two private parties, and are not listed on an exchange. The terms of an OTC option are unrestricted and may be individually tailored to meet any business need. In general, the option writer is a well-capitalized institution (in order to prevent the credit risk). Option types commonly traded over the counter include:\n* Interest rate options\n* Currency cross rate options, and\n* Options on [[swap (finance)|swaps]] or [[swaption]]s.\n\nBy avoiding an exchange, users of OTC options can narrowly tailor the terms of the option contract to suit individual business requirements. In addition, OTC option transactions generally do not need to be advertised to the market and face little or no regulatory requirements. However, OTC counterparties must establish credit lines with each other, and conform to each other's clearing and settlement procedures.\n\nWith few exceptions,<ref>{{Citation | author=Elinor Mills | title=Google unveils unorthodox stock option auction | publisher=CNet | url=http://news.cnet.com/Google+unveils+unorthodox+stock+option+auction/2100-1030_3-6143227.html | date=December 12, 2006 | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref> there are no [[secondary market]]s for [[employee stock options]]. These must either be exercised by the original grantee or allowed to expire.\n\n=== Exchange trading===\nThe most common way to trade options is via standardized options contracts that are listed by various [[futures exchange|futures and options exchanges]].\n<ref>{{Citation\n  | last =Harris  | first =Larry\n  | author-link =\n  | title =Trading and Exchanges\n  | place=\n  | publisher =Oxford University Press\n  | year =2003\n  | location =\n  | volume =\n  | edition =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id = pp.26\u201327 }}\n</ref> Listings and prices are tracked and can be looked up by [[Option symbol|ticker symbol]]. By publishing continuous, live markets for option prices, an exchange enables independent parties to engage in [[price discovery]] and execute transactions. As an intermediary to both sides of the transaction, the benefits the exchange provides to the transaction include:\n* Fulfillment of the contract is backed by the credit of the exchange, which typically has the highest [[bond rating|rating]] (AAA),\n* Counterparties remain anonymous,\n* Enforcement of market regulation to ensure fairness and transparency, and\n* Maintenance of orderly markets, especially during fast trading conditions.\n\n===Basic trades (American style)===\nThese trades are described from the point of view of a speculator. If they are combined with other positions, they can also be used in [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]]. An option contract in US markets usually represents 100 shares of the underlying security.<ref>[http://invest-faq.com/cbc/deriv-option-basics.html invest-faq] or [http://www.wfu.edu/~palmitar/Law&Valuation/chapter%204/4-4-1.htm Law & Valuation] for typical size of option contract</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/pdf/understanding.pdf | title=Understanding Stock Options | publisher=[[Options Clearing Corporation|The Options Clearing Corporation]] and [[CBOE]] |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Long call====\n[[File:Long call option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from buying a call.]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to increase can buy a [[call option]] to purchase the stock at a fixed price (\"[[strike price]]\") at a later date, rather than purchase the stock outright. The cash outlay on the option is the premium. The trader would have no obligation to buy the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. The risk of loss would be limited to the premium paid, unlike the possible loss had the stock been bought outright.\n\nThe holder of an American-style call option can sell the option holding at any time until the expiration date, and would consider doing so when the stock's spot price is above the exercise price, especially if the holder expects the price of the option to drop. By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can realise an immediate profit. Alternatively, the trader can exercise the option \u2014 for example, if there is no secondary market for the options \u2014 and then sell the stock, realising a profit. A trader would make a profit if the spot price of the shares rises by more than the premium. For example, if the exercise price is 100 and premium paid is 10, then if the spot price of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.\n\nIf the stock price at expiration is lower than the exercise price, the holder of the options at that time will let the call contract expire and only lose the premium (or the price paid on transfer).\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Long put====\n[[File:Long put option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from buying a put]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to decrease can buy a [[put option]] to sell the stock at a fixed price (\"strike price\") at a later date. The trader will be under no obligation to sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price, he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.\n\nIt is important to note that one who exercises a put option, does not necessarily need to own the underlying asset. Specifically, one does not need to own the underlying stock in order to sell it. The reason for this is that one can [[Short (finance)|short sell]] that underlying stock.\n\n====Short call====\n[[File:Short call option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from writing a call.]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to decrease can sell the stock [[Short (finance)|short]] or instead sell, or \"write\", a call. The trader selling a call has an obligation to sell the stock to the call buyer at a fixed price (\"strike price\"). If the seller does not own the stock when the option is exercised, he is obligated to purchase the stock from the market at the then market price. If the stock price decreases, the seller of the call (call writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the stock price increases over the strike price by more than the amount of the premium, the seller will lose money, with the potential loss being unlimited.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Short put====\n[[File:Short put option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from writing a put.]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to increase can buy the stock or instead sell, or \"write\", a put. The trader selling a put has an obligation to buy the stock from the put buyer at a fixed price (\"strike price\"). If the stock price at expiration is above the strike price, the seller of the put (put writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the stock price at expiration is below the strike price by more than the amount of the premium, the trader will lose money, with the potential loss being up to the strike price minus the premium. A benchmark index for the performance of a cash-secured short put option position is the [[CBOE S&P 500 PutWrite Index]] (ticker PUT).\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Options strategies===\n{{Main|Options strategy}}\n[[File:Long butterfly option.svg|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from buying a butterfly spread.]]\n[[File:Short straddle option.svg|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from selling a straddle.]]\n[[File:Covered Call.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from a covered call.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Protective Put.gif|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from a protective put.]] -->\n\nCombining any of the four basic kinds of option trades (possibly with different exercise prices and maturities) and the two basic kinds of stock trades (long and short) allows a variety of [[options strategies]]. Simple strategies usually combine only a few trades, while more complicated strategies can combine several.\n\nStrategies are often used to engineer a particular risk profile to movements in the underlying security. For example, buying a [[Butterfly (options)|butterfly]] spread (long one X1 call, short two X2 calls, and long one X3 call) allows a trader to profit if the stock price on the expiration date is near the middle exercise price, X2, and does not expose the trader to a large loss.\n\nAn [[iron condor]] is a strategy that is similar to a butterfly spread, but with different strikes for the short options&nbsp;\u2013 offering a larger likelihood of profit but with a lower net credit compared to the butterfly spread.\n\nSelling a [[straddle]] (selling both a put and a call at the same exercise price) would give a trader a greater profit than a butterfly if the final stock price is near the exercise price, but might result in a large loss.\n\nSimilar to the straddle is the [[Strangle (options)|strangle]] which is also constructed by a call and a put, but whose strikes are different, reducing the net debit of the trade, but also reducing the risk of loss in the trade.\n\nOne well-known strategy is the [[covered call]], in which a trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and sells a call. If the stock price rises above the exercise price, the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit. If the stock price falls, the call will not be exercised, and any loss incurred to the trader will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. Overall, the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put. This relationship is known as [[put\u2013call parity]] and offers insights for financial theory. A benchmark index for the performance of a [[buy-write]] strategy is the [[CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index]] (ticker symbol BXM).\n\nAnother very common strategy is the [[protective put]], in which a trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock, hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the underlying stock. The maximum loss is limited to the purchase price of the underlying stock less the strike price of the put option and the premium paid. A protective put is also known as a married put.\n\n==Types==\nOptions can be classified in a few ways.\n\n===According to the option rights===\n* Call options give the holder the right\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to buy something at a specific price for a specific time period.\n* Put options give the holder the right\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to sell something at a specific price for a specific time period.\n\n===According to the underlying assets===\n* Equity option\n* Bond option\n* Future option\n* Index option\n* Commodity option\n* Currency option\n\n===Other option types===\nAnother important class of options, particularly in the U.S., are [[employee stock option]]s, which are awarded by a company to their employees as a form of incentive compensation. Other types of options exist in many financial contracts, for example [[Option (law)|real estate options]] are often used to assemble large parcels of land, and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] options are usually included in [[mortgage loan]]s. However, many of the valuation and risk management principles apply across all financial options. There are two more types of options; covered and naked.<ref name=\"McMillan2011\">{{cite book|author=Lawrence G.

There are many pricing models in use, although all essentially incorporate the concepts of [[Rational pricing#Options|rational pricing]] (i.e. [[risk neutral]]ity) , [[moneyness]], [[option time value]] and [[put-call parity]].\n\nThe valuation itself combines a model of the behavior ([[stochastic process|\"process\"]]) of the underlying price with a mathematical method which returns the premium as a function of the assumed behavior. \nThe models range from the (prototypical) [[Black\u2013Scholes model]] for equities,<ref>{{cite paper |first=Eric |last=Benhamou |title=Options pre-Black Scholes |url=http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Pre%20Black-Scholes.pdf |year= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Fischer |first2=Myron |last2=Scholes |year=1973 |title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=637\u2013654 |jstor=1831029 |doi=10.1086/260062}}</ref> to the [[Heath\u2013Jarrow\u2013Morton framework]] for interest rates, to the [[Heston model]] where volatility itself is considered [[stochastic]]. See [[Asset pricing]] for a listing of the various models here.\n\n===Basic decomposition===\nIn its most basic terms, the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts:\n* The first part is the '''intrinsic value''', which is defined as the difference between the market value of the [[underlying]], and the strike price of the given, option\n* The second part is the '''time value''', which depends on a set of other factors which, through a multi-variable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect the [[discounted]] [[expected value]] of that difference at expiration.\n\n===Valuation models===\n{{Main|Valuation of options}}\nAs above, the value of the option is estimated using a variety of quantitative techniques, all based on the principle of [[risk-neutral]] pricing, and using [[stochastic calculus]] in their solution. The most basic model is the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]]. More sophisticated models are used to model the [[volatility smile]].

Other models include the [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]] and [[SABR volatility model]]s.  One principal advantage of the Heston model, however, is that it can be solved in closed-form, while other stochastic volatility models require complex [[numerical methods]].<ref name=gatheral>{{Citation | author=Jim Gatheral | title=The Volatility Surface, A Practitioner's Guide | year=2006 | publisher=Wiley Finance | isbn=978-0-471-79251-2}}</ref>\n\nAn alternate, though related, approach is to apply a [[local volatility]] model, where [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] is treated as a ''[[deterministic]]'' function of both the current asset level <math> S_t </math> and of time <math> t </math>.  As such, a local volatility model is a generalisation of the [[Black-Scholes model]], where the volatility is a constant. The concept was developed when [[Bruno Dupire]] <ref name=dupire>{{cite journal | author=Bruno Dupire | title=Pricing with a Smile | publisher=Risk |  year= 1994 }}{{cite web|url=http://www.risk.net/data/risk/pdf/technical/2007/risk20_0707_technical_volatility.pdf |title=Download media disabled |accessdate=2013-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907114056/http://www.risk.net/data/risk/pdf/technical/2007/risk20_0707_technical_volatility.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-07 }}</ref>  and [[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Iraj Kani]]<ref name=derman>{{cite journal | author=Derman, E., Iraj Kani | title=\"Riding on a Smile.\" RISK, 7(2) Feb.1994, pp. 139-145, pp. 32-39. | publisher=Risk | year= 1994 | url=http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/gs-volatility_smile.pdf | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> noted that there is a unique diffusion process consistent with the risk neutral densities derived from the market prices of European options.

And some of the short rate models can be straightforwardly expressed in the HJM framework.)\nFor some purposes, e.g., valuation of [[mortgage backed securities]], this can be a big simplification; regardless, the framework is often preferred for models of higher dimension.\nNote that for the simpler options here, i.e. those mentioned initially, the [[Black model]] can instead be employed, with certain assumptions.\n\n===Model implementation===\n{{Further|Valuation of options}}\nOnce a valuation model has been chosen, there are a number of different techniques used to take the mathematical models to implement the models.\n\n====Analytic techniques====\nIn some cases, one can take the [[mathematical model]] and using analytical methods develop [[Closed-form expression|closed form solutions]] such as the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]] and the [[Black model]]. The resulting solutions are readily computable, as are their [[Greeks (finance)|\"Greeks\"]]. Although the [[Roll\u2013Geske\u2013Whaley model]] applies to an American call with one dividend, for other cases of [[American option]]s, closed form solutions are not available; approximations here include [[Barone-Adesi and Whaley]], [[Bjerksund and Stensland]] and others.\n\n====Binomial tree pricing model====\n{{Main|Binomial options pricing model}}\n{{Further|Lattice model (finance)}}\nClosely following the derivation of Black and Scholes, [[John Carrington Cox|John Cox]], [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]] and [[Mark Rubinstein]] developed the original version of the [[binomial options pricing model]].<ref>[[John Carrington Cox|Cox, J.

The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the Black\u2013Scholes model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black\u2013Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black\u2013Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and [[American option]]s can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The [[Trinomial tree]] is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.  For a more general discussion, as well as for application to commodities, interest rates and hybrid instruments, see [[Lattice model (finance)]].\n\n====Monte Carlo models====\n{{Main|Monte Carlo methods for option pricing}}\nFor many classes of options, traditional valuation techniques are [[Tractable problem|intractable]] because of the complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses [[Monte Carlo simulation|simulation]] to generate random price paths of the underlying asset, each of which results in a payoff for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an [[expectation value]] for the option.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last =Crack | first =Timothy Falcon\n  | author-link =\n  | title =Basic Black\u2013Scholes: Option Pricing and Trading\n  | place=pp. 91\u2013102\n  | publisher =\n  | year =2004\n  | location =\n  | volume =\n  | edition =1st\n  | url =http://www.BasicBlackScholes.com/\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =0-9700552-2-6}}\n</ref> Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for [[american option|American styled options]] is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.\n\n====Finite difference models====\n{{Main|Finite difference methods for option pricing}}\nThe equations used to model the option are often expressed as [[partial differential equation]]s (see for example [[Black\u2013Scholes equation]]). Once expressed in this form, a [[Finite difference method|finite difference model]] can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: [[explicit method|explicit finite difference]], [[implicit method|implicit finite difference]] and the [[Crank\u2013Nicolson method]]. A trinomial tree option pricing model can be shown to be a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs&nbsp;\u2013 for example dividend yield, risk-free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these&nbsp;\u2013 that are not [[tractable problem|tractable]] in closed form.\n\n====Other models====\nOther numerical implementations which have been used to value options include [[finite element method]]s.\n\n==Risks==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"100\"\n|-\n|Example:\nA call option (also known as a CO) expiring in 99 days on 100 shares of XYZ stock is struck at $50, with XYZ currently trading at $48. With future realized volatility over the life of the option estimated at 25%, the theoretical value of the option is $1.89. The hedge parameters <math>\\Delta</math>, <math>\\Gamma</math>, <math>\\kappa</math>, <math>\\theta</math> are (0.439, 0.0631, 9.6, and \u22120.022), respectively. Assume that on the following day, XYZ stock rises to $48.5 and volatility falls to 23.5%. We can calculate the estimated value of the call option by applying the hedge parameters to the new model inputs as:\n::<math>dC = (0.439 \\cdot 0.5) + \\left(0.0631 \\cdot \\frac{0.5^2}{2} \\right) + (9.6 \\cdot -0.015) + (-0.022 \\cdot 1) = 0.0614</math>\nUnder this scenario, the value of the option increases by $0.0614 to $1.9514, realizing a profit of $6.14. Note that for a delta neutral portfolio, whereby the trader had also sold 44 shares of XYZ stock as a hedge, the net loss under the same scenario would be ($15.86).\n|}\nAs with all securities, trading options entails the risk of the option's value changing over time. However, unlike traditional securities, the [[Stock option return|return]] from holding an option varies non-linearly with the value of the underlying and other factors. Therefore, the risks associated with holding options are more complicated to understand and predict.\n\nIn general, the change in the value of an option can be derived from [[It\u00f4's lemma]] as:\n\n::<math>dC=\\Delta dS + \\Gamma \\frac{dS^2}{2} + \\kappa d\\sigma + \\theta dt \\,</math>\n\nwhere the [[Greeks (finance)|Greeks]] <math>\\Delta</math>, <math>\\Gamma</math>, <math>\\kappa</math> and <math>\\theta</math> are the standard hedge parameters calculated from an option valuation model, such as [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes]], and <math>dS</math>, <math>d\\sigma</math> and <math>dt</math> are unit changes in the underlying's price, the underlying's volatility and time, respectively.\n\nThus, at any point in time, one can estimate the risk inherent in holding an option by calculating its hedge parameters and then estimating the expected change in the model inputs, <math>dS</math>, <math>d\\sigma</math> and <math>dt</math>, provided the changes in these values are small. This technique can be used effectively to understand and manage the risks associated with standard options. For instance, by offsetting a holding in an option with the quantity <math>-\\Delta</math> of shares in the underlying, a trader can form a [[delta neutral]] portfolio that is hedged from loss for small changes in the underlying's price. The corresponding price sensitivity formula for this portfolio <math>\\Pi</math> is:\n\n::<math>d\\Pi=\\Delta dS  + \\Gamma \\frac{dS^2}{2} + \\kappa d\\sigma + \\theta dt = \\Gamma \\frac{dS^2}{2} + \\kappa d\\sigma + \\theta dt\\,</math>\n\n===Pin risk===\n{{Main|Pin risk}}\nA special situation called [[Pin risk (options)|pin risk]] can arise when the underlying closes at or very close to the option's strike value on the last day the option is traded prior to expiration. The option writer (seller) may not know with certainty whether or not the option will actually be exercised or be allowed to expire. Therefore, the option writer may end up with a large, unwanted residual position in the underlying when the markets open on the next trading day after expiration, regardless of his or her best efforts to avoid such a residual.\n\n===Counterparty risk===\nA further, often ignored, risk in derivatives such as options is [[counterparty credit risk|counterparty risk]]. In an option contract this risk is that the seller won't sell or buy the underlying asset as agreed. The risk can be minimized by using a financially strong intermediary able to make good on the trade, but in a major panic or crash the number of defaults can overwhelm even the strongest intermediaries.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Area yield options contract]]\n* [[Ascot (finance)]]\n* [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]\n* [[Dilutive security]]\n* [[Eurex]]\n* [[Euronext.liffe]]\n* [[International Securities Exchange]]\n* [[NYSE Arca]]\n* [[Philadelphia Stock Exchange]]\n* [[LEAPS (finance)]]\n* [[Options backdating]]\n* [[Options Clearing Corporation]]\n* [[Options spread]]\n* [[Options strategy]]\n* [[Option symbol]]\n* [[Real options analysis]]\n* [[PnL Explained]]\n* [[Pin risk (options)]]\n* [[XVA]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fischer Black and Myron S.

The strike price may be set by reference to the [[spot price]] (market price) of the underlying security or commodity on the day an option is taken out, or it may be fixed at a discount or at a premium. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction \u2013 to sell or buy \u2013 if the buyer (owner) \"exercises\" the option. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy at a specific price is referred to as a [[call option|call]]; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell at a specific price is referred to as a [[put option|put]]. Both are commonly traded, but the call option is more frequently discussed.\n\nThe seller may grant an option to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue or as part of an employee incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.\n\nThe owner of an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a [[secondary market]], in either an [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] transaction or on an [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchange]], depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock being the difference between the market price of the stock and the strike price of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.\n\n==History==\n\n===Historical uses of options===\nContracts similar to options have been used since ancient times.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/history-options-futures.asp|title = History of Financial Options - Investopedia|date = May 13, 2010|accessdate = Jun 2, 2014|website = Investopedia|publisher = |last = Abraham|first = Stephan}}</ref> The first reputed option buyer was the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mathematician and philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]].

Their exercise price was fixed at a rounded-off market price on the day or week that the option was bought, and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase. They were not traded in secondary markets.\n\nIn the [[real estate]] market, call options have long been used to assemble large parcels of land from separate owners; e.g., a developer pays for the right to buy several adjacent plots, but is not obligated to buy these plots and might not unless he can buy all the plots in the entire parcel.\n\nIn the motion picture industry, film or theatrical producers often buy the right&nbsp;\u2014 but not the obligation&nbsp;\u2014 to dramatize a specific book or script.\n\n[[Line of credit|Lines of credit]] give the potential borrower the right&nbsp;\u2014 but not the obligation&nbsp;\u2014 to borrow within a specified time period.\n\nMany choices, or embedded options, have traditionally been included in [[bond (finance)|bond]] contracts. For example, many bonds are [[Convertible bond|convertible]] into common stock at the buyer's option, or may be called (bought back) at specified prices at the issuer's option. [[Mortgage loan|Mortgage]] borrowers have long had the option to repay the loan early, which corresponds to a callable bond option.\n\n===Modern stock options===\nOptions contracts have been known for decades. The [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] was established in 1973, which set up a regime using standardized forms and terms and trade through a guaranteed clearing house. Trading activity and academic interest has increased since then.\n\nToday, many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchanges]], while other [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] options are written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may be a dealer or market-maker.

Exchange-traded options include:<ref>{{Citation | title=Trade CME Products | url=http://www.cme.com/trading/ | publisher=Chicago Mercantile Exchange | accessdate=June 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title=ISE Traded Products | publisher=International Securities Exchange | url=http://www.iseoptions.com/products_traded.aspx | accessdate=June 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070511003741/http://www.iseoptions.com/products_traded.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 11, 2007}}</ref>\n* Stock options\n* [[Bond option]]s and other [[interest rate derivative|interest rate options]]\n* [[Stock market index option]]s or, simply, index options and\n* [[Options on futures contracts]]\n* [[Callable bull/bear contract]]\n\n====Over-the-counter options====\n[[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] options (OTC options, also called \"dealer options\") are traded between two private parties, and are not listed on an exchange. The terms of an OTC option are unrestricted and may be individually tailored to meet any business need. In general, the option writer is a well-capitalized institution (in order to prevent the credit risk). Option types commonly traded over the counter include:\n* Interest rate options\n* Currency cross rate options, and\n* Options on [[swap (finance)|swaps]] or [[swaption]]s.\n\nBy avoiding an exchange, users of OTC options can narrowly tailor the terms of the option contract to suit individual business requirements. In addition, OTC option transactions generally do not need to be advertised to the market and face little or no regulatory requirements. However, OTC counterparties must establish credit lines with each other, and conform to each other's clearing and settlement procedures.\n\nWith few exceptions,<ref>{{Citation | author=Elinor Mills | title=Google unveils unorthodox stock option auction | publisher=CNet | url=http://news.cnet.com/Google+unveils+unorthodox+stock+option+auction/2100-1030_3-6143227.html | date=December 12, 2006 | accessdate=June 19, 2007}}</ref> there are no [[secondary market]]s for [[employee stock options]]. These must either be exercised by the original grantee or allowed to expire.\n\n=== Exchange trading===\nThe most common way to trade options is via standardized options contracts that are listed by various [[futures exchange|futures and options exchanges]].\n<ref>{{Citation\n  | last =Harris  | first =Larry\n  | author-link =\n  | title =Trading and Exchanges\n  | place=\n  | publisher =Oxford University Press\n  | year =2003\n  | location =\n  | volume =\n  | edition =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id = pp.26\u201327 }}\n</ref> Listings and prices are tracked and can be looked up by [[Option symbol|ticker symbol]]. By publishing continuous, live markets for option prices, an exchange enables independent parties to engage in [[price discovery]] and execute transactions. As an intermediary to both sides of the transaction, the benefits the exchange provides to the transaction include:\n* Fulfillment of the contract is backed by the credit of the exchange, which typically has the highest [[bond rating|rating]] (AAA),\n* Counterparties remain anonymous,\n* Enforcement of market regulation to ensure fairness and transparency, and\n* Maintenance of orderly markets, especially during fast trading conditions.\n\n===Basic trades (American style)===\nThese trades are described from the point of view of a speculator. If they are combined with other positions, they can also be used in [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]]. An option contract in US markets usually represents 100 shares of the underlying security.<ref>[http://invest-faq.com/cbc/deriv-option-basics.html invest-faq] or [http://www.wfu.edu/~palmitar/Law&Valuation/chapter%204/4-4-1.htm Law & Valuation] for typical size of option contract</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/pdf/understanding.pdf | title=Understanding Stock Options | publisher=[[Options Clearing Corporation|The Options Clearing Corporation]] and [[CBOE]] |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Long call====\n[[File:Long call option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from buying a call.]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to increase can buy a [[call option]] to purchase the stock at a fixed price (\"[[strike price]]\") at a later date, rather than purchase the stock outright. The cash outlay on the option is the premium. The trader would have no obligation to buy the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. The risk of loss would be limited to the premium paid, unlike the possible loss had the stock been bought outright.\n\nThe holder of an American-style call option can sell the option holding at any time until the expiration date, and would consider doing so when the stock's spot price is above the exercise price, especially if the holder expects the price of the option to drop. By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can realise an immediate profit. Alternatively, the trader can exercise the option \u2014 for example, if there is no secondary market for the options \u2014 and then sell the stock, realising a profit. A trader would make a profit if the spot price of the shares rises by more than the premium. For example, if the exercise price is 100 and premium paid is 10, then if the spot price of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.\n\nIf the stock price at expiration is lower than the exercise price, the holder of the options at that time will let the call contract expire and only lose the premium (or the price paid on transfer).\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Long put====\n[[File:Long put option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from buying a put]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to decrease can buy a [[put option]] to sell the stock at a fixed price (\"strike price\") at a later date. The trader will be under no obligation to sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price, he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.\n\nIt is important to note that one who exercises a put option, does not necessarily need to own the underlying asset. Specifically, one does not need to own the underlying stock in order to sell it. The reason for this is that one can [[Short (finance)|short sell]] that underlying stock.\n\n====Short call====\n[[File:Short call option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from writing a call.]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to decrease can sell the stock [[Short (finance)|short]] or instead sell, or \"write\", a call. The trader selling a call has an obligation to sell the stock to the call buyer at a fixed price (\"strike price\"). If the seller does not own the stock when the option is exercised, he is obligated to purchase the stock from the market at the then market price. If the stock price decreases, the seller of the call (call writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the stock price increases over the strike price by more than the amount of the premium, the seller will lose money, with the potential loss being unlimited.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Short put====\n[[File:Short put option.svg|thumb|200px|Payoff from writing a put.]]\nA trader who expects a stock's price to increase can buy the stock or instead sell, or \"write\", a put. The trader selling a put has an obligation to buy the stock from the put buyer at a fixed price (\"strike price\"). If the stock price at expiration is above the strike price, the seller of the put (put writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the stock price at expiration is below the strike price by more than the amount of the premium, the trader will lose money, with the potential loss being up to the strike price minus the premium. A benchmark index for the performance of a cash-secured short put option position is the [[CBOE S&P 500 PutWrite Index]] (ticker PUT).\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Options strategies===\n{{Main|Options strategy}}\n[[File:Long butterfly option.svg|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from buying a butterfly spread.]]\n[[File:Short straddle option.svg|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from selling a straddle.]]\n[[File:Covered Call.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from a covered call.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Protective Put.gif|thumb|right|200px|Payoffs from a protective put.]] -->\n\nCombining any of the four basic kinds of option trades (possibly with different exercise prices and maturities) and the two basic kinds of stock trades (long and short) allows a variety of [[options strategies]]. Simple strategies usually combine only a few trades, while more complicated strategies can combine several.\n\nStrategies are often used to engineer a particular risk profile to movements in the underlying security. For example, buying a [[Butterfly (options)|butterfly]] spread (long one X1 call, short two X2 calls, and long one X3 call) allows a trader to profit if the stock price on the expiration date is near the middle exercise price, X2, and does not expose the trader to a large loss.\n\nAn [[iron condor]] is a strategy that is similar to a butterfly spread, but with different strikes for the short options&nbsp;\u2013 offering a larger likelihood of profit but with a lower net credit compared to the butterfly spread.\n\nSelling a [[straddle]] (selling both a put and a call at the same exercise price) would give a trader a greater profit than a butterfly if the final stock price is near the exercise price, but might result in a large loss.\n\nSimilar to the straddle is the [[Strangle (options)|strangle]] which is also constructed by a call and a put, but whose strikes are different, reducing the net debit of the trade, but also reducing the risk of loss in the trade.\n\nOne well-known strategy is the [[covered call]], in which a trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and sells a call. If the stock price rises above the exercise price, the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit. If the stock price falls, the call will not be exercised, and any loss incurred to the trader will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. Overall, the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put. This relationship is known as [[put\u2013call parity]] and offers insights for financial theory. A benchmark index for the performance of a [[buy-write]] strategy is the [[CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index]] (ticker symbol BXM).\n\nAnother very common strategy is the [[protective put]], in which a trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock, hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the underlying stock. The maximum loss is limited to the purchase price of the underlying stock less the strike price of the put option and the premium paid. A protective put is also known as a married put.\n\n==Types==\nOptions can be classified in a few ways.\n\n===According to the option rights===\n* Call options give the holder the right\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to buy something at a specific price for a specific time period.\n* Put options give the holder the right\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to sell something at a specific price for a specific time period.\n\n===According to the underlying assets===\n* Equity option\n* Bond option\n* Future option\n* Index option\n* Commodity option\n* Currency option\n\n===Other option types===\nAnother important class of options, particularly in the U.S., are [[employee stock option]]s, which are awarded by a company to their employees as a form of incentive compensation. Other types of options exist in many financial contracts, for example [[Option (law)|real estate options]] are often used to assemble large parcels of land, and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] options are usually included in [[mortgage loan]]s. However, many of the valuation and risk management principles apply across all financial options. There are two more types of options; covered and naked.<ref name=\"McMillan2011\">{{cite book|author=Lawrence G.

There are many pricing models in use, although all essentially incorporate the concepts of [[Rational pricing#Options|rational pricing]] (i.e. [[risk neutral]]ity) , [[moneyness]], [[option time value]] and [[put-call parity]].\n\nThe valuation itself combines a model of the behavior ([[stochastic process|\"process\"]]) of the underlying price with a mathematical method which returns the premium as a function of the assumed behavior. \nThe models range from the (prototypical) [[Black\u2013Scholes model]] for equities,<ref>{{cite paper |first=Eric |last=Benhamou |title=Options pre-Black Scholes |url=http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Pre%20Black-Scholes.pdf |year= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Fischer |first2=Myron |last2=Scholes |year=1973 |title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=637\u2013654 |jstor=1831029 |doi=10.1086/260062}}</ref> to the [[Heath\u2013Jarrow\u2013Morton framework]] for interest rates, to the [[Heston model]] where volatility itself is considered [[stochastic]]. See [[Asset pricing]] for a listing of the various models here.\n\n===Basic decomposition===\nIn its most basic terms, the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts:\n* The first part is the '''intrinsic value''', which is defined as the difference between the market value of the [[underlying]], and the strike price of the given, option\n* The second part is the '''time value''', which depends on a set of other factors which, through a multi-variable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect the [[discounted]] [[expected value]] of that difference at expiration.\n\n===Valuation models===\n{{Main|Valuation of options}}\nAs above, the value of the option is estimated using a variety of quantitative techniques, all based on the principle of [[risk-neutral]] pricing, and using [[stochastic calculus]] in their solution. The most basic model is the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]]. More sophisticated models are used to model the [[volatility smile]]. These models are implemented using a variety of numerical techniques.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last =Reilly\n  | first =Frank K.\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =Brown  | first2 =Keith C.\n  | author2-link =\n  | title =Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management\n  | place=\n  | publisher =Thomson Southwestern\n  | year =2003\n  | location =\n  | volume =\n  | edition =7th\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id = Chapter 23 }}\n</ref> In general, standard option valuation models depend on the following factors:\n* The current market price of the underlying security,\n* the [[strike price]] of the option, particularly in relation to the current market price of the underlying (in the money vs. out of the money),\n* the cost of holding a position in the underlying security, including interest and dividends,\n* the time to [[expiration (options)|expiration]] together with any restrictions on when exercise may occur, and\n* an estimate of the future [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the underlying security's price over the life of the option.\n\nMore advanced models can require additional factors, such as an estimate of how volatility changes over time and for various underlying price levels, or the dynamics of stochastic interest rates.\n\nThe following are some of the principal valuation techniques used in practice to evaluate option contracts.\n\n====Black\u2013Scholes====\n{{Main|Black\u2013Scholes model}}\nFollowing early work by [[Louis Bachelier]] and later work by [[Robert C.

By employing the technique of constructing a risk neutral portfolio that replicates the returns of holding an option, Black and Scholes produced a closed-form solution for a European option's theoretical price.<ref>Black, Fischer and Myron S.

Others models include the [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]] and [[SABR volatility model]]s.

As such, a local volatility model is a generalisation of the [[Black-Scholes model]], where the volatility is a constant.

And some of the short rate models can be straightforwardly expressed in the HJM framework.)\nFor some purposes, e.g., valuation of [[mortgage backed securities]], this can be a big simplification; regardless, the framework is often preferred for models of higher dimension.\nNote that for the simpler options here, i.e. those mentioned initially, the [[Black model]] can instead be employed, with certain assumptions.\n\n===Model implementation===\n{{Further|Valuation of options}}\nOnce a valuation model has been chosen, there are a number of different techniques used to take the mathematical models to implement the models.\n\n====Analytic techniques====\nIn some cases, one can take the [[mathematical model]] and using analytical methods develop [[Closed-form expression|closed form solutions]] such as the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]] and the [[Black model]]. The resulting solutions are readily computable, as are their [[Greeks (finance)|\"Greeks\"]]. Although the [[Roll\u2013Geske\u2013Whaley model]] applies to an American call with one dividend, for other cases of [[American option]]s, closed form solutions are not available; approximations here include [[Barone-Adesi and Whaley]], [[Bjerksund and Stensland]] and others.\n\n====Binomial tree pricing model====\n{{Main|Binomial options pricing model}}\n{{Further|Lattice model (finance)}}\nClosely following the derivation of Black and Scholes, [[John Carrington Cox|John Cox]], [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]] and [[Mark Rubinstein]] developed the original version of the [[binomial options pricing model]].<ref>[[John Carrington Cox|Cox, J.

The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the Black\u2013Scholes model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black\u2013Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black\u2013Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and [[American option]]s can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The [[Trinomial tree]] is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.  For a more general discussion, as well as for application to commodities, interest rates and hybrid instruments, see [[Lattice model (finance)]].\n\n====Monte Carlo models====\n{{Main|Monte Carlo methods for option pricing}}\nFor many classes of options, traditional valuation techniques are [[Tractable problem|intractable]] because of the complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses [[Monte Carlo simulation|simulation]] to generate random price paths of the underlying asset, each of which results in a payoff for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an [[expectation value]] for the option.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last =Crack | first =Timothy Falcon\n  | author-link =\n  | title =Basic Black\u2013Scholes: Option Pricing and Trading\n  | place=pp. 91\u2013102\n  | publisher =\n  | year =2004\n  | location =\n  | volume =\n  | edition =1st\n  | url =http://www.BasicBlackScholes.com/\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =0-9700552-2-6}}\n</ref> Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for [[american option|American styled options]] is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.\n\n====Finite difference models====\n{{Main|Finite difference methods for option pricing}}\nThe equations used to model the option are often expressed as [[partial differential equation]]s (see for example [[Black\u2013Scholes equation]]). Once expressed in this form, a [[Finite difference method|finite difference model]] can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: [[explicit method|explicit finite difference]], [[implicit method|implicit finite difference]] and the [[Crank\u2013Nicolson method]]. A trinomial tree option pricing model can be shown to be a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs&nbsp;\u2013 for example dividend yield, risk-free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these&nbsp;\u2013 that are not [[tractable problem|tractable]] in closed form.\n\n====Other models====\nOther numerical implementations which have been used to value options include [[finite element method]]s.\n\n==Risks==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"100\"\n|-\n|Example:\nA call option (also known as a CO) expiring in 99 days on 100 shares of XYZ stock is struck at $50, with XYZ currently trading at $48.

We can calculate the estimated value of the call option by applying the hedge parameters to the new model inputs as:\n::<math>dC = (0.439 \\cdot 0.5) + \\left(0.0631 \\cdot \\frac{0.5^2}{2} \\right) + (9.6 \\cdot -0.015) + (-0.022 \\cdot 1) = 0.0614</math>\nUnder this scenario, the value of the option increases by $0.0614 to $1.9514, realizing a profit of $6.14. Note that for a delta neutral portfolio, whereby the trader had also sold 44 shares of XYZ stock as a hedge, the net loss under the same scenario would be ($15.86).\n|}\nAs with all securities, trading options entails the risk of the option's value changing over time. However, unlike traditional securities, the [[Stock option return|return]] from holding an option varies non-linearly with the value of the underlying and other factors. Therefore, the risks associated with holding options are more complicated to understand and predict.\n\nIn general, the change in the value of an option can be derived from [[It\u00f4's lemma]] as:\n\n::<math>dC=\\Delta dS + \\Gamma \\frac{dS^2}{2} + \\kappa d\\sigma + \\theta dt \\,</math>\n\nwhere the [[Greeks (finance)|Greeks]] <math>\\Delta</math>, <math>\\Gamma</math>, <math>\\kappa</math> and <math>\\theta</math> are the standard hedge parameters calculated from an option valuation model, such as [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes]], and <math>dS</math>, <math>d\\sigma</math> and <math>dt</math> are unit changes in the underlying's price, the underlying's volatility and time, respectively.\n\nThus, at any point in time, one can estimate the risk inherent in holding an option by calculating its hedge parameters and then estimating the expected change in the model inputs, <math>dS</math>, <math>d\\sigma</math> and <math>dt</math>, provided the changes in these values are small. This technique can be used effectively to understand and manage the risks associated with standard options. For instance, by offsetting a holding in an option with the quantity <math>-\\Delta</math> of shares in the underlying, a trader can form a [[delta neutral]] portfolio that is hedged from loss for small changes in the underlying's price. The corresponding price sensitivity formula for this portfolio <math>\\Pi</math> is:\n\n::<math>d\\Pi=\\Delta dS  + \\Gamma \\frac{dS^2}{2} + \\kappa d\\sigma + \\theta dt = \\Gamma \\frac{dS^2}{2} + \\kappa d\\sigma + \\theta dt\\,</math>\n\n===Pin risk===\n{{Main|Pin risk}}\nA special situation called [[Pin risk (options)|pin risk]] can arise when the underlying closes at or very close to the option's strike value on the last day the option is traded prior to expiration. The option writer (seller) may not know with certainty whether or not the option will actually be exercised or be allowed to expire. Therefore, the option writer may end up with a large, unwanted residual position in the underlying when the markets open on the next trading day after expiration, regardless of his or her best efforts to avoid such a residual.\n\n===Counterparty risk===\nA further, often ignored, risk in derivatives such as options is [[counterparty credit risk|counterparty risk]]. In an option contract this risk is that the seller won't sell or buy the underlying asset as agreed. The risk can be minimized by using a financially strong intermediary able to make good on the trade, but in a major panic or crash the number of defaults can overwhelm even the strongest intermediaries.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Area yield options contract]]\n* [[Ascot (finance)]]\n* [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]\n* [[Dilutive security]]\n* [[Eurex]]\n* [[Euronext.liffe]]\n* [[International Securities Exchange]]\n* [[NYSE Arca]]\n* [[Philadelphia Stock Exchange]]\n* [[LEAPS (finance)]]\n* [[Options backdating]]\n* [[Options Clearing Corporation]]\n* [[Options spread]]\n* [[Options strategy]]\n* [[Option symbol]]\n* [[Real options analysis]]\n* [[PnL Explained]]\n* [[Pin risk (options)]]\n* [[XVA]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fischer Black and Myron S.
