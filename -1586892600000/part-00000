It consists of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN), [[Australian Army]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and several \"tri-service\" units. The ADF has a strength of just over 85,000 full-time personnel and [[Military reserve force|active reservists]] and is supported by the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] and several other civilian agencies.\n\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] established the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent [[chain of command]]. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics, and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.\n\nThe ADF is technologically sophisticated but relatively small. Although the ADF's 58,206 full-time active-duty personnel and 21,694 active reservists make it the largest military in Oceania, it is smaller than most Asian military forces. Nonetheless, the ADF is supported by a significant budget by worldwide standards and can deploy forces in multiple locations outside Australia Wagga air base NSW Australia.\n\n==Role==\n\nThe ADF's legal standing draws on the executive government sections of the [[Australian Constitution]]. [[Section 51(vi) of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51 (vi)]] gives the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] the power to make laws regarding Australia's defence and defence forces. Section 114 of the Constitution prevents the States from raising armed forces without the permission of the Commonwealth and Section 119 gives the Commonwealth responsibility for defending Australia from invasion and sets out the conditions under which the government can deploy the defence force domestically.{{sfn|Khosa|2010|p=2}}\n\nSection 68 of the Constitution sets out the ADF's command arrangements. The Section states that \"the command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] as the [[Monarchy of Australia#Australian Defence Force|Queen's]] representative\". In practice, the Governor-General does not play an active part in the ADF's command structure, and the elected government controls the ADF. The [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] and several subordinate ministers [[Civilian control of the military|exercise this control]]. The Minister acts on most matters alone, though the [[Australian Intelligence Community#National Security Committee of Cabinet (Australia)|National Security Committee of Cabinet]] considers important matters. The Minister then advises the Governor-General who acts as advised in the normal form of [[executive government]].{{sfn|Khosa|2010|p=2}} The Commonwealth Government has never been required by the Constitution or legislation to seek [[Parliament of Australia|parliamentary]] approval for decisions to deploy military forces overseas or go to war.{{sfn|McKeown|Jordan|2010|p=1}}\n\nThe ADF's current priorities are set out in the ''[[2016 Defence White Paper]]'', which identifies three main areas of focus. The first of these is to defend Australia from direct attack or coercion. The second priority is to contribute to the security of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The third priority is to contribute to stability across the Indo-Pacific region and a \"rules-based global order which supports our interests\".{{sfn|Australian Government|2016|pp=17\u201318}} The white paper states that the government will place equal weight on the three priorities when developing the ADF's capabilities.{{sfn|Australian Government|2016|p=71}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Military history of Australia|History of the Royal Australian Navy|History of the Australian Army|History of the Royal Australian Air Force}}\n\n===Formation===\n[[Image:HMAS Melbourne (R21) and USS Midway (CV-41) underway, 16 May 1981 (6380752).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An aerial photo of an aircraft carrier with several aircraft on her flight deck. Another carrier is visible in the background.|The retirement of the aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} without replacement in 1982 marked a shift away from the policy of \"forward defence\".{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=55}}]]\nAustralia has maintained military forces since [[Federation of Australia|federation as a nation]] in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the [[Australian Army]] and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states had maintained.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=67}} In 1911, the Government established the [[Royal Australian Navy]], which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=467}} The Army established the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in 1912 which was separated to form the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1921.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|pp=61, 457}} The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during [[Military history of Australia during World War I|World War I]] and [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]], and took part in conflicts in Asia during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Horner|2007|pp=145\u2013150}}\n\nThe importance of [[Joint warfare|'joint' warfare]] was made clear to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for the appointment of a [[commander in chief]] of the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=42}} The absence of a central authority resulted in poor coordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different [[military doctrine]].{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=44}}\n\nThe need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis as a result of the inefficient arrangements which at times hindered the military's efforts [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|during the Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=44}} In 1973, the Secretary of the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Arthur Tange]], submitted a report to the [[Government of Australia|Government]] that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single Department of Defence and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The government accepted these recommendations and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=47}}\n\n===Defence of Australia era===\n[[Image:Kangaroo 89.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of men wearing green military uniforms walking across barren ground.|Australian soldiers lead a column of American troops during Exercise Kangaroo '89, which was held in northern Australia.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=65}}]]\nUntil the 1970s, Australia's military strategy centred on the concept of 'forward defence', in which the role of the Australian military was to co-operate with allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. In 1969, when the United States began the [[Guam Doctrine]] and the British withdrew '[[east of Suez]]', Australia developed a defence policy which emphasised self-reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. This was known as the [[Defence of Australia Policy]]. Under this policy, the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia's northern maritime approaches (the \"Air-Sea Gap\") against enemy attack.{{sfn|Tewes|Rayner|Kavanaugh|2004}} In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to northern Australia.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=72}}\n\nAt this time, the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of [[Operation Morris Dance]], in which several warships and a rifle [[Company (military)|company]] deployed to the waters off [[Fiji]] in response to the [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat]]. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=225\u2013227}}\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Government has increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to [[Australian contribution to UNTAG|Namibia]] in early 1989, [[Australian contribution to UNTAC in Cambodia 1992\u20131993|Cambodia]] between 1992 and 1993, [[Operation Solace|Somalia]] in 1993, [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|Rwanda]] between 1994 and 1995 and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]] in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=228\u2013255}}\n\nThe [[Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War]] was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|clearance diving team]] deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF's capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a [[List of recent Australian warship deployments to the Middle East|frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea]] to enforce the [[Iraq sanctions|trade sanctions imposed on Iraq]].{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=231\u2013237}}\n\n===East Timor and after===\n[[File:Australian C-130 H being unloaded at Tallil Air Base in April 2003.jpeg|thumb|alt=Rear view of a propeller-driven plane on the ground with its cargo door open and propellers still spinning|A RAAF C-130 Hercules being unloaded at Tallil Air Base, Iraq, during April 2003]]\n\nIn 1996, [[John Howard]] led the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party's]] election campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, there were significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's allies]] to manage potential security threats.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=95\u201396}} From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nThe ADF's experiences during the [[International Force for East Timor|deployment to East Timor in 1999]] led to significant changes in Australia's defence policies and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large ADF force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War, and revealed shortcomings in its ability to mount and sustain such operations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Sinclair |title=Operation Chaos |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/19/1037490107525.html |work=[[The Age]] |date=19 December 2002 |access-date=6 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the Government released a new Defence White Paper, ''Defence 2000&nbsp;\u2013 Our Future Defence Force'', that placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] Defence expenditure by 3% per year;{{sfn|Thomson|2005|p=11}} in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% per annum in real terms in the period to 2012\u201313.{{sfn|Thomson|2012|p=25}} In 2003 and 2005, the ''Defence Updates'' emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.{{sfn|Thomson|2006|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nSince 2000, the ADF's expanded force structure and deployment capabilities have been put to the test on several occasions. Following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the United States, Australia committed a [[special forces]] task group and an [[air-to-air refuelling]] aircraft to operations in [[Afghanistan]], and naval warships to the [[Persian Gulf]] as [[Operation Slipper]].{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|pp=8\u20139}} In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 [[F/A-18 Hornet]] aircraft, took part in the [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=248}}\n\nThe ADF was subsequently involved in the reconstruction of Iraq. From 2003 until 2005 this was mainly limited to a [[Security Detachment Iraq (Australia)|Security Detachment]] which protected the Australian embassy, the attachment of officers to multi-national headquarters, small numbers of transport and maritime patrol aircraft, and teams of air traffic controllers and medical personnel.<ref name=\"Fielding Concluding Australia\u2019s Military Commitment in Iraq\">{{cite web|last1=Fielding|first1=Marcus|title=Concluding Australia\u2019s Military Commitment in Iraq|url=http://www.mhhv.org.au/?p=340|publisher=Military History and Heritage Victoria|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref> From 2005 until 2008 a [[battalion]]-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the [[Al Muthanna Task Group]], and later [[Overwatch Battle Group (West)]]) was stationed in southern Iraq.

In line with a 2007 election commitment, the [[Rudd Government (2007\u201310)|Rudd Government]] withdrew combat-related forces from Iraq in mid-2008, and most of the remaining Australian units left the country the next year.<ref name=\"Fielding Concluding Australia\u2019s Military Commitment in Iraq\" /><ref name=\"SBS Iraq timeline\">{{cite web|title=Timeline: Australian troops in Iraq|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2008/06/02/timeline-australian-troops-iraq|website=SBS News|publisher=SBS|access-date=31 December 2016|date=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Five ASLAVs in Afghanistan during March 2011.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour photo of five military armoured fighting vehicles driving through dusty terrain|Australian Army [[ASLAV]] armoured vehicles in Afghanistan during 2011]]\n\nThe ADF also undertook several operations in Australia's immediate region during the 2000s.

This increase in spending did not occur, however.{{sfn|Edwards|2016|pp=20\u201321}} The ''Defence White Paper 2013'' had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances.

Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes that it needs to make a contribution to maintaining the rules-based order globally. There is also a risk that [[climate change]], weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.{{sfn|Australian Government|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\n[[Demographics of Australia|Australian demographic trends]] will put pressure on the ADF in the future.{{sfn|Henry|2005|p=19}} Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian [[labour market]] each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget.{{sfn|Henry|2005|pp=22\u201323}} Few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=280}}\n\nThe ADF has developed strategies to respond to Australia's changing strategic environment. The ''2016 Defence White Paper'' states that \"the Government will ensure Australia maintains a regionally superior ADF\nwith the highest levels of military capability and scientific and technological sophistication\". To this end, the government intends to improve the ADF's combat power and expand the number of military personnel. This will include introducing new technologies and capabilities.

During the 1990s the strength of the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the outsourcing of some military functions. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military's strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003\u201304 to 2005\u201306 financial years due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009\u201310 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014\u201315. The size of the ADF grew between the 2014\u201315 and 2016\u201317 financial years.{{sfn|Thomson|2017|p=64}} The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995\u201396 financial year.{{sfn|Thomson|2017|p=65}}\n\nThe ADF is small compared to [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel|many other national militaries]]. Both the number of personnel in the ADF and the share of the Australian population this represents is smaller than that in many countries in Australia's immediate region. Several [[NATO]] member countries, including France and the United States, also have a higher share of their population in the military.{{sfn|Thomson|2005|pp=4\u20135}} This is a continuation of long-term trends, as outside of major wars Australia has always had a relatively small military. The size of the force is a result of Australia's relatively small population and the military being structured around a maritime strategy focused on the RAN and RAAF rather than a manpower-intensive army.{{sfn|Thomson|2005|p=5}}{{sfn|Australian Government|2014|p=33}}\n\n===Reserves===\n\nEach of the branches of the ADF has a reserve component.

This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2001|p=29}} As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2001|p=30}} It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=46}} Successive governments since the 1960s have also been reluctant to use the 'call out' powers to require reservists to undertake active service.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Hugh|title=A \u2018total force\u2019 at last?

Large numbers of reserve personnel have also been deployed as part of ADF operations in Australia's region; this has included the deployment of Army Reserve [[Company (military unit)|rifle companies]] to East Timor and the Solomon Islands. Smaller numbers of reservists have taken part in operations in locations distant from Australia.{{sfn|Department of Defence|2009|p=90}} Notably, companies of the Army Reserve [[1st Commando Regiment (Australia)|1st Commando Regiment]] were regularly deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Special Operations Task Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=1st Commando Regiment|url=https://www.army.gov.au/our-people/units/special-operations-command/1st-commando-regiment|publisher=Australian Army|access-date=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\n[[File:ADFA Aerial.jpg|thumb|The Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra]]\nIndividual training of Australian servicemen and women is generally provided by the services in their own training institutions. Each service has its own training organisation to manage this individual training. Where possible, however, individual training is increasingly being provided through tri-service schools.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=281}}\n\nMilitary academies include {{HMAS|Creswell}} for the Navy, [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], for the Army, and the [[Officers' Training School RAAF|Officers' Training School]] for the Air Force.

These functions are primarily the responsibility of civilian agencies, and the ADF's role in them requires specific justification and authorisation.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=178}}\n\nElements of the ADF are frequently \"[[Military aid to the civil power|called out]]\" to contribute to relief efforts following natural disasters in Australia or overseas. The ADF's role in these efforts is set out in Australia's emergency management plans. The ADF typically contributes specialist capabilities, such as engineers or transport, to support the civil authorities.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2014|pp=11\u201313, 39}} For major disasters, this can involve a large-scale deployment of personnel and assets. While the ADF has a commitment to assist relief efforts, several defence white papers have specified that this is a secondary responsibility to the force's focus on maintaining combat capabilities. As a result, requests for assistance have to be balanced against military priorities.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2014|pp=30\u201331}} No elements of the ADF are specifically tasked with or equipped for disaster relief efforts.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2014|p=39}}\n\nThe ADF can also be tasked with providing aid to civil authorities outside of natural disasters; for instance in response to [[industrial action]] or to assist civilian police maintain law and order. This rarely occurs, however, and most Australians consider the use of military personnel to break strikes or undertake law enforcement to be inappropriate.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Elizabeth|title=Call Out the Troops: an examination of the legal basis for Australian Defence Force involvement in 'non-defence' matters|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98rp08|publisher=Parliament of Australia|access-date=1 January 2017|date=1997}}</ref>{{sfn|Sutton|2017|pp=42}} Due to the political sensitivities associated with strike breaking, the ADF conducts little planning or other preparations for this role and the ''Defence Act'' explicitly states that reservists may not be called out or deployed in response to industrial action.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=179}}\n[[File:HMAS Albany 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=A grey warship underway.

Force''' ('''ADF''') is the [[Armed forces|military organisation]] responsible for the defence of [[Australia]]. It consists of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN), [[Australian Army]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and several \"tri-service\" units. The ADF has a strength of just over 85,000 full-time personnel and [[Military reserve force|active reservists]] and is supported by the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] and several other civilian agencies.\n\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] established the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent [[chain of command]]. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics, and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.\n\nThe ADF is technologically sophisticated but relatively small. Although the ADF's 58,206 full-time active-duty personnel and 21,694 active reservists make it the largest military in Oceania, it is smaller than most Asian military forces. Nonetheless, the ADF is supported by a significant budget by worldwide standards and can deploy forces in multiple locations outside Australia.\n\n==Role==\n\nThe ADF's legal standing draws on the executive government sections of the [[Australian Constitution]]. [[Section 51(vi) of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51 (vi)]] gives the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] the power to make laws regarding Australia's defence and defence forces. Section 114 of the Constitution prevents the States from raising armed forces without the permission of the Commonwealth and Section 119 gives the Commonwealth responsibility for defending Australia from invasion and sets out the conditions under which the government can deploy the defence force domestically.{{sfn|Khosa|2010|p=2}}\n\nSection 68 of the Constitution sets out the ADF's command arrangements. The Section states that \"the command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] as the [[Monarchy of Australia#Australian Defence Force|Queen's]] representative\". In practice, the Governor-General does not play an active part in the ADF's command structure, and the elected government controls the ADF. The [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] and several subordinate ministers [[Civilian control of the military|exercise this control]]. The Minister acts on most matters alone, though the [[Australian Intelligence Community#National Security Committee of Cabinet (Australia)|National Security Committee of Cabinet]] considers important matters. The Minister then advises the Governor-General who acts as advised in the normal form of [[executive government]].{{sfn|Khosa|2010|p=2}} The Commonwealth Government has never been required by the Constitution or legislation to seek [[Parliament of Australia|parliamentary]] approval for decisions to deploy military forces overseas or go to war.{{sfn|McKeown|Jordan|2010|p=1}}\n\nThe ADF's current priorities are set out in the ''[[2016 Defence White Paper]]'', which identifies three main areas of focus. The first of these is to defend Australia from direct attack or coercion. The second priority is to contribute to the security of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The third priority is to contribute to stability across the Indo-Pacific region and a \"rules-based global order which supports our interests\".{{sfn|Australian Government|2016|pp=17\u201318}} The white paper states that the government will place equal weight on the three priorities when developing the ADF's capabilities.{{sfn|Australian Government|2016|p=71}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Military history of Australia|History of the Royal Australian Navy|History of the Australian Army|History of the Royal Australian Air Force}}\n\n===Formation===\n[[Image:HMAS Melbourne (R21) and USS Midway (CV-41) underway, 16 May 1981 (6380752).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An aerial photo of an aircraft carrier with several aircraft on her flight deck. Another carrier is visible in the background.|The retirement of the aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} without replacement in 1982 marked a shift away from the policy of \"forward defence\".{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=55}}]]\nAustralia has maintained military forces since [[Federation of Australia|federation as a nation]] in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the [[Australian Army]] and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states had maintained.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=67}} In 1911, the Government established the [[Royal Australian Navy]], which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=467}} The Army established the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in 1912 which was separated to form the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1921.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|pp=61, 457}} The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during [[Military history of Australia during World War I|World War I]] and [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]], and took part in conflicts in Asia during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Horner|2007|pp=145\u2013150}}\n\nThe importance of [[Joint warfare|'joint' warfare]] was made clear to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for the appointment of a [[commander in chief]] of the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=42}} The absence of a central authority resulted in poor coordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different [[military doctrine]].{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=44}}\n\nThe need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis as a result of the inefficient arrangements which at times hindered the military's efforts [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|during the Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=44}} In 1973, the Secretary of the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Arthur Tange]], submitted a report to the [[Government of Australia|Government]] that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single Department of Defence and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The government accepted these recommendations and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=47}}\n\n===Defence of Australia era===\n[[Image:Kangaroo 89.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of men wearing green military uniforms walking across barren ground.|Australian soldiers lead a column of American troops during Exercise Kangaroo '89, which was held in northern Australia.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=65}}]]\nUntil the 1970s, Australia's military strategy centred on the concept of 'forward defence', in which the role of the Australian military was to co-operate with allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. In 1969, when the United States began the [[Guam Doctrine]] and the British withdrew '[[east of Suez]]', Australia developed a defence policy which emphasised self-reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. This was known as the [[Defence of Australia Policy]]. Under this policy, the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia's northern maritime approaches (the \"Air-Sea Gap\") against enemy attack.{{sfn|Tewes|Rayner|Kavanaugh|2004}} In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to northern Australia.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=72}}\n\nAt this time, the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of [[Operation Morris Dance]], in which several warships and a rifle [[Company (military)|company]] deployed to the waters off [[Fiji]] in response to the [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat]]. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=225\u2013227}}\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Government has increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to [[Australian contribution to UNTAG|Namibia]] in early 1989, [[Australian contribution to UNTAC in Cambodia 1992\u20131993|Cambodia]] between 1992 and 1993, [[Operation Solace|Somalia]] in 1993, [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|Rwanda]] between 1994 and 1995 and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]] in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=228\u2013255}}\n\nThe [[Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War]] was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|clearance diving team]] deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF's capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a [[List of recent Australian warship deployments to the Middle East|frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea]] to enforce the [[Iraq sanctions|trade sanctions imposed on Iraq]].{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=231\u2013237}}\n\n===East Timor and after===\n[[File:Australian C-130 H being unloaded at Tallil Air Base in April 2003.jpeg|thumb|alt=Rear view of a propeller-driven plane on the ground with its cargo door open and propellers still spinning|A RAAF C-130 Hercules being unloaded at Tallil Air Base, Iraq, during April 2003]]\n\nIn 1996, [[John Howard]] led the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party's]] election campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, there were significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's allies]] to manage potential security threats.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=95\u201396}} From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.{{sfn|Horner|2001|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nThe ADF's experiences during the [[International Force for East Timor|deployment to East Timor in 1999]] led to significant changes in Australia's defence policies and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large ADF force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War, and revealed shortcomings in its ability to mount and sustain such operations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Sinclair |title=Operation Chaos |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/19/1037490107525.html |work=[[The Age]] |date=19 December 2002 |access-date=6 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the Government released a new Defence White Paper, ''Defence 2000&nbsp;\u2013 Our Future Defence Force'', that placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] Defence expenditure by 3% per year;{{sfn|Thomson|2005|p=11}} in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% per annum in real terms in the period to 2012\u201313.{{sfn|Thomson|2012|p=25}} In 2003 and 2005, the ''Defence Updates'' emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.{{sfn|Thomson|2006|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nSince 2000, the ADF's expanded force structure and deployment capabilities have been put to the test on several occasions. Following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the United States, Australia committed a [[special forces]] task group and an [[air-to-air refuelling]] aircraft to operations in [[Afghanistan]], and naval warships to the [[Persian Gulf]] as [[Operation Slipper]].{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|pp=8\u20139}} In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 [[F/A-18 Hornet]] aircraft, took part in the [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=248}}\n\nThe ADF was subsequently involved in the reconstruction of Iraq. From 2003 until 2005 this was mainly limited to a [[Security Detachment Iraq (Australia)|Security Detachment]] which protected the Australian embassy, the attachment of officers to multi-national headquarters, small numbers of transport and maritime patrol aircraft, and teams of air traffic controllers and medical personnel.<ref name=\"Fielding Concluding Australia\u2019s Military Commitment in Iraq\">{{cite web|last1=Fielding|first1=Marcus|title=Concluding Australia\u2019s Military Commitment in Iraq|url=http://www.mhhv.org.au/?p=340|publisher=Military History and Heritage Victoria|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref> From 2005 until 2008 a [[battalion]]-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the [[Al Muthanna Task Group]], and later [[Overwatch Battle Group (West)]]) was stationed in southern Iraq. In addition, teams of ADF personnel were deployed to train Iraqi military units.

Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes that it needs to make a contribution to maintaining the rules-based order globally. There is also a risk that [[climate change]], weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.{{sfn|Australian Government|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\n[[Demographics of Australia|Australian demographic trends]] will put pressure on the ADF in the future.{{sfn|Henry|2005|p=19}} Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian [[labour market]] each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget.{{sfn|Henry|2005|pp=22\u201323}} Few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=280}}\n\nThe ADF has developed strategies to respond to Australia's changing strategic environment.

During the 1990s the strength of the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the outsourcing of some military functions. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military's strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003\u201304 to 2005\u201306 financial years due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009\u201310 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014\u201315. The size of the ADF grew between the 2014\u201315 and 2016\u201317 financial years.{{sfn|Thomson|2017|p=64}} The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995\u201396 financial year.{{sfn|Thomson|2017|p=65}}\n\nThe ADF is small compared to [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel|many other national militaries]]. Both the number of personnel in the ADF and the share of the Australian population this represents is smaller than that in many countries in Australia's immediate region. Several [[NATO]] member countries, including France and the United States, also have a higher share of their population in the military.{{sfn|Thomson|2005|pp=4\u20135}} This is a continuation of long-term trends, as outside of major wars Australia has always had a relatively small military. The size of the force is a result of Australia's relatively small population and the military being structured around a maritime strategy focused on the RAN and RAAF rather than a manpower-intensive army.{{sfn|Thomson|2005|p=5}}{{sfn|Australian Government|2014|p=33}}\n\n===Reserves===\n\nEach of the branches of the ADF has a reserve component.

This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2001|p=29}} As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2001|p=30}} It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=46}} Successive governments since the 1960s have also been reluctant to use the 'call out' powers to require reservists to undertake active service.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Hugh|title=A \u2018total force\u2019 at last?

Large numbers of reserve personnel have also been deployed as part of ADF operations in Australia's region; this has included the deployment of Army Reserve [[Company (military unit)|rifle companies]] to East Timor and the Solomon Islands. Smaller numbers of reservists have taken part in operations in locations distant from Australia.{{sfn|Department of Defence|2009|p=90}} Notably, companies of the Army Reserve [[1st Commando Regiment (Australia)|1st Commando Regiment]] were regularly deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Special Operations Task Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=1st Commando Regiment|url=https://www.army.gov.au/our-people/units/special-operations-command/1st-commando-regiment|publisher=Australian Army|access-date=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\n[[File:ADFA Aerial.jpg|thumb|The Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra]]\nIndividual training of Australian servicemen and women is generally provided by the services in their own training institutions. Each service has its own training organisation to manage this individual training. Where possible, however, individual training is increasingly being provided through tri-service schools.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=281}}\n\nMilitary academies include {{HMAS|Creswell}} for the Navy, [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], for the Army, and the [[Officers' Training School RAAF|Officers' Training School]] for the Air Force.

These functions are primarily the responsibility of civilian agencies, and the ADF's role in them requires specific justification and authorisation.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=178}}\n\nElements of the ADF are frequently \"[[Military aid to the civil power|called out]]\" to contribute to relief efforts following natural disasters in Australia or overseas. The ADF's role in these efforts is set out in Australia's emergency management plans. The ADF typically contributes specialist capabilities, such as engineers or transport, to support the civil authorities.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2014|pp=11\u201313, 39}} For major disasters, this can involve a large-scale deployment of personnel and assets. While the ADF has a commitment to assist relief efforts, several defence white papers have specified that this is a secondary responsibility to the force's focus on maintaining combat capabilities. As a result, requests for assistance have to be balanced against military priorities.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2014|pp=30\u201331}} No elements of the ADF are specifically tasked with or equipped for disaster relief efforts.{{sfn|Australian National Audit Office|2014|p=39}}\n\nThe ADF can also be tasked with providing aid to civil authorities outside of natural disasters; for instance in response to [[industrial action]] or to assist civilian police maintain law and order. This rarely occurs, however, and most Australians consider the use of military personnel to break strikes or undertake law enforcement to be inappropriate.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Elizabeth|title=Call Out the Troops: an examination of the legal basis for Australian Defence Force involvement in 'non-defence' matters|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98rp08|publisher=Parliament of Australia|access-date=1 January 2017|date=1997}}</ref>{{sfn|Sutton|2017|pp=42}} Due to the political sensitivities associated with strike breaking, the ADF conducts little planning or other preparations for this role and the ''Defence Act'' explicitly states that reservists may not be called out or deployed in response to industrial action.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=179}}\n[[File:HMAS Albany 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=A grey warship underway.
