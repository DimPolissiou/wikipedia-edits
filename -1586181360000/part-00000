Visitors can join one of the many regular house tours or simply walk about at their leisure.

It has a length of {{convert|1+1/4|mile|0|spell=in}} through scenic woodland and along the edge of Half Mile Lake. The line has taken several different courses across the years, but the route along the lake has remained consistent. After opening the railway was originally run by outside company Minirail on a ten-year contract, which was not renewed due to disagreements between the two companies. Following this, Longleat took over running the railway in 1976. Many engines have run on the railway over the years, both steam and diesel; as of 2018 the railway owns three diesel locomotives. The railway also has 15 carriages, all built at Longleat between 1976 and 2013 and wearing mock [[British Railways]] [[British Rail corporate liveries#Coaching stock from 1948|crimson and cream livery]], along with several permanent way wagons. Between 2011 and 2017 the railway was known as the ''Jungle Express'', with the station and carriages given additional theming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Longleat Railway|url=https://www.longleat.co.uk/main-square/longleat-railway|website=longleat.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jungle Express (Longleat)|url=http://www.miniaturerailwayworld.co.uk/Longleat.html|website=Miniature Railway World|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://reader.exacteditions.com/issues/1759/spread/10 Profile: Longleat Railway] ''Miniature Railway Magazine'' Retrieved 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n====Current locomotives====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Beginning with Pets Corner in the 1970s and the butterfly house in the 1980s, the number of animal exhibits expanded greatly during the 2010s.\n\n==== Jungle Kingdom ====\nOriginally known as ''Pets Corner'', the revamped Jungle Kingdom opened in 2011. The centrepiece of this area is a large walk-through [[meerkat]] enclosure, the first of its kind in the UK. Two [[crested porcupine]]s share part of this enclosure with the meerkats, which have [[Rein|free rein]] of the area.

Retrieved 17 February 2017</ref>the centrepiece of this attraction is a large themed ruin with long rope walkways running across the paths, which allows visitors to safely interact with a variety of [[marmoset]]s and [[tamarin]]s.

There is also a group of [[Indian runner duck]]s who live in the stream nearby this area.\n\n==== Giant Otters and Crocodiles ==== \nBranching off from Monkey Temple, this attraction opened in 2019. Previously the enclosure was home to a colony of captive-bred [[Humboldt penguin]]s which were first displayed in 2013, however following several outbreaks of [[avian malaria]] in September 2016 <ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-37434602 Longleat Safari Park penguins die in malaria outbreak] ''[[BBC News]]'' Retrieved 17 February 2017</ref> and December 2018 <ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-46481247 Longleat shuts penguin enclosure after new malaria deaths] ''[[BBC News]]'' Retrieved 17 September 2019</ref> that resulted in the deaths of most of the colony, the decision was made to permanently close the attraction and relocate the surviving penguins. The exhibit is now divided into two enclosures for [[Giant Otter]]s and [[Cuban Crocodile]]s joined by shoals of freshwater fish and dozens of exotic butterflies who moved in.\n\n==== Animal Adventure ====\n[[File:Longleat003.jpeg|right|none|thumb|Animal Adventure rabbit]]\nContaining many animals previously kept in Pets' Corner, this area opened in 2009<ref>[http://www.leisuremanagement.co.uk/detail.cfm?pagetype=detail&subject=news&codeID=156693 Longleat's new Animal Adventure opens] ''Leisure Management'' Retrieved 17 February 2017</ref> and contains many exotic and familiar mammals, birds, reptiles and insects.

As in November 2019 a new mammal exhibit is now open replacing the butterfly house and is now home to [[Chipmunk]]s, [[Ferret]]s, [[Brazilian guinea pig]] and an adorable pair of [[Prehensile-tailed porcupine]]s.\n\n==== Jungle Cruise ====\nThe Jungle Cruise (known as the Safari Boat until 2011) is a short trip around Half Mile Lake. The journey takes visitors past the Island, which was a former home to the elderly male [[western lowland gorilla]] [[Nico (gorilla)|Nico]], the oldest gorilla in Europe, until his death aged 56 on 7 January 2018 and is now home to [[Black-and-white colobus monkey]]s.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-14550157 Longleat Safari Park western lowland gorilla marks '50th birthday]''[[BBC News]]'' Retrieved 17 February 2017</ref> At the far end of the lake is the shallow Pelican Cove containing [[Eastern white pelican]]s and Gorilla Colony, an enclosure for five male western lowland gorillas.

It has a length of {{convert|1+1/4|mile|0|spell=in}} through scenic woodland and along the edge of Half Mile Lake. The line has taken several different courses across the years, but the route along the lake has remained consistent. After opening the railway was originally run by outside company Minirail on a ten-year contract, which was not renewed due to disagreements between the two companies. Following this, Longleat took over running the railway in 1976. Many engines have run on the railway over the years, both steam and diesel; as of 2018 the railway owns three diesel locomotives. The railway also has 15 carriages, all built at Longleat between 1976 and 2013 and wearing mock [[British Railways]] [[British Rail corporate liveries#Coaching stock from 1948|crimson and cream livery]], along with several permanent way wagons. Between 2011 and 2017 the railway was known as the ''Jungle Express'', with the station and carriages given additional theming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Longleat Railway|url=https://www.longleat.co.uk/main-square/longleat-railway|website=longleat.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jungle Express (Longleat)|url=http://www.miniaturerailwayworld.co.uk/Longleat.html|website=Miniature Railway World|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://reader.exacteditions.com/issues/1759/spread/10 Profile: Longleat Railway] ''Miniature Railway Magazine'' Retrieved 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n====Current locomotives====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Beginning with Pets Corner in the 1970s and the butterfly house in the 1980s, the number of animal exhibits expanded greatly during the 2010s.\n\n==== Jungle Kingdom ====\nOriginally known as ''Pets Corner'', the revamped Jungle Kingdom opened in 2011.

The exhibit is now divided into two enclosures for [[Giant Otter]]s and [[Cuban Crocodile]]s joined by shoals of freshwater fish and dozens of exotic butterflies who moved in.\n\n==== Animal Adventure ====\n[[File:Longleat003.jpeg|right|none|thumb|Animal Adventure rabbit]]\nContaining many animals previously kept in Pets' Corner, this area opened in 2009<ref>[http://www.leisuremanagement.co.uk/detail.cfm?pagetype=detail&subject=news&codeID=156693 Longleat's new Animal Adventure opens] ''Leisure Management'' Retrieved 17 February 2017</ref> and contains many exotic and familiar mammals, birds, reptiles and insects.
