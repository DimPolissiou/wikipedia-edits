Prisoners of war from the nearby town of [[Antemnae]] were rounded up in the Circus and slaughtered while the Senate met in the adjacent [[Temple of Bellona, Rome|Temple of Bellona]]; the screams which could be heard from the Temple were a way of intimidating the Senators.<ref>Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives''; XXX.II</ref>\n\nThe Circus Flaminius was also used as a market. [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]] were often held within it. In 9 BC, it was the venue when [[Augustus]] delivered the ''Laudatio'' of Drusus.\n\n==Later history==\nThe buildings remained in use until the end of the fourth century, when the area was finally abandoned. In the middle ages the ruins of the [[Stadium of Domitian]] (the [[Piazza Navona]]) were often incorrectly identified as the Circus Flaminius.

But it was not until July 7, 1896, that [[President of Nicaragua|President]] [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]] decreed the creation of the General National Archive as the repository for the holdings of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, as well as holding the archives of the [[Municipality|municipalities]].\n\nThe [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|earthquake of March 31, 1931]] provoked a fire that destroyed the majority of the archives, including the ''Secci\u00f3n de Tierras'', which included documents from the colonial era.\n\nIn October 1959, another decree was issued to regulate the operations of the archive. Until 1979, it was under the auspices of the [[Nicaraguan Ministry of Governance|Ministry of Governance]], at which point in came under the control of the [[Nicaraguan Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports|Ministry of Culture]]. With the administrative reforms of 1988, the archive came under the General Administration of Culture of the Ministry of Education. It was later ascribed to the Nicaraguan Historical Institute and since 1990 has been run by the Nicaraguan Institute of Culture.\n\n==Functions==\nThe functions of the General National Archive include:\n*The collection, caretaking, and placing into public service the documents produced by public institutions,\n*Caring for and conserving legal and private collections,\n*and the dissemination, through printed publications and other media, of documents of historical interest.\n\n==Holdings==\nThe archive holds approximately ten million documents, which are organized in the following collections:\n*Colonial Section (1526-1821): A collection of photocopies obtained from the [[National Archives of Costa Rica]], chronologically ordered.\n*Presidential Collection (1900-1979): Administrative archives, divided into sections for the Private Secretary, Presidential Secretary, Secretary of General Command, and Secretary of Information and the Press.\n*Governance Collection (1925-1979): Archives of the Ministry of Governance and its attached bodies such as Justice, Police, and Charity.\n*Education Collection (1900-1984): The most complete collection in regards to volume, documentary structure, and years covered. This collection is not completely processed, but are mostly in chronological order.\n*Finance Collection (1931-1954): The ledgers of the Ministry of Finance. Consists of 731 books grouped by issued and ordered chronologically.\n*Nicaraguan Railroad Collection (1912-1987): Accounting books and inventories of goods and services.

But it was not until July 7, 1896, that [[President of Nicaragua|President]] [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]] decreed the creation of the General National Archive as the repository for the holdings of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, as well as holding the archives of the [[Municipality|municipalities]].\n\nThe [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|earthquake of March 31, 1931]] provoked a fire that destroyed the majority of the archives, including the ''Secci\u00f3n de Tierras'', which included documents from the colonial era.\n\nIn October 1959, another decree was issued to regulate the operations of the archive. Until 1979, it was under the auspices of the [[Nicaraguan Ministry of Governance|Ministry of Governance]], at which point in came under the control of the [[Nicaraguan Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports|Ministry of Culture]]. With the administrative reforms of 1988, the archive came under the General Administration of Culture of the Ministry of Education. It was later ascribed to the Nicaraguan Historical Institute and since 1990 has been run by the Nicaraguan Institute of Culture.\n\n==Functions==\nThe functions of the General National Archive include:\n*The collection, caretaking, and placing into public service the documents produced by public institutions,\n*Caring for and conserving legal and private collections,\n*and the dissemination, through printed publications and other media, of documents of historical interest.\n\n==Holdings==\nThe archive holds approximately ten million documents, which are organized in the following collections:\n*Colonial Section (1526-1821): A collection of photocopies obtained from the [[National Archives of Costa Rica]], chronologically ordered.\n*Presidential Collection (1900-1979): Administrative archives, divided into sections for the Private Secretary, Presidential Secretary, Secretary of General Command, and Secretary of Information and the Press.\n*Governance Collection (1925-1979): Archives of the Ministry of Governance and its attached bodies such as Justice, Police, and Charity.\n*Education Collection (1900-1984): The most complete collection in regards to volume, documentary structure, and years covered. This collection is not completely processed, but are mostly in chronological order.\n*Finance Collection (1931-1954): The ledgers of the Ministry of Finance. Consists of 731 books grouped by issued and ordered chronologically.\n*Nicaraguan Railroad Collection (1912-1987): Accounting books and inventories of goods and services. A nearly-complete collection of the now-defunct Nicaraguan Railroad Company.\n*Legislative Section (1943-1979): In numeric order, indexed.\n*\"Somoza Garc\u00eda\" Section (1923-1956): Documents related to the governmental activity of [[Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda]].

The first collected volume, which was produced in 1779, had a title page which bore an [[Allegory|allegorical]] illustration as well as the full title of the collection: '''''Gallerie des modes et des costumes fran\u00e7ais dessin\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s nature, Grav\u00e9s par le plus C\u00e9l\u00e8bres Artistes en ce genre, et color\u00e9s avec le plus grand soin par Madame Le Beau. Ouvrage commence en l'ann\u00e9e 1778. A Paris, chez le Srs Esnauts et Rapilly rue St. Jacques \u00e0 la Ville de coutances. Avec priv. Du Roi''''' (''Gallery of French fashions and costumes, drawn from life, engraved by the most celebrated artists in this medium, and hand-colored with the greatest care by Madame Le Beau;publication begun in 1778. Paris, Messrs. Esnauts and Rapilly, rue Satin-Jacques, at the sign of the City of Countances. Licensed by the King''). Importantly, this lengthier epithet indicates that the engravings of the ''Galerie'' (or ''Gallerie'', according to eighteenth-century spelling) were created \"d'apr\u00e8s nature,\" or \"after nature,\" meaning that they were intended to represent what was actually worn in the streets of Paris during the latter part of the eighteenth century.\n\nAlthough they vary in their presentation, the majority of images included in this series are ''tableaux vivants'' in which Parisians from various walks of life flaunt their quotidian fashions. These plates were completed by a group of prominent, eighteenth-century designers and engravers and are accompanied by descriptive text.  Although no private or public collection possesses a complete edition of the ''Galerie,'' the series is widely recognized for its high aesthetic value as well as its innovation within the overarching field of the fashion plate. Ren\u00e9 Colas, who compiled the major reference work ''Bibliographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du costume et de la mode'' (1933), calls it \"the most beautiful collection in existence on the fashions of the eighteenth century.\"<ref>Blum, Stella, ''Eighteenth-Century French Fashion Plates: 64 Engravings from the \"Galerie des Modes,\" 1778-1787.'' Mineola: Dover Publications, Inc., 1982, p. v</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n''Galerie des modes'' was conceived during the final decades of the 1700s, a period when France was at the forefront of fashion innovation. To quote the historian [[James Laver]],  at this time \"fashionable clothes...meant French clothes.\"<ref>Laver, James. ''Costume and Fashion: a Concise History.''London: Thame and Hudson, 1985, p. 127</ref> This supreme influence was undoubtedly strengthened by Queen Marie Antoinette as well as figures such as [[Rose Bertin]] (her dressmaker) and Monsieur [[L\u00e9onard Auti\u00e9]] (her hairdresser) who were responsible for designing her iconic courtly wardrobe.<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, pp.70-72</ref> Beginning in the 1770s (the decade during which Antoinette both married future king Louis-Auguste and assumed the title [[Queen of France and Navarre]]), women's dress came to exhibit greater variation than ever before; the fashion plate emerged under these conditions, as if to disseminate each budding trend.\n\nDespite the prominence of eighteenth-century French style, the first true fashion plates were produced for ''[[The Lady's Magazine]]'', a British publication established in 1770. Prior to this date, the majority of prints published in France, such as [[Jean Dieu de Saint-Jean| Jean Dieu de Saint-Jean's]] engravings of male and female costume at the Court of Louis XIV, were \"costume plates,\" which depicted clothes \"after the event.\" Information concerning the latest fashion was difficult to come by, so difficult, in fact, that the aforementioned Rose Bertin would travel the Continent each year in an enormous ''berline'' containing dolls dressed in the most up-to-date ''modes de Paris''.<ref>Laver, James. ''Costume and Fashion: a Concise History.''London: Thame and Hudson, 1985, pp. 144-147</ref> Ostensibly rendered \"after nature\", according to the everyday observations of prominent contemporary artists, the engravings of the ''Galerie'' thus responded to a growing demand for fashion news as well as a general gap in the market of French prints.\n\n===Publication===\nThe innovative ''Galerie des modes'' is the most expansive and perhaps the best known project of the print merchants Jacques Esnauts (or Esnault) and Michel Rapilly. Both of these men hailed from the region of [[Normandy]] (Esnauts came from [[Magny-le-D\u00e9sert]], and Rapilly came from [[Pirou]]), and the name of their publishing house, ''Ville de Coutances'', reflects these common origins. Located on the rue Saint-Jacques, this ''maison'' was established on July 6, 1773 following their brief stint at the nearby ''La Croix de Lorraine,'' where they had worked about three years earlier. Here the editors primarily published portraits of both historical and contemporary subjects; they began issuing the ''Galerie'' after obtaining a ''privil\u00e8ge'' on July 29, 1778 and continued to do so until 1787.<ref>Maxime Pr\u00e9aud, et al., ''Dictionnaire des \u00e9diteurs d'estampes \u00e0 Paris sous l'Ancien R\u00e9gime.''Promodis: Editions du Cercle de la Librairie, 1987, pp. 117-118</ref>\n\nPerhaps in an effort to emulate the prints of ''The Lady's Magazine'', various engravers, hairdressers, and booksellers had, at this time, published a number of small almanacs on contemporary fashion. In formulating their ''Galerie'', Esnauts and Rapilly combined the subjects of these early volumes (which primarily focused on hairstyles) with the high quality of engraving found in series by the prolific [[Jean-Michel Moreau|Moreau le Jeune]], such as ''Suite d'estampes pour servir \u00e0 l'Histoire des Moeurs et du Costume''.<ref>\"La Galerie des modes.\" ''The Fashion Institute'', http://fashioninstitute.canalblog.com/archives/2011/03/10/20594418.html. Accessed 20 June 2017</ref> The resulting prints were distributed at random intervals, usually in sets (''cahiers'') of six, for the price of 36 [[French livre|livres]] (around 14 euro's in today's currency). Although many historians differ on the exact number of plates issued throughout publication, it is clear that over 400 engravings were issued in what was probably more than 70 portfolios. The first ''cahiers'' focused solely on hairstyles (''coiffures'') However, from the seventh ''cahier'' onwards, the series began to represent full outfits, illustrated from head-to-toe. The first collected volume of the ''Galerie'' (published in 1779) included 96 plates which came from the initial 16 portfolios of the series and was preceded by a forty-page descriptive introduction written by the lawyer G.Fran\u00e7ois-Roger Mol\u00e9.<ref>Delpierre, Madeleine. ''Dress in France in the Eighteenth Century.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997, p.158</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===The Artists===\nThe ''Galerie'' implicated the work of numerous prominent visual artists.  In fact, the full title of the series, which was displayed in the epigraph of the collected 1779 volume, vaunts that its illustrations were drawn by \"the most celebrated artists (\"les plus c\u00e9lebres artistes\") of the period, all of which had achieved the highest level of mastery in their medium. Recognized as some of the best fashion illustrators of their time, the designers tied to the project included Pierre Thomas Le Clerc (or Lecl\u00e9re), Claude Louis Desrais, Fran\u00e7ois Louis Joseph Watteau (the grandnephew of [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau]]), Augustin de Saint-Aubin, and Jean-Baptiste Martin. Claude-Ferdinand Gaillard, Jean-Baptiste Patas, Pierre Andrien Le Beau, Nicolas Dupin, his son Jean Pierre Julien, Etienne Claude Voysard, Jean Alexandre Aveline, P\u00e9lissier, Jacques Le Roy, J.P. Vossinik (or Wossinik), and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Janinet appear to have been the enlisted engravers. In certain cases, the draftsman Martin seems to have acted as both the designer and engraver. To quote Peter McNeil and Sanda Miller's ''Fashion Writing and Criticism: History, Theory, Practice'', the compositions completed by each one of these artists demonstrate \"the strong influence of figurative painting in their creation.\"<ref>McNeil, Peter, and Sanda Miller. ''Fashion Writing and Criticism: History, Theory, Practice.'' London and New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014, p.68</ref>\n\nAlthough there exist no contracts that officially confirm the involvement of these artists, their respective contributions are marked by signatures.<ref>\"La Galerie des modes.\" ''The Fashion Institute'', http://fashioninstitute.canalblog.com/archives/2011/03/10/20594418.html. Accessed 20 June 2017</ref> With the exception of the first six notebooks (which are not signed) as well as a few other plates which seem to have been released later in publication, the names of the designer and the engraver are found below each image included in the ''Galerie'', often with variations in spelling.  The name of the designer normally appears at the lower right of each plate, alongside the words \"Dessin\u00e9 par\" or  \"del.\" (\"delineavit\"). The name of the engraver, meanwhile, is typically found on the lower right beside the terms \"Grav\u00e9 par\" (or \"Grav\u00e9e par), \"sc.\" or \"sculp.\" (\"sculpsit\").<ref>Blum, Stella. ''Eighteenth-Century French Fashion Plates: 64 Engravings from the \"Galerie des Modes,\" 1778-1787.'' Mineola: Dover Publications, Inc., 1982, p. v</ref> In certain rarer cases, the designer's name is accompanied by the word \"inv.\" (\"invenit\"), meaning \"invented it\" or \"devised it.\" This notation can often be viewed, for example, alongside the signature of Jean-Baptiste Martin and seems to have been used for the first time in the twenty-fourth ''cahier'' of the series.\n\n===The Plates===\nThe prints of the ''Galerie'' were rendered through a process commonly implemented in fashion plate production. The designers provided the drawings for the series, and the engravers accordingly translated their creations into prints (in this case [[etching]]s, or line engravings). These images would then be [[Tints and shades|tinted]] by hand either prior to distribution (presumably by Madame Le Beau) or after distribution by a \"home hobbyist\".<ref>\"Galerie des Modes et Costumes Fran\u00e7ais: 1778-1787,\" http://blog.fitnyc.edu/materialmode/2013/08/28/galerie-des-modes-et-costumes-francais-1778-1787/. Accessed 26 June 2017</ref> The prints, for this reason, were sold both in color and in black and white. \n \nPlates from the ''Galerie'' can be divided into essentially five categories of composition. Among suites depicting ''coiffures,'' three different formate emerge, all of which feature isolated figures illustrated from the shoulders up. In the first six ''cahiers'' of the ''Galerie'', the designer (whose identity is not confirmed) has rendered four figures that appear in distinct rectangular quadrants. In later four-figure, ''coiffure''-oriented plates, the subjects are distinguished by oval-shaped frames. Particularly in plates depicting more than four hairstyles (some contain twelve or sixteen), figures are separated by individual rectangles as well as overlaid elliptical frames.\n\nAmong suites depicting entire outfits (\"''habillemens \u00e0 la mode''\"), there emerge essentially two different compositions. In most cases, one to three full-length figures appear in what is supposed to be a general, quotidian scene. Designed to showcase the fashions worn by these characters (rather than any complex narrative action), the backgrounds of these plates contain few elements, if any at all. Though figures are sometimes drawn in a specific setting, such as a garden, patio, or dressing room, they are depicted, perhaps more often, in a nondescript indoor or outdoor space with a mostly blank background. In certain later prints, figures are drawn individually, in frames rendered at the center of the composition on a rather small scale. This inner pictorial space is surrounded by garments that, relative to the depicted figure, appear larger than life. In some cases, these accoutrements are labeled with numbers corresponding to captions at the bottom of the plate.\n\nCaptions, indeed, are found on practically every print included in the ''Galerie''. On plates with full-outfit compositions, text is printed directly below each image andusually above some variation of the inscription, \"A Paris chez Esnauts et Rapilly rue St Jacques, \u00e0 la Ville de Countances. Avec Priv du Roi (or A.P.D.R.),\" which gives readers general information about publication. On certain plates devoted to ''coiffures'', captions appear in the space of the illustrated figures. Though always descriptive in nature, the content of these captions varies from plate to plate. In some cases, the text simply focuses on the intricacies of the represented fashions. However, in others, it gives a sense of narrative and highlights the identity of the depicted character. Throughout the series, the length of these captions also has a tendency to fluctuate.\n\n===The Subjects===\nIn the late eighteenth century the courtly presence of Marie Antoinette was, as mentioned, absolutely instrumental to augmenting France's influence on the world of fashion at large. The subjects of the ''Galerie'', however, are by no means relegated to \"ladies of the highest rank.\"<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.97</ref> In addition to noblewomen, the series represents members of the bourgeoisie and the serving class. (To quote the exhibition catalogue, ''New for Now: The Origin of Fashion Magazines'', published by the Rijksmuseum, \"the costumier and the housemaid also appear\" in certain plates<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.97</ref>) Though outnumbered by these other subjects, the series also devotes some of its prints to the fashions of men and children.\n\nThese drawings were touted as \"designs after nature\" (\"''dessin\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s nature''\"), reflecting the fact that the designers who contributed to the series would draw from life. Their compositions were based on the most fashionable garments and hairstyles of period, which they would often observe with their own eyes at popular locales, such as parks, theaters, and even the ''ateliers'' of fashionable dressmakers and tailors.<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.98</ref> Breaking ever so slightly from this mold, several plates found within the series also depict costumes made for eighteenth-century productions of theater and ballet, many of which were designed by P.N Sarrazin who is listed in various captions as the \"'Costumier des Princes\"\" (\"Costume designer of Princes\").\n\n==Impact==\n''Galerie des Modes'' is a huge monument to the world of fashion. As highlighted in ''New for Now'', the ''Galerie'' was circulated among a wide array of \"fashion-conscious\" audiences, both in France and abroad, and would ultimately go down in history as \"the best and largest\" fashion plate series of the eighteenth century.<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards.

The first collected volume, which was produced in 1779, had a title page which bore an [[Allegory|allegorical]] illustration as well as the full title of the collection: '''''Gallerie des modes et des costumes fran\u00e7ais dessin\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s nature, Grav\u00e9s par le plus C\u00e9l\u00e8bres Artistes en ce genre, et color\u00e9s avec le plus grand soin par Madame Le Beau. Ouvrage commence en l'ann\u00e9e 1778. A Paris, chez le Srs Esnauts et Rapilly rue St. Jacques \u00e0 la Ville de coutances. Avec priv. Du Roi''''' (''Gallery of French fashions and costumes, drawn from life, engraved by the most celebrated artists in this medium, and hand-colored with the greatest care by Madame Le Beau;publication begun in 1778. Paris, Messrs. Esnauts and Rapilly, rue Satin-Jacques, at the sign of the City of Countances. Licensed by the King''). Importantly, this lengthier epithet indicates that the engravings of the ''Galerie'' (or ''Gallerie'', according to eighteenth-century spelling) were created \"d'apr\u00e8s nature,\" or \"after nature,\" meaning that they were intended to represent what was actually worn in the streets of Paris during the latter part of the eighteenth century.\n\nAlthough they vary in their presentation, the majority of images included in this series are ''tableaux vivants'' in which Parisians from various walks of life flaunt their quotidian fashions. These plates were completed by a group of prominent, eighteenth-century designers and engravers and are accompanied by descriptive text.  Although no private or public collection possesses a complete edition of the ''Galerie,'' the series is widely recognized for its high aesthetic value as well as its innovation within the overarching field of the fashion plate. Ren\u00e9 Colas, who compiled the major reference work ''Bibliographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du costume et de la mode'' (1933), calls it \"the most beautiful collection in existence on the fashions of the eighteenth century.\"<ref>Blum, Stella, ''Eighteenth-Century French Fashion Plates: 64 Engravings from the \"Galerie des Modes,\" 1778-1787.'' Mineola: Dover Publications, Inc., 1982, p. v</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n''Galerie des modes'' was conceived during the final decades of the 1700s, a period when France was at the forefront of fashion innovation. To quote the historian [[James Laver]],  at this time \"fashionable clothes...meant French clothes.\"<ref>Laver, James. ''Costume and Fashion: a Concise History.''London: Thame and Hudson, 1985, p. 127</ref> This supreme influence was undoubtedly strengthened by Queen Marie Antoinette as well as figures such as [[Rose Bertin]] (her dressmaker) and Monsieur [[L\u00e9onard Auti\u00e9]] (her hairdresser) who were responsible for designing her iconic courtly wardrobe.<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, pp.70-72</ref> Beginning in the 1770s (the decade during which Antoinette both married future king Louis-Auguste and assumed the title [[Queen of France and Navarre]]), women's dress came to exhibit greater variation than ever before; the fashion plate emerged under these conditions, as if to disseminate each budding trend.\n\nDespite the prominence of eighteenth-century French style, the first true fashion plates were produced for ''[[The Lady's Magazine]]'', a British publication established in 1770. Prior to this date, the majority of prints published in France, such as [[Jean Dieu de Saint-Jean| Jean Dieu de Saint-Jean's]] engravings of male and female costume at the Court of Louis XIV, were \"costume plates,\" which depicted clothes \"after the event.\" Information concerning the latest fashion was difficult to come by, so difficult, in fact, that the aforementioned Rose Bertin would travel the Continent each year in an enormous ''berline'' containing dolls dressed in the most up-to-date ''modes de Paris''.<ref>Laver, James. ''Costume and Fashion: a Concise History.''London: Thame and Hudson, 1985, pp. 144-147</ref> Ostensibly rendered \"after nature\", according to the everyday observations of prominent contemporary artists, the engravings of the ''Galerie'' thus responded to a growing demand for fashion news as well as a general gap in the market of French prints.\n\n===Publication===\nThe innovative ''Galerie des modes'' is the most expansive and perhaps the best known project of the print merchants Jacques Esnauts (or Esnault) and Michel Rapilly. Both of these men hailed from the region of [[Normandy]] (Esnauts came from [[Magny-le-D\u00e9sert]], and Rapilly came from [[Pirou]]), and the name of their publishing house, ''Ville de Coutances'', reflects these common origins. Located on the rue Saint-Jacques, this ''maison'' was established on July 6, 1773 following their brief stint at the nearby ''La Croix de Lorraine,'' where they had worked about three years earlier. Here the editors primarily published portraits of both historical and contemporary subjects; they began issuing the ''Galerie'' after obtaining a ''privil\u00e8ge'' on July 29, 1778 and continued to do so until 1787.<ref>Maxime Pr\u00e9aud, et al., ''Dictionnaire des \u00e9diteurs d'estampes \u00e0 Paris sous l'Ancien R\u00e9gime.''Promodis: Editions du Cercle de la Librairie, 1987, pp. 117-118</ref>\n\nPerhaps in an effort to emulate the prints of ''The Lady's Magazine'', various engravers, hairdressers, and booksellers had, at this time, published a number of small almanacs on contemporary fashion. In formulating their ''Galerie'', Esnauts and Rapilly combined the subjects of these early volumes (which primarily focused on hairstyles) with the high quality of engraving found in series by the prolific [[Jean-Michel Moreau|Moreau le Jeune]], such as ''Suite d'estampes pour servir \u00e0 l'Histoire des Moeurs et du Costume''.<ref>\"La Galerie des modes.\" ''The Fashion Institute'', http://fashioninstitute.canalblog.com/archives/2011/03/10/20594418.html. Accessed 20 June 2017</ref> The resulting prints were distributed at random intervals, usually in sets (''cahiers'') of six, for the price of 36 [[French livre|livres]] (around 14 euro's in today's currency). Although many historians differ on the exact number of plates issued throughout publication, it is clear that over 400 engravings were issued in what was probably more than 70 portfolios. The first ''cahiers'' focused solely on hairstyles (''coiffures'') However, from the seventh ''cahier'' onwards, the series began to represent full outfits, illustrated from head-to-toe. The first collected volume of the ''Galerie'' (published in 1779) included 96 plates which came from the initial 16 portfolios of the series and was preceded by a forty-page descriptive introduction written by the lawyer G.Fran\u00e7ois-Roger Mol\u00e9.<ref>Delpierre, Madeleine. ''Dress in France in the Eighteenth Century.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997, p.158</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===The Artists===\nThe ''Galerie'' implicated the work of numerous prominent visual artists.  In fact, the full title of the series, which was displayed in the epigraph of the collected 1779 volume, vaunts that its illustrations were drawn by \"the most celebrated artists (\"les plus c\u00e9lebres artistes\") of the period, all of which had achieved the highest level of mastery in their medium. Recognized as some of the best fashion illustrators of their time, the designers tied to the project included Pierre Thomas Le Clerc (or Lecl\u00e9re), Claude Louis Desrais, Fran\u00e7ois Louis Joseph Watteau (the grandnephew of [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau]]), Augustin de Saint-Aubin, and Jean-Baptiste Martin. Claude-Ferdinand Gaillard, Jean-Baptiste Patas, Pierre Andrien Le Beau, Nicolas Dupin, his son Jean Pierre Julien, Etienne Claude Voysard, Jean Alexandre Aveline, P\u00e9lissier, Jacques Le Roy, J.P. Vossinik (or Wossinik), and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Janinet appear to have been the enlisted engravers. In certain cases, the draftsman Martin seems to have acted as both the designer and engraver. To quote Peter McNeil and Sanda Miller's ''Fashion Writing and Criticism: History, Theory, Practice'', the compositions completed by each one of these artists demonstrate \"the strong influence of figurative painting in their creation.\"<ref>McNeil, Peter, and Sanda Miller. ''Fashion Writing and Criticism: History, Theory, Practice.'' London and New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014, p.68</ref>\n\nAlthough there exist no contracts that officially confirm the involvement of these artists, their respective contributions are marked by signatures.<ref>\"La Galerie des modes.\" ''The Fashion Institute'', http://fashioninstitute.canalblog.com/archives/2011/03/10/20594418.html. Accessed 20 June 2017</ref> With the exception of the first six notebooks (which are not signed) as well as a few other plates which seem to have been released later in publication, the names of the designer and the engraver are found below each image included in the ''Galerie'', often with variations in spelling.  The name of the designer normally appears at the lower right of each plate, alongside the words \"Dessin\u00e9 par\" or  \"del.\" (\"delineavit\"). The name of the engraver, meanwhile, is typically found on the lower right beside the terms \"Grav\u00e9 par\" (or \"Grav\u00e9e par), \"sc.\" or \"sculp.\" (\"sculpsit\").<ref>Blum, Stella. ''Eighteenth-Century French Fashion Plates: 64 Engravings from the \"Galerie des Modes,\" 1778-1787.'' Mineola: Dover Publications, Inc., 1982, p. v</ref> In certain rarer cases, the designer's name is accompanied by the word \"inv.\" (\"invenit\"), meaning \"invented it\" or \"devised it.\" This notation can often be viewed, for example, alongside the signature of Jean-Baptiste Martin and seems to have been used for the first time in the twenty-fourth ''cahier'' of the series.\n\n===The Plates===\nThe prints of the ''Galerie'' were rendered through a process commonly implemented in fashion plate production. The designers provided the drawings for the series, and the engravers accordingly translated their creations into prints (in this case [[etching]]s, or line engravings). These images would then be [[Tints and shades|tinted]] by hand either prior to distribution (presumably by Madame Le Beau) or after distribution by a \"home hobbyist\".<ref>\"Galerie des Modes et Costumes Fran\u00e7ais: 1778-1787,\" http://blog.fitnyc.edu/materialmode/2013/08/28/galerie-des-modes-et-costumes-francais-1778-1787/. Accessed 26 June 2017</ref> The prints, for this reason, were sold both in color and in black and white. \n \nPlates from the ''Galerie'' can be divided into essentially five categories of composition. Among suites depicting ''coiffures,'' three different formate emerge, all of which feature isolated figures illustrated from the shoulders up. In the first six ''cahiers'' of the ''Galerie'', the designer (whose identity is not confirmed) has rendered four figures that appear in distinct rectangular quadrants. In later four-figure, ''coiffure''-oriented plates, the subjects are distinguished by oval-shaped frames. Particularly in plates depicting more than four hairstyles (some contain twelve or sixteen), figures are separated by individual rectangles as well as overlaid elliptical frames.\n\nAmong suites depicting entire outfits (\"''habillemens \u00e0 la mode''\"), there emerge essentially two different compositions. In most cases, one to three full-length figures appear in what is supposed to be a general, quotidian scene. Designed to showcase the fashions worn by these characters (rather than any complex narrative action), the backgrounds of these plates contain few elements, if any at all. Though figures are sometimes drawn in a specific setting, such as a garden, patio, or dressing room, they are depicted, perhaps more often, in a nondescript indoor or outdoor space with a mostly blank background. In certain later prints, figures are drawn individually, in frames rendered at the center of the composition on a rather small scale. This inner pictorial space is surrounded by garments that, relative to the depicted figure, appear larger than life. In some cases, these accoutrements are labeled with numbers corresponding to captions at the bottom of the plate.\n\nCaptions, indeed, are found on practically every print included in the ''Galerie''. On plates with full-outfit compositions, text is printed directly below each image andusually above some variation of the inscription, \"A Paris chez Esnauts et Rapilly rue St Jacques, \u00e0 la Ville de Countances. Avec Priv du Roi (or A.P.D.R.),\" which gives readers general information about publication. On certain plates devoted to ''coiffures'', captions appear in the space of the illustrated figures. Though always descriptive in nature, the content of these captions varies from plate to plate. In some cases, the text simply focuses on the intricacies of the represented fashions. However, in others, it gives a sense of narrative and highlights the identity of the depicted character. Throughout the series, the length of these captions also has a tendency to fluctuate.\n\n===The Subjects===\nIn the late eighteenth century the courtly presence of Marie Antoinette was, as mentioned, absolutely instrumental to augmenting France's influence on the world of fashion at large. The subjects of the ''Galerie'', however, are by no means relegated to \"ladies of the highest rank.\"<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.97</ref> In addition to noblewomen, the series represents members of the bourgeoisie and the serving class. (To quote the exhibition catalogue, ''New for Now: The Origin of Fashion Magazines'', published by the Rijksmuseum, \"the costumier and the housemaid also appear\" in certain plates<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.97</ref>) Though outnumbered by these other subjects, the series also devotes some of its prints to the fashions of men and children.\n\nThese drawings were touted as \"designs after nature\" (\"''dessin\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s nature''\"), reflecting the fact that the designers who contributed to the series would draw from life. Their compositions were based on the most fashionable garments and hairstyles of period, which they would often observe with their own eyes at popular locales, such as parks, theaters, and even the ''ateliers'' of fashionable dressmakers and tailors.<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak. ''New for Now: the Origin of Fashion Magazines.'' Translated by Lynne Richards. Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum, 2015, p.98</ref> Breaking ever so slightly from this mold, several plates found within the series also depict costumes made for eighteenth-century productions of theater and ballet, many of which were designed by P.N Sarrazin who is listed in various captions as the \"'Costumier des Princes\"\" (\"Costume designer of Princes\").\n\n==Impact==\n''Galerie des Modes'' is a huge monument to the world of fashion. As highlighted in ''New for Now'', the ''Galerie'' was circulated among a wide array of \"fashion-conscious\" audiences, both in France and abroad, and would ultimately go down in history as \"the best and largest\" fashion plate series of the eighteenth century.<ref>Koning, Georgette, and Els Verhaak.

It houses the collection of industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]]  (1849\u20131919).\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Henry Clay Frick House}}\nHenry Frick started his substantial art collection as soon as he started amassing his fortunes. A considerable amount of his art collection is located in his former residence \"Clayton\" in Pittsburgh, which is today a part of the [[Frick Art & Historical Center]]. Another part was given by his daughter and heiress Helen to the [[Frick Fine Arts Building]], which is on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe family did not permanently move from Pittsburgh to New York until 1905. Henry Frick initially leased the Vanderbilt house at 640 Fifth Avenue, to which he moved a substantial amount of his collection. He had his permanent residence built between 1912 and 1914 by [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]] of [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]]. He stayed in the house until his death in 1919. He willed the house and all of its contents, including art, furniture, and decorative objects, as a public museum. His widow Adelaide Howard Childs Frick, however, retained the right of residence and continued living in the mansion with her daughter Helen. After Adelaide Frick died in 1931, the conversion of the house into a public museum started.\n\n[[John Russell Pope]] altered and enlarged the building in the early 1930s to adapt it to use as a public institution. It opened to the public on December 16, 1935. Various additions to the architecture and landscape architecture of the museum site have been considered over the years including the placement of a prominent magnolia garden from the 1930s. As stated by the museum announcements: \"As a result of a decision of the Board of Trustees in 1939, three magnolias were selected for the Fifth Avenue garden. The two trees on the lower tier are Saucer Magnolias ([[Magnolia soulangeana]]) and the species on the upper tier by the flagpole is a Star Magnolia ([[Magnolia stellata]]).\"<ref>Frick online library.

It houses the collection of industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]]  (1849\u20131919).\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Henry Clay Frick House}}\nHenry Frick started his substantial art collection as soon as he started amassing his fortunes. A considerable amount of his art collection is located in his former residence \"Clayton\" in Pittsburgh, which is today a part of the [[Frick Art & Historical Center]]. Another part was given by his daughter and heiress Helen to the [[Frick Fine Arts Building]], which is on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe family did not permanently move from Pittsburgh to New York until 1905. Henry Frick initially leased the Vanderbilt house at 640 Fifth Avenue, to which he moved a substantial amount of his collection. He had his permanent residence built between 1912 and 1914 by [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]] of [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]]. He stayed in the house until his death in 1919. He willed the house and all of its contents, including art, furniture, and decorative objects, as a public museum. His widow Adelaide Howard Childs Frick, however, retained the right of residence and continued living in the mansion with her daughter Helen. After Adelaide Frick died in 1931, the conversion of the house into a public museum started.\n\n[[John Russell Pope]] altered and enlarged the building in the early 1930s to adapt it to use as a public institution. It opened to the public on December 16, 1935. Various additions to the architecture and landscape architecture of the museum site have been considered over the years including the placement of a prominent magnolia garden from the 1930s. As stated by the museum announcements: \"As a result of a decision of the Board of Trustees in 1939, three magnolias were selected for the Fifth Avenue garden. The two trees on the lower tier are Saucer Magnolias ([[Magnolia soulangeana]]) and the species on the upper tier by the flagpole is a Star Magnolia ([[Magnolia stellata]]).\"<ref>Frick online library. Description of architecture and landscape architecture. [http://www.frick.org/collection/gardens/magnolias].</ref>\n\nFurther expansions of the museum took place in 1977 and in 2011. In 2014, the museum announced further expansion plans, but came up against community opposition because it would result in the loss of a garden.  The Frick ultimately dropped those plans and is said to be considering other options.<ref>Pogebrin, Robin (June 9, 2014) [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/arts/design/frick-plans-changes-but-vows-to-stay-the-same.html \"Frick Seeks to Expand Beyond Jewel-Box Spaces\"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref><ref>Pogebrin, Robin (November 9, 2014) [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/arts/fricks-plan-for-expansion-faces-fight-over-loss-of-garden.html?_r=1 \"Frick\u2019s Plan for Expansion Faces Fight Over Loss of Garden\"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref><ref>Pogebrin, Robin (June 3, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/nyregion/frick-museum-abandons-contested-renovation-plan.html \"Frick Museum Abandons Contested Renovation Plan\"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Frick is one of the pre-eminent small art museums in the United States, with a high-quality collection of [[old master]] paintings and fine furniture housed in nineteen galleries of varying size within the former residence.

It was founded in 1920 by [[Helen Clay Frick]], the daughter of industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]], to facilitate object-oriented research. The documentation it offers records the essential elements of the biography of the work of art: the artist, title, present owner, as well as historical information such as changes of attribution, ownership and condition, all of which are essential for the study of the history of art.\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1920s, reproductions were only rarely included in art historical texts. The Frick's Photoarchive was established to complement this growing body of literature. Although many scholars had personal image libraries, the Frick Art Reference Library was one of the first institutions to afford public access to a consolidated collection of photographs, thus enabling a broad range of researchers to study and evaluate works of art in an entirely new way. The establishment of similar [[Art Historical Photo Archives]] in Europe and the United States soon followed.\n\nIn planning the Photoarchive, Helen Clay Frick regularly consulted with [[Sir Robert Witt]], whose personal library of reproductions in London was her single most important source of inspiration. She also turned to American and European scholars, including [[Fiske Kimball]] and [[Bernard Berenson]]. As early as 1922, Frick organized photographic expeditions to capture images of significant and rarely reproduced works of art in Europe and the United States. The resulting collection of roughly 60,000 original negatives, which in many cases document works of art that have subsequently been altered, lost or destroyed, has become one of the library's most treasured resources.\n\nTo facilitate object-oriented research, the library actively acquires multiple photographs of the same work of art to document changes in condition and appearance over time. Photographs of preparatory drawings, versions, copies, pastiches, and forgeries\u2014materials often overlooked in the literature\u2014are also collected. Many of the photographs in the collection are rare images of works that have since been lost, stolen, or destroyed.\n\nThe library continues to acquire many photographs and digital images each year, focusing on unpublished or little-known works. Staff photoarchivists work to maintain current information on changes of attribution and location, often relying on information provided by art researchers.\n\n==Access==\nAll 40,000 artists represented in the Photoarchive and documentation of over 200,000 works of art are accessible through NYARC Discovery,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyarc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=UnknownView&afterPDS=true&docId=|title=Primo by Ex Libris|author=|date=|website=ExLibrisGroup.com|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> the catalog of the [[New York Art Resources Consortium]] (NYARC).\n\nThe Frick Digital Collections<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.frick.org|title=The Frick Digital Collections|author=|date=|website=The Frick Digital Collections|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> provides access to approximately 200,000 high-resolution digital images for 75,000 works of art represented in the Photoarchive.

Tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the South Sound region, which has a population of  around 1 million.\n\nTacoma adopted its name after the nearby [[Mount Rainier]], originally called Takhoma or Tahoma. It is locally known as the \"City of Destiny\" because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] in the late 19th century. The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma's neighboring deep-water harbor, [[Commencement Bay]]. By connecting the bay with the railroad, Tacoma's motto became \"When rails meet sails\". Commencement Bay serves the [[Port of Tacoma]], a center of [[international trade]] on the [[Pacific Coast]] and Washington's largest port.\n\nLike most industrial cities, Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of [[suburbanization]] and divestment. Since the 1990s, downtown Tacoma has undergone a slow and steady revitalization. Developments in the downtown core include the [[University of Washington Tacoma]]; [[Sound Transit Tacoma Link|Tacoma Link]], the first modern electric [[light rail]] service in the state; the state's highest density of art and history museums; and a restored urban waterfront, the [[Thea Foss Waterway]].\n\nTacoma has been named one of the most livable areas in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mostlivable.org/cities/tacoma/home.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20040803021810/http://mostlivable.org/cities/tacoma/home.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 3, 2004|title=Mostlivable.org}}</ref> In 2006, Tacoma was listed as one of the \"most walkable\" cities in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/americas-top-100-cities-walking?page=4|title=100 Best Walking Cities|work=Prevention.com|accessdate=March 27, 2008|date=March 9, 2006}}</ref>\n\nTacoma gained notoriety in 1940 for the collapse of the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], which earned the nickname \"Galloping Gertie\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Mount Rainier overlooking the Port of Tacoma.jpg|thumb|View of Mount Rainier and the Port of Tacoma from [[Brown's Point]], 2009]]\nThe area was inhabited for thousands of years by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], predominantly the [[Puyallup (tribe)|Puyallup]] people, who lived in settlements on the delta.\n\nIn 1852, a Swede named Nicolas Delin built a water-powered sawmill on a creek near the head of Commencement Bay, but the small settlement that grew around it was abandoned during the [[Puget Sound War|Indian War of 1855\u201356]]. In 1864, pioneer and postmaster Job Carr, a Civil War veteran and land speculator, built a cabin (which also served as Tacoma's first post office; a replica was built in 2000 near the original site in \"Old Town\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jobcarrmuseum.org/|title=Job Carr Cabin Museum|website=Job Carr Cabin Museum}}</ref> Carr hoped to profit from the selection of Commencement Bay as the terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad, and sold most of his claim to developer [[Morton M. McCarver]] (1807\u20131875), who named his project Tacoma City, derived from the indigenous name for the mountain.\n\nTacoma was incorporated on November 12, 1875, following its selection in 1873 as the western terminus of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] due to lobbying by McCarver, future mayor [[John Wilson Sprague]], and others. However, the railroad built its depot on '''New Tacoma''', two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of the Carr\u2013McCarver development. The two communities grew together and joined, merging on January 7, 1884. The transcontinental link was effected in 1887, and the population grew from 1,098 in 1880 to 36,006 in 1890. [[Rudyard Kipling]] visited Tacoma in 1889 and said it was \"literally staggering under a boom of the boomiest\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Caroline Denyer |last=Gallacci |title=The City of Destiny and the South Sound: An Illustrated History of Tacoma and Pierce County |location=Carlsbad, California |publisher=Heritage Media Corp |year=2001 |pages=49}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Commencement Bay Land Improvement Co. business card.jpg|thumb|left|The Commencement Bay Land and Improvement Co. played a major role in the city's early growth.]]\n[[George Francis Train]] was a resident for a few years in the late 19th century. In 1890, he staged a global circumnavigation starting and ending in Tacoma to promote the city. A plaque in downtown Tacoma marks the start and finish line.\n\nIn November 1885, white citizens led by then-mayor Jacob Weisbach [[Tacoma riot of 1885|expelled several hundred Chinese residents]] peacefully living in the city. As described by the account prepared by the [[Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation]], on the morning of November 3, \"several hundred men, led by the mayor and other city officials, evicted the Chinese from their homes, corralled them at 7th Street and Pacific Avenue, marched them to the railway station at Lakeview and forced them aboard the morning train to [[Portland, Oregon]]. The next day two Chinese settlements were burned to the ground.\"\n\nThe discovery of gold in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]] in 1898 led to Tacoma's prominence in the region being eclipsed by the development of Seattle.\n\nA major tragedy marred the end of the 19th century, when a [[Tacoma Streetcar Disaster|streetcar accident]] resulted in significant loss of life on July 4, 1900.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:PostcardTacomaWAPacificAveNorthFrom13thStCirca1907.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown, early 20th century]]\n[[File:Asarco Tacoma 1909 postcard.jpg|thumb|left|A 1909 postcard image of Tacoma with its ASARCO smelter smokestack]]\n\nFrom May to August 1907, the city was the site of a smelter workers' strike organized by Local 545 of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), with the goal of a fifty-cent per day pay raise.<ref name=\"IWWYearbook1907\">{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1907.shtml |title=IWW Yearbook 1907 |last=Hermida |first=Arianne |website=IWW History Project |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |access-date=5 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601110035/http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1907.shtml |archive-date=1 June 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"IUB V1 N20\">{{cite news |author=<!-- No author listed. --> |publication-date=13 July 1907 |title=To Whom It May Concern |volume=1 |issue=20 |page=2 |newspaper=[[Industrial Union Bulletin]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v1n20-jul-13-1907-iub }}</ref> The strike was strongly opposed by the local business community, and the smelter owners threatened to [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklist]] organizers and union officials.

The [[Tacoma City Council|city council]] consists of an elected mayor ([[Victoria Woodards]]) and eight elected council members: five from individual city council districts and three others from the city at-large. All serve four-year terms and are elected in odd-numbered years. The council adopts and amends city laws, approves a two-year budget, establishes city policy, appoints citizens to boards and commissions, and performs other actions. The council also meets in \"standing committees\", which examine the council's work in more defined areas, such as \"Environment & Public Works\", \"Neighborhoods & Housing\", and \"Public Safety, Human Services & Education\". The council meets as a whole most Tuesdays at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. in the council chambers at 747 Market St. Meetings are open to the public and provide for public input.\n\n[[Victoria Woodards]] began her term as mayor of the City of Tacoma on January 2, 2018. She is Tacoma's third African-American mayor and third female mayor, and the second African-American female mayor. She was preceded by [[Marilyn Strickland]], who was elected in 2009, becoming Tacoma's first African-American female mayor.\n\nNormal day-to-day operations of the city government are administered by Tacoma's city manager, who is appointed by the city council.

The majority of the city has a system of [[street grid|gridded streets]] oriented in relation to A Street (one block east of Pacific Avenue) and 6th Avenue or Division Avenue, both beginning in [[Downtown, Tacoma, Washington|downtown Tacoma]]. Within the city, and with a few exceptions, east-to-west streets are numbered and north-to-south streets are given a name or a letter. Some east-to-west streets are also given names, such as S. Center St. and N. Westgate Blvd. Streets are generally labeled \"North\", \"South\", \"East\", or \"North East\" according to their relationship with 6th Avenue or Division Avenue (west of 'Division Ave', '6th Avenue' is the lowest-numbered street, making it the dividing street between \"North\" and \"South\"), 'A Street' (which is the dividing line between \"East\" and \"South\"), or 1st Street NE (which is the dividing line between \"East\" and \"North East\"). This can lead to confusion, as most named streets intersect streets of the same number in both north and south Tacoma. For example, the intersection of South 11th Street and South Union Avenue is just ten blocks south of North 11th Street and North Union Avenue.\n\nTo the east of the Thea Foss waterway and 'A Street', streets are similarly divided into \"East\" and \"Northeast\", with 1st Street NE being in-line with the Pierce\u2013King county line. \"North East\" covers a small wedge of Tacoma and unincorporated Pierce County (around Browns Point and Dash Point) lying on the hill across the tideflats from downtown. Tacoma does have some major roads which do not seem to follow any naming rules. These roads include Schuster Pkwy, Pacific Ave, Puyallup Ave, Tacoma Mall Blvd, Marine View Dr (SR 509), and Northshore Pkwy. Tacoma also has some major roads which appear to change names in different areas (most notable are Tyler St/Stevens St, Oakes St/Pine St/Cedar St/Alder St, and S. 72nd St/S. 74th St). These major [[Arterial road|arterials]] actually shift over to align with other roads, which causes them to have the name changed.\n\nThis numeric system extends to the furthest reaches of unincorporated Pierce County (with roads outside of the city carrying \"East\", \"West\", \"North West\", and \"South West\", except on the [[Key Peninsula]], which retains the north-south streets but chooses the Pierce\u2013Kitsap county line as the zero point for east-west streets. Key Peninsula's roads also carry a \"KP N\" or \"KP S\" (\"Key Peninsula North\" or \"Key Peninsula South\") designation at the end of the street name.\n\nIn portions of the city dating back to the Tacoma Streetcar Period (1888\u20131938), denser mixed-use business districts exist alongside [[single family homes]]. Twelve such districts have active, city-recognized business associations and hold \"small town\"-style parades and other festivals. The [[Proctor|Proctor District, Tacoma]], Old Town, Dome, [[Sixth Avenue (Tacoma)|6th Avenue]], [[Stadium District, Tacoma, Washington|Stadium]], Lincoln Business District, and South Tacoma Business Districts are some of the more prominent of these and coordinate their efforts to redevelop urban villages through the Cross District Association of Tacoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tacomabusinessdistricts.com|title=Tacoma Business Districts|website=www.tacomabusinessdistricts.com}}</ref> In newer portions of the city to the west and south, residential [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]], four-lane collector roads and indoor shopping centers are more commonplace.\n\n===Roads and highways===\nSeven highways end in or pass through Tacoma: [[I-5 (WA)|I-5]], [[I-705]], [[Washington State Route 7|SR 7]], [[Washington State Route 16|SR 16]], [[Washington State Route 163|SR 163]], [[Washington State Route 167|SR 167]], and [[Washington State Route 509|SR 509]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wspdsmap.ci.tacoma.wa.us/samples/streets.pdf|title=City of Tacoma Streets|author=City of Tacoma Community & Economic Development Department, GIS Analysis & Data Services|accessdate=2009-10-15|date=2009-10-08}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant intercity transportation link between Tacoma and other parts of the Puget Sound is [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]], which links Tacoma with [[Seattle]] to the north and [[Portland, Oregon]], to the south. [[Washington State Route 16|State Route 16]] runs along a concrete viaduct through Tacoma's Nalley Valley, connecting Interstate 5 with Central and West Tacoma, the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], and the [[Kitsap Peninsula]]. [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]] lies {{convert|22|mi|km}} north, in the city of [[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]].\n\n===Public transportation===\n[[File:Tacoma Link approaches S 13th Street.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tacoma Link approaches S 13th Street]]\nPublic transportation in Tacoma includes buses, commuter rail, [[light rail]], and [[ferries]]. Public bus service is provided by [[Pierce Transit]], which serves Tacoma and [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]]. Pierce Transit operates 43 bus routes (five of which through Sound Transit), using a fleet of buses powered by [[compressed natural gas]], diesel, and electric batteries. Bus service operates at 30\u201360 minute frequencies daily, while three heavily ridden \"trunk\" routes are mostly served every 20 minutes on weekdays and every half-hour to an hour on weekends as of October 2, 2011. The bus route serving the Pacific Avenue corridor is planned to be upgraded into a [[bus rapid transit]] line by 2022, at a cost of $150 million.\n\n[[Sound Transit]], the regional transit authority, provides weekday [[Sounder Commuter Rail]] service and daily express bus service to and from Seattle. Sound Transit has also established [[Sound Transit Tacoma Link|Tacoma Link]] [[light rail]], a {{convert|1.6|mi|adj=on}} [[Zero-fare public transport|free]] electric [[streetcar]] line linking [[Tacoma Dome]] Station with the [[University of Washington, Tacoma]], Tacoma's Museum District, and the Theater District. Expansion of the city's rail transit system is in planning stages by the city of Tacoma and Sound Transit. The line will be extended north along Commerce St/Stadium Way and then west along Division Ave. It will then turn south along Martin Luther King Jr. Way and end near South 19th Street.\n\nThe [[Washington State Ferries]] system, which has a dock at [[Point Defiance Park|Point Defiance]], provides [[Point Defiance-Tahlequah Ferry|ferry access]] to [[Tahlequah, Washington|Tahlequah]] at the southern tip of [[Vashon Island]].\n[[File:Tacoma Link in Dome District, Tacoma (8755130086).jpg|alt=|thumb|Tacoma Link in Dome District]]\n[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] intercity bus service is accessible via [[Tacoma Dome Station]].\n\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Tacoma from Tacoma Dome Station. The [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascades]] trains, operating as far north as [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and as far south as [[Eugene, Oregon]], serve Tacoma several times daily in both directions. The long-distance ''Coast Starlight'' operates daily between Seattle and Los Angeles via the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n\n==Public utilities==\nTacoma's relationship with [[public utilities]] extends back to 1893. At that time the city was undergoing a boom in population, causing it to exceed the available amount of fresh water supplied by Charles B. Wright's Tacoma Light & Water Company. In response to both this demand and a growing desire to have local public control over the utility system, the city council put up a public vote to acquire and expand the private utility. The measure passed on July 1, 1893, with 3,195 in favor of acquiring the utility system and 1,956 voting against. Since then, [[Tacoma Public Utilities]] (TPU) has grown from a small water and light utility to be the largest department in the city's government, employing about 1,200 people.\n\n[[Tacoma Power]], a division of TPU, provides residents of Tacoma and several bordering municipalities with electrical power generated by eight hydroelectric dams on the [[Skokomish River]] and elsewhere. Environmentalists, fishermen, and the Skokomish Indian Tribe have criticized TPU's operation of Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish River; the tribe's $6 billion claim<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fwee.org/news/getStory?story=1453 |title=Court Ends Fight Over Dams |work=Foundation for Water and Energy Education, quoting The News Tribune |accessdate=2008-03-27 |date=2006-01-12 |first=Chris |last=Sherman}}</ref> was denied by the U.S. Supreme court<ref>{{cite web |url={{SCOTUS URL Docket|05-434}} |title=Docket for 05-434}}</ref> in January 2006.   The capacity of Tacoma's [[hydroelectric]] system as of 2004 was 713,000 [[kilowatt]]s, or about 50% of the demand made up by TPU's customers (the rest is purchased from other utilities). According to TPU, hydroelectricity provides about 87% of Tacoma's power; coal 3%; natural gas 1%; nuclear 9%; and biomass and wind at less than 1%. Tacoma Power also operates the [[Click! Network]], a municipally owned [[cable television]] and internet service. The residential cost per kilowatt hour of electricity is just over 6 cents.\n\nTacoma Water provides customers in its service area with water from the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green River]] Watershed.

Tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the South Sound region, which has a population of  around 1 million.\n\nTacoma adopted its name after the nearby [[Mount Rainier]], originally called Takhoma or Tahoma. It is locally known as the \"City of Destiny\" because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] in the late 19th century. The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma's neighboring deep-water harbor, [[Commencement Bay]]. By connecting the bay with the railroad, Tacoma's motto became \"When rails meet sails\". Commencement Bay serves the [[Port of Tacoma]], a center of [[international trade]] on the [[Pacific Coast]] and Washington's largest port.\n\nLike most industrial cities, Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of [[suburbanization]] and divestment. Since the 1990s, downtown Tacoma has undergone a slow and steady revitalization. Developments in the downtown core include the [[University of Washington Tacoma]]; [[Sound Transit Tacoma Link|Tacoma Link]], the first modern electric [[light rail]] service in the state; the state's highest density of art and history museums; and a restored urban waterfront, the [[Thea Foss Waterway]].\n\nTacoma has been named one of the most livable areas in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mostlivable.org/cities/tacoma/home.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20040803021810/http://mostlivable.org/cities/tacoma/home.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 3, 2004|title=Mostlivable.org}}</ref> In 2006, Tacoma was listed as one of the \"most walkable\" cities in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/americas-top-100-cities-walking?page=4|title=100 Best Walking Cities|work=Prevention.com|accessdate=March 27, 2008|date=March 9, 2006}}</ref>\n\nTacoma gained notoriety in 1940 for the collapse of the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], which earned the nickname \"Galloping Gertie\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Mount Rainier overlooking the Port of Tacoma.jpg|thumb|View of Mount Rainier and the Port of Tacoma from [[Brown's Point]], 2009]]\nThe area was inhabited for thousands of years by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], predominantly the [[Puyallup (tribe)|Puyallup]] people, who lived in settlements on the delta.\n\nIn 1852, a Swede named Nicolas Delin built a water-powered sawmill on a creek near the head of Commencement Bay, but the small settlement that grew around it was abandoned during the [[Puget Sound War|Indian War of 1855\u201356]]. In 1864, pioneer and postmaster Job Carr, a Civil War veteran and land speculator, built a cabin (which also served as Tacoma's first post office; a replica was built in 2000 near the original site in \"Old Town\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jobcarrmuseum.org/|title=Job Carr Cabin Museum|website=Job Carr Cabin Museum}}</ref> Carr hoped to profit from the selection of Commencement Bay as the terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad, and sold most of his claim to developer [[Morton M. McCarver]] (1807\u20131875), who named his project Tacoma City, derived from the indigenous name for the mountain.\n\nTacoma was incorporated on November 12, 1875, following its selection in 1873 as the western terminus of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] due to lobbying by McCarver, future mayor [[John Wilson Sprague]], and others. However, the railroad built its depot on '''New Tacoma''', two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of the Carr\u2013McCarver development. The two communities grew together and joined, merging on January 7, 1884. The transcontinental link was effected in 1887, and the population grew from 1,098 in 1880 to 36,006 in 1890. [[Rudyard Kipling]] visited Tacoma in 1889 and said it was \"literally staggering under a boom of the boomiest\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Caroline Denyer |last=Gallacci |title=The City of Destiny and the South Sound: An Illustrated History of Tacoma and Pierce County |location=Carlsbad, California |publisher=Heritage Media Corp |year=2001 |pages=49}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Commencement Bay Land Improvement Co. business card.jpg|thumb|left|The Commencement Bay Land and Improvement Co. played a major role in the city's early growth.]]\n[[George Francis Train]] was a resident for a few years in the late 19th century. In 1890, he staged a global circumnavigation starting and ending in Tacoma to promote the city. A plaque in downtown Tacoma marks the start and finish line.\n\nIn November 1885, white citizens led by then-mayor Jacob Weisbach [[Tacoma riot of 1885|expelled several hundred Chinese residents]] peacefully living in the city. As described by the account prepared by the [[Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation]], on the morning of November 3, \"several hundred men, led by the mayor and other city officials, evicted the Chinese from their homes, corralled them at 7th Street and Pacific Avenue, marched them to the railway station at Lakeview and forced them aboard the morning train to [[Portland, Oregon]]. The next day two Chinese settlements were burned to the ground.\"\n\nThe discovery of gold in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]] in 1898 led to Tacoma's prominence in the region being eclipsed by the development of Seattle.\n\nA major tragedy marred the end of the 19th century, when a [[Tacoma Streetcar Disaster|streetcar accident]] resulted in significant loss of life on July 4, 1900.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:PostcardTacomaWAPacificAveNorthFrom13thStCirca1907.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown, early 20th century]]\n[[File:Asarco Tacoma 1909 postcard.jpg|thumb|left|A 1909 postcard image of Tacoma with its ASARCO smelter smokestack]]\n\nFrom May to August 1907, the city was the site of a smelter workers' strike organized by Local 545 of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), with the goal of a fifty-cent per day pay raise.<ref name=\"IWWYearbook1907\">{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1907.shtml |title=IWW Yearbook 1907 |last=Hermida |first=Arianne |website=IWW History Project |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |access-date=5 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601110035/http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1907.shtml |archive-date=1 June 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"IUB V1 N20\">{{cite news |author=<!-- No author listed. --> |publication-date=13 July 1907 |title=To Whom It May Concern |volume=1 |issue=20 |page=2 |newspaper=[[Industrial Union Bulletin]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v1n20-jul-13-1907-iub }}</ref> The strike was strongly opposed by the local business community, and the smelter owners threatened to [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklist]] organizers and union officials.

C. Weaver Studio, was sited at present-day [[Titlow Beach]].

The majority of the city has a system of [[street grid|gridded streets]] oriented in relation to A Street (one block east of Pacific Avenue) and 6th Avenue or Division Avenue, both beginning in [[Downtown, Tacoma, Washington|downtown Tacoma]]. Within the city, and with a few exceptions, east-to-west streets are numbered and north-to-south streets are given a name or a letter. Some east-to-west streets are also given names, such as S. Center St. and N. Westgate Blvd. Streets are generally labeled \"North\", \"South\", \"East\", or \"North East\" according to their relationship with 6th Avenue or Division Avenue (west of 'Division Ave', '6th Avenue' is the lowest-numbered street, making it the dividing street between \"North\" and \"South\"), 'A Street' (which is the dividing line between \"East\" and \"South\"), or 1st Street NE (which is the dividing line between \"East\" and \"North East\"). This can lead to confusion, as most named streets intersect streets of the same number in both north and south Tacoma. For example, the intersection of South 11th Street and South Union Avenue is just ten blocks south of North 11th Street and North Union Avenue.\n\nTo the east of the Thea Foss waterway and 'A Street', streets are similarly divided into \"East\" and \"Northeast\", with 1st Street NE being in-line with the Pierce\u2013King county line. \"North East\" covers a small wedge of Tacoma and unincorporated Pierce County (around Browns Point and Dash Point) lying on the hill across the tideflats from downtown. Tacoma does have some major roads which do not seem to follow any naming rules. These roads include Schuster Pkwy, Pacific Ave, Puyallup Ave, Tacoma Mall Blvd, Marine View Dr (SR 509), and Northshore Pkwy. Tacoma also has some major roads which appear to change names in different areas (most notable are Tyler St/Stevens St, Oakes St/Pine St/Cedar St/Alder St, and S. 72nd St/S. 74th St). These major [[Arterial road|arterials]] actually shift over to align with other roads, which causes them to have the name changed.\n\nThis numeric system extends to the furthest reaches of unincorporated Pierce County (with roads outside of the city carrying \"East\", \"West\", \"North West\", and \"South West\", except on the [[Key Peninsula]], which retains the north-south streets but chooses the Pierce\u2013Kitsap county line as the zero point for east-west streets. Key Peninsula's roads also carry a \"KP N\" or \"KP S\" (\"Key Peninsula North\" or \"Key Peninsula South\") designation at the end of the street name.\n\nIn portions of the city dating back to the Tacoma Streetcar Period (1888\u20131938), denser mixed-use business districts exist alongside [[single family homes]]. Twelve such districts have active, city-recognized business associations and hold \"small town\"-style parades and other festivals. The [[Proctor|Proctor District, Tacoma]], Old Town, Dome, [[Sixth Avenue (Tacoma)|6th Avenue]], [[Stadium District, Tacoma, Washington|Stadium]], Lincoln Business District, and South Tacoma Business Districts are some of the more prominent of these and coordinate their efforts to redevelop urban villages through the Cross District Association of Tacoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tacomabusinessdistricts.com|title=Tacoma Business Districts|website=www.tacomabusinessdistricts.com}}</ref> In newer portions of the city to the west and south, residential [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]], four-lane collector roads and indoor shopping centers are more commonplace.\n\n===Roads and highways===\nSeven highways end in or pass through Tacoma: [[I-5 (WA)|I-5]], [[I-705]], [[Washington State Route 7|SR 7]], [[Washington State Route 16|SR 16]], [[Washington State Route 163|SR 163]], [[Washington State Route 167|SR 167]], and [[Washington State Route 509|SR 509]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wspdsmap.ci.tacoma.wa.us/samples/streets.pdf|title=City of Tacoma Streets|author=City of Tacoma Community & Economic Development Department, GIS Analysis & Data Services|accessdate=2009-10-15|date=2009-10-08}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant intercity transportation link between Tacoma and other parts of the Puget Sound is [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]], which links Tacoma with [[Seattle]] to the north and [[Portland, Oregon]], to the south. [[Washington State Route 16|State Route 16]] runs along a concrete viaduct through Tacoma's Nalley Valley, connecting Interstate 5 with Central and West Tacoma, the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], and the [[Kitsap Peninsula]]. [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]] lies {{convert|22|mi|km}} north, in the city of [[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]].\n\n===Public transportation===\n[[File:Tacoma Link approaches S 13th Street.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tacoma Link approaches S 13th Street]]\nPublic transportation in Tacoma includes buses, commuter rail, [[light rail]], and [[ferries]]. Public bus service is provided by [[Pierce Transit]], which serves Tacoma and [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]]. Pierce Transit operates 43 bus routes (five of which through Sound Transit), using a fleet of buses powered by [[compressed natural gas]], diesel, and electric batteries. Bus service operates at 30\u201360 minute frequencies daily, while three heavily ridden \"trunk\" routes are mostly served every 20 minutes on weekdays and every half-hour to an hour on weekends as of October 2, 2011. The bus route serving the Pacific Avenue corridor is planned to be upgraded into a [[bus rapid transit]] line by 2022, at a cost of $150 million.\n\n[[Sound Transit]], the regional transit authority, provides weekday [[Sounder Commuter Rail]] service and daily express bus service to and from Seattle. Sound Transit has also established [[Sound Transit Tacoma Link|Tacoma Link]] [[light rail]], a {{convert|1.6|mi|adj=on}} [[Zero-fare public transport|free]] electric [[streetcar]] line linking [[Tacoma Dome]] Station with the [[University of Washington, Tacoma]], Tacoma's Museum District, and the Theater District. Expansion of the city's rail transit system is in planning stages by the city of Tacoma and Sound Transit. The line will be extended north along Commerce St/Stadium Way and then west along Division Ave. It will then turn south along Martin Luther King Jr. Way and end near South 19th Street.\n\nThe [[Washington State Ferries]] system, which has a dock at [[Point Defiance Park|Point Defiance]], provides [[Point Defiance-Tahlequah Ferry|ferry access]] to [[Tahlequah, Washington|Tahlequah]] at the southern tip of [[Vashon Island]].\n[[File:Tacoma Link in Dome District, Tacoma (8755130086).jpg|alt=|thumb|Tacoma Link in Dome District]]\n[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] intercity bus service is accessible via [[Tacoma Dome Station]].\n\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Tacoma from Tacoma Dome Station. The [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascades]] trains, operating as far north as [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and as far south as [[Eugene, Oregon]], serve Tacoma several times daily in both directions. The long-distance ''Coast Starlight'' operates daily between Seattle and Los Angeles via the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n\n==Public utilities==\nTacoma's relationship with [[public utilities]] extends back to 1893. At that time the city was undergoing a boom in population, causing it to exceed the available amount of fresh water supplied by Charles B. Wright's Tacoma Light & Water Company. In response to both this demand and a growing desire to have local public control over the utility system, the city council put up a public vote to acquire and expand the private utility. The measure passed on July 1, 1893, with 3,195 in favor of acquiring the utility system and 1,956 voting against. Since then, [[Tacoma Public Utilities]] (TPU) has grown from a small water and light utility to be the largest department in the city's government, employing about 1,200 people.\n\n[[Tacoma Power]], a division of TPU, provides residents of Tacoma and several bordering municipalities with electrical power generated by eight hydroelectric dams on the [[Skokomish River]] and elsewhere. Environmentalists, fishermen, and the Skokomish Indian Tribe have criticized TPU's operation of Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish River; the tribe's $6 billion claim<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fwee.org/news/getStory?story=1453 |title=Court Ends Fight Over Dams |work=Foundation for Water and Energy Education, quoting The News Tribune |accessdate=2008-03-27 |date=2006-01-12 |first=Chris |last=Sherman}}</ref> was denied by the U.S. Supreme court<ref>{{cite web |url={{SCOTUS URL Docket|05-434}} |title=Docket for 05-434}}</ref> in January 2006.   The capacity of Tacoma's [[hydroelectric]] system as of 2004 was 713,000 [[kilowatt]]s, or about 50% of the demand made up by TPU's customers (the rest is purchased from other utilities). According to TPU, hydroelectricity provides about 87% of Tacoma's power; coal 3%; natural gas 1%; nuclear 9%; and biomass and wind at less than 1%. Tacoma Power also operates the [[Click! Network]], a municipally owned [[cable television]] and internet service. The residential cost per kilowatt hour of electricity is just over 6 cents.\n\nTacoma Water provides customers in its service area with water from the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green River]] Watershed. As of 2004, Tacoma Water provided water services to 93,903 customers. The average annual cost for residential supply was $257.84.\n\n[[Tacoma Rail]], initially a municipally owned street railway line running to the tideflats, was converted to a common-carrier rail switching utility. Tacoma Rail is self-supporting and employs over 90 people.\n\nIn addition to municipal garbage collection, Tacoma offers commingled [[recycling]] services for paper, cardboard, plastics, and metals.\n\n==Parks==\n[[File:Pt Defiance Park 04.jpg|thumb|left|Owen Beach at [[Point Defiance Park]]]]\nParks and recreation services in and around Tacoma are governed by [[Metro Parks Tacoma]], a [[municipal corporation]] established as a separate entity from the city government in 1907.

Public parks along Ruston Way include Jack Hyde Park, Old Town Dock, Hamilton Park, Dickman Mill Park, Les Davis Pier, Marine Park, and Cummings Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroparkstacoma.org/page.php?id=19|title=Metro Parks Tacoma|publisher=}}</ref> The trail is used by walkers, runners, cyclists, and other recreationalists. There are several beaches along Ruston Way with public access, some of which are also popular for scuba diving.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAnother large park in Tacoma is Wapato Park, which has a lake and walking trails that circle the lake. Wapato is in Tacoma's south end, at Sheridan and 72nd St.\n\n[[Titlow Beach]], at the end of 6th Avenue, is also a [[scuba diving]] area.\n\n[[File:Tacoma, WA - Wright Park 01.jpg|thumb|right|Wright Park]]\nWright Park, near downtown, is a large, English-style park designed in the late 19th century by [[Edward Otto Schwagerl]] and Ebenezer Rhys Roberts. It contains [[Wright Park Arboretum]] and the [[W. W. Seymour Botanical Conservatory]]. This historic park is also the home of local festivals such as Ethnic Fest,<ref>[http://www.metroparkstacoma.org/ethnicfest MetroParksTacoma \u2013 Ethnic Fest]</ref> Out in the Park (Tacoma's [[Pride festival#United States|Pride]] festival<ref>[http://tacomapride.org/ TacomaPride \u2013 Pride Festival]</ref>), and the Tacoma [[Seattle Hempfest|Hempfest]] (Tacoma's annual gathering advocating decriminalization of marijuana).\n\nJefferson Park in North Tacoma is the location of a new sprayground, an area designed to be a safe and unique play area where water is sprayed from structures or ground sprays and then drained away before it can accumulate.\n\nFrost Park in downtown Tacoma is often utilized for sidewalk chalk contests.\n\nIn response to the Tacoma area's growing dog population and stricter leash laws in many areas, [[dog park]]s have begun to be established.

Russell]], and [[Silas E. Nelsen]].\n\nTwo suspension bridges span a narrow section of the [[Salish Sea]] called the Tacoma Narrows. The Tacoma Narrows Bridges link Tacoma to Gig Harbor and the [[Kitsap Peninsula]]. The failure of the first [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], which was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world, is a famous case study in architecture textbooks.\n\n===Historic landmarks===\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Pierce County, Washington#Tacoma}}\n[[Image:Fireboat1-ruston-way-tacoma.jpg|thumb|[[Fireboat No. 1]]]]\n\nTacoma has many properties that are listed on the City of Tacoma Register of Historic Places, the Washington State Heritage Register, and the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe city of Tacoma has an active municipal [[historic preservation]] program, which includes 165 individual city landmarks and over 1,000 historic properties included within five locally regulated historic overlay zones.\n\n[[Engine House No. 9 (Tacoma, Washington)|Engine House No. 9]] is a [[fire station]] built in 1907.

At one point, the Tacoma Dome was home to a professional [[indoor soccer]] team, the [[Tacoma Stars (MISL)|Tacoma Stars]]. For the 1994\u201395 season, the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] played in the Tacoma Dome while the [[Seattle Center Coliseum]] was renovated (and renamed [[KeyArena]]). The Tacoma Dome also hosted the 1988 and 1989 Women's NCAA Final Four.
