She could play many different types, but often portrayed haughty, arrogant characters.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Robertson Moorehead was born on December 6, 1900<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Moorehead|title=Agnes Moorehead {{!}} American actress|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref> in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], the daughter of former singer Mary (''n\u00e9e'' McCauley; 1883&ndash;1990), who was 17 when she was born, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] clergyman John Henderson Moorehead (1869&ndash;1938). She was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. Moorehead later claimed that she was born in 1906 in order to appear younger for acting parts. She recalled that she made her first public performance at the age of three, when she recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] in her father's church. The family moved to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and her ambition to become an actress grew \"very strong\". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, \"Who are you today, Agnes?\" while Moorehead and her younger sister Peggy (born Margaret Ann; 1906-1929) engaged in mimicry. This involved coming to the dinner table and imitating their father's parishioners. They were further encouraged by his amused reactions.<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\">Kear, Lynn.

In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in [[religion]]; in later years, actors such as [[Dick Sargent]] recalled Moorehead's arriving on the set with \"the [[Bible]] in one hand and the script in the other\".<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\"/>\n\nMoorehead always said that she graduated from Central High School in St. Louis in 1918. However, she appears in no Central High School yearbook while she does appear in the yearbook of Soldan High School. She lived near Soldan High School on Union Boulevard; she did not live near Central High School on Grand Avenue and Bell. Although her father did not discourage her acting ambitions, he insisted that she obtain a formal education. Moorehead earned a bachelor's degree in 1923, majoring in biology at [[Muskingum College]] in New Concord, Ohio. While there, she also appeared in college stage plays. She received an honorary doctorate in literature from Muskingum in 1947,<ref>{{cite news |editor-last=Rathbun |editor-first=Joe |title=Muskingum to Honor Actress |date=31 May 1947 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/293009118/ |newspaper=The Time Recorder |publisher=W.

She then pursued postgraduate studies at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead also received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].\n\n==Career==\nMoorehead's early career was unsteady, and although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her \"the value of a dollar\". She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met actress [[Helen Hayes]], who encouraged her to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. When she was rejected as not being \"the right type\", Moorehead returned to radio.\n\n===Mercury Theatre===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen Kane-Agnes Moorehead2.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Moorehead in the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] (1940)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and Agnes Moorehead in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], Agnes Moorehead, and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942)\n}}\nBy 1937, Moorehead had joined [[Orson Welles]]' [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]], as one of his principal performers along with [[Joseph Cotten]]. (In an appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on 19 February 1973, she revealed that, in 1922, she had by chance met Welles (fifteen years her junior) when he was a mere seven years old at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.)<ref>Moorehead, Agnes. ''The Dick Cavett Show'', youtube.com, ABC Television Network, 19 February 1973, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jobppR1MPs.</ref>  She performed in his ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial ''[[The Shadow]]'' as [[Margo Lane]]. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for [[RKO Pictures]]. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as the mother of his own character, Charles Foster Kane, in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), considered by most film critics as one of the best films ever made. Moorehead was featured in Welles' second film, ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), and received the [[New York Film Critics Award]] and an [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Award nomination]] for her performance. She also appeared in ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey Into Fear]]'' (1943), a Mercury film production.\n\nMoorehead received positive reviews for her performance in ''[[Mrs. Parkington]]'' as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination. Moorehead played another strong role in ''[[The Big Street]]'' (1942) with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]], and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1943) with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[The Youngest Profession]]'' (1944) with adolescent [[Virginia Weidler]].\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nBy the mid-1940s, Moorehead became a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player, negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract, which also allowed her to perform on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to appear on radio as \"the actors didn't have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show.\"<ref name=\"kear\"/> In 1943\u20131944, Moorehead portrayed \"matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet\", who was constantly offering her \"candied opinion\", in the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall]]''; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.<ref>Cox, Jim, ''Radio Crime Fighters'', 2002, p. 18, McFarland, Jefferson, North Carolina, {{ISBN|0-7864-1390-5}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries.She played Aggie McDonald in Johnny Belinda. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap'n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM's hit 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. She also was in ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' and ''[[Since You Went Away]]''. Moorehead was in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'' in 1951\u20131952, and ''Lord Pengo'' in 1962\u20131963.\n\n===Radio===\nIn her first radio role, Moorehead appeared as a replacement for Dorothy Denvir's role as Min Gump in ''[[The Gumps (radio)|The Gumps]]''. During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''. During the 946-episode run of ''Suspense'', Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the \"first lady of ''Suspense''\". Moorehead's most successful appearance on ''Suspense'' was in the  play ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number#Radio play|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'', written by [[Lucille Fletcher]], broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for ''Suspense'' and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. [[Barbara Stanwyck]] played the role in the [[Sorry, Wrong Number|1948 film version]].\n\nIn 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived ''[[Bringing Up Father (radio)|Bringing Up Father]]'' program on the [[Blue Network]]. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor's housekeeper in the radio version of ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. She also starred in ''The Amazing Mrs. Danberry'', a situation comedy on [[CBS]] in 1946. Moorehead's title character was described as \"the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer.\"<ref name=\"dunningota\">Dunning, John.

Her roles included a national tour of Shaw's ''[[Man and Superman#Don Juan in Hell|Don Juan in Hell]]'', co-starring [[Charles Boyer]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Cedric Hardwicke]], and the pre-Broadway engagements of the new musical ''The Pink Jungle''. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney's hit film ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960). She starred with Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten in ''Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'' (1964) as the maid Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Academy Award]].\n\n===Television===\nIn 1959, Moorehead guest starred on many series, including ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'' and ''[[Alcoa Theatre]]''.<ref name=IMDB>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001547/ ''Agnes Moorehead - Acting Credits''] at IMDb</ref> Her role in the radio play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' inspired writers of the CBS television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' to script an episode with Moorehead in mind.<ref>Richard J.

McFarland, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7864-2367-6}}</ref> In \"[[The Invaders (The Twilight Zone)|The Invaders]]\" (broadcast January 27, 1961) Moorehead played a woman whose isolated farm is plagued by mysterious intruders. In ''Sorry, Wrong Number'', Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice, and for \"The Invaders\", she was offered a script where she had no dialogue at all.\n\nMoorehead also had guest roles on ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' in \"Incident at Poco Tiempo\" as Sister Frances, and ''[[The Rifleman]]''. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in \"The Night of the Vicious Valentine\" on ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a performance for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\n===''Bewitched''===\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|Moorehead with ''[[Bewitched]]'' castmates [[Dick York]] and [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]]]\n\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Bewitched 1969.JPG|thumb|Moorehead as Endora in ''[[Bewitched]]'']]\nIn 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal-loathing, quick-witted witch mother in the situation comedy ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success. However, she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, therefore allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the ''[[Bewitched]]'' scripts as \"hack\" in a 1965 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>\"Agnes Moorehead's recipe for TV success: The Strength of an  Amazon...\" ''TV Guide''. July 17\u201323, 1965</ref> The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as ''[[Bewitched]]'' was in the top 10 programs for the first few years it aired.\n\nMoorehead received six Emmy Award nominations, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Despite her ambivalence, she remained with ''[[Bewitched]]'' until its run ended in 1972. She commented to the ''New York Times'' in 1974, \"I've been in movies and played theater from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before ''[[Bewitched]]'', and I don't particularly want to be identified as a witch.\" Later that year, she said she had enjoyed playing the role, but it was not challenging and the show itself was \"not breathtaking\", although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star [[Dick Sargent]], who in 1969 replaced the ill [[Dick York]] as Samantha's husband Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, describing her as \"a tough old bird.\"<ref name=\"kear\">{{Cite book |last= Kear |first= Lynn |title= Agnes Moorehead: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1992 |publisher= Greenwood Press, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-28155-6 |page= 12 }}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\nIn fall 1964, Moorehead participated in a five-minute commercial spot featuring casts of both ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''Bewitched'', announcing the new 1965 [[Chevrolet]] line.  Moorehead was featured with [[Dan Blocker]] extolling the virtues of the new '65 Chevy II.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early ''[[Night Gallery]]'' episode \"Certain Shadows on the Wall\". She also reprised her role in ''Don Juan in Hell'' on Broadway and on tour, with an all-star cast that featured [[Edward Mulhare]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], and [[Paul Henreid]].\n\nMoorehead supplied the voice of the friendly Mother Goose in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1973 adaptation of [[E. B. White]]'s children's book ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.\n\nFor the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 Broadway adaptation of ''Gigi'']], Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including \"The Contract\" for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, forcing [[Arlene Francis]] to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.\n\nIn January 1974, three months before her death, Moorehead performed in two episodes (including the first) of ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the popular series produced by old-time radio master [[Himan Brown]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1930, Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee; they divorced a year after fostering a boy named Sean in 1952. Moorehead and Lee fostered a boy whose mother had 14 children and were giving six up for adoption. Moorehead felt pity and fostered her son Sean in 1949, but there was never an adoption. Sean had a twin sister but Moorehead did not adopt her. According to Debbie Reynolds that little girl was adopted by another actor or actress. Moorehead fostered Sean but did not raise him nor was she really involved in his life. The employees of Moorehead took care of Sean while she was away being an actress. Sean begged her many times to come home and be with him. She also was a strict disciplinarian and wanted Sean to behave a certain way. She married actor [[Robert Gist]] in 1954, and they divorced in 1958.\n\n===Sexuality===\nMoorehead's sexuality has been the subject of much speculation and dispute.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harbin|first1=Billy J., Kim Marra, and Robert A.

1974) was an American actress whose 41-year career included work in radio, stage, film, and television.<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', May 8, 1974, page 286.</ref> She is best known for her role as [[List of Bewitched characters#Endora|Endora]] on the television series ''[[Bewitched]]'', but she also had notable roles in films, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'', ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'', and ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]''.\n\nMoorehead rarely played lead roles, but her skill at character development and range earned her one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s in addition to nominations for four [[Academy Awards]] and six Emmy Awards. She was the first woman to host the Oscars ceremony.  Her transition to television won acclaim for drama and comedy. She could play many different types, but often portrayed haughty, arrogant characters.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Robertson Moorehead was born on December 6, 1900<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Moorehead|title=Agnes Moorehead {{!}} American actress|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref> in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], the daughter of former singer Mary (''n\u00e9e'' McCauley; 1883&ndash;1990), who was 17 when she was born, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] clergyman John Henderson Moorehead (1869&ndash;1938). She was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. Moorehead later claimed that she was born in 1906 in order to appear younger for acting parts. She recalled that she made her first public performance at the age of three, when she recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] in her father's church. The family moved to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and her ambition to become an actress grew \"very strong\". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, \"Who are you today, Agnes?\" while Moorehead and her younger sister Peggy (born Margaret Ann; 1906-1929) engaged in mimicry. This involved coming to the dinner table and imitating their father's parishioners. They were further encouraged by his amused reactions.<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\">Kear, Lynn. ''Agnes Moorehead: a Bio-Bibliography''. Greenwood Press, 1992. {{ISBN|9780313281556}}.</ref> Moorehead rarely spoke of her sister after her suicide at age 23.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8246713/margaret-ann-moorehead|title=Margaret Ann Moorehead Death Certificate|date=1929-07-16|website=Find a Grave|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>\n\nAs a young lady, Moorehead joined the chorus of the [[The Muny|St. Louis Municipal Opera Company]], known as \"The Muny\". In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in [[religion]]; in later years, actors such as [[Dick Sargent]] recalled Moorehead's arriving on the set with \"the [[Bible]] in one hand and the script in the other\".<ref name=\"Kear, Lynn 1992\"/>\n\nMoorehead always said that she graduated from Central High School in St. Louis in 1918. However, she appears in no Central High School yearbook while she does appear in the yearbook of Soldan High School. She lived near Soldan High School on Union Boulevard; she did not live near Central High School on Grand Avenue and Bell. Although her father did not discourage her acting ambitions, he insisted that she obtain a formal education. Moorehead earned a bachelor's degree in 1923, majoring in biology at [[Muskingum College]] in New Concord, Ohio. While there, she also appeared in college stage plays.

She then pursued postgraduate studies at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead also received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].\n\n==Career==\nMoorehead's early career was unsteady, and although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her \"the value of a dollar\". She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met actress [[Helen Hayes]], who encouraged her to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. When she was rejected as not being \"the right type\", Moorehead returned to radio.\n\n===Mercury Theatre===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen Kane-Agnes Moorehead2.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Moorehead in the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] (1940)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and Agnes Moorehead in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], Agnes Moorehead, and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942)\n}}\nBy 1937, Moorehead had joined [[Orson Welles]]' [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]], as one of his principal performers along with [[Joseph Cotten]]. (In an appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on 19 February 1973, she revealed that, in 1922, she had by chance met Welles (fifteen years her junior) when he was a mere seven years old at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.)<ref>Moorehead, Agnes. ''The Dick Cavett Show'', youtube.com, ABC Television Network, 19 February 1973, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jobppR1MPs.</ref>  She performed in his ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial ''[[The Shadow]]'' as [[Margo Lane]]. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for [[RKO Pictures]]. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as the mother of his own character, Charles Foster Kane, in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), considered by most film critics as one of the best films ever made. Moorehead was featured in Welles' second film, ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), and received the [[New York Film Critics Award]] and an [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Award nomination]] for her performance. She also appeared in ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey Into Fear]]'' (1943), a Mercury film production.\n\nMoorehead received positive reviews for her performance in ''[[Mrs. Parkington]]'' as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination. Moorehead played another strong role in ''[[The Big Street]]'' (1942) with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]], and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1943) with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[The Youngest Profession]]'' (1944) with adolescent [[Virginia Weidler]].\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nBy the mid-1940s, Moorehead became a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player, negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract, which also allowed her to perform on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to appear on radio as \"the actors didn't have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show.\"<ref name=\"kear\"/> In 1943\u20131944, Moorehead portrayed \"matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet\", who was constantly offering her \"candied opinion\", in the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall]]''; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.<ref>Cox, Jim, ''Radio Crime Fighters'', 2002, p. 18, McFarland, Jefferson, North Carolina, {{ISBN|0-7864-1390-5}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries.She played Aggie McDonald in Johnny Belinda. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap'n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM's hit 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. She also was in ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' and ''[[Since You Went Away]]''. Moorehead was in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'' in 1951\u20131952, and ''Lord Pengo'' in 1962\u20131963.\n\n===Radio===\nIn her first radio role, Moorehead appeared as a replacement for Dorothy Denvir's role as Min Gump in ''[[The Gumps (radio)|The Gumps]]''. During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''. During the 946-episode run of ''Suspense'', Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the \"first lady of ''Suspense''\". Moorehead's most successful appearance on ''Suspense'' was in the  play ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number#Radio play|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'', written by [[Lucille Fletcher]], broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for ''Suspense'' and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. [[Barbara Stanwyck]] played the role in the [[Sorry, Wrong Number|1948 film version]].\n\nIn 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived ''[[Bringing Up Father (radio)|Bringing Up Father]]'' program on the [[Blue Network]]. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor's housekeeper in the radio version of ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. She also starred in ''The Amazing Mrs. Danberry'', a situation comedy on [[CBS]] in 1946. Moorehead's title character was described as \"the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer.\"<ref name=\"dunningota\">Dunning, John.

Her roles included a national tour of Shaw's ''[[Man and Superman#Don Juan in Hell|Don Juan in Hell]]'', co-starring [[Charles Boyer]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Cedric Hardwicke]], and the pre-Broadway engagements of the new musical ''The Pink Jungle''. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney's hit film ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960). She starred with Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten in ''Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'' (1964) as the maid Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Academy Award]].\n\n===Television===\nIn 1959, Moorehead guest starred on many series, including ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'' and ''[[Alcoa Theatre]]''.<ref name=IMDB>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001547/ ''Agnes Moorehead - Acting Credits''] at IMDb</ref> Her role in the radio play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' inspired writers of the CBS television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' to script an episode with Moorehead in mind.<ref>Richard J.

In ''Sorry, Wrong Number'', Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice, and for \"The Invaders\", she was offered a script where she had no dialogue at all.\n\nMoorehead also had guest roles on ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' in \"Incident at Poco Tiempo\" as Sister Frances, and ''[[The Rifleman]]''. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in \"The Night of the Vicious Valentine\" on ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a performance for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\n===''Bewitched''===\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|Moorehead with ''[[Bewitched]]'' castmates [[Dick York]] and [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]]]\n\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Bewitched 1969.JPG|thumb|Moorehead as Endora in ''[[Bewitched]]'']]\nIn 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal-loathing, quick-witted witch mother in the situation comedy ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success. However, she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, therefore allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the ''[[Bewitched]]'' scripts as \"hack\" in a 1965 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>\"Agnes Moorehead's recipe for TV success: The Strength of an  Amazon...\" ''TV Guide''. July 17\u201323, 1965</ref> The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as ''[[Bewitched]]'' was in the top 10 programs for the first few years it aired.\n\nMoorehead received six Emmy Award nominations, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Despite her ambivalence, she remained with ''[[Bewitched]]'' until its run ended in 1972. She commented to the ''New York Times'' in 1974, \"I've been in movies and played theater from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before ''[[Bewitched]]'', and I don't particularly want to be identified as a witch.\" Later that year, she said she had enjoyed playing the role, but it was not challenging and the show itself was \"not breathtaking\", although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star [[Dick Sargent]], who in 1969 replaced the ill [[Dick York]] as Samantha's husband Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, describing her as \"a tough old bird.\"<ref name=\"kear\">{{Cite book |last= Kear |first= Lynn |title= Agnes Moorehead: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1992 |publisher= Greenwood Press, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-28155-6 |page= 12 }}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\nIn fall 1964, Moorehead participated in a five-minute commercial spot featuring casts of both ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''Bewitched'', announcing the new 1965 [[Chevrolet]] line.  Moorehead was featured with [[Dan Blocker]] extolling the virtues of the new '65 Chevy II.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early ''[[Night Gallery]]'' episode \"Certain Shadows on the Wall\". She also reprised her role in ''Don Juan in Hell'' on Broadway and on tour, with an all-star cast that featured [[Edward Mulhare]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], and [[Paul Henreid]].\n\nMoorehead supplied the voice of the friendly Mother Goose in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1973 adaptation of [[E. B. White]]'s children's book ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.\n\nFor the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 Broadway adaptation of ''Gigi'']], Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including \"The Contract\" for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, forcing [[Arlene Francis]] to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.\n\nIn January 1974, three months before her death, Moorehead performed in two episodes (including the first) of ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the popular series produced by old-time radio master [[Himan Brown]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1930, Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee; they divorced a year after fostering a boy named Sean in 1952. Moorehead and Lee fostered a boy whose mother had 14 children and were giving six up for adoption. Moorehead felt pity and fostered her son Sean in 1949, but there was never an adoption. Sean had a twin sister but Moorehead did not adopt her. According to Debbie Reynolds that little girl was adopted by another actor or actress. Moorehead fostered Sean but did not raise him nor was she really involved in his life. The employees of Moorehead took care of Sean while she was away being an actress. Sean begged her many times to come home and be with him. She also was a strict disciplinarian and wanted Sean to behave a certain way. She married actor [[Robert Gist]] in 1954, and they divorced in 1958.\n\n===Sexuality===\nMoorehead's sexuality has been the subject of much speculation and dispute.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harbin|first1=Billy J., Kim Marra, and Robert A.

Failing to obtain a legal status, the Ahmadiyya community decided to seek registration as a non-commercial organisation with the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, where one of its biggest congregations is based. This too was rejected on the grounds that \"the community had been denied registration as a religion\" and that \"only registered religious communities are allowed to create non-commercial entities to promote their faith\". However, the community was able to successfully challenge this latter decision and gained registration as such in December 2005. Subsequently, their legal status as a non-commercial organisation was again opposed by the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Regional Prosecutor's Office lodged a suit to the regional court calling for it to revoke the registration. The Bulgarian authorities citied the Pakistani government's legal measures against the Ahmadis as a reason to restrict their rights also. Most human rights and religious freedom activists have seen this denial of registration to the Ahmadi community as an exception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=874|title=Bulgaria: Ahmadis barred \"because it is against the religions that people follow here\"|publisher=Forum18.org|accessdate=2016-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193647/http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=874|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\n{{main|Ahmadiyya in Egypt}}\nThere has been a recent rise of persecution of Ahmadis in Egypt.

Failing to obtain a legal status, the Ahmadiyya community decided to seek registration as a non-commercial organisation with the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, where one of its biggest congregations is based. This too was rejected on the grounds that \"the community had been denied registration as a religion\" and that \"only registered religious communities are allowed to create non-commercial entities to promote their faith\". However, the community was able to successfully challenge this latter decision and gained registration as such in December 2005. Subsequently, their legal status as a non-commercial organisation was again opposed by the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Regional Prosecutor's Office lodged a suit to the regional court calling for it to revoke the registration. The Bulgarian authorities citied the Pakistani government's legal measures against the Ahmadis as a reason to restrict their rights also.

It is the largest and primary city of the [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg district]] with about 88,000 inhabitants. It is situated within the ''[[Stuttgart Region]]'', and the district is part of the [[Stuttgart (region)|administrative region (''Regierungsbezirk'') of Stuttgart]].\n<!--\n==Geography== -->\n\n==Founding==\nThe area around Ludwigsburg had been a favored hunting grounds by the royal W\u00fcrttemberg family for generations before the founding of Ludwigsburg.  Although the region was wilderness, it was easily accessible by boat using the [[Neckar]] River.  In 1704 the founder of Ludwigsburg, [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], arranged for the laying of the foundation stone for Ludwigsburg Palace.  Ludwigsburg is named after the Duke Eberhard Louis' middle name, Ludwig being the German name for Louis.  Right up until his death, construction workers and craftsmen worked on what was to become one of the largest Baroque palace ensembles in Europe.  Under Eberhard Louis and his successor, Charles Eugene, the Palace served as the royal residence of W\u00fcrttemberg for a total of 28 years.  With the Palace as their ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (translated literally, \"collective work of art\") and the opulent festivals they organized, the Dukes put their unbounded power on display with no consideration for the finances of W\u00fcrttemberg.  To them, their most important task was to bring fame and renown to the court of W\u00fcrttemberg and to compete with and outdo other European rulers in this regard.\n\nDuke Eberhard Louis planned to found an ideal Baroque city right beside Ludwigsburg Palace.  From 1709 onwards, he tried to attract new residents to the city with a series of incentives: first he promised free plots of land and free building materials as well as fifteen years tax-free status, and later on he added freedom to practice one's profession and religion to the list.  However, the town only began to grow when it was granted city status in 1718 and then in that year became the royal residence and capital city of the country of W\u00fcrttemberg.  By the time of Eberhard Louis' death in 1733, the population had risen to around 6,000 people, which was more than half as big as the former capital city Stuttgart.  Nevertheless, the new capital city Ludwigsburg was still a major construction site with many unpaved streets and half-finished buildings.\n\nFor over two decades, Eberhard Louis (1676-1733) held court in Ludwigsburg with his mistress Wilhilmine von Gr\u00e4venitz (1684-1744) while the Duchess Johanna Elisabeth (1680-1757) remained in Stuttgart.  The clever, ambitious mistress made the best of her time, influencing politics in W\u00fcrttemberg and advancing her status in society.  When it became clear that the seriously ill heir to the throne would not come to power, Eberhard Louis had a change of heart, split with his lover and reconciled with his wife in the hope that he would have another son.  This was cause for great joy for many people in W\u00fcrttemberg, as the Protestant population feared that power would fall into the hands of the Catholic side of the royal house.  To mark reconciliation, the Ludwigsburg citizenry published a leaflet with a copper etching that made reference to the general wish for a new heir to the throne.  The etching depicts the personification of Ludwigsburg who is receiving a pearl, a symbol of fertility, from the hand of God.  However, people's hopes for another child were not fulfilled as Eberhard Louis died in 1733 and his Catholic cousin, [[Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], ascended to the throne.  When Charles Alexander immediately moved the capital of W\u00fcrttemberg back to Stuttgart, the population of the Ludwigsburg suddenly dropped by more than half within a year.\n\n==History==\nThe middle of Neckarland, where Ludwigsburg lies, was settled in the [[Stone age|stone]] and [[bronze age]]s. Numerous [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] remain in the city and surrounding area.<ref>Hans-Peter Stika.

Accessed March 4, 2010</ref> \n\nTowards the end of the 1st century, the area was occupied by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. They pushed the [[Upper Germanic Limes|Limes]] further to the east around 150 and controlled the region until 260, when the [[Alamanni]] occupied the Neckarland. Evidence of the Alamanni settlement can be found in grave sites in the city today.\n[[File:Ludwigsburg Palace December 2018 IMG 0846.jpg|right|thumb|250px|View of the upper grounds of Ludwigsburg Palace]]\n[[File:JagdschlossFavorite.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Favorite Ludwigsburg|Favorite]] hunting lodge]]\n[[File:SchlossMonrepos.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Monrepos Palace]]]]\n\nThe origins of Ludwigsburg date from the beginning of the 18th century (1718\u20131723) when the largest [[baroque]] [[castle]] in Germany, [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] was built by [[Duke]] [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Ludwig]] von [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Originally, the Duke planned to just build one country home (albeit a [[palace]]), which he began building in 1704.  However, the examples of other [[F\u00fcrst|princes]] fostered a desire to project his [[political absolutism|absolutist]] power by establishing a city. To the baroque palace, he added a hunting lodge and country seat, called ''[[Favorite Ludwigsburg|Schloss Favorite]]'' (1713\u20131728), and the ''Seeschloss'' (castle on the lake) ''[[Monrepos Palace|Monrepos]]'' (1764\u20131768).<ref>[http://www.schloss-ludwigsburg.de/en/ludwigsburg-palace/Home/267924.html Official website of the Ludwigsburg Palace]</ref>\n\nA settlement began near the palace in 1709 and  a town charter was granted on 3 April 1718. That same year, Ludwigsburg became a bailiff's seat, which eventually became the rural district of Ludwigsburg in 1938.\n\nIn the years between 1730 and 1800, the royal seat of residence changed back and forth several times between Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg. In 1800, W\u00fcrttemberg was occupied by France under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and was forced into an alliance. In 1806, the ''[[prince-elector|Kurf\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince-Elector) Friedrich was made king of W\u00fcrttemberg by Napoleon. In 1812, the W\u00fcrttembergish army was raised in Ludwigsburg for Napoleon's Russian campaign. Of the 15,800 W\u00fcrttemberg soldiers who served, just a few hundred returned.\n\nIn 1921, Ludwigsburg became the largest garrison in southwest Germany. In 1945, Ludwigsburg was made a \"Kreisstadt\" (urban district), and later, when the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg municipal code took effect on 1 April 1956, the city was named a major urban district. In 1956 the tradition of the German garrison town was taken up again by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', Germany's federal armed forces.\n\n2004 was the 300th birthday of ''Residenzschloss'' Ludwigsburg, celebrated by the opening of the Baroque Gallery and the Ceramic Museum in the ''Residenzschloss''.\n\n==Jews and World War II==\nJewish families began living in Ludwigsburg during the 19th century and in 1884, a synagogue was built on Solitudestra\u00dfe. The synagogue was later destroyed by storm troopers during [[Kristallnacht]], the pogrom of November 1938.<ref>[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/ludwigsburg_synagoge.htm#Ludwigsburg Jewish History of Ludwigsburg] Official website of Alemania Judaica.

After 1945 until the middle of 1946, there was also an allied internment camp for war criminals in Ludwigsburg and the [[U.S. Army]] maintained the [[Pattonville|Pattonville barracks]] on the edge of town, large enough to have its own American high school.

It is the largest and primary city of the [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg district]] with about 88,000 inhabitants. It is situated within the ''[[Stuttgart Region]]'', and the district is part of the [[Stuttgart (region)|administrative region (''Regierungsbezirk'') of Stuttgart]].\n<!--\n==Geography== -->\n\n==Founding==\nThe area around Ludwigsburg had been a favored hunting grounds by the royal W\u00fcrttemberg family for generations before the founding of Ludwigsburg.  Although the region was wilderness, it was easily accessible by boat using the [[Neckar]] River.  In 1704 the founder of Ludwigsburg, [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], arranged for the laying of the foundation stone for Ludwigsburg Palace.  Ludwigsburg is named after the Duke Eberhard Louis' middle name, Ludwig being the German name for Louis.  Right up until his death, construction workers and craftsmen worked on what was to become one of the largest Baroque palace ensembles in Europe.  Under Eberhard Louis and his successor, Charles Eugene, the Palace served as the royal residence of W\u00fcrttemberg for a total of 28 years.  With the Palace as their ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (translated literally, \"collective work of art\") and the opulent festivals they organized, the Dukes put their unbounded power on display with no consideration for the finances of W\u00fcrttemberg.  To them, their most important task was to bring fame and renown to the court of W\u00fcrttemberg and to compete with and outdo other European rulers in this regard.\n\nDuke Eberhard Louis planned to found an ideal Baroque city right beside Ludwigsburg Palace.  From 1709 onwards, he tried to attract new residents to the city with a series of incentives: first he promised free plots of land and free building materials as well as fifteen years tax-free status, and later on he added freedom to practice one's profession and religion to the list.  However, the town only began to grow when it was granted city status in 1718 and then in that year became the royal residence and capital city of the country of W\u00fcrttemberg.  By the time of Eberhard Louis' death in 1733, the population had risen to around 6,000 people, which was more than half as big as the former capital city Stuttgart.  Nevertheless, the new capital city Ludwigsburg was still a major construction site with many unpaved streets and half-finished buildings.\n\nFor over two decades, Eberhard Louis (1676-1733) held court in Ludwigsburg with his mistress Wilhilmine von Gr\u00e4venitz (1684-1744) while the Duchess Johanna Elisabeth (1680-1757) remained in Stuttgart.  The clever, ambitious mistress made the best of her time, influencing politics in W\u00fcrttemberg and advancing her status in society.  When it became clear that the seriously ill heir to the throne would not come to power, Eberhard Louis had a change of heart, split with his lover and reconciled with his wife in the hope that he would have another son.  This was cause for great joy for many people in W\u00fcrttemberg, as the Protestant population feared that power would fall into the hands of the Catholic side of the royal house.  To mark reconciliation, the Ludwigsburg citizenry published a leaflet with a copper etching that made reference to the general wish for a new heir to the throne.  The etching depicts the personification of Ludwigsburg who is receiving a pearl, a symbol of fertility, from the hand of God.  However, people's hopes for another child were not fulfilled as Eberhard Louis died in 1733 and his Catholic cousin, [[Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], ascended to the throne.  When Charles Alexander immediately moved the capital of W\u00fcrttemberg back to Stuttgart, the population of the Ludwigsburg suddenly dropped by more than half within a year.\n\n==History==\nThe middle of Neckarland, where Ludwigsburg lies, was settled in the [[Stone age|stone]] and [[bronze age]]s.

Originally, the Duke planned to just build one country home (albeit a [[palace]]), which he began building in 1704.  However, the examples of other [[F\u00fcrst|princes]] fostered a desire to project his [[political absolutism|absolutist]] power by establishing a city. To the baroque palace, he added a hunting lodge and country seat, called ''[[Favorite Ludwigsburg|Schloss Favorite]]'' (1713\u20131728), and the ''Seeschloss'' (castle on the lake) ''[[Monrepos Palace|Monrepos]]'' (1764\u20131768).<ref>[http://www.schloss-ludwigsburg.de/en/ludwigsburg-palace/Home/267924.html Official website of the Ludwigsburg Palace]</ref>\n\nA settlement began near the palace in 1709 and  a town charter was granted on 3 April 1718. That same year, Ludwigsburg became a bailiff's seat, which eventually became the rural district of Ludwigsburg in 1938.\n\nIn the years between 1730 and 1800, the royal seat of residence changed back and forth several times between Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg. In 1800, W\u00fcrttemberg was occupied by France under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and was forced into an alliance. In 1806, the ''[[prince-elector|Kurf\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince-Elector) Friedrich was made king of W\u00fcrttemberg by Napoleon. In 1812, the W\u00fcrttembergish army was raised in Ludwigsburg for Napoleon's Russian campaign. Of the 15,800 W\u00fcrttemberg soldiers who served, just a few hundred returned.\n\nIn 1921, Ludwigsburg became the largest garrison in southwest Germany. In 1945, Ludwigsburg was made a \"Kreisstadt\" (urban district), and later, when the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg municipal code took effect on 1 April 1956, the city was named a major urban district. In 1956 the tradition of the German garrison town was taken up again by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', Germany's federal armed forces.\n\n2004 was the 300th birthday of ''Residenzschloss'' Ludwigsburg, celebrated by the opening of the Baroque Gallery and the Ceramic Museum in the ''Residenzschloss''.\n\n==Jews and World War II==\nJewish families began living in Ludwigsburg during the 19th century and in 1884, a synagogue was built on Solitudestra\u00dfe. The synagogue was later destroyed by storm troopers during [[Kristallnacht]], the pogrom of November 1938.<ref>[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/ludwigsburg_synagoge.htm#Ludwigsburg Jewish History of Ludwigsburg] Official website of Alemania Judaica.

After 1945 until the middle of 1946, there was also an allied internment camp for war criminals in Ludwigsburg and the [[U.S. Army]] maintained the [[Pattonville|Pattonville barracks]] on the edge of town, large enough to have its own American high school.

The horizontal elements of the {{ibeam}} are [[flange]]s, and the vertical element is the \"web\". I-beams are usually made of [[structural steel]] and are used in construction and civil engineering. \n\nSometimes, ''school projects'' are rapidly using the i-beam. Note: It is a minor version.\n\nThe web resists shear forces, while the flanges resist most of the bending moment experienced by the beam. The [[Euler-Bernoulli beam equation]] shows that the I-shaped section is a very efficient form for carrying both [[bending]] and [[shearing (physics)|shear]] loads in the plane of the web. On the other hand, the cross-section has a reduced capacity in the transverse direction, and is also inefficient in carrying [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]], for which [[hollow structural section]]s are often preferred.\n\n== History ==\nThe method of producing an I-beam, as rolled from a single piece of steel, was patented by Alphonse Halbou of the company ''[[Forges de la Providence]]'' in 1849.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18-6AAAAIAAJ|page=82|title=International directory of company histories|volume=26|author=Thomas Derdak, Jay P.

''A detailed history of the company by journalists of the Morning Call staff.''}}</ref> Today, rolled cross-sections have been partially displaced in such work by [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] cross-sections.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Ibeam.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.20|Typical cross-section of I-beams.]]\n\nThere are two standard I-beam forms:\n* Rolled I-beam, formed by [[hot rolling]], [[cold rolling]] or [[extrusion]] (depending on material).\n* [[Plate girder]], formed by [[welding]] (or occasionally [[bolted joint|bolting]] or [[rivet]]ing) plates.\n\nI-beams are commonly made of [[structural steel]] but may also be formed from [[aluminium]] or other materials. A common type of I-beam is the ''rolled steel joist'' (RSJ)\u2014sometimes incorrectly rendered as ''reinforced steel joist''. [[British Standard|British]] and [[European Committee for Standardization|European standards]] also specify Universal Beams (UBs) and Universal Columns (UCs). These sections have parallel flanges, as opposed to the varying thickness of RSJ flanges which are seldom now rolled in the UK. Parallel flanges are easier to connect to and do away with the need for tapering washers. UCs have equal or near-equal width and depth and are more suited to being oriented vertically to carry axial load such as columns in multi-storey construction, while UBs are significantly deeper than they are wide are more suited to carrying bending load such as beam elements in floors.\n\n[[I-joist]]s\u2014I-beams engineered from wood with [[fiberboard]] and/or [[laminated veneer lumber]]\u2014are also becoming increasingly popular in construction, especially residential, as they are both lighter and less prone to warping than solid wooden [[joist]]s. However, there has been some concern as to their rapid loss of strength in a fire if unprotected.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Beam mode 2.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.20|Illustration of an I-beam vibrating in torsion mode.]]\nI-beams are widely used in the [[construction industry]] and are available in a variety of standard sizes. Tables are available to allow easy selection of a suitable steel I-beam size for a given applied load. I-beams may be used both as beams and as [[column]]s.\n\nI-beams may be used both on their own, or acting [[composite material|compositely]] with another material, typically [[concrete]]. Design may be governed by any of the following criteria:\n* [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]: the [[stiffness]] of the I-beam will be chosen to minimize deformation\n* [[vibration]]: the stiffness and [[mass]] are chosen to prevent unacceptable vibrations, particularly in settings sensitive to vibrations, such as offices and libraries\n* bending failure by [[yield (engineering)|yielding]]: where the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the cross section exceeds the [[yield stress]]\n* bending failure by [[Buckling#Lateral-torsional buckling|lateral torsional buckling]]: where a flange in compression tends to buckle sideways or the entire cross-section buckles torsionally\n* bending failure by [[Buckling#Local buckling|local buckling]]: where the flange or web is so slender as to buckle locally\n* local yield: caused by concentrated loads, such as at the beam's point of support\n* [[shear failure]]: where the web fails. Slender webs will fail by buckling, rippling in a phenomenon termed '''tension field action''', but shear failure is also resisted by the stiffness of the flanges\n* buckling or yielding of components: for example, of stiffeners used to provide stability to the I-beam's web.\n\n=== Design for bending ===\n[[File:Poutre flexion deviee.svg|thumb|upright=1.80|The largest stresses (<math>\\sigma_{xx}</math>) in a beam under bending are in the locations farthest from the neutral axis.]]\n\nA beam under bending sees high stresses along the axial fibers that are farthest from the [[neutral axis]].  To prevent failure, most of the material in the beam must be located in these regions.  Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the neutral axis.  This observation is the basis of the I-beam cross-section; the neutral axis runs along the center of the web which can be relatively thin and most of the material can be concentrated in the flanges.\n\nThe ideal beam is the one with the least cross-sectional area (and hence requiring the least material) needed to achieve a given [[section modulus]].  Since the section modulus depends on the value of the [[second moment of area|moment of inertia]], an efficient beam must have most of its material located as far from the neutral axis as possible.  The farther a given amount of material is from the neutral axis, the larger is the section modulus and hence a larger bending moment can be resisted.\n\nWhen designing a symmetric I-beam to resist stresses due to bending the usual starting point is the required section modulus.  If the allowable stress is <math>\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}</math> and the maximum expected bending moment is <math>M_{\\mathrm{max}}</math>, then the required section modulus is given by<ref name=Gere />\n:<math>\n   S = \\cfrac{M_{\\mathrm{max}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\cfrac{I}{c}\n </math>\nwhere <math>I</math> is the moment of inertia of the beam cross-section and <math>c</math> is the distance of the top of the beam from the neutral axis (see [[beam theory]] for more details).\n\nFor a beam of cross-sectional area <math>a</math> and height <math>h</math>, the ideal cross-section would have half the area at a distance <math>h/2</math> above the cross-section and the other half at a distance <math>h/2</math> below the cross-section<ref name=Gere>Gere and Timoshenko, 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.</ref>  For this cross-section\n:<math>\n   I = \\cfrac{ah^2}{4} ~;~~ S = 0.5 a h\n </math>\nHowever, these ideal conditions can never be achieved because material is needed in the web for physical reasons, including to resist buckling.  For wide-flange beams, the section modulus is approximately\n:<math>\n   S \\approx 0.35 a h\n </math>\nwhich is superior to that achieved by rectangular beams and circular beams.\n\n=== Issues ===\nThough I-beams are excellent for unidirectional bending in a plane parallel to the web, they do not perform as well in bidirectional bending.  These beams also show little resistance to twisting and undergo sectional warping under torsional loading.  For torsion dominated problems, [[box beam]]s and other types of stiff sections are used in preference to the I-beam.\n\n== Wide-flange steel materials and rolling processes (U.S.) ==\n[[File:Rostiger Stahltraeger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.10|Rusty riveted steel I-beam]]\n\nIn the United States, the most commonly mentioned I-beam is the wide-flange (W) shape. These beams have flanges in which the planes are nearly parallel. Other I-beams include American Standard (designated S) shapes, in which flange surfaces are not parallel, and H-piles (designated HP), which are typically used as pile foundations.

The horizontal elements of the {{ibeam}} are [[flange]]s, and the vertical element is the \"web\". I-beams are usually made of [[structural steel]] and are used in construction and civil engineering.\n\nThe web resists shear forces, while the flanges resist most of the bending moment experienced by the beam. The [[Euler-Bernoulli beam equation]] shows that the I-shaped section is a very efficient form for carrying both [[bending]] and [[shearing (physics)|shear]] loads in the plane of the web. On the other hand, the cross-section has a reduced capacity in the transverse direction, and is also inefficient in carrying [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]], for which [[hollow structural section]]s are often preferred.\n\n== History ==\nThe method of producing an I-beam, as rolled from a single piece of steel, was patented by Alphonse Halbou of the company ''[[Forges de la Providence]]'' in 1849.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18-6AAAAIAAJ|page=82|title=International directory of company histories|volume=26|author=Thomas Derdak, Jay P.

A common type of I-beam is the ''rolled steel joist'' (RSJ)\u2014sometimes incorrectly rendered as ''reinforced steel joist''. [[British Standard|British]] and [[European Committee for Standardization|European standards]] also specify Universal Beams (UBs) and Universal Columns (UCs). These sections have parallel flanges, as opposed to the varying thickness of RSJ flanges which are seldom now rolled in the UK. Parallel flanges are easier to connect to and do away with the need for tapering washers. UCs have equal or near-equal width and depth and are more suited to being oriented vertically to carry axial load such as columns in multi-storey construction, while UBs are significantly deeper than they are wide are more suited to carrying bending load such as beam elements in floors.\n\n[[I-joist]]s\u2014I-beams engineered from wood with [[fiberboard]] and/or [[laminated veneer lumber]]\u2014are also becoming increasingly popular in construction, especially residential, as they are both lighter and less prone to warping than solid wooden [[joist]]s. However, there has been some concern as to their rapid loss of strength in a fire if unprotected.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Beam mode 2.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.20|Illustration of an I-beam vibrating in torsion mode.]]\nI-beams are widely used in the [[construction industry]] and are available in a variety of standard sizes. Tables are available to allow easy selection of a suitable steel I-beam size for a given applied load. I-beams may be used both as beams and as [[column]]s.\n\nI-beams may be used both on their own, or acting [[composite material|compositely]] with another material, typically [[concrete]]. Design may be governed by any of the following criteria:\n* [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]: the [[stiffness]] of the I-beam will be chosen to minimize deformation\n* [[vibration]]: the stiffness and [[mass]] are chosen to prevent unacceptable vibrations, particularly in settings sensitive to vibrations, such as offices and libraries\n* bending failure by [[yield (engineering)|yielding]]: where the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the cross section exceeds the [[yield stress]]\n* bending failure by [[Buckling#Lateral-torsional buckling|lateral torsional buckling]]: where a flange in compression tends to buckle sideways or the entire cross-section buckles torsionally\n* bending failure by [[Buckling#Local buckling|local buckling]]: where the flange or web is so slender as to buckle locally\n* local yield: caused by concentrated loads, such as at the beam's point of support\n* [[shear failure]]: where the web fails. Slender webs will fail by buckling, rippling in a phenomenon termed '''tension field action''', but shear failure is also resisted by the stiffness of the flanges\n* buckling or yielding of components: for example, of stiffeners used to provide stability to the I-beam's web.\n\n=== Design for bending ===\n[[File:Poutre flexion deviee.svg|thumb|upright=1.80|The largest stresses (<math>\\sigma_{xx}</math>) in a beam under bending are in the locations farthest from the neutral axis.]]\n\nA beam under bending sees high stresses along the axial fibers that are farthest from the [[neutral axis]].  To prevent failure, most of the material in the beam must be located in these regions.  Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the neutral axis.  This observation is the basis of the I-beam cross-section; the neutral axis runs along the center of the web which can be relatively thin and most of the material can be concentrated in the flanges.\n\nThe ideal beam is the one with the least cross-sectional area (and hence requiring the least material) needed to achieve a given [[section modulus]].  Since the section modulus depends on the value of the [[second moment of area|moment of inertia]], an efficient beam must have most of its material located as far from the neutral axis as possible.  The farther a given amount of material is from the neutral axis, the larger is the section modulus and hence a larger bending moment can be resisted.\n\nWhen designing a symmetric I-beam to resist stresses due to bending the usual starting point is the required section modulus.  If the allowable stress is <math>\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}</math> and the maximum expected bending moment is <math>M_{\\mathrm{max}}</math>, then the required section modulus is given by<ref name=Gere />\n:<math>\n   S = \\cfrac{M_{\\mathrm{max}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\cfrac{I}{c}\n </math>\nwhere <math>I</math> is the moment of inertia of the beam cross-section and <math>c</math> is the distance of the top of the beam from the neutral axis (see [[beam theory]] for more details).\n\nFor a beam of cross-sectional area <math>a</math> and height <math>h</math>, the ideal cross-section would have half the area at a distance <math>h/2</math> above the cross-section and the other half at a distance <math>h/2</math> below the cross-section<ref name=Gere>Gere and Timoshenko, 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.</ref>  For this cross-section\n:<math>\n   I = \\cfrac{ah^2}{4} ~;~~ S = 0.5 a h\n </math>\nHowever, these ideal conditions can never be achieved because material is needed in the web for physical reasons, including to resist buckling.  For wide-flange beams, the section modulus is approximately\n:<math>\n   S \\approx 0.35 a h\n </math>\nwhich is superior to that achieved by rectangular beams and circular beams.\n\n=== Issues ===\nThough I-beams are excellent for unidirectional bending in a plane parallel to the web, they do not perform as well in bidirectional bending.  These beams also show little resistance to twisting and undergo sectional warping under torsional loading.  For torsion dominated problems, [[box beam]]s and other types of stiff sections are used in preference to the I-beam.\n\n== Wide-flange steel materials and rolling processes (U.S.) ==\n[[File:Rostiger Stahltraeger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.10|Rusty riveted steel I-beam]]\n\nIn the United States, the most commonly mentioned I-beam is the wide-flange (W) shape.
