Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her a U.S. [[National Book Awar\n\n==Life and work==\n{{Listen|filename=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy).ogg|title=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy)}}\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:RachelCarsonHomestead.jpg|thumb|left|Carson's childhood home is now preserved as the [[Rachel Carson Homestead]] (photo taken November 7, 2009)]]\nRachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near [[Springdale, Pennsylvania]], just up the [[Allegheny River]] from [[Pittsburgh]]. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu/mwwc/research/featured-writers/rachel-l.-carson-collection-1946-1964 |title=Maine Women Writers Collection\u2014Research\u2014Featured Writers\u2014Rachel L.

An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' (which carried her first published stories), the works of [[Beatrix Potter]], and the novels of [[Gene Stratton-Porter]], and in her teen years, [[Herman Melville]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania|Parnassus, Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.<ref>Lear, 7\u201324</ref>\n\nAt the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as [[Chatham University]]), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928, though she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rachel Carson|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/rachelcarson/carsonbio.html|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Though admitted to graduate standing at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated ''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'' in 1929. After a summer course at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], she continued her studies in [[zoology]] and [[genetics]] at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=27\u201362}}</ref>\n\nAfter her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in [[Raymond Pearl]]'s laboratory, where she worked with rats and ''[[Drosophila]]'', to earn money for tuition. After false starts with [[pit viper]]s and [[squirrel]]s, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the [[pronephros]] in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=Autumn 2011|title=\"Silence, Miss Carson!\" Science, Gender, and the Reception of \"Silent Spring\"|jstor=3178817|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=27|issue=3|pages=733\u2013752|doi=10.2307/3178817}}</ref> In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the [[United States Fish Commission|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled ''Romance Under the Waters''. The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureau, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=63\u201379}}</ref>\n\nCarson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=79\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Early career and publications===\nAt the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=82\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' accepted a revised version of an essay, ''The World of Waters'', that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as ''Undersea'', was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house [[Simon & Schuster]], impressed by ''Undersea'', contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued\u2014her features appeared in ''Sun Magazine'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=85\u2013113}}</ref> Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the [[Manhattan Project]]. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of [[DDT]], a revolutionary new pesticide\u2014lauded as the \"insect bomb\" after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]\u2014that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and [[Ecology|ecological]] effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=114\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Rachel Carson Conducts Marine Biology Research with Bob Hines.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rachel Carson and [[Robert W. Hines|Bob Hines]] conducting research off the Atlantic coast in 1952]]\nCarson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 becoming chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, [[Marie Rodell]]; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=121\u201360}}</ref>\n\n[[Oxford University Press]] expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become ''[[The Sea Around Us]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=163\u201364}}.<br />\u2022 An apocryphal story holds that the book was rejected by over twenty publishers before Oxford University Press. In fact, it may have only been sent to one other publisher before being accepted, though Rodell and Carson worked extensively to place chapters and excerpts in periodicals.</ref> Chapters appeared in ''[[Science Digest]]'' and ''[[The Yale Review]]''\u2014the latter chapter, \"The Birth of an Island\", winning the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize.

She also licensed a documentary film based on it. ''The Sea''{{'s}} success led to the republication of ''Under the Sea Wind'', which became a bestseller itself.

This led to many scientific inconsistencies inside the film.  Allen then proceeded in spite of Carson's objections to fix the problems to produce a very successful documentary.  It then proceeded to win the 1953 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], but Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=239\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Dorothy Freeman===\nCarson first met Dorothy Freeman in the summer of 1953 in [[Southport, Maine|Southport Island, Maine]]. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book ''Always, Rachel'', published in 1995 by Beacon Press.\n\nCarson's biographer, [[Linda J. Lear]], writes that \"Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=248}}</ref> She found this in Freeman. The two women had a number of common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would share summers for the remainder of Carson's life, and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=243\u201388}}</ref>\n\nIn regard to the extent of their relationship, commentators have said that: \"the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Montefiore, Janet|title='The fact that possesses my imagination': Rachel Carson, Science and Writing|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|volume=12|issue=1|page=48|year=2001|doi=10.1080/09574040110034110}}</ref> Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=255\u201356}}</ref> Some believe Freeman and Carson's relationship was romantic in nature.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/deliberate-pace-rachel-carson/|title=A Deliberate Pace: On Rachel Carson|last=Gornick|first=Vivian|date=2013-02-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/the-right-way-to-remember-rachel-carson|title=The Right Way to Remember Rachel Carson|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=2018-03-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> One of the letters from Carson to Freeman reads: \u201cBut, oh darling, I want to be with you so terribly that it hurts!\u201d, while in another, Freeman writes: \u201cI love you beyond expression...

The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as ''Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952\u20131964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship'', edited by Freeman's granddaughter. Editor Martha Freeman, Dorothy's granddaughter, wrote at publication: \"A few comments in early letters indicate that Rachel and Dorothy were initially cautious about the romantic tone and terminology of their correspondence.

Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against her own wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached. Carson's own wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her agent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks) and Dorothy Freeman. In the Spring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel's ashes in the mail sent to her by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel's final wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in Maine.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=482\u2013483}}</ref>\n\n===<span id=\"The Edge of the Sea\"></span> ''The Edge of the Sea'' and transition to conservation work ===\nEarly in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=223\u201344}}</ref> In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''The Edge of the Sea'', which focuses on life in [[coast]]al ecosystems, particularly along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=261\u201376}}</ref>\n\nThrough 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on a number of projects\u2014including the script for an ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' episode, \"Something About the Sky\"\u2014and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address [[evolution]], but the publication of [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''Evolution in Action''\u2014and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic\u2014led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled ''Remembrance of the Earth'' and became involved with [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the \"Lost Woods.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=276\u2013300}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1957, a family tragedy struck for a third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her 5-year-old son, Roger Christie an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility of Roger Christie when she adopted him, alongside caring for her aging mother. Carson moved to [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting together a new living situation and studying on specific environmental threats\n\nBy late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) planned to eradicate [[Red imported fire ant|fire ants]], and other spraying programs involving [[Organochloride|chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and [[organophosphate]]s were on the rise.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=305\u201313}}</ref> For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.\n\n===''Silent Spring''===\n{{Main|Silent Spring}}\n{{See also|DDT|}}\n\n''[[Silent Spring]]'', Carson's best-known book, was published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] on 27 September 1962.<ref name=McLaughlin>{{cite web |author=McLaughlin, Dorothy |title=Fooling with Nature: ''Silent Spring'' Revisited |work=Frontline |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html |access-date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the [[environmental movement]].<ref>Josie Glausiusz.

It was the United States federal government's 1957 [[gypsy moth]] eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on [[Long Island]] filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.<ref name=CarsonPaull /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=S.|title=Marjorie Spock |journal=The Ellsworth American |date=January 30, 2008 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Jennifer|title=Obituary for Marjorie Spock|journal=Newsletter of the Portland Branch of Anthroposophical Society in Portland, Oregon|date=February 2008|volume=4|issue=2|page=7|url=http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|access-date=29 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829182612/http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Audubon Naturalist Society]] also actively opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=312\u201317}}</ref> Carson began the four-year project of what would become ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist [[E. B. White]], and a number of journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with ''[[Newsweek]]'' science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when ''The New Yorker'' commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of ''Silent Spring'').<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=317\u201327}}</ref>\n\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as [[biological pest control]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=327\u201336}}</ref>\n\nShe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of [[biodynamic agriculture]] organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government.  According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson's book. [[Marjorie Spock]] and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They  compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts, as a primary input for ''Silent Spring''. Carson wrote of the content as \"a gold mine of information\" and says, \"I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here\"<ref>Carson, R. (1958c).

New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the USDA's [[Agricultural Research Service]] responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, ''Fire Ant on Trial''; Carson characterized it as \"flagrant [[propaganda]]\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially [[dieldrin]] and [[heptachlor]]) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', that attributed the recent decline in bird populations\u2014in her words, the \"silencing of birds\"\u2014to pesticide overuse.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=342\u201346}}</ref> That was also the year of the \"Great Cranberry Scandal\": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. [[cranberry|cranberries]] were found to contain high levels of the herbicide [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole|aminotriazole]] (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=358\u201361}}</ref>\n\nResearch at the [[United States National Library of Medicine|Library of Medicine]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of [[National Cancer Institute]] researcher and environmental cancer section founding director [[Wilhelm Hueper]], who classified many pesticides as [[carcinogen]]s. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide [[carcinogenesis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=355\u201358}}</ref>\n\nBy 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of ''Silent Spring''. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a [[mastectomy]]. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was [[malignant]] and the cancer had [[metastasized]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=360\u201368}}</ref> Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of ''The Sea Around Us'', and by a collaborative photo essay with [[Erich Hartmann (photographer)|Erich Hartmann]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=372\u201373}}. The photo essay, ''The Sea'', was published in ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', May/June 1961; Carson provided the captions for Hartmann's photographs.</ref> Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on [[biological pest control]]s and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=376\u201377}}</ref> During this time while writing the book Carson had to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies couldn't use it against her. She worried that if the companies knew it would give them additional ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Koehn |first1=Nancy |title=Forged in crisis : the power of courageous leadership in turbulent times |date=3 October 2017 |isbn=9781501174445 |page=416 |edition=First Scribner hardcoverition}}</ref>\n\nIt was difficult finding a title for the book; \"Silent Spring\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: ''Silent Spring'' would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377\u201378, 386\u201387, 389}}</ref> With Carson's approval, editor [[Paul Brooks (author)|Paul Brooks]] at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, ''A Fable for Tomorrow'', which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=390\u201397}}</ref>\n\n====Content====\nAs biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson \"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the [[paradigm]] of [[scientific progress]] that defined [[post-war]] American culture.\" The overriding theme of ''Silent Spring'' is the powerful\u2014and often adverse\u2014effect humans have on the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201376}}</ref>\n\nCarson's main argument is that [[pesticide]]s have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed ''[[biocide]]s'', she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny as well, many of which are subject to [[bioaccumulation]]. Carson also accuses the [[chemical industry]] of intentionally spreading [[disinformation]] and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201372}}</ref> About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:\n{{quote|In laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some \"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas.\" Dr. Hueper [author of ''Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases''] now gives DDT the definite rating of a \"chemical carcinogen.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=225}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop [[pesticide resistance]], while weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated [[invasive species]]. The book closes with a call for a [[biotic material|biotic]] approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=169, 173}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to the pesticide DDT, Carson never actually called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in ''Silent Spring'' was that even if DDT and other insecticides had ''no'' environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticide(s), making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations:\n\n{{quote|No responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story\u2014the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=266}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson further noted that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=267}}</ref> and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity' ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\"<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\">{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=275}}</ref>\n\n====Promotion and reception====\nCarson and the others involved with publication of ''Silent Spring'' expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for [[Defamation|libel]]. Carson was also undergoing [[radiation therapy]] to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=397\u2013400}}</ref>\n\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the [[White House]] Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of ''Silent Spring'' to many of the delegates, and promoted the upcoming ''New Yorker'' serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice [[William O. Douglas]], a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377, 400\u201307}}. Douglas's dissenting opinion on the rejection of the case, ''Robert Cushman Murphy et al., v. Butler et al.'', from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, is from March 28, 1960.</ref>\n\nThough ''Silent Spring'' had generated a fairly high level of interest based on prepublication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that ''Silent Spring'' had been selected as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] for October; as she put it, this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like\u2014much less ''The New Yorker''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=407\u201308}}. Quotation (p. 408) from a June 13, 1962, letter from Carson to Dorothy Freeman.</ref> Other publicity included a positive editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and excerpts of the serialized version in ''[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]]'' magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug [[thalidomide]] broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=409\u201313}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Silent Spring Book-of-the-Month-Club edition.JPG|thumb|The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] edition of ''[[Silent Spring]]'', including an endorsement by Justice Douglas, had a first print run of 150,000 copies, two-and-a-half times the combined size of the two conventional printings of the initial release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=416, 419}}</ref>]] -->\nIn the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to ''Silent Spring'' from the chemical industry. [[DuPont]] (a main manufacturer of DDT and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]]) and [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]] (exclusive manufacturer of [[chlordane]] and [[heptachlor]]) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as ''The New Yorker'' and ''Audubon'' unless the planned ''Silent Spring'' features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process ''Silent Spring'' had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=412\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[American Cyanamid]] biochemist [[Robert White-Stevens]] and former Cyanamid chemist [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Jukes]] were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=433\u201334}}</ref> According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.\"<ref name=\"frontline_Cyanamid\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html Fooling with nature: special reports: Silent Spring revisited:]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.</ref> Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character. White-Stevens labeled her \"...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=434}}</ref> while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture [[Ezra Taft Benson]], in a letter to former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \"probably a [[Communism|Communist]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=429\u201330}}. Benson's supposed comments were widely repeated at the time, but have not been directly confirmed.</ref>\n\nMany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2005||p=9}}</ref> In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in ''Silent Spring'' not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\" />\n\nThe academic community, including prominent defenders such as [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]], [[Loren Eiseley]], [[Clarence Cottam]], and [[Frank Edwin Egler|Frank Egler]], by and large backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as ''Silent Spring'' book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the ''[[CBS Reports]]'' TV special ''The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson'' that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from ''Silent Spring'' and interviews with a number of other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer [[Linda Lear]], \"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=437\u201349}}; quotation from 449.</ref> Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=449\u201350}}</ref> Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.<ref name=\"time100\">[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson03.html The Time 100: Scientists and Thinkers], accessed September 23, 2007</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=461}}</ref>\n\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President [[John F.

Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the [[National Audubon Society#Audubon Medal|Audubon Medal]] (from the [[National Audubon Society]]), the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (from the [[American Geographical Society]]), and induction into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=451\u201361, 469\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWeakened from [[breast cancer]] and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964.

All of Carson's books remain in print.<ref name=\"Murphy 25\" />\n\n===Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA===\nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. ''Silent Spring'', in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, \"''Silent Spring'' altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|p=3}}</ref> Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the [[deep ecology]] movement, and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of [[ecofeminism]] and on many feminist scientists.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nWhile there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement.<ref name=\":0\" /> Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an \"amateur\" and it was said that her writing was too \"emotional.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical, but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead, of her leisure activities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment,\" and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a [[conflict of interest]], since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the extended shadow of ''Silent Spring''.\" Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]], was directly related to Carson's work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=47\u201348, 148\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the policies of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=217\u201320}}; Jeffrey K.

Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her a U.S. [[National Book Award]],<ref name=nba1952 /> recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, ''The Edge of the Sea'', and the reissued version of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'', were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.\n\nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic [[pesticide]]s. The result was the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although ''Silent Spring'' was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on [[DDT]] and other pesticides. It also inspired a [[grassroots]] environmental movement that led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref name=CarsonPaull>Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/22934/7/22934.pdf \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring\"], ''Sage Open'', 3(July): 1\u201312. {{doi|10.1177/2158244013494861}}</ref> Carson was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\n==Life and work==\n{{Listen|filename=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy).ogg|title=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy)}}\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:RachelCarsonHomestead.jpg|thumb|left|Carson's childhood home is now preserved as the [[Rachel Carson Homestead]] (photo taken November 7, 2009)]]\nRachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near [[Springdale, Pennsylvania]], just up the [[Allegheny River]] from [[Pittsburgh]]. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu/mwwc/research/featured-writers/rachel-l.-carson-collection-1946-1964 |title=Maine Women Writers Collection\u2014Research\u2014Featured Writers\u2014Rachel L.

An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' (which carried her first published stories), the works of [[Beatrix Potter]], and the novels of [[Gene Stratton-Porter]], and in her teen years, [[Herman Melville]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania|Parnassus, Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.<ref>Lear, 7\u201324</ref>\n\nAt the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as [[Chatham University]]), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928, though she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rachel Carson|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/rachelcarson/carsonbio.html|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Though admitted to graduate standing at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated ''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'' in 1929. After a summer course at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], she continued her studies in [[zoology]] and [[genetics]] at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=27\u201362}}</ref>\n\nAfter her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in [[Raymond Pearl]]'s laboratory, where she worked with rats and ''[[Drosophila]]'', to earn money for tuition. After false starts with [[pit viper]]s and [[squirrel]]s, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the [[pronephros]] in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=Autumn 2011|title=\"Silence, Miss Carson!\" Science, Gender, and the Reception of \"Silent Spring\"|jstor=3178817|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=27|issue=3|pages=733\u2013752|doi=10.2307/3178817}}</ref> In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the [[United States Fish Commission|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled ''Romance Under the Waters''. The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureau, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=63\u201379}}</ref>\n\nCarson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=79\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Early career and publications===\nAt the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=82\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' accepted a revised version of an essay, ''The World of Waters'', that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as ''Undersea'', was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house [[Simon & Schuster]], impressed by ''Undersea'', contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued\u2014her features appeared in ''Sun Magazine'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=85\u2013113}}</ref> Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the [[Manhattan Project]]. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of [[DDT]], a revolutionary new pesticide\u2014lauded as the \"insect bomb\" after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]\u2014that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and [[Ecology|ecological]] effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=114\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Rachel Carson Conducts Marine Biology Research with Bob Hines.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rachel Carson and [[Robert W.

Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, [[Marie Rodell]]; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=121\u201360}}</ref>\n\n[[Oxford University Press]] expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become ''[[The Sea Around Us]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=163\u201364}}.<br />\u2022 An apocryphal story holds that the book was rejected by over twenty publishers before Oxford University Press.

Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book ''Always, Rachel'', published in 1995 by Beacon Press.\n\nCarson's biographer, [[Linda J. Lear]], writes that \"Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=248}}</ref> She found this in Freeman. The two women had a number of common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would share summers for the remainder of Carson's life, and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=243\u201388}}</ref>\n\nIn regard to the extent of their relationship, commentators have said that: \"the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Montefiore, Janet|title='The fact that possesses my imagination': Rachel Carson, Science and Writing|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|volume=12|issue=1|page=48|year=2001|doi=10.1080/09574040110034110}}</ref> Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=255\u201356}}</ref> Some believe Freeman and Carson's relationship was romantic in nature.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/deliberate-pace-rachel-carson/|title=A Deliberate Pace: On Rachel Carson|last=Gornick|first=Vivian|date=2013-02-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/the-right-way-to-remember-rachel-carson|title=The Right Way to Remember Rachel Carson|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=2018-03-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> One of the letters from Carson to Freeman reads: \u201cBut, oh darling, I want to be with you so terribly that it hurts!\u201d, while in another, Freeman writes: \u201cI love you beyond expression...

Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against her own wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached. Carson's own wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her agent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks) and Dorothy Freeman. In the Spring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel's ashes in the mail sent to her by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel's final wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in Maine.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=482\u2013483}}</ref>\n\n===<span id=\"The Edge of the Sea\"></span> ''The Edge of the Sea'' and transition to conservation work ===\nEarly in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=223\u201344}}</ref> In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''The Edge of the Sea'', which focuses on life in [[coast]]al ecosystems, particularly along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=261\u201376}}</ref>\n\nThrough 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on a number of projects\u2014including the script for an ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' episode, \"Something About the Sky\"\u2014and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address [[evolution]], but the publication of [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''Evolution in Action''\u2014and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic\u2014led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled ''Remembrance of the Earth'' and became involved with [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the \"Lost Woods.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=276\u2013300}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1957, a family tragedy struck for a third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her 5-year-old son, Roger Christie an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility of Roger Christie when she adopted him, alongside caring for her aging mother. Carson moved to [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting together a new living situation and studying on specific environmental threats\n\nBy late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) planned to eradicate [[Red imported fire ant|fire ants]], and other spraying programs involving [[Organochloride|chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and [[organophosphate]]s were on the rise.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=305\u201313}}</ref> For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.\n\n===''Silent Spring''===\n{{Main|Silent Spring}}\n{{See also|DDT|}}\n\n''[[Silent Spring]]'', Carson's best-known book, was published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] on 27 September 1962.<ref name=McLaughlin>{{cite web |author=McLaughlin, Dorothy |title=Fooling with Nature: ''Silent Spring'' Revisited |work=Frontline |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html |access-date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the [[environmental movement]].<ref>Josie Glausiusz.

It was the United States federal government's 1957 [[gypsy moth]] eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on [[Long Island]] filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.<ref name=CarsonPaull /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=S.|title=Marjorie Spock |journal=The Ellsworth American |date=January 30, 2008 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Jennifer|title=Obituary for Marjorie Spock|journal=Newsletter of the Portland Branch of Anthroposophical Society in Portland, Oregon|date=February 2008|volume=4|issue=2|page=7|url=http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|access-date=29 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829182612/http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Audubon Naturalist Society]] also actively opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=312\u201317}}</ref> Carson began the four-year project of what would become ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist [[E. B. White]], and a number of journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with ''[[Newsweek]]'' science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when ''The New Yorker'' commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of ''Silent Spring'').<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=317\u201327}}</ref>\n\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as [[biological pest control]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=327\u201336}}</ref>\n\nShe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of [[biodynamic agriculture]] organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government.  According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson's book. [[Marjorie Spock]] and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They  compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts, as a primary input for ''Silent Spring''. Carson wrote of the content as \"a gold mine of information\" and says, \"I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here\"<ref>Carson, R. (1958c). MS typewritten letter: Dear Miss Spock; 12/8/1958. New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</ref> and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and to his correspondence.<ref>Paull, John. \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring.\" Sage Open 3, no. 3 (2013) doi:10.1177/2158244013494861.</ref><ref>Carson, R. (1958f). MS typewritten letter: Dear Mrs. Spock; 26/3/1958 (1 p.). New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the USDA's [[Agricultural Research Service]] responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, ''Fire Ant on Trial''; Carson characterized it as \"flagrant [[propaganda]]\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially [[dieldrin]] and [[heptachlor]]) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', that attributed the recent decline in bird populations\u2014in her words, the \"silencing of birds\"\u2014to pesticide overuse.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=342\u201346}}</ref> That was also the year of the \"Great Cranberry Scandal\": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. [[cranberry|cranberries]] were found to contain high levels of the herbicide [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole|aminotriazole]] (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=358\u201361}}</ref>\n\nResearch at the [[United States National Library of Medicine|Library of Medicine]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of [[National Cancer Institute]] researcher and environmental cancer section founding director [[Wilhelm Hueper]], who classified many pesticides as [[carcinogen]]s. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide [[carcinogenesis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=355\u201358}}</ref>\n\nBy 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of ''Silent Spring''. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a [[mastectomy]]. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was [[malignant]] and the cancer had [[metastasized]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=360\u201368}}</ref> Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of ''The Sea Around Us'', and by a collaborative photo essay with [[Erich Hartmann (photographer)|Erich Hartmann]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=372\u201373}}. The photo essay, ''The Sea'', was published in ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', May/June 1961; Carson provided the captions for Hartmann's photographs.</ref> Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on [[biological pest control]]s and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=376\u201377}}</ref> During this time while writing the book Carson had to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies couldn't use it against her. She worried that if the companies knew it would give them additional ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Koehn |first1=Nancy |title=Forged in crisis : the power of courageous leadership in turbulent times |date=3 October 2017 |isbn=9781501174445 |page=416 |edition=First Scribner hardcoverition}}</ref>\n\nIt was difficult finding a title for the book; \"Silent Spring\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: ''Silent Spring'' would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377\u201378, 386\u201387, 389}}</ref> With Carson's approval, editor [[Paul Brooks (author)|Paul Brooks]] at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, ''A Fable for Tomorrow'', which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=390\u201397}}</ref>\n\n====Content====\nAs biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson \"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the [[paradigm]] of [[scientific progress]] that defined [[post-war]] American culture.\" The overriding theme of ''Silent Spring'' is the powerful\u2014and often adverse\u2014effect humans have on the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201376}}</ref>\n\nCarson's main argument is that [[pesticide]]s have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed ''[[biocide]]s'', she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny as well, many of which are subject to [[bioaccumulation]]. Carson also accuses the [[chemical industry]] of intentionally spreading [[disinformation]] and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201372}}</ref> About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:\n{{quote|In laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some \"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas.\" Dr. Hueper [author of ''Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases''] now gives DDT the definite rating of a \"chemical carcinogen.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=225}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop [[pesticide resistance]], while weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated [[invasive species]]. The book closes with a call for a [[biotic material|biotic]] approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=169, 173}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to the pesticide DDT, Carson never actually called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in ''Silent Spring'' was that even if DDT and other insecticides had ''no'' environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticide(s), making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations:\n\n{{quote|No responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story\u2014the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=266}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson further noted that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=267}}</ref> and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity' ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\"<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\">{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=275}}</ref>\n\n====Promotion and reception====\nCarson and the others involved with publication of ''Silent Spring'' expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for [[Defamation|libel]]. Carson was also undergoing [[radiation therapy]] to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=397\u2013400}}</ref>\n\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the [[White House]] Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of ''Silent Spring'' to many of the delegates, and promoted the upcoming ''New Yorker'' serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice [[William O. Douglas]], a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377, 400\u201307}}. Douglas's dissenting opinion on the rejection of the case, ''Robert Cushman Murphy et al., v. Butler et al.'', from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, is from March 28, 1960.</ref>\n\nThough ''Silent Spring'' had generated a fairly high level of interest based on prepublication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that ''Silent Spring'' had been selected as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] for October; as she put it, this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like\u2014much less ''The New Yorker''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=407\u201308}}. Quotation (p. 408) from a June 13, 1962, letter from Carson to Dorothy Freeman.</ref> Other publicity included a positive editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and excerpts of the serialized version in ''[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]]'' magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug [[thalidomide]] broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=409\u201313}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Silent Spring Book-of-the-Month-Club edition.JPG|thumb|The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] edition of ''[[Silent Spring]]'', including an endorsement by Justice Douglas, had a first print run of 150,000 copies, two-and-a-half times the combined size of the two conventional printings of the initial release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=416, 419}}</ref>]] -->\nIn the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to ''Silent Spring'' from the chemical industry. [[DuPont]] (a main manufacturer of DDT and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]]) and [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]] (exclusive manufacturer of [[chlordane]] and [[heptachlor]]) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as ''The New Yorker'' and ''Audubon'' unless the planned ''Silent Spring'' features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process ''Silent Spring'' had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=412\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[American Cyanamid]] biochemist [[Robert White-Stevens]] and former Cyanamid chemist [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Jukes]] were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=433\u201334}}</ref> According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.\"<ref name=\"frontline_Cyanamid\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html Fooling with nature: special reports: Silent Spring revisited:]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.</ref> Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character. White-Stevens labeled her \"...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=434}}</ref> while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture [[Ezra Taft Benson]], in a letter to former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \"probably a [[Communism|Communist]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=429\u201330}}. Benson's supposed comments were widely repeated at the time, but have not been directly confirmed.</ref>\n\nMany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2005||p=9}}</ref> In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in ''Silent Spring'' not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\" />\n\nThe academic community, including prominent defenders such as [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]], [[Loren Eiseley]], [[Clarence Cottam]], and [[Frank Edwin Egler|Frank Egler]], by and large backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as ''Silent Spring'' book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the ''[[CBS Reports]]'' TV special ''The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson'' that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from ''Silent Spring'' and interviews with a number of other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer [[Linda Lear]], \"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=437\u201349}}; quotation from 449.</ref> Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=449\u201350}}</ref> Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.<ref name=\"time100\">[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson03.html The Time 100: Scientists and Thinkers], accessed September 23, 2007</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=461}}</ref>\n\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President [[John F.

Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the [[National Audubon Society#Audubon Medal|Audubon Medal]] (from the [[National Audubon Society]]), the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (from the [[American Geographical Society]]), and induction into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=451\u201361, 469\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWeakened from [[breast cancer]] and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964.

The essay, which was combined with photographs by [[Charles Pratt II|Charles Pratt]] and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the \"...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea and sky and their amazing life.\"<ref name=\"Murphy 25\">Murphy, 25; quotations from ''The Sense of Wonder'', 95.

All of Carson's books remain in print.<ref name=\"Murphy 25\" />\n\n===Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA===\nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. ''Silent Spring'', in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, \"''Silent Spring'' altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|p=3}}</ref> Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the [[deep ecology]] movement, and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of [[ecofeminism]] and on many feminist scientists.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nWhile there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement.<ref name=\":0\" /> Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an \"amateur\" and it was said that her writing was too \"emotional.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical, but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead, of her leisure activities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment,\" and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a [[conflict of interest]], since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the extended shadow of ''Silent Spring''.\" Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]], was directly related to Carson's work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=47\u201348, 148\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the policies of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=217\u201320}}; Jeffrey K.

Turkey]] is the process by which people [[human migration|migrate]] to [[Turkey]] to reside in the country. Many, but not all, become [[Turkish nationality law|Turkish citizens]]. After the  [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] and following [[Turkish War of Independence]], an [[Emigration|exodus]] by the large portion of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ([[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]) and [[Islam|Muslim]] peoples from the [[Balkans]] ([[Turks in the Balkans|Balkan Turks]], [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Pomaks]]), [[Caucasus]] ([[Abkhaz people|Abkhazians]], [[Ajarians]], '[[Circassians]]', [[Chechen people|Chechens]]), [[Crimea]] ([[Crimean Tatar diaspora]]), and [[Crete]] ([[Cretan Turks]]) took refuge in present-day Turkey and moulded the country's fundamental features. Trends of immigration towards Turkey continue to this day, although the motives are more varied and are usually in line with the patterns of global [[immigration]] movements &mdash; Turkey, for example, receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as [[Armenia]], the [[Moldova]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], and [[Azerbaijan]], but also from [[Central Asia]]. [[Turkey's migrant crisis]] is a period during 2010s characterized by high numbers of people arriving in Turkey.\n\n== Internal migration ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Place of origin (rows) versus place of residence (columns) for Turkish citizens in 2014<ref>TurkStat</ref>\n!

[[Secularism|secular]] (''Laiklik'', Turkish adaptation of French ''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]''), i.e. without a [[state religion]], or separate ethnic divisions/ identities. The concept of \"minorities\" has only been accepted by the Republic of Turkey as defined by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and thence strictly limited to Greeks, Jews and Armenians, only on religious matters, excluding from the scope of the concept the ethnic identities of these minorities as of others such as the Kurds who make up 15% of the country; others include Assyrians/Syriacs of various Christian denominations, Alevis and all the others.\n\nThere are many reports from sources such as ([[Human Rights Watch]], [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], national parliaments in EU member states, [[Amnesty International]] etc.) on persistent yet declining discrimination.\n\nCertain current trends are:\n* Turkish [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imams]] get salaries from the state, whereas Turkish Alevi as well as non-Orthodox and non-Armenian clerics are not paid\n* Imams can be trained freely at the numerous religious schools and theology departments of universities throughout the country; minority religions can not re-open schools for training of their local clerics due to legislation and international treaties dating back to the end of [[Turkish War of Independence]]. The closing of the [[Halki seminary|Theological School of Halki]] is a sore bone of contention between Turkey and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] world;\n* The Turkish state sends out paid imams, working under authority from the Presidency of Religious Affairs ([[Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131]]) to various European or Asian countries with Turkish- or Turkic-speaking populations, with as local heads officials from the Turkish consulates;\n* Turkey has recently engaged in promulgating a series of legal enactments aiming at removal of the procedural hurdles before the use of several local languages spoken by Turkish citizens such as Kurdish (Kurmanji), Arabic and Zaza as medium of public communication, together with several other smaller ethnic group languages. A few private Kurdish teaching centers have recently been allowed to open. Kurdish-language TV broadcasts on 7/24 basis at the public frequency denominated in the government-owned [[TRT 6]], while the private national channels show no interest yet. However, there are already several satellite Kurdish TV stations operating from Kurdish Autonomous Region at Northern Iraq and Western Europe, broadcasting in Kurdish, Turkish and Neo-Aramaic languages, [[Kurdistan TV]], [[Kurdsat TV|KurdSAT]], etc.;\n* Non-Muslim minority numbers are said to be falling rapidly, mainly as a result of aging, migration (to [[state of Israel|Israel]], [[Greece]], the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]]).\n*There is concern over the future of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which suffers from a lack of trained clergy due to the closure of the Halki school. The state does not recognise the Ecumenical status of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nAccording to figures released by the Foreign Ministry in December 2008, there are 89,000 Turkish citizens designated as belonging to a minority, two thirds of Armenian descent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291

Turkey]] is the process by which people [[human migration|migrate]] to [[Turkey]] to reside in the country. Many, but not all, become [[Turkish nationality law|Turkish citizens]]. After the  [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] and following [[Turkish War of Independence]], an [[Emigration|exodus]] by the large portion of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ([[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]) and [[Islam|Muslim]] peoples from the [[Balkans]] ([[Turks in the Balkans|Balkan Turks]], [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Pomaks]]), [[Caucasus]] ([[Abkhaz people|Abkhazians]], [[Ajarians]], '[[Circassians]]', [[Chechen people|Chechens]]), [[Crimea]] ([[Crimean Tatar diaspora]]), and [[Crete]] ([[Cretan Turks]]) took refuge in present-day Turkey and moulded the country's fundamental features. Trends of immigration towards Turkey continue to this day, although the motives are more varied and are usually in line with the patterns of global [[immigration]] movements &mdash; Turkey, for example, receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as [[Armenia]], the [[Moldova]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], and [[Azerbaijan]], but also from [[Central Asia]]. [[Turkey's migrant crisis]] is a period during 2010s characterized by high numbers of people arriving in Turkey.\n\n== Internal migration ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Place of origin (rows) versus place of residence (columns) for Turkish citizens in 2014<ref>TurkStat</ref>\n!

[[Secularism|secular]] (''Laiklik'', Turkish adaptation of French ''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]''), i.e. without a [[state religion]], or separate ethnic divisions/ identities. The concept of \"minorities\" has only been accepted by the Republic of Turkey as defined by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and thence strictly limited to Greeks, Jews and Armenians, only on religious matters, excluding from the scope of the concept the ethnic identities of these minorities as of others such as the Kurds who make up 15% of the country; others include Assyrians/Syriacs of various Christian denominations, Alevis and all the others.\n\nThere are many reports from sources such as ([[Human Rights Watch]], [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], national parliaments in EU member states, [[Amnesty International]] etc.) on persistent yet declining discrimination.\n\nCertain current trends are:\n* Turkish [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imams]] get salaries from the state, whereas Turkish Alevi as well as non-Orthodox and non-Armenian clerics are not paid\n* Imams can be trained freely at the numerous religious schools and theology departments of universities throughout the country; minority religions can not re-open schools for training of their local clerics due to legislation and international treaties dating back to the end of [[Turkish War of Independence]]. The closing of the [[Halki seminary|Theological School of Halki]] is a sore bone of contention between Turkey and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] world;\n* The Turkish state sends out paid imams, working under authority from the Presidency of Religious Affairs ([[Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131]]) to various European or Asian countries with Turkish- or Turkic-speaking populations, with as local heads officials from the Turkish consulates;\n* Turkey has recently engaged in promulgating a series of legal enactments aiming at removal of the procedural hurdles before the use of several local languages spoken by Turkish citizens such as Kurdish (Kurmanji), Arabic and Zaza as medium of public communication, together with several other smaller ethnic group languages. A few private Kurdish teaching centers have recently been allowed to open. Kurdish-language TV broadcasts on 7/24 basis at the public frequency denominated in the government-owned [[TRT 6]], while the private national channels show no interest yet. However, there are already several satellite Kurdish TV stations operating from Kurdish Autonomous Region at Northern Iraq and Western Europe, broadcasting in Kurdish, Turkish and Neo-Aramaic languages, [[Kurdistan TV]], [[Kurdsat TV|KurdSAT]], etc.;\n* Non-Muslim minority numbers are said to be falling rapidly, mainly as a result of aging, migration (to [[state of Israel|Israel]], [[Greece]], the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]]).\n*There is concern over the future of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which suffers from a lack of trained clergy due to the closure of the Halki school. The state does not recognise the Ecumenical status of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nAccording to figures released by the Foreign Ministry in December 2008, there are 89,000 Turkish citizens designated as belonging to a minority, two thirds of Armenian descent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501063653/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2008-12-15 |title=Foreign Ministry: 89,000 minorities live in Turkey |date=2008-12-15 |work=[[Today's Zaman]] }}</ref>\n\n== CIA World Factbook demographic statistics ==\nThe following demographic statistics are from the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]:<ref name=\"ciawfb\"/>\n\n'''Age structure'''\n<br>''0\u201314 years:'' 24.26% (male 10,085,558/female 9,627,967)\n<br>''15\u201324 years:'' 15.88% (male 6,589,039/female 6,311,113)\n<br>''25\u201354 years:'' 43.26% (male 17,798,864/female 17,349,228)\n<br>55\u201364 years: 8.82% (male 3,557,329/female 3,606,120)\n<br>''65 years and over:'' 7.79% (male 2,825,738/female 3,506,283) (2018 est.)\n\n'''Median age'''\n<br />''total population:''\n31.2 years\n<br />''male:''\n30.9 years\n<br />''female:''\n31.9 years (2018 est.)\n\n'''Sex ratio'''\n<br />''at birth:''\n1.05 male(s)/female\n<br />''under 15 years:''\n1.05 male(s)/female\n<br />''15\u201324 years:''\n1.04 male(s)/female\n<br />''25\u201354 years:''\n1.03 male(s)/female\n<br />''55\u201364 years:''\n0.99 male(s)/female\n<br />''65 years and over:''\n0.8 male(s)/female\n<br />''total population:''\n1.01 male(s)/female (2017 est.)\n\n'''Life expectancy at birth'''\n<br />''total population:''\n75.3 years\n<br />''male:''\n72.9 years\n<br />''female:''\n77.7 years (2018 est.)\n\n'''Urbanization'''\n<br />urban population: 75.1% of total population (2018)\n<br />rate of urbanization: 2.04% annual rate of change (2015\u201320 est.)\n\n'''Nationality'''\n<br />''noun:''\nTurk(s)\n<br />''adjective:''\nTurkish\n\n'''Literacy'''\n<br />''definition:''\nage 15 and over can read and write\n<br />total population: 96.2%\n<br />male: 98.8%\n<br />female: 93.6% (2016 est.)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Census in Turkey]]\n* [[Minorities in Turkey]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Demographics of Turkey}}\n* [https://archive.today/20150404121423/http://itbulk.org/population/population-by-country/ Build Turkey population graph: from 1960 till now (World Bank data)]\n* [https://archive.today/20150220095949/http://itbulk.org/population/population-projection-by-country/ Build Turkey population projection graph till 2100 (United Nation data)]\n* [https://archive.today/20150404121433/http://itbulk.org/population/life-expectancy-by-country/ Build Turkey life expectancy at birth graph: from 1950 till now (United Nation data)]\n\n{{Turkey topics}}\n{{Demographics of Turkey}}\n{{Asia topic|Demographics of}}\n{{Europe topic|Demographics of}}\n{{Demographics of Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Demographics of Turkey| ]]\n", "name_user": "Sems\u00fbr\u00ee", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eKurds:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Turkey"}

It is a [[remake]] of Ozu's own [[black-and-white]] [[silent film]] ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a hot [[summer]] in 1958 at a seaside town on the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]]. A travelling theatre troupe arrives by ship, headed by the troupe's lead actor and owner, Komajuro ([[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]]). The rest of the troupe goes around the town to publicise their appearance.\n\nKomajuro visits his former mistress, Oyoshi, who runs a small eatery in the town. They have a grown-up son, Kiyoshi, who works at the [[post office]] as a mail clerk and is saving up to study at the [[university]]. However, he does not know who Komajuro is, having been told he is his uncle. Komajuro invites Kiyoshi to go fishing by the sea.\n\nWhen Sumiko, the lead actress of the troupe and Komajuro's present girlfriend, learns that Komajuro is visiting his former mistress, she becomes jealous and makes a visit to Oyoshi's eatery, where Kiyoshi and Komajuro are playing a game of [[Go (game)|go]]. Komajuro brusquely chases her away before she can say anything too calamitous, then confronts her in the pouring rain. He tells her to back off from his son, and decides to break up with her. Sumiko calls Komajuro an ingrate, and reminds him of the times she has helped him out in the past.\n\nBackstage one day, Sumiko offers Kayo, a pretty young actress from the same troupe, some money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi. Although Kayo is at first reluctant, she gives in after Sumiko's insistence, without being told why. She goes to Kiyoshi's post office to make him fall for her. However, after knowing Kiyoshi for some time, she falls for him and decides to tell Kiyoshi the truth about how their relationship started. Kiyoshi is undaunted and says it does not matter to him, and eventually their relationship is discovered by Komajuro.\n\nKomajuro confronts Kayo, who tells him of Sumiko's setup, but only after asserting she now loves Kiyoshi and is not doing it for money. Komajuro has a violent confrontation with Sumiko and tells her he does not want to see her again. She pleads for reconciliation, but he is indignant.\n\nAmid Komajuro's personal dramas, the troupe's old-fashioned [[kabuki]]-style performances fail to attract the town's residents. The other actors pursue their own romantic diversions at local businesses, including a brothel and a barber shop. As audiences decline, problems pile up: the manager of the troupe abandons them, and a principal supporting player absconds with the remaining funds. Komajuro has no choice but to disband the troupe, and they meet for a melancholy last night together. Komajuro then goes to Oyoshi's place and tells her of his troupe's break-up. Oyoshi persuades him to tell Kiyoshi the truth about his parenthood and then stay together with them at her place as a family. After some discussion, Komajuro agrees.\n\nWhen Kiyoshi later comes back with Kayo, Komajuro becomes so enraged to see them together that he beats both of them repeatedly, leading to a physical tussle between Kiyoshi and him, ending with Kiyoshi pushing him towards a table. To stifle the brawl, Oyoshi reveals to him the truth about Komajuro. Kiyoshi first responds that he had suspected it all along, but then refuses to accept Komajuro as his father, saying he has coped well without one so far, and goes to his room upstairs. Taking in Kiyoshi's reaction, Komajuro decides to leave after all. Kayo wants to join Komajuro to help him achieve success for the family, but a chastened Komajuro asks her to stay to help make Kiyoshi a fine man, as was always Komajuro's hope. Kiyoshi later has a change of heart and goes downstairs to look for Komajuro, but his father has already left, and Oyoshi tells Kiyoshi to let him go.\n\nAt the train station in town, Komajuro tries to light a cigarette but has no matches. Sumiko, who is sitting nearby, comes up and offers him a light. Sumiko asks where Komajuro is going, and asks to accompany him, since she now has no place to go. The two reconcile and Sumiko decides to join Komajuro to start anew under another [[impresario]] at [[Kuwana]].

He was a gambler and petty thief who, having returned to his native village to find his family ruined and his sister driven mad by the wicked local magistrate, wreaked his revenge before taking refuge in the forest, where he and his fellow-outlaws robbed the rich to give to the poor.

It is a [[remake]] of Ozu's own [[black-and-white]] [[silent film]] ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a hot [[summer]] in 1958 at a seaside town on the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]]. A travelling theatre troupe arrives by ship, headed by the troupe's lead actor and owner, Komajuro ([[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]]). The rest of the troupe goes around the town to publicise their appearance.\n\nKomajuro visits his former mistress, Oyoshi, who runs a small eatery in the town. They have a grown-up son, Kiyoshi, who works at the [[post office]] as a mail clerk and is saving up to study at the [[university]]. However, he does not know who Komajuro is, having been told he is his uncle. Komajuro invites Kiyoshi to go fishing by the sea.\n\nWhen Sumiko, the lead actress of the troupe and Komajuro's present girlfriend, learns that Komajuro is visiting his former mistress, she becomes jealous and makes a visit to Oyoshi's eatery, where Kiyoshi and Komajuro are playing a game of [[Go (game)|go]]. Komajuro brusquely chases her away before she can say anything too calamitous, then confronts her in the pouring rain. He tells her to back off from his son, and decides to break up with her. Sumiko calls Komajuro an ingrate, and reminds him of the times she has helped him out in the past.\n\nBackstage one day, Sumiko offers Kayo, a pretty young actress from the same troupe, some money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi. Although Kayo is at first reluctant, she gives in after Sumiko's insistence, without being told why. She goes to Kiyoshi's post office to make him fall for her. However, after knowing Kiyoshi for some time, she falls for him and decides to tell Kiyoshi the truth about how their relationship started. Kiyoshi is undaunted and says it does not matter to him, and eventually their relationship is discovered by Komajuro.\n\nKomajuro confronts Kayo, who tells him of Sumiko's setup, but only after asserting she now loves Kiyoshi and is not doing it for money. Komajuro has a violent confrontation with Sumiko and tells her he does not want to see her again. She pleads for reconciliation, but he is indignant.\n\nAmid Komajuro's personal dramas, the troupe's old-fashioned [[kabuki]]-style performances fail to attract the town's residents. The other actors pursue their own romantic diversions at local businesses, including a brothel and a barber shop. As audiences decline, problems pile up: the manager of the troupe abandons them, and a principal supporting player absconds with the remaining funds. Komajuro has no choice but to disband the troupe, and they meet for a melancholy last night together. Komajuro then goes to Oyoshi's place and tells her of his troupe's break-up. Oyoshi persuades him to tell Kiyoshi the truth about his parenthood and then stay together with them at her place as a family. After some discussion, Komajuro agrees.\n\nWhen Kiyoshi later comes back with Kayo, Komajuro becomes so enraged to see them together that he beats both of them repeatedly, leading to a physical tussle between Kiyoshi and him, ending with Kiyoshi pushing him towards a table. To stifle the brawl, Oyoshi reveals to him the truth about Komajuro. Kiyoshi first responds that he had suspected it all along, but then refuses to accept Komajuro as his father, saying he has coped well without one so far, and goes to his room upstairs. Taking in Kiyoshi's reaction, Komajuro decides to leave after all. Kayo wants to join Komajuro to help him achieve success for the family, but a chastened Komajuro asks her to stay to help make Kiyoshi a fine man, as was always Komajuro's hope. Kiyoshi later has a change of heart and goes downstairs to look for Komajuro, but his father has already left, and Oyoshi tells Kiyoshi to let him go.\n\nAt the train station in town, Komajuro tries to light a cigarette but has no matches. Sumiko, who is sitting nearby, comes up and offers him a light. Sumiko asks where Komajuro is going, and asks to accompany him, since she now has no place to go. The two reconcile and Sumiko decides to join Komajuro to start anew under another [[impresario]] at [[Kuwana]].

What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to?\"<ref name=\"shorts\"/>\n\nAt the 2012 [[New York Comic Con]], [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Kevin Feige]] announced that Gregg would be starring as Coulson in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', despite the character dying in ''The Avengers'', with Whedon saying \"He's headlining the S.H.I.E.L.D. show and always was.\"<ref name=\"NYCC2012\" /> Gregg said of Whedon's explanation for Coulson's resurrection, \"I found it so fascinating and so true to the world of the comics and mythology in general as I understand them that I was immediately in.\"<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> Regarding the amount of creative input he has over the character in the series, Gregg said, \"I have meetings with [the [[showrunner]]s] once or twice a year and talk about what the big ideas are ... They're really responsive to the fact that I've been involved with this person four, five years longer than them, but ... I have no complaints with what they're doing.\"<ref name=\"GreggCBRJan2015\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' costume designer Ann Foley described Coulson as a \"company man\", wearing suits in \"the S.H.I.E.L.D. palette\u2014grey, black and navy with a distinct but subtle pattern.\" Foley did note \"subtle changes\" in Coulson's costuming in the series from the films, such as streamlined suits and \"more slick\" ties, \"now that [he] is back after being 'killed' by Loki\".<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> After Coulson's hand is cut off in the second-season finale, which was realized by having a mechanical axe cut through a \"faux arm made of tripe wrapped around a chicken thigh\", Gregg described it as \"heavy ... one of those things where you\u2019re having the practical difficulty your character does. People were handing me stuff, like files, and I couldn\u2019t really open them without using my nose.\"<ref name=\"CoulsonArm\" /> This practicality issue continued with the prosthetic hand Coulson subsequently has to use, with Gregg saying \"the reality informs the thing. It\u2019s really hard to figure out how to use this prosthetic, and that\u2019s what Phil Coulson\u2019s going through ... I\u2019m hoping it evolves at some point.\"<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> Gregg also noted that in the third season Coulson would be wearing more casual clothes, partly because \"he can\u2019t even seem to tie a tie\" with his new hand.<ref name=\"CoulsonCasual\" /> The prosthetic hand evolves throughout the season, with a later iteration projecting an energy shield, inspired by [[Captain America's shield#Other shields|a similar one]] used in the comics by [[Captain America]].<ref name=\"CoulsonShield\" /> The energy shield was created by Cosa, one of the series' visual effects vendors.<ref name=\"CosaVFX\" />\n\nThere had been considerations for Coulson to return in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'',<ref name=\"CraveOnline\"/> but the character was not slated to appear in any more films.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\"/> Whedon asserts, \"As far as the fiction of the movies, Coulson is dead\",<ref name=\"WhedonFilmsDead\" /> elaborating that \"generally [he feels] like the ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' audience and ''The Avengers'' audiences are not actually the same group, necessarily,\" and so the films would have to explain Coulson's resurrection again for the film-only audience if he were to be reintroduced.<ref name=\"WhedonDeadElaboration\" /> Gregg reprises the role once again in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019), as the film is set in the 1990s.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" /> Gregg is digitally de-aged by 25 years, along with co-star [[Samuel L. Jackson]], the first time Marvel has done this for an entire film.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n\n===Characterization===\nGregg has stated, \"I think of Agent Coulson, after all these years, as a guy with a full life. I think every day he's somewhere doing something for S.H.I.E.L.D., and yet I don't always know what that is... There's always a different twist. In this one he gets to show more of his wisecracking wit, and in this one he's a little bit more of a badass.\"<ref name=\"shorts\"/> Despite Coulson being called \"the most recognizable face in the Marvel Comics movie universe\", he is depicted as an \"[[everyman]]\" in a universe full of superheroes\u2014\"the glue that binds\" the characters together. Gregg explained his portrayal of the character as \"just a guy grumbling about his job ... he's tasked with handling these kind of diva superheroes, you know? 'Oh, really, Asgard? Dude, just get in the car.'\"<ref name=\"WNBC\"/>\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=By being so front and center in ''Marvel\u2019s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in a way that he wasn\u2019t as much in the films ... he\u2019s gotten some power. He\u2019s at the front lines, and what is the cost of that going to be?|source=\u2013Gregg, on how starring in the television series can affect Coulson differently to appearing in the films.<ref name=\"GreggRebuilding\" />}}\nOn whether the resurrected Coulson would be the same as before he died, Gregg said \"I don\u2019t know how you could not change going through what he went through. I think if he hadn\u2019t gone through some kind of change, it wouldn\u2019t be any good. That said, I don\u2019t know if he understands how much he\u2019s changed.\"<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> Later exploring some of those changes, Gregg stated \"In some ways, he kinda finds himself not nearly as cold or ruthless as he would like to be, or as he has been. And at the same time, putting together this team, he feels driven by motives inside of himself that he can't quite always make sense of and that feels very new to him.\"<ref name=\"GreggHitFixJan2014\" />\n\nAfter Coulson was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gregg said \"He kind of got his dream job that I don\u2019t even think he would have ever dreamed he would be given ... he\u2019s got a little bit more of an idealistic, big hearted side of him [than Nick Fury does], some of which is going to be extinguished by the hard decisions he has to make.\" Speaking about the evolving nature of Coulson's relationship with his team, Gregg said \"There\u2019s a way he can afford an intimacy with all of them when they\u2019re part of a small, elite squad on the Bus. It\u2019s different than what\u2019s possible for him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"<ref name=\"GreggRebuilding\" /> Discussing Coulson's character progression through three seasons in relation to him killing Ward on the alien planet, executive producer [[Jeffrey Bell]] said, \"First season Coulson would have beat Ward up and then thrown him over his shoulder and brought him back to Earth and locked him away. Season two Coulson would have defeated him and left him there on the other planet to fend for himself,\" while season three Coulson paused while the portal to Earth was already closing to take the time to kill Ward.<ref name=\"BellTHRDec2015\" />\n\nFor the fourth season, Coulson is demoted back to field agent status. Gregg said that the reasoning for this \"makes sense given that S.H.I.E.L.D. is coming out of the shadows. There are people that will want their person in charge.\" He felt that Coulson would actually prefer this, saying, \"I always felt like Coulson was happiest in the field. Neither I nor Coulson loved playing and listening while his agents went into dangerous situations. And there are more dramatic possibilities when you have a boss that you have to deal with.\"<ref name=\"GreggSep2016\" />\n\n===Alternate forms===\n====Sarge / Pachakutiq====\nSarge (portrayed by Clark Gregg) is a man who occupies a clone body of Coulson which was created by the powers of the Di'Allas and sent hundred years into the past on his and Izel's home planet.\n\n====Phil Coulson (Chronicom L.M.D.)====\nFollowing the deaths of Izel and Sarge, Enoch and the Chronicoms on his side create a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson (portrayed by Clark Gregg) with all of Coulson's memories.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his review for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s first season, Evan Valentine at Collider named Clark Gregg as one of the high points of the series, noting that the actor was \"one positive I consistently point out in each and every episode\". Valentine stated that \"What made us fall in love with the character from the first ''Iron Man'' to his death in ''The Avengers'' is still alive and kicking. Coulson was able to throw out quips like none other, while also turning on a dime, and expressing serious rage in moments ... Gregg raises the S.H.I.E.L.D. banner high\".<ref name=\"ColliderSeasonReview\" /> Reviewing the episode \"[[The Writing on the Wall (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Writing on the Wall]]\", which concluded the majority of Coulson's storyline in the series up to that point, Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush praised how Coulson had become \"unglued\" throughout the series, which had \"pushed the newly-minted director into some dark places\".<ref name=\"Ep2.7ScreenCrush\" /> Eric Goldman, reviewing for [[IGN]], was also positive of the \"unhinged version of Coulson\",<ref name=\"Ep2.7IGN\" /> as well as the more serious leadership role the character took on for the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]], with Goldman finding Coulson's decision in \"[[Making Friends and Influencing People]]\" that [[Blizzard (comics)|Donnie Gill]] \"either went with them or had to be taken out\" to be especially notable.<ref name=\"Ep2.3IGN\" />\n\n==Other appearances==\n\n===Animation===\n[[File:Agent Coulson on Ultimate Spider-Man.jpg|thumb|200px|Principal Phil Coulson on ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'']]\n* Coulson makes a by-name cameo appearance in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode \"Extremis\" as one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents encountering (and getting knocked down by) the just-mutated renegade agent [[Mallen (comics)|Mallen]].<ref name=\"IronManAAExtremis\" />\n* It was announced at the 2011 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] that Gregg would return to voice Phil Coulson in the [[cartoon series]] ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', where he appears as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school [[Head teacher|principal]].

He is one of several agents who accompany [[Pepper Potts]] in an attempt to arrest [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] once his criminal activities are revealed. In ''Iron Man 2'', Coulson is assigned to supervise Stark for a time before being reassigned to investigate a crisis in New Mexico.

Gregg initially balked at this due to the character only being known as \"Agent\" and having few lines, but recognized Marvel's plan for an interconnected universe.<ref name=\"GreggJan2016\" /> Gregg went on to play the character in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"shorts\" />\n\nThroughout the films, Coulson is generally depicted as a supporting character of the protagonists and used to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence, to the point that Gregg has described Coulson as \"''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent\". However, for the [[Marvel One-Shot]] short films ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant (2011)|The Consultant]]'' and ''[[Marvel One-Shots#A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer (2011)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer]]'', Coulson is given \"a chance to stand in his own spotlight for once\". This was a \"natural\" move for co-producer Brad Winderbaum, who wanted to \"paint a picture of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible for some of the events we've seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to?\"<ref name=\"shorts\"/>\n\nAt the 2012 [[New York Comic Con]], [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Kevin Feige]] announced that Gregg would be starring as Coulson in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', despite the character dying in ''The Avengers'', with Whedon saying \"He's headlining the S.H.I.E.L.D. show and always was.\"<ref name=\"NYCC2012\" /> Gregg said of Whedon's explanation for Coulson's resurrection, \"I found it so fascinating and so true to the world of the comics and mythology in general as I understand them that I was immediately in.\"<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> Regarding the amount of creative input he has over the character in the series, Gregg said, \"I have meetings with [the [[showrunner]]s] once or twice a year and talk about what the big ideas are ... They're really responsive to the fact that I've been involved with this person four, five years longer than them, but ... I have no complaints with what they're doing.\"<ref name=\"GreggCBRJan2015\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' costume designer Ann Foley described Coulson as a \"company man\", wearing suits in \"the S.H.I.E.L.D. palette\u2014grey, black and navy with a distinct but subtle pattern.\" Foley did note \"subtle changes\" in Coulson's costuming in the series from the films, such as streamlined suits and \"more slick\" ties, \"now that [he] is back after being 'killed' by Loki\".<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> After Coulson's hand is cut off in the second-season finale, which was realized by having a mechanical axe cut through a \"faux arm made of tripe wrapped around a chicken thigh\", Gregg described it as \"heavy ... one of those things where you\u2019re having the practical difficulty your character does. People were handing me stuff, like files, and I couldn\u2019t really open them without using my nose.\"<ref name=\"CoulsonArm\" /> This practicality issue continued with the prosthetic hand Coulson subsequently has to use, with Gregg saying \"the reality informs the thing. It\u2019s really hard to figure out how to use this prosthetic, and that\u2019s what Phil Coulson\u2019s going through ... I\u2019m hoping it evolves at some point.\"<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> Gregg also noted that in the third season Coulson would be wearing more casual clothes, partly because \"he can\u2019t even seem to tie a tie\" with his new hand.<ref name=\"CoulsonCasual\" /> The prosthetic hand evolves throughout the season, with a later iteration projecting an energy shield, inspired by [[Captain America's shield#Other shields|a similar one]] used in the comics by [[Captain America]].<ref name=\"CoulsonShield\" /> The energy shield was created by Cosa, one of the series' visual effects vendors.<ref name=\"CosaVFX\" />\n\nThere had been considerations for Coulson to return in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'',<ref name=\"CraveOnline\"/> but the character was not slated to appear in any more films.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\"/> Whedon asserts, \"As far as the fiction of the movies, Coulson is dead\",<ref name=\"WhedonFilmsDead\" /> elaborating that \"generally [he feels] like the ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' audience and ''The Avengers'' audiences are not actually the same group, necessarily,\" and so the films would have to explain Coulson's resurrection again for the film-only audience if he were to be reintroduced.<ref name=\"WhedonDeadElaboration\" /> Gregg reprises the role once again in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019), as the film is set in the 1990s.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" /> Gregg is digitally de-aged by 25 years, along with co-star [[Samuel L. Jackson]], the first time Marvel has done this for an entire film.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n\n===Characterization===\nGregg has stated, \"I think of Agent Coulson, after all these years, as a guy with a full life. I think every day he's somewhere doing something for S.H.I.E.L.D., and yet I don't always know what that is... There's always a different twist. In this one he gets to show more of his wisecracking wit, and in this one he's a little bit more of a badass.\"<ref name=\"shorts\"/> Despite Coulson being called \"the most recognizable face in the Marvel Comics movie universe\", he is depicted as an \"[[everyman]]\" in a universe full of superheroes\u2014\"the glue that binds\" the characters together.

I think if he hadn\u2019t gone through some kind of change, it wouldn\u2019t be any good. That said, I don\u2019t know if he understands how much he\u2019s changed.\"<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> Later exploring some of those changes, Gregg stated \"In some ways, he kinda finds himself not nearly as cold or ruthless as he would like to be, or as he has been. And at the same time, putting together this team, he feels driven by motives inside of himself that he can't quite always make sense of and that feels very new to him.\"<ref name=\"GreggHitFixJan2014\" />\n\nAfter Coulson was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gregg said \"He kind of got his dream job that I don\u2019t even think he would have ever dreamed he would be given ... he\u2019s got a little bit more of an idealistic, big hearted side of him [than Nick Fury does], some of which is going to be extinguished by the hard decisions he has to make.\" Speaking about the evolving nature of Coulson's relationship with his team, Gregg said \"There\u2019s a way he can afford an intimacy with all of them when they\u2019re part of a small, elite squad on the Bus. It\u2019s different than what\u2019s possible for him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"<ref name=\"GreggRebuilding\" /> Discussing Coulson's character progression through three seasons in relation to him killing Ward on the alien planet, executive producer [[Jeffrey Bell]] said, \"First season Coulson would have beat Ward up and then thrown him over his shoulder and brought him back to Earth and locked him away. Season two Coulson would have defeated him and left him there on the other planet to fend for himself,\" while season three Coulson paused while the portal to Earth was already closing to take the time to kill Ward.<ref name=\"BellTHRDec2015\" />\n\nFor the fourth season, Coulson is demoted back to field agent status. Gregg said that the reasoning for this \"makes sense given that S.H.I.E.L.D. is coming out of the shadows. There are people that will want their person in charge.\" He felt that Coulson would actually prefer this, saying, \"I always felt like Coulson was happiest in the field. Neither I nor Coulson loved playing and listening while his agents went into dangerous situations. And there are more dramatic possibilities when you have a boss that you have to deal with.\"<ref name=\"GreggSep2016\" />\n\n===Alternate forms===\n====Sarge / Pachakutiq====\nSarge (portrayed by Clark Gregg) is a man who occupies a clone body of Coulson which was created by the powers of the Di'Allas and sent hundred years into the past on his and Izel's home planet.\n\n====Phil Coulson (Chronicom L.M.D.)====\nFollowing the deaths of Izel and Sarge, Enoch and the Chronicoms on his side create a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson (portrayed by Clark Gregg) with all of Coulson's memories.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his review for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s first season, Evan Valentine at Collider named Clark Gregg as one of the high points of the series, noting that the actor was \"one positive I consistently point out in each and every episode\".

Founded in 1908 as the '''Fredericksburg Teachers College''', the institution was named '''Mary Washington College''' in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States, [[George Washington]]. The General Assembly of Virginia changed the college's name to the University of Mary Washington in 2004 to reflect the addition of graduate and professional programs to the central undergraduate curriculum, as well as the establishment of more than one campus.\n\nEach year, students pursue more than 60 majors and programs of graduate and undergraduate study through the university's three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education. One third of UMW's undergraduate students study abroad before graduation, taking advantage of 121 study abroad programs in 56 countries. UMW Athletics' 23 teams compete in the NCAA Division III Capital Athletic Conference. Known as the UMW Eagles, 308 of these student-athletes have been named to All-American teams.\n\n==History==\nOn March 14, 1908, Virginia Governor [[Claude A. Swanson]] signed into law legislation for the establishment of the new State [[Normal school|Normal]] and Industrial School for Women. It was called Fredericksburg Teachers College. The institution was renamed Mary Washington College in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States of America, [[George Washington]], and longtime resident of Fredericksburg.<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Alvey\n| first      = Edward\n| title      = History of Mary Washington College 1908\u20131972\n| publisher  = University of Virginia Press\n| year       = 1974\n| pages      = 227\n| isbn       = 978-0-8139-0528-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title      = H.

Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates, except in its education and nursing programs, although its postgraduate programs were coeducational. Following UVA's transition to coeducational status in 1970, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] reorganized Mary Washington College in 1972 as a separate, coeducational institution.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Alvey\n| first     = Edward\n| title     = History of Mary Washington College 1908\u20131972\n| publisher = University of Virginia Press\n| year      = 1974\n| pages     = 278, 511\n| isbn      = 978-0-8139-0528-0}}</ref>\n\nThe General Assembly of Virginia enacted legislation changing the college's name to University of Mary Washington on March 19, 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp524.exe?041+ful+CHAP0176|title=Bill Tracking - 2004 session > Legislation|website=leg1.state.va.us}}</ref> to reflect the addition of master's degree programs and the establishment of more than one campus.\n\nThe university's first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building, CGPS North Building, was built in 2007. The university houses stops along the route of the Fredericksburg Regional Transit System (FRED). The school signed an Energy Performance Contact with the [[energy service company]] NORESCO from 2005\u20132007, enabling the campus to install water saving devices which reduced campus water consumption by 50%. NORESCO also installed low energy light fixtures, occupant sensors, HVAC controls, and completed replacement of leaking condensate piping.<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = Water Conservation Measures\n| publisher  = University of Mary Washington\n| url        = http://sustainability.umw.edu/initiatives/water-conservation/\n| accessdate = October 27, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:UMW Trinkle Hall.JPG|thumb|Once the library, Trinkle Hall features a rotunda.

While topics vary, classes are all capped at 15 students, focus on the development of writing and speaking skills and use active, discussion-based formats. Previous first-year seminars have included \"Beyond the Selfie: Exploring Digital Identities,\" \"Cold Case: Theatre Mysteries,\" \"The Art of Mathematics,\" \"Race & Revolution,\" and \"Science and Technology \u2013 Because We Can, Should We?\"\n\nMany UMW students study abroad before graduation.

The UMW Board of Visitors is composed of twelve members appointed by the [[Governor of Virginia]] and confirmed by the General Assembly.

During '''Family Weekend''', typically held in the fall semester, families visit the campus to get a taste of student life through events, performances and tours. Spirit Week is a series of student events that lead up to Homecoming and the return of UMW alumni to the university for athletic contests and tailgating. '''Senior Countdown''' is an event that celebrates 100 days until graduation for the undergraduate class. '''Spring Formal''' gives students an element of surprise \u2013 students learn the location of the formal (unique each year) only once they're on the buses heading over.

Founded in 1908 as the '''Fredericksburg Teachers College''', the institution was named '''Mary Washington College''' in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States, [[George Washington]]. The General Assembly of Virginia changed the college's name to the University of Mary Washington in 2004 to reflect the addition of graduate and professional programs to the central undergraduate curriculum, as well as the establishment of more than one campus.\n\nEach year, students pursue more than 60 majors and programs of graduate and undergraduate study through the university's three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education. One third of UMW's undergraduate students study abroad before graduation, taking advantage of 121 study abroad programs in 56 countries. UMW Athletics' 23 teams compete in the NCAA Division III Capital Athletic Conference. Known as the UMW Eagles, 308 of these student-athletes have been named to All-American teams.\n\n==History==\nOn March 14, 1908, Virginia Governor [[Claude A. Swanson]] signed into law legislation for the establishment of the new State [[Normal school|Normal]] and Industrial School for Women. It was called Fredericksburg Teachers College. The institution was renamed Mary Washington College in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States of America, [[George Washington]], and longtime resident of Fredericksburg.<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Alvey\n| first      = Edward\n| title      = History of Mary Washington College 1908\u20131972\n| publisher  = University of Virginia Press\n| year       = 1974\n| pages      = 227\n| isbn       = 978-0-8139-0528-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title      = H.

Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates, except in its education and nursing programs, although its postgraduate programs were coeducational. Following UVA's transition to coeducational status in 1970, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] reorganized Mary Washington College in 1972 as a separate, coeducational institution.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Alvey\n| first     = Edward\n| title     = History of Mary Washington College 1908\u20131972\n| publisher = University of Virginia Press\n| year      = 1974\n| pages     = 278, 511\n| isbn      = 978-0-8139-0528-0}}</ref>\n\nThe General Assembly of Virginia enacted legislation changing the college's name to University of Mary Washington on March 19, 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp524.exe?041+ful+CHAP0176|title=Bill Tracking - 2004 session > Legislation|website=leg1.state.va.us}}</ref> to reflect the addition of master's degree programs and the establishment of more than one campus.\n\nThe university's first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building, CGPS North Building, was built in 2007. The university houses stops along the route of the Fredericksburg Regional Transit System (FRED). The school signed an Energy Performance Contact with the [[energy service company]] NORESCO from 2005\u20132007, enabling the campus to install water saving devices which reduced campus water consumption by 50%. NORESCO also installed low energy light fixtures, occupant sensors, HVAC controls, and completed replacement of leaking condensate piping.<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = Water Conservation Measures\n| publisher  = University of Mary Washington\n| url        = http://sustainability.umw.edu/initiatives/water-conservation/\n| accessdate = October 27, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:UMW Trinkle Hall.JPG|thumb|Once the library, Trinkle Hall features a rotunda.

The campus is within walking distance to the historic downtown with shops, restaurants and the Rappahannock River.<ref name=\"umw.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/files/2017/08/Undergrad-Catalog-2017-18_WEB-copy.pdf |title=Undergrad Catalog|website=publications.umw.edu}}</ref> Other campuses are Stafford Campus, seven miles north of Fredericksburg, and Dahlgren Campus, near the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division]].\n\nUMW has five pre-professional programs: pre-dental, pre-law, pre-med, pre-pharmacy, and pre-veterinary. Bachelor's degrees include a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in addition to two degree completion programs \u2013 a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and a Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS).<ref name=\"umw.edu\"/> Master's degrees include a Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Education for Professional Development or Added Endorsement (M.Ed.), Master of Science in Elementary Education (M.S.) and a Master of Geospatial Analysis (MSGA).

While topics vary, classes are all capped at 15 students, focus on the development of writing and speaking skills and use active, discussion-based formats. Previous first-year seminars have included \"Beyond the Selfie: Exploring Digital Identities,\" \"Cold Case: Theatre Mysteries,\" \"The Art of Mathematics,\" \"Race & Revolution,\" and \"Science and Technology \u2013 Because We Can, Should We?\"\n\nMany UMW students study abroad before graduation. The university offers 121 approved programs in 56 countries, five exchange programs, and more than 15 programs led by UMW faculty during spring breaks and summer sessions.\n\n==Administration==\nBy statute of the [[Code of Virginia]], the University of Mary Washington is governed by a [[Board of Visitors]], one member of which is elected every two years to serve as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]. The UMW Board of Visitors is composed of twelve members appointed by the [[Governor of Virginia]] and confirmed by the General Assembly. At least six members of the Board must be alumni of the university, and no more than three may be nonresidents of Virginia.

'''Eagle Gathering''' is a candlelit celebration on Ball Circle that marks the start of the year and officially welcomes the newest class to UMW. During '''Family Weekend''', typically held in the fall semester, families visit the campus to get a taste of student life through events, performances and tours. Spirit Week is a series of student events that lead up to Homecoming and the return of UMW alumni to the university for athletic contests and tailgating. '''Senior Countdown''' is an event that celebrates 100 days until graduation for the undergraduate class. '''Spring Formal''' gives students an element of surprise \u2013 students learn the location of the formal (unique each year) only once they're on the buses heading over.

He served most famously as the commander of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[World War I]], 1917\u201318.\n\nPershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies, and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command, although some American divisions fought under British command, and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the [[French army]].\n\nPershing's soldiers first saw serious battle at [[Cantigny, Somme|Cantigny]], [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry (1918)|Chateau-Thierry]], [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]], and [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]]. To speed up the arrival of American troops, they embarked for France leaving heavy equipment behind, and used British and French tanks, artillery, airplanes and other munitions. In September 1918 at [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel]], the [[First United States Army|First Army]] was directly under Pershing's command; it overwhelmed the [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] \u2013 the encroachment into [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] territory \u2013 that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] had held for three years. For the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne, keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days, alongside the French. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Hundred Days Offensive]], which the Argonne fighting was part of, contributed to Germany calling for an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]].

At the time, Army officer promotions were based primarily on seniority rather than merit,<ref name=boot /> and although there was widespread acknowledgment that Pershing should serve as a colonel, the Army General Staff declined to change their seniority-based promotion tradition just to accommodate Pershing. They would not consider a promotion to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] or even [[Major (United States)|major]]. This angered Roosevelt, but since the President could only name and promote army officers in the General ranks, his options for recognizing Pershing through promotion were limited.\n\n[[File:Leon Hornecker-general-Pershing.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Portrait of Captain Pershing by [[L\u00e9on Hornecker]] (1903)]]\n\nIn 1904, Pershing was assigned as the Assistant Chief of Staff of the Southwest Army Division stationed at [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

Pershing was the most likely candidate other than Funston, and following America's entrance into the war in May, Wilson briefly interviewed Pershing, and then selected him for the command.  He was officially installed in the position on May 10, 1917, and held the post until 1918. On October&nbsp;6, 1917, Pershing, then a [[Major general (United States)|major general]], was promoted to full general in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]].  He bypassed the three star rank of lieutenant general, and was the first full general since [[Philip Sheridan]] in 1888.  As AEF commander, Pershing was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of a combined professional and draft Army and National Guard force that eventually grew from 27,000 inexperienced men to two Armies, with a third forming as the war ended, totaling over two million soldiers.\n\nPershing exercised significant control over his command, with a full delegation of authority from Wilson and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]]. Baker, cognizant of the endless problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision making in wartime, gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit. In turn, Pershing exercised his prerogative carefully, not engaging in politics or disputes over government policy that might distract him from his military mission. While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, he did not advocate their full participation on the battlefield, understanding the general racial attitudes of white Americans. \n\n[[George Marshall]] served as one of Pershing's top assistants during and after the war. Pershing's initial chief of staff was [[James Harbord]], who later took a combat command but worked as Pershing's closest assistant for many years and remained extremely loyal to him.\n\n[[File:Pershing at Lafayette Tomb.jpg|left|thumb|282px|Pershing saluting the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]'s grave in [[Paris]]]]\n\nAfter departing from [[Fort Jay]] at [[Governors Island]] in New York Harbor under top secrecy in May 1917 aboard the [[RMS Baltic (1903)|RMS ''Baltic,'']] Pershing arrived in France in June 1917. In a show of American presence, part of the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)#World War I|16th Infantry Regiment]] marched through Paris shortly after his arrival. Pausing at the tomb of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]], he was reputed to have uttered the famous line \"Lafayette, we are here,\" a line spoken, in fact, by his aide, Colonel [[Charles E.

In late June, General [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]], commanding the British Fourth Army, suggested to Australian Lieutenant General [[John Monash]] that American involvement in a set-piece attack alongside the experienced Australians in the upcoming [[Battle of Hamel]] would both give the American troops experience and also strengthen the Australian battalions by an additional company each. On June 29, General Bell, commanding the American 33rd Division, selected two companies each from the 131st and 132nd Infantry regiments of the 66th brigade. Monash had been promised ten companies of American troops and on June 30 the remaining companies of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 131st regiment were sent. Each American platoon was attached to an Australian company, but there was difficulty in integrating the American platoons (which numbered 60 men) among the Australian companies of 100 men. This difficulty was overcome by reducing the size of each American platoon by one-fifth and sending the troops thus removed, which numbered 50 officers and men, back to battalion reinforcement camps.\n\nThe day before the attack was scheduled to commence, Pershing learned of the plan and ordered the withdrawal of six American companies.<ref name=\"Nunan, Peter 2000\">Nunan, Peter (2000). \"Diggers' Fourth of July\".

This meant that battalions had to rearrange their attack formations and caused a serious reduction in the size of the Allied force.

Pershing insisted that the AEF fight as units under American command rather than being split up by battalions to augment British and French regiments and brigades (although the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]] and [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Divisions]], grouped under [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] command, were loaned during the [[Spring Offensive|desperate days of spring 1918]], fought with the British/Australian/Canadian [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] until the end of the war, taking part in the breach of the [[Hindenburg Line]] in October).\n\nBy May 1918, Pershing had become discontented with [[Air Service, United States Army|Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force]], believing staff planning had been inefficient with considerable internal dissension, as well as conflict between its members and those of Pershing's General Staff. Further, aircraft and unit totals lagged far behind those expected. Pershing appointed his former [[West Point]] classmate and non-aviator, [[Major General]] [[Mason Patrick]] as the new [[United States Army Air Service#Chiefs, AEF Aviation|Chief of Air Service]]. Considerable house-cleaning of the existing staff resulted from Patrick's appointment, bringing in experienced staff officers to administrate, and tightening up lines of communication.<ref>Tate, Dr. James P.

Along with the British Fourth Army's victory at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], the Allied victory at the Second Battle of the Marne marked the turning point of World War I on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nIn August 1918 the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] had been formed, first under Pershing's direct command and then by Lieutenant General [[Hunter Liggett]], when the [[Second United States Army|U.S. Second Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Robert Lee Bullard|Robert Bullard]] was created. After a quick victory at [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|Saint-Mihiel]], east of [[Verdun]], some of the more bullish AEF commanders had hoped to push on eastwards to [[Metz]], but this did not fit in with the plans of the Allied Supreme Commander, [[Ferdinand Foch|Marshal Foch]], for three simultaneous offensives into the \"bulge\" of the Western Front (the other two being the Fourth Army's breach of the Hindenburg Line and an Anglo-Belgian offensive, led by [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Plumer's]] Second Army, in Flanders). Instead, the AEF was required to redeploy and, aided by French tanks, launched a major offensive northwards in very difficult terrain at [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Meuse-Argonne]]. Initially enjoying numerical odds of eight to one, this offensive eventually engaged 35 or 40 of the 190 or so German divisions on the Western Front, although to put this in perspective, around half the German divisions were engaged on the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) sector at the time.\n\n[[File:Stars and Stripes first issue.tif|thumb|left|Pershing on the front page of the first issue of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', February 8, 1918.]]\n\nThe offensive was marked by a Pershing failure, specifically his reliance on massed infantry attacks with little artillery support led to high casualty rates in the capturing of three key points. This was despite the AEF facing only second-line German troops after the decision by [[Erich Ludendorff]], the [[German General Staff|German Chief of Staff]], to withdraw to the Hindenburg Line on October 3\u2013and in notable contrast to the simultaneous British breakthrough of the Hindenburg Line in the north. Pershing was subsequently forced to reorganize the AEF with the creation of the Second Army, and to step down as the commander of the First Army.<ref>Trask, David F. ''The AEF and Coalition Warmaking, 1917\u20131918''. [[University Press of Kansas]], 1993, p. 141.</ref>\n\nWhen he arrived in Europe, Pershing had openly scorned the slow trench warfare of the previous three years on the Western Front, believing that American soldiers' skill with the rifle would enable them to avoid costly and senseless fighting over a small area of [[no-man's land]]. This was regarded as unrealistic by British and French commanders, and (privately) by a number of Americans such as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] General [[Tasker H. Bliss|Tasker Bliss]] and even Liggett. Even German generals were negative, with Ludendorff dismissing Pershing's strategic efforts in the Meuse-Argonne offensive by recalling how \"the attacks of the youthful American troops broke down with the heaviest losses\".<ref>Trask, David F. ''The AEF and Coalition Warmaking, 1917\u20131918''. University Press of Kansas, 1993, p. 142.</ref> The AEF had performed well in the relatively open warfare of the Second Battle of the Marne, but the eventual American casualties against German defensive positions in the Argonne (roughly 120,000 American casualties in six weeks, against 35 or 40 German divisions) were not noticeably better than those of the Franco-British [[Battle of the Somme|offensive on the Somme]] two years earlier (600,000 casualties in four and a half months, versus 50 or so German divisions). More ground was gained, but by this stage of the war the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] was in worse shape than in previous years.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Pershing - Address from France.ogg\n|title=\"Address from France\"\n|description=A speech given from Allied Headquarters, Chaumont, France, 1918\n}}\n\nSome writers<ref>e.g., David F. Trask (1993)</ref> have speculated that Pershing's frustration at the slow progress through the Argonne was the cause of two incidents which then ensued. First, he ordered the U.S. First Army to take \"the honor\" of recapturing [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], site of the [[Battle of Sedan|French defeat in 1870]]; the ensuing confusion (an order was issued that \"boundaries were not to be considered binding\") exposed American troops to danger not only from the French on their left, but even from one another, as the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] tacked westward by night across the path of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Division]] (accounts differ as to whether [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], then commanding the 84th Brigade of the 42nd Division, was really mistaken for a German officer and arrested). Liggett, who had been away from headquarters the previous day, had to sort out the mess and implement the instructions from the Allied Supreme Command, Marshal Foch, allowing the French to recapture the city; he later recorded that this was the only time during the war in which he lost his temper.\n\nSecond, Pershing sent an unsolicited letter to the Allied [[Supreme War Council]], demanding that the Germans not be given an armistice and that instead, the Allies should push on and obtain an unconditional surrender.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pershing and the Armistice|author=Lowry, Bullitt|journal=[[The Journal of American History]]|volume=55|pages=281\u2013291|number=2|date=September 1968|jstor=1899558|doi=10.2307/1899558}}</ref> Although in later years, many, including President [[Franklin D.

MacArthur saw Pershing as a desk soldier, and the relationship between the two men deteriorated by the end of the war. Similar criticism of senior commanders by the younger generation of officers (the future generals of [[World War II]]) was made in the British and other armies, but in fairness to Pershing, although it was not uncommon for brigade commanders to serve near the front and even be killed, the state of communications in World War I made it more practical for senior generals to command from the rear. He controversially ordered his troops to continue fighting before the signed Armistice took effect. This resulted in 3,500 American casualties on the last day of the war, an act which was regarded as murder by a few officers under his command. Pershing doubted the German\u2019s good faith, and most of his contemporaries took the view he expressed to the House Committee on Military Affairs in his testimony on November 5, 1919:\n\n\u201cWhen the subject of the armistice was under discussion we did not know what the purpose of it was definitely, whether it was something proposed by the German High Command to gain time or whether they were sincere in their desire to have an armistice; and the mere discussion of an armistice would not be sufficient grounds for any judicious commander to relax his military activities\u2026.No one could possibly know when the armistice was to be signed, or what hour be fixed for the cessation of hostilities so that the only thing for us to do, and which I did as commander in chief of the American forces, and which Marshal Foch did as commander in chief of the Allied armies was to continue the military activities\u2026.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm|title=World War I: Wasted Lives on Armistice Day|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515085844/http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm|archivedate=May 15, 2011|df=mdy-all|date=2006-06-12}}</ref>\n\nThe year of 1918 also saw a personal health struggle for Pershing as he was sickened during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], but unlike many who were not so fortunate, Pershing survived.<ref>Collier, Richard.

He created the [[Pershing Map]], a proposed national network of military and civilian highways. The [[Interstate Highway System]] instituted in 1956 bears considerable resemblance to the Pershing map. On his 64th birthday, September 13, 1924, Pershing retired from active military service.  (Army regulations from the late 1860s to the early 1940s required officers to retire on their 64th birthday.)\n\nOn November 1, 1921, Pershing was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] to take part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Liberty Memorial that was being constructed there, (now known as the [[National World War I Museum and Memorial]]). Also present that day were Lieutenant General [[Jules Marie Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude|Baron Jacques]] of Belgium, Admiral of the Fleet [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]] of Great Britain, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] of France, and General [[Armando Diaz]] of Italy. One of the main speakers was Vice President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. In 1935, bas-reliefs of Pershing, Jacques, Foch and Diaz by sculptor [[Walker Hancock]] were added to the memorial.  Pershing also laid the cornerstone of the [[Indiana War Memorial#The War Memorial|World War Memorial]] in Indianapolis on July 4, 1927.<ref>{{cite book|last=Price|first=Nelson|title=Indianapolis Then & Now|publisher=Thunder Bay Press|location=San Diego, California|year=2004|pages=102\u201303|isbn=978-1-59223-208-6}}</ref>\n\nOn October 2, 1922, amid several hundred officers, many of them combat veterans of World War I, Pershing formally established the [[Reserve Officers Association]] (ROA) as an organization at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. ROA is a 75,000-member, professional association of officers, former officers, and spouses of all the uniformed services of the United States, primarily the Reserve and United States National Guard. It is a congressionally chartered Association that advises the Congress and the President on issues of national security on behalf of all members of the Reserve Component.\n\nIn 1924 Pershing became a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].  He was also an honorary member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and a Veteran Companion of the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]].\n\n[[File:John Pershing Newsreel 1940.ogv|thumb|left|1940 newsreel]]\n\nPershing served on a committee of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] to establish and recognize [[Constitution Day (United States)|Constitution Day]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Williams, Winston C. |title=Centennial History of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution 1889\u20131989 |publisher=Turner Publishing Company |location=Paducah, Kentucky |page=9 |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SHHzcZnVwEC |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231132048/http://books.google.com/books?id=0SHHzcZnVwEC |archivedate=December 31, 2013 |df=mdy-all |isbn=9781563110283 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1930s, Pershing largely retreated to private life, but returned to the public eye with publication of his memoirs, ''[[My Experiences in the World War]]'', which were awarded the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for history. He was also an active [[Civitan International|Civitan]] during this time.<ref>{{cite book |last= Leonhart |first= James Chancellor |title= The Fabulous Octogenarian |year= 1962 |publisher= Redwood House, Inc. |location= Baltimore Maryland |page= 277 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, before and after the [[Fall of France]], Pershing was an outspoken advocate of aid for the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]]. In August 1940, he publicly supported the \"[[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]\", whereby the United States sold fifty warships from World War I to the UK in exchange for lengthy leases of land on British possessions for the establishment for military bases.\n\nIn 1944, with Congress' creation of the five star rank of General of the Army, Pershing was still considered to be the highest-ranking officer of the United States military as his rank was General of the Armies. \"In [1799] Congress created for [[George Washington]] the rank of General of the Armies ... General [[Ulysses S. Grant|[Ulysses S.] Grant]] received the title of General of the Army in 1866 . ... Carefully Congress wrote a bill (HR 7594) to revive the rank of General of the Armies for General Pershing alone to hold during his lifetime.  The rank would cease to exist upon Pershing's death.\" Later, when asked if this made Pershing a five-star general, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] commented that it did not, since Pershing never wore more than four stars, but that Pershing was still to be considered senior to the present five-star generals of World War II.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cray |first=Ed |date=1990 |title=General of the Army: George C.

He served most famously as the commander of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[World War I]], 1917\u201318.\n\nPershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies, and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command, although some American divisions fought under British command, and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the [[French army]].\n\nPershing's soldiers first saw serious battle at [[Cantigny, Somme|Cantigny]], [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry (1918)|Chateau-Thierry]], [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]], and [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]]. To speed up the arrival of American troops, they embarked for France leaving heavy equipment behind, and used British and French tanks, artillery, airplanes and other munitions. In September 1918 at [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel]], the [[First United States Army|First Army]] was directly under Pershing's command; it overwhelmed the [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] \u2013 the encroachment into [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] territory \u2013 that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] had held for three years. For the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne, keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days, alongside the French. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Hundred Days Offensive]], which the Argonne fighting was part of, contributed to Germany calling for an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]]. Pershing was of the opinion that the war should continue and that all of [[Germany]] should be occupied in an effort to permanently destroy German militarism.\n\nPershing is the only American to be promoted in his own lifetime to [[General of the Armies]] rank, the highest possible rank in the United States Army.<ref group=Notes>An act was passed in 1976 retroactively promoting [[George Washington]] to the same rank but with higher seniority, ensuring that he would always be considered the senior ranking officer in the United States Army.</ref> Allowed to select his own insignia, Pershing chose to use [[General of the Armies#John Pershing|four gold stars]] to distinguish himself from those officers who held the rank of [[General (United States)|General]], which was signified with four silver stars.<ref>{{cite news |date=April 18, 1925 |title=Lest We Forget: Over There; The Reduction of the Marne Salient |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/83256506/ |newspaper=The Evening Star |location=Franklin, IN |page=7 |url-access=subscription  |quote= ... and the boys stood in formation from noon till evening before the arrival of the automobile bearing the impressive insignia of four gold stars. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116131222/https://www.newspapers.com/image/83256506/ |archivedate=January 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  After the creation of the five-star [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] rank during [[World War II]], his rank of General of the Armies could unofficially be considered that of a [[six-star general]], but he died before the proposed insignia could be considered and acted upon by [[United States Congress|Congress]].\n\nSome of his tactics have been criticized both by other commanders at the time and by modern historians. His reliance on costly [[frontal assault]]s, long after other Allied armies had abandoned such tactics, has been blamed for causing unnecessarily high American casualties.<ref>Sheffield, G. (2001).

Despite this and other hindrances, such as the lack of aid from the former Mexican government, and their refusal to allow American troops to transport troops and supplies over their railroads, Pershing organized and commanded the [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Mexican Punitive Expedition]], a combined armed force of 10,000 men that penetrated {{convert|350|mi}} into Mexico.

[[Frederick Funston]], Pershing's superior in Mexico, was being considered for the top billet as the Commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) when he died suddenly from a heart attack on February 19, 1917. Pershing was the most likely candidate other than Funston, and following America's entrance into the war in May, Wilson briefly interviewed Pershing, and then selected him for the command.  He was officially installed in the position on May 10, 1917, and held the post until 1918. On October&nbsp;6, 1917, Pershing, then a [[Major general (United States)|major general]], was promoted to full general in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]].  He bypassed the three star rank of lieutenant general, and was the first full general since [[Philip Sheridan]] in 1888.  As AEF commander, Pershing was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of a combined professional and draft Army and National Guard force that eventually grew from 27,000 inexperienced men to two Armies, with a third forming as the war ended, totaling over two million soldiers.\n\nPershing exercised significant control over his command, with a full delegation of authority from Wilson and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]]. Baker, cognizant of the endless problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision making in wartime, gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit. In turn, Pershing exercised his prerogative carefully, not engaging in politics or disputes over government policy that might distract him from his military mission. While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, he did not advocate their full participation on the battlefield, understanding the general racial attitudes of white Americans. \n\n[[George Marshall]] served as one of Pershing's top assistants during and after the war. Pershing's initial chief of staff was [[James Harbord]], who later took a combat command but worked as Pershing's closest assistant for many years and remained extremely loyal to him.\n\n[[File:Pershing at Lafayette Tomb.jpg|left|thumb|282px|Pershing saluting the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]'s grave in [[Paris]]]]\n\nAfter departing from [[Fort Jay]] at [[Governors Island]] in New York Harbor under top secrecy in May 1917 aboard the [[RMS Baltic (1903)|RMS ''Baltic,'']] Pershing arrived in France in June 1917. In a show of American presence, part of the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)#World War I|16th Infantry Regiment]] marched through Paris shortly after his arrival. Pausing at the tomb of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]], he was reputed to have uttered the famous line \"Lafayette, we are here,\" a line spoken, in fact, by his aide, Colonel [[Charles E.

In late June, General [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]], commanding the British Fourth Army, suggested to Australian Lieutenant General [[John Monash]] that American involvement in a set-piece attack alongside the experienced Australians in the upcoming [[Battle of Hamel]] would both give the American troops experience and also strengthen the Australian battalions by an additional company each. On June 29, General Bell, commanding the American 33rd Division, selected two companies each from the 131st and 132nd Infantry regiments of the 66th brigade. Monash had been promised ten companies of American troops and on June 30 the remaining companies of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 131st regiment were sent. Each American platoon was attached to an Australian company, but there was difficulty in integrating the American platoons (which numbered 60 men) among the Australian companies of 100 men. This difficulty was overcome by reducing the size of each American platoon by one-fifth and sending the troops thus removed, which numbered 50 officers and men, back to battalion reinforcement camps.\n\nThe day before the attack was scheduled to commence, Pershing learned of the plan and ordered the withdrawal of six American companies.<ref name=\"Nunan, Peter 2000\">Nunan, Peter (2000). \"Diggers' Fourth of July\".

This meant that battalions had to rearrange their attack formations and caused a serious reduction in the size of the Allied force.

Pershing insisted that the AEF fight as units under American command rather than being split up by battalions to augment British and French regiments and brigades (although the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]] and [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Divisions]], grouped under [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] command, were loaned during the [[Spring Offensive|desperate days of spring 1918]], fought with the British/Australian/Canadian [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] until the end of the war, taking part in the breach of the [[Hindenburg Line]] in October).\n\nBy May 1918, Pershing had become discontented with [[Air Service, United States Army|Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force]], believing staff planning had been inefficient with considerable internal dissension, as well as conflict between its members and those of Pershing's General Staff. Further, aircraft and unit totals lagged far behind those expected. Pershing appointed his former [[West Point]] classmate and non-aviator, [[Major General]] [[Mason Patrick]] as the new [[United States Army Air Service#Chiefs, AEF Aviation|Chief of Air Service]]. Considerable house-cleaning of the existing staff resulted from Patrick's appointment, bringing in experienced staff officers to administrate, and tightening up lines of communication.<ref>Tate, Dr. James P.

Along with the British Fourth Army's victory at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], the Allied victory at the Second Battle of the Marne marked the turning point of World War I on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nIn August 1918 the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] had been formed, first under Pershing's direct command and then by Lieutenant General [[Hunter Liggett]], when the [[Second United States Army|U.S. Second Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Robert Lee Bullard|Robert Bullard]] was created. After a quick victory at [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|Saint-Mihiel]], east of [[Verdun]], some of the more bullish AEF commanders had hoped to push on eastwards to [[Metz]], but this did not fit in with the plans of the Allied Supreme Commander, [[Ferdinand Foch|Marshal Foch]], for three simultaneous offensives into the \"bulge\" of the Western Front (the other two being the Fourth Army's breach of the Hindenburg Line and an Anglo-Belgian offensive, led by [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Plumer's]] Second Army, in Flanders). Instead, the AEF was required to redeploy and, aided by French tanks, launched a major offensive northwards in very difficult terrain at [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Meuse-Argonne]]. Initially enjoying numerical odds of eight to one, this offensive eventually engaged 35 or 40 of the 190 or so German divisions on the Western Front, although to put this in perspective, around half the German divisions were engaged on the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) sector at the time.\n\n[[File:Stars and Stripes first issue.tif|thumb|left|Pershing on the front page of the first issue of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', February 8, 1918.]]\n\nThe offensive was marked by a Pershing failure, specifically his reliance on massed infantry attacks with little artillery support led to high casualty rates in the capturing of three key points. This was despite the AEF facing only second-line German troops after the decision by [[Erich Ludendorff]], the [[German General Staff|German Chief of Staff]], to withdraw to the Hindenburg Line on October 3\u2013and in notable contrast to the simultaneous British breakthrough of the Hindenburg Line in the north. Pershing was subsequently forced to reorganize the AEF with the creation of the Second Army, and to step down as the commander of the First Army.<ref>Trask, David F. ''The AEF and Coalition Warmaking, 1917\u20131918''. [[University Press of Kansas]], 1993, p. 141.</ref>\n\nWhen he arrived in Europe, Pershing had openly scorned the slow trench warfare of the previous three years on the Western Front, believing that American soldiers' skill with the rifle would enable them to avoid costly and senseless fighting over a small area of [[no-man's land]]. This was regarded as unrealistic by British and French commanders, and (privately) by a number of Americans such as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] General [[Tasker H. Bliss|Tasker Bliss]] and even Liggett. Even German generals were negative, with Ludendorff dismissing Pershing's strategic efforts in the Meuse-Argonne offensive by recalling how \"the attacks of the youthful American troops broke down with the heaviest losses\".<ref>Trask, David F. ''The AEF and Coalition Warmaking, 1917\u20131918''. University Press of Kansas, 1993, p. 142.</ref> The AEF had performed well in the relatively open warfare of the Second Battle of the Marne, but the eventual American casualties against German defensive positions in the Argonne (roughly 120,000 American casualties in six weeks, against 35 or 40 German divisions) were not noticeably better than those of the Franco-British [[Battle of the Somme|offensive on the Somme]] two years earlier (600,000 casualties in four and a half months, versus 50 or so German divisions). More ground was gained, but by this stage of the war the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] was in worse shape than in previous years.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Pershing - Address from France.ogg\n|title=\"Address from France\"\n|description=A speech given from Allied Headquarters, Chaumont, France, 1918\n}}\n\nSome writers<ref>e.g., David F. Trask (1993)</ref> have speculated that Pershing's frustration at the slow progress through the Argonne was the cause of two incidents which then ensued. First, he ordered the U.S. First Army to take \"the honor\" of recapturing [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], site of the [[Battle of Sedan|French defeat in 1870]]; the ensuing confusion (an order was issued that \"boundaries were not to be considered binding\") exposed American troops to danger not only from the French on their left, but even from one another, as the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] tacked westward by night across the path of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Division]] (accounts differ as to whether [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], then commanding the 84th Brigade of the 42nd Division, was really mistaken for a German officer and arrested). Liggett, who had been away from headquarters the previous day, had to sort out the mess and implement the instructions from the Allied Supreme Command, Marshal Foch, allowing the French to recapture the city; he later recorded that this was the only time during the war in which he lost his temper.\n\nSecond, Pershing sent an unsolicited letter to the Allied [[Supreme War Council]], demanding that the Germans not be given an armistice and that instead, the Allies should push on and obtain an unconditional surrender.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pershing and the Armistice|author=Lowry, Bullitt|journal=[[The Journal of American History]]|volume=55|pages=281\u2013291|number=2|date=September 1968|jstor=1899558|doi=10.2307/1899558}}</ref> Although in later years, many, including President [[Franklin D.

MacArthur saw Pershing as a desk soldier, and the relationship between the two men deteriorated by the end of the war. Similar criticism of senior commanders by the younger generation of officers (the future generals of [[World War II]]) was made in the British and other armies, but in fairness to Pershing, although it was not uncommon for brigade commanders to serve near the front and even be killed, the state of communications in World War I made it more practical for senior generals to command from the rear. He controversially ordered his troops to continue fighting before the signed Armistice took effect. This resulted in 3,500 American casualties on the last day of the war, an act which was regarded as murder by a few officers under his command. Pershing doubted the German\u2019s good faith, and most of his contemporaries took the view he expressed to the House Committee on Military Affairs in his testimony on November 5, 1919:\n\n\u201cWhen the subject of the armistice was under discussion we did not know what the purpose of it was definitely, whether it was something proposed by the German High Command to gain time or whether they were sincere in their desire to have an armistice; and the mere discussion of an armistice would not be sufficient grounds for any judicious commander to relax his military activities\u2026.No one could possibly know when the armistice was to be signed, or what hour be fixed for the cessation of hostilities so that the only thing for us to do, and which I did as commander in chief of the American forces, and which Marshal Foch did as commander in chief of the Allied armies was to continue the military activities\u2026.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm|title=World War I: Wasted Lives on Armistice Day|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515085844/http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm|archivedate=May 15, 2011|df=mdy-all|date=2006-06-12}}</ref>\n\nThe year of 1918 also saw a personal health struggle for Pershing as he was sickened during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], but unlike many who were not so fortunate, Pershing survived.<ref>Collier, Richard.
