Founded on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[Exhibition game|friendly matches]] until they entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1885\u201386 in English football|1885\u201386]]. The club currently plays in the [[Premier League]], the first tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. Nicknamed \"the [[Bordeaux wine#\"Claret\" term|Clarets]]\", due to the dominant colour of the home shirts, Burnley was one of the twelve founding members of [[the Football League]] in [[1888\u201389 Football League|1888]]. The club's [[emblem]] is based on the town's crest, with a Latin [[motto]] ''Pretiumque et Causa Laboris'' (\"The Prize and the Cause of [Our] Labour\").\n\nBurnley has been [[List of English football champions|champions of England]] twice, in [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920\u201321]] and [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]], has won the FA Cup once, in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], and has won the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] twice, in [[1960 FA Charity Shield|1960]] and [[1973 FA Charity Shield|1973]]. The Clarets also reached the [[1960\u201361 European Cup|1961]] quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. Burnley is one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].\n\nIn the [[1920\u201321 Burnley F.C. season|1920\u201321]] campaign, Burnley was crowned champions of England for the first time when they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref name=\"premier_league\" group=nb>Upon its formation in 1992, the [[Premier League]] became the top tier of [[Football in England|English football]]; the [[English Football League|Football League]] [[Football League First Division|First]] and [[Football League Second Division|Second Divisions]] then became the second and third tiers, respectively. From 2004, the First Division became the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and the Second Division became [[EFL League One|League One]].</ref> During that season the team embarked on a 30-match unbeaten run, which remained an English record until it was beaten by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2003\u201304. Burnley attained a second league championship in [[1959\u201360 Burnley F.C. season|1959\u201360]] with a team consisting of mostly youth academy graduates, winning the title with a last-day victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], after foundations were laid by pioneers [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]], [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]] and [[Harry Potts]]. Twenty years later, in [[1979\u201380 Burnley F.C. season|1979\u201380]], Burnley was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] \u2014 the first time in the club's history. Five years later, the team competed in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time following another relegation, and on 9 May 1987 only a 2\u20131 home win against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Orient]] saved Burnley from relegation to the [[Football Conference]] and a possible dissolution. Burnley won promotion in [[1991\u201392 Burnley F.C. season|1991\u201392]] to the third tier and again in [[1999\u20132000 Burnley F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] to the second tier, before being promoted to the Premier League in [[2008\u201309 Burnley F.C. season|2008\u201309]], [[2013\u201314 Burnley F.C. season|2013\u201314]] and [[2015\u201316 Burnley F.C. season|2015\u201316]].\n\nBurnley has played home games at [[Turf Moor]] since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from the original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of [[claret]] and blue were adopted prior to the 1910\u201311 season in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Burnley's current manager, [[Sean Dyche]], was appointed on 30 October 2012.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years (1882\u20131912) ===\n[[File:Burnley FC 1890.png|thumb|One of the earliest photographed Burnley sides, with the [[Lancashire Senior Cup|Lancashire Cup]] in the middle of the photo]]\nOn 18 May 1882, members of '''Burnley Rovers Rugby Club''' gathered at the Bull Hotel in Burnley to vote for a shift from [[rugby union]] to [[association football]], since other sports clubs in the area had changed their codes to association football and more income could be generated by playing football.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Burnley FC On This Day: History, Facts & Figures from Every Day of the Year|last=Bird|first=Philip|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2018|isbn=978-1785314254}}</ref> A large majority voted in favour of change of sports.

Founded on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[Exhibition game|friendly matches]] until they entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1885\u201386 in English football|1885\u201386]]. The club currently plays in the [[Premier League]], the first tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. Nicknamed \"the [[Bordeaux wine#\"Claret\" term|Clarets]]\", due to the dominant colour of the home shirts, Burnley was one of the twelve founding members of [[the Football League]] in [[1888\u201389 Football League|1888]]. The club's [[emblem]] is based on the town's crest, with a Latin [[motto]] ''Pretiumque et Causa Laboris'' (\"The Prize and the Cause of [Our] Labour\").\n\nBurnley has been [[List of English football champions|champions of England]] twice, in [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920\u201321]] and [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]], has won the FA Cup once, in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], and has won the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] twice, in [[1960 FA Charity Shield|1960]] and [[1973 FA Charity Shield|1973]]. The Clarets also reached the [[1960\u201361 European Cup|1961]] quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. Burnley is one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].\n\nIn the [[1920\u201321 Burnley F.C. season|1920\u201321]] campaign, Burnley was crowned champions of England for the first time when they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref name=\"premier_league\" group=nb>Upon its formation in 1992, the [[Premier League]] became the top tier of [[Football in England|English football]]; the [[English Football League|Football League]] [[Football League First Division|First]] and [[Football League Second Division|Second Divisions]] then became the second and third tiers, respectively. From 2004, the First Division became the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and the Second Division became [[EFL League One|League One]].</ref> During that season the team embarked on a 30-match unbeaten run, which remained an English record until it was beaten by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2003\u201304. Burnley attained a second league championship in [[1959\u201360 Burnley F.C. season|1959\u201360]] with a team consisting of mostly youth academy graduates, winning the title with a last-day victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], after foundations were laid by pioneers [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]], [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]] and [[Harry Potts]]. Twenty years later, in [[1979\u201380 Burnley F.C. season|1979\u201380]], Burnley was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] \u2014 the first time in the club's history. Five years later, the team competed in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time following another relegation, and on 9 May 1987 only a 2\u20131 home win against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Orient]] saved Burnley from relegation to the [[Football Conference]] and a possible dissolution. Burnley won promotion in [[1991\u201392 Burnley F.C. season|1991\u201392]] to the third tier and again in [[1999\u20132000 Burnley F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] to the second tier, before being promoted to the Premier League in [[2008\u201309 Burnley F.C. season|2008\u201309]], [[2013\u201314 Burnley F.C. season|2013\u201314]] and [[2015\u201316 Burnley F.C. season|2015\u201316]].\n\nBurnley has played home games at [[Turf Moor]] since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from the original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of [[claret]] and blue were adopted prior to the 1910\u201311 season in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Burnley's current manager, [[Sean Dyche]], was appointed on 30 October 2012.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years (1882\u20131912) ===\n[[File:Burnley FC 1890.png|thumb|One of the earliest photographed Burnley sides, with the [[Lancashire Senior Cup|Lancashire Cup]] in the middle of the photo]]\nOn 18 May 1882, members of '''Burnley Rovers Rugby Club''' gathered at the Bull Hotel in Burnley to vote for a shift from [[rugby union]] to [[association football]], since other sports clubs in the area had changed their codes to association football and more income could be generated by playing football.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Burnley FC On This Day: History, Facts & Figures from Every Day of the Year|last=Bird|first=Philip|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2018|isbn=978-1785314254}}</ref> A large majority voted in favour of change of sports.

Following victory in the national under-19\u2032s Championship beating John Parrott in the final, Foulds then turned professional in 1983. \n\nAt the end of the season he qualified for the final stages of the [[1984 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] at his first attempt. Even more impressively however, he then defeated twice-champion [[Alex Higgins]] 10\u20139 in the first round before going down 13\u20139 to [[Doug Mountjoy]] in the last 16, a run that saw him enter the rankings at number 30.\n\nFoulds quickly climbed the rankings in the seasons that followed [[Snooker world rankings 1987/1988|reaching no. 3]] within four years. He won his first ranking tournament in 1986, the [[Scottish Open (snooker)|BCE International]], beating [[Cliff Thorburn]] 12\u20139 in the final. In the same season he was runner-up to [[Steve Davis]] in the [[UK Championship]], and he also reached the semi-finals of the [[World Snooker Championship 1987|1987 World Championship]], losing 16\u20139 to [[Joe Johnson (snooker player)|Joe Johnson]].<ref name=\"Clive Everton's Crucible History - 1987 World Championship\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/static/in_depth/other_sports/2001/world_snooker/history/1987.stm\n| title = Clive Everton's Crucible History \u2013 1987 World Championship\n| publisher = [[BBC]]\n| year = 2001\n| accessdate = 2008-04-03\n}}</ref>\nStarting the following season in a career high position of number three, 1987/88 was not to be quite as successful, though another strong run to the quarter-finals in the [[1988 World Snooker Championship]]  before losing to [[Terry Griffiths]] ensured that he would retain his spot at third in the rankings. Foulds also won the [[1988 Dubai Masters]], beating Steve Davis in the final, though this event would not hold any ranking points until the following year.\n\nFrom here however he started to struggle, dropping 17 places to 20th in the rankings and finding himself having to qualify for events the following season. Still, 1989/90 was to see a revival and despite a round one exit at the [[1989 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] to [[Wayne Jones (snooker player)|Wayne Jones]], he did enough to regain a place in the top 16 before moving up to number seven at the end of 1990/1.<ref>http://www.wpbsa.com/neal-foulds-the-big-interview/</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Foulds was crowned the [[1992 Scottish Masters|Scottish Masters]] champion and also won the 1992 edition of [[1992 Pot Black|Pot Black]], beating Nigel Bond, Jimmy White, Ronnie O'Sullivan en route to the final, where he beat James Wattana. \n\n[[File:German Masters 2015-Venue-Misc-11 (LezFraniak).jpg|thumb|Foulds and Jimmy White in an interview with Shaun Murphy after his victory against Mark Allen]]\nThough he was able to maintain a top 16 place until the end of the 1993/4 season, and a place on the tour until 2003, he played his final match as a Main Tour player on 13 January 2003 before retiring from competitive play aged 39.\n\nFoulds made a brief reappearance as a player in November 2011 in the World Seniors (aged 48) before eventually losing to Dene O'Kane.\n\nFoulds made 86 competitive century breaks in his career.\n\n==Commentary career==\nSince his retirement, Foulds has moved up to the commentary box for [[Eurosport]], [[Sky Sports|BBC, Sky Sports]] and he also co-hosts all [[ITV4]] tournament coverage, interviewing players as well as commentating. In 2014, Foulds made a cameo as himself commentating on a fictional match at the climax of the snooker short film drama 'Extended Rest'. <ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3710580/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_9</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nFoulds is married and has a daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inside-snooker.com/snooker/2014/2/25/neal-foulds-army-saved-me-from-floods|title=Neal Foulds: Army Saved Me From Floods|last=|first=|date=25 February 2014|website=Inside Snooker|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Performance and rankings timeline ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

Foulds''' (born 13 July 1963) is an [[English people|English]] former professional [[snooker]] player and six-times tournament winner, including the [[1986 International Open]], the [[1988 Dubai Masters]] and the [[1992 Scottish Masters]]<ref>http://www.snookerdatabase.co.uk/PlayerDetails.aspx?playerKey=114</ref>, as well as the invitational [[1992 Pot Black|Pot Black]] in 1992. He was the runner up for the UK Championships in 1986, the British Open in 1987 and reached the semi finals of the Masters on three occasions, as well as the World Championship.<ref>http://www.snookerdatabase.co.uk/PlayerDetails.aspx?playerKey=114</ref> After his retirement, Foulds became a commentator for the BBC and is currently part of the presenting team for ITV and Eurosport.<ref>http://www.eurosport.com/snooker/then-and-now-neal-foulds_sto2224101/story.shtml</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThe son of snooker professional [[Geoff Foulds]], he began playing the game at the age of 11 and by the early 1980s was already one of the strongest players in his area. Following victory in the national under-19\u2032s Championship beating John Parrott in the final, Foulds then turned professional in 1983. \n\nAt the end of the season he qualified for the final stages of the [[1984 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] at his first attempt. Even more impressively however, he then defeated twice-champion [[Alex Higgins]] 10\u20139 in the first round before going down 13\u20139 to [[Doug Mountjoy]] in the last 16, a run that saw him enter the rankings at number 30.\n\nFoulds quickly climbed the rankings in the seasons that followed [[Snooker world rankings 1987/1988|reaching no. 3]] within four years. He won his first ranking tournament in 1986, the [[Scottish Open (snooker)|BCE International]], beating [[Cliff Thorburn]] 12\u20139 in the final. In the same season he was runner-up to [[Steve Davis]] in the [[UK Championship]], and he also reached the semi-finals of the [[World Snooker Championship 1987|1987 World Championship]], losing 16\u20139 to [[Joe Johnson (snooker player)|Joe Johnson]].<ref name=\"Clive Everton's Crucible History - 1987 World Championship\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/static/in_depth/other_sports/2001/world_snooker/history/1987.stm\n| title = Clive Everton's Crucible History \u2013 1987 World Championship\n| publisher = [[BBC]]\n| year = 2001\n| accessdate = 2008-04-03\n}}</ref>\nStarting the following season in a career high position of number three, 1987/88 was not to be quite as successful, though another strong run to the quarter-finals in the [[1988 World Snooker Championship]]  before losing to [[Terry Griffiths]] ensured that he would retain his spot at third in the rankings. Foulds also won the [[1988 Dubai Masters]], beating Steve Davis in the final, though this event would not hold any ranking points until the following year.\n\nFrom here however he started to struggle, dropping 17 places to 20th in the rankings and finding himself having to qualify for events the following season. Still, 1989/90 was to see a revival and despite a round one exit at the [[1989 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] to [[Wayne Jones (snooker player)|Wayne Jones]], he did enough to regain a place in the top 16 before moving up to number seven at the end of 1990/1.<ref>http://www.wpbsa.com/neal-foulds-the-big-interview/</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Foulds was crowned the [[1992 Scottish Masters|Scottish Masters]] champion and also won the 1992 edition of [[1992 Pot Black|Pot Black]], beating Nigel Bond, Jimmy White, Ronnie O'Sullivan en route to the final, where he beat James Wattana. \n\n[[File:German Masters 2015-Venue-Misc-11 (LezFraniak).jpg|thumb|Foulds and Jimmy White in an interview with Shaun Murphy after his victory against Mark Allen]]\nThough he was able to maintain a top 16 place until the end of the 1993/4 season, and a place on the tour until 2003, he played his final match as a Main Tour player on 13 January 2003 before retiring from competitive play aged 39.\n\nFoulds made a brief reappearance as a player in November 2011 in the World Seniors (aged 48) before eventually losing to Dene O'Kane.\n\nFoulds made 86 competitive century breaks in his career.\n\n==Commentary career==\nSince his retirement, Foulds has moved up to the commentary box for [[Eurosport]], [[Sky Sports|BBC, Sky Sports]] and he also co-hosts all [[ITV4]] tournament coverage, interviewing players as well as commentating. In 2014, Foulds made a cameo as himself commentating on a fictional match at the climax of the snooker short film drama 'Extended Rest'. <ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3710580/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_9</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nFoulds is married and has a daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inside-snooker.com/snooker/2014/2/25/neal-foulds-army-saved-me-from-floods|title=Neal Foulds: Army Saved Me From Floods|last=|first=|date=25 February 2014|website=Inside Snooker|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Performance and rankings timeline ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

Numerous [[cultivar]]s have been selected, for variation in flower colour (white, mauve, peach, scarlet and reddish-orange), and also for tolerance of cooler growing conditions in temperate regions.

Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the [[Knife game|Russian game]], in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body \u2013 the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramovi\u0107 began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\"<ref>Kaplan, 9</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 5'', 1974===\nIn this performance, Abramovi\u0107 sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramovi\u0107 cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramovi\u0107 leapt across the flames into the center of the large star. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.\n\nAbramovi\u0107 later commented upon this experience: \"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\"<ref>Daneri, 29</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 2'', 1974===\nPrompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramovi\u0107 devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from [[catatonia]], to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-8747-9 |pages=132\u2013144 |last1=Dezeuze |first1=Anna |last2=Ward, Frazer |title=The \"Do-It-Yourself\" Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media |chapter=Marina Abramovic: Approaching zero |location=Manchester |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Charta |isbn=978-88-8158-175-7 |last1=Pejic |first1=Bojana |last2=Abramovic |first2=Marina |last3=McEvilley |first3=Thomas |last4=Stoos |first4=Toni |title=Marina Abramovic: Artist Body |location=Milano |date=July 2, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |edition=Second Printing  |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, New York |isbn=978-0-87070-747-6 |last1=Danto |first1=Arthur |last2=Iles |first2=Chrissie |last3=Abramovic |first3=Marina |others=Klaus Biesenbach (ed.) |title=Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present |location=New York |date=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 4'', 1974===\nIn this piece, Abramovi\u0107 kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan.

She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force which would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramovi\u0107 described as the \"Madonna, mother, and whore.\"<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Additionally, markings of aggression were written on the artist's body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body. With an initial determination to find out how the public acts with no consequences tied to their actions, she realized by the end that the public might very well have killed her for their own personal enjoyment.\n\nIn her works, Abramovi\u0107 affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Abramovi\u0107's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demaria|first=Cristina|date=2016-07-25|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovi\u0107: Rerelating (in) Time and Space|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1350506804044464|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|doi=10.1177/1350506804044464}}</ref>\n\nInitially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that&nbsp;... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.&nbsp;... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetheatretimes.com/audience-to-be/|title=Audience To Be|date=2019-02-11|website=The Theatre Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n===Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen)===\n[[File:Abramovic Ulay.jpg|thumb|Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Uwe Laysiepen 1978]]\nIn 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramovi\u0107 met the [[West Germany|West German]] performance artist [[Uwe Laysiepen]], who went by the single name Ulay.

As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\".<ref>Green, 41</ref>\n\nThe work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, [[transcendental meditation]] and [[nonverbal communication]].<ref name=\":3\" /> While some critics have explored the idea of a [[hermaphroditic]] state of being as a [[feminist]] statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with [[gender]] ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"<ref>Kaplan, 14</ref>\n*In ''Relation in Space'' (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".<ref name=Garage/>\n*''Relation in Movement'' (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\n*In ''Relation in Time'' (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.<ref name=\"uoregon1\">{{cite web|author=|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/marinaabramovic/category/ulayabramovic/ |title=Ulay/Abramovi\u0107 \u2013 Marina Abramovi\u0107 |publisher=Blogs.uoregon.edu |date=February 12, 2015 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n*To create ''[[Breathing in/breathing out|Breathing In/Breathing Out]]'' the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.\n*In ''Imponderabilia'' (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.<ref name=Garage/>\n*In ''AAA-AAA'' (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/> This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n*In 1980, they performed ''[[Rest Energy (performance piece)|Rest Energy]],'' in an art exhibition in [[Dublin]], where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upperhand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.<ref name=Garage/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/march/22/documenting-the-performance-art-of-marina-abramovi-in-pictures/?idx=9 |title=Documenting the performance art of Marina Abramovi\u0107 in pictures &#124; Art &#124; Agenda |publisher=Phaidon |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987, the pair performed ''Nightsea Crossing'' in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n\nIn 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called ''Lovers,'' starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the [[Gobi Desert]] and I from the [[Yellow Sea]].

She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending&nbsp;... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.\"<ref name=\"Daneri, 35\"/> She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall has been described as a \"dragon of energy.\" It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved.\n\nAt her 2010 MoMA retrospective, Abramovi\u0107 performed ''The Artist Is Present'', in which she shared a period of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her.

She vigorously brushes the different parts of the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramovi\u0107 becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #1 was performed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], consisting of three hours. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University.

On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the '60s and '70s, in addition to re-performing her own ''Lips of Thomas'' and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist.  Included in Abramovi\u0107's performances were recreations of [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning,'' which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of [[Vito Acconci]]'s 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead. It is argued that Abramovi\u0107 re-performed these works as a series of homages to the past, though many of the performances were altered from their originals.<ref>{{citation | title= Marina Abramovi\u0107 | author= | publisher=BLOUINARTINFO  | date= November 9, 2005 | url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/marina-abramovic-4098 | accessdate=April 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHere is a full list of the works performed:\n* [[Bruce Nauman]]'s ''[[Body Pressure]]'' (1974)\n* [[Vito Acconci]]'s ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]'' (1972)\n* [[Valie Export]]'s ''Action Pants: Genital Panic'' (1969)\n* [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning'' (1973)\n* [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]'' (1965)\n* Abramovi\u0107's own ''Thomas Lips'' (1975)\n* Abramovi\u0107's own ''Entering the Other Side'' (2005)\n\n===''The Artist Is Present'': March\u2013May 2010{{anchor|The Artist Is Present}}===\n[[File:artistIsPresent.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Abramovi\u0107 performing ''The Artist Is Present'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], March 2010]]\n\nFrom March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Abramovi\u0107's work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history, curated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]].<ref>Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/arts/design/14performance.html?pagewanted=all A Rebel Form Gains Favor.

Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[James Franco]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Jemima Kirke]], [[Jennifer Carpenter]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]]; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist.

The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramovi\u0107. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their clothes for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused.\n\nIn 1970 she proposed a similar idea to the same gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramovi\u0107 would stand in front of the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. \"From the right pocket of my skirt I take a gun. From the left pocket of my skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple.

Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the [[Knife game|Russian game]], in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body \u2013 the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramovi\u0107 began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\"<ref>Kaplan, 9</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 5'', 1974===\nIn this performance, Abramovi\u0107 sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramovi\u0107 cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramovi\u0107 leapt across the flames into the center of the large star. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.\n\nAbramovi\u0107 later commented upon this experience: \"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\"<ref>Daneri, 29</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 2'', 1974===\nPrompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramovi\u0107 devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from [[catatonia]], to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-8747-9 |pages=132\u2013144 |last1=Dezeuze |first1=Anna |last2=Ward, Frazer |title=The \"Do-It-Yourself\" Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media |chapter=Marina Abramovic: Approaching zero |location=Manchester |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Charta |isbn=978-88-8158-175-7 |last1=Pejic |first1=Bojana |last2=Abramovic |first2=Marina |last3=McEvilley |first3=Thomas |last4=Stoos |first4=Toni |title=Marina Abramovic: Artist Body |location=Milano |date=July 2, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |edition=Second Printing  |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, New York |isbn=978-0-87070-747-6 |last1=Danto |first1=Arthur |last2=Iles |first2=Chrissie |last3=Abramovic |first3=Marina |others=Klaus Biesenbach (ed.) |title=Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present |location=New York |date=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 4'', 1974===\nIn this piece, Abramovi\u0107 kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan.

She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force which would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramovi\u0107 described as the \"Madonna, mother, and whore.\"<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Additionally, markings of aggression were written on the artist's body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body. With an initial determination to find out how the public acts with no consequences tied to their actions, she realized by the end that the public might very well have killed her for their own personal enjoyment.\n\nIn her works, Abramovi\u0107 affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Abramovi\u0107's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demaria|first=Cristina|date=2016-07-25|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovi\u0107: Rerelating (in) Time and Space|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1350506804044464|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|doi=10.1177/1350506804044464}}</ref>\n\nInitially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that&nbsp;... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.&nbsp;... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetheatretimes.com/audience-to-be/|title=Audience To Be|date=2019-02-11|website=The Theatre Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n===Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen)===\n[[File:Abramovic Ulay.jpg|thumb|Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Uwe Laysiepen 1978]]\nIn 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramovi\u0107 met the [[West Germany|West German]] performance artist [[Uwe Laysiepen]], who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their collaboration,<ref name=Garage/> the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created \"relation works\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \"art vital\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art, 2nd ed.|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=808\u2013809}}</ref> This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \"The Other\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \"two-headed body\".<ref>Quoted in Green, 37</ref> They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\".<ref>Green, 41</ref>\n\nThe work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, [[transcendental meditation]] and [[nonverbal communication]].<ref name=\":3\" /> While some critics have explored the idea of a [[hermaphroditic]] state of being as a [[feminist]] statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with [[gender]] ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"<ref>Kaplan, 14</ref>\n*In ''Relation in Space'' (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".<ref name=Garage/>\n*''Relation in Movement'' (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\n*In ''Relation in Time'' (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.<ref name=\"uoregon1\">{{cite web|author=|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/marinaabramovic/category/ulayabramovic/ |title=Ulay/Abramovi\u0107 \u2013 Marina Abramovi\u0107 |publisher=Blogs.uoregon.edu |date=February 12, 2015 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n*To create ''[[Breathing in/breathing out|Breathing In/Breathing Out]]'' the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.\n*In ''Imponderabilia'' (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.<ref name=Garage/>\n*In ''AAA-AAA'' (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/> This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n*In 1980, they performed ''[[Rest Energy (performance piece)|Rest Energy]],'' in an art exhibition in [[Dublin]], where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upperhand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.<ref name=Garage/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/march/22/documenting-the-performance-art-of-marina-abramovi-in-pictures/?idx=9 |title=Documenting the performance art of Marina Abramovi\u0107 in pictures &#124; Art &#124; Agenda |publisher=Phaidon |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987, the pair performed ''Nightsea Crossing'' in twenty-two performances.

They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called ''Lovers,'' starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the [[Gobi Desert]] and I from the [[Yellow Sea]].

She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending&nbsp;... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.\"<ref name=\"Daneri, 35\"/> She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall has been described as a \"dragon of energy.\" It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved.\n\nAt her 2010 MoMA retrospective, Abramovi\u0107 performed ''The Artist Is Present'', in which she shared a period of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her.

She vigorously brushes the different parts of the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramovi\u0107 becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #1 was performed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], consisting of three hours. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University.

On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the '60s and '70s, in addition to re-performing her own ''Lips of Thomas'' and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist.  Included in Abramovi\u0107's performances were recreations of [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning,'' which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of [[Vito Acconci]]'s 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead. It is argued that Abramovi\u0107 re-performed these works as a series of homages to the past, though many of the performances were altered from their originals.<ref>{{citation | title= Marina Abramovi\u0107 | author= | publisher=BLOUINARTINFO  | date= November 9, 2005 | url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/marina-abramovic-4098 | accessdate=April 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHere is a full list of the works performed:\n* [[Bruce Nauman]]'s ''[[Body Pressure]]'' (1974)\n* [[Vito Acconci]]'s ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]'' (1972)\n* [[Valie Export]]'s ''Action Pants: Genital Panic'' (1969)\n* [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning'' (1973)\n* [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]'' (1965)\n* Abramovi\u0107's own ''Thomas Lips'' (1975)\n* Abramovi\u0107's own ''Entering the Other Side'' (2005)\n\n===''The Artist Is Present'': March\u2013May 2010{{anchor|The Artist Is Present}}===\n[[File:artistIsPresent.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Abramovi\u0107 performing ''The Artist Is Present'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], March 2010]]\n\nFrom March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Abramovi\u0107's work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history, curated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]].<ref>Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/arts/design/14performance.html?pagewanted=all A Rebel Form Gains Favor.

Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[James Franco]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Jemima Kirke]], [[Jennifer Carpenter]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]]; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist.

The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramovi\u0107. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their clothes for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused.\n\nIn 1970 she proposed a similar idea to the same gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramovi\u0107 would stand in front of the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear.
