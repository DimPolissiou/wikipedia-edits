This test detects only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 and is used to confirm very recent or active infections.\n\nDetection of antibodies ([[serology]]) can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance. Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were minor or who were asymptomatic. An accurate [[mortality rate]] of the disease and the level of [[herd immunity]] in the population can be determined from the results of this test.\n\nDue to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.<ref>{{cite news|title=A fiasco in the making?

The high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these assays but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system. For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is commonly used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response. For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture. Unlike PCR methods an extraction step is not needed before assay.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn late March 2020, a number of companies received European approvals for their test kits.

It is located on [[Impalila Island]]  at the confluence of the [[Zambezi]] and [[Chobe]] rivers.\n\n==History==\nThe base was originally constructed by the [[South African Defence Force]] and used by the [[South African Marine Corps]]. It was abandoned in 1989 during South Africa's withdrawal from Namibia. After Namibia's independence it was used as a secondary school.<ref>https://www.defenceweb.co.za/security/maritime-security/namibia-commissions-new-naval-facility/</ref> In 2011 the [[Namibian Navy]] condcuted a Navy Coastal-land, Riverine and Meteorological survey, which found critical security gaps.<ref>https://neweralive.na/posts/impalila-naval-base-officially-opened</ref> The report led to the creation of the naval district covering [[Zambezi]], [[Chobe]] and [[Okavango]] rivers.
