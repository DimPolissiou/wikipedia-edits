And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it.

The plug was pulled on the project halfway through shooting after Jett fell ill, but in 1984, after she became famous, producers looked for a way to use the footage from the incomplete film.<ref name=MTV/> Parts of the original footage of Jett were eventually used in another project, an underground film called ''DuBeat-Eo'', which was produced by Alan Sacks but not commercially released.<ref name=MTV/>\n\nJett and Laguna entered [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]] with the latter at the helm, and Jett's self-titled solo debut was released by [[Ariola Records]] in Europe on May 17, 1980.

The final addition to the original Blackhearts was drummer Danny \"Furious\" O'Brien, formerly of the San Francisco band the [[Avengers (band)|Avengers]]. This lineup played several gigs at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]], in Huntington Beach, California and the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood before embarking on their first European tour, which consisted of an extensive tour of the Netherlands and a few key shows in England, including the Marquee in London.<ref name=\"badrep\">{{cite web| last=Jett|first=Joan|title=Joan Jett and the Blackhearts&nbsp;\u2013 An Open Forum with Joan Jett!|volume=2, Issue 4|website=Bad Reputation Nation|date=July 1992|url=http://joanjettbadrep.com/Interviews/fanclub/Vol2Issue4.shtml|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLaguna fired O'Brien at the end of the tour,<ref name=\"Record8\"/> and upon returning to the States, Jett, Ryan, and Ambel moved to [[Long Beach, New York]].

The [[Riot Grrrl]] movement started in the 1990s, with Bikini Kill as a representative band, and many of these women credited Jett as a role model and inspiration.\n\nIn 1997, Jett was featured on the ''We Will Fall: The Iggy Pop Tribute'' album. She performed a cover of the [[Johnny O'Keefe]] song \"[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Wild One]]\" (or \"Real Wild Child\"). Jett worked with members of the punk rock band [[the Gits]], whose lead singer and lyricist, [[Mia Zapata]], had been raped and murdered in 1993.<ref name=\"VH1\"/> The results of their collaboration was a live album, ''[[Evil Stig]]'' and a single, \"Bob\", whose earnings were contributed to the investigation of Zapata's murder. To this end, the band and Jett appeared on the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', appealing to the public for information. The case was solved in 2004, when Zapata's murderer, Jesus Mezquia, was brought to trial and convicted.\n\nJett is a guest artist on [[Marky Ramone and the Intruders]]' 1999 album ''The Answer to Your Problems?'' on the track \"Don't Blame Me\".

And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]] and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]]. It was the last of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThis conflict can be viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War|First]] and [[Second Silesian War]]s of the previous decade. After the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Austria enacted broad reforms and [[Diplomatic Revolution|upended its traditional diplomatic policy]] to prepare for renewed war with Prussia. As with the previous Silesian Wars, no particular triggering event initiated the conflict; rather, Prussia struck opportunistically to disrupt its enemies' plans. The war's cost in blood and treasure was high on both sides, and it ended inconclusively when neither of the main belligerents could sustain the conflict any longer.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] in mid-1756, and it ended in a Prussian diplomatic victory with the 1763 [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. The treaty resulted in no territorial changes, but Austria agreed to recognise Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia in return for Prussia's support for the election of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The conflict formed part of the ongoing [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry]] that would shape German politics for more than a century. The war greatly enhanced the prestige of Prussia, which won general recognition as a major European power, and of Frederick, who cemented his reputation as a preeminent military commander.\n\n==Context and causes==\n{{Further|First Silesian War|Second Silesian War}}\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|alt=Map of European political borders in 1756|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Brandenburg\u2013Prussia]] in violet and the Habsburg Monarchy in gold|upright=1.2]]\nWhile the [[Seven Years' War]] was a global conflict among many belligerents, its [[Central Europe]]an theatre turned on lingering grudges from the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1741\u20131748). The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], which had concluded the latter war, confirmed Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]]'s seizure of the region of [[Silesia]] from the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through two [[Silesian Wars]].<ref name=\"Fraser 202\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=202}}</ref> The defeated Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria nevertheless fully intended to retake the lost province and reassert Austria's hegemony in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; after peace was restored, she set about rebuilding her armed forces and seeking out new alliances.<ref>{{Harvp|Wilson|2016|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n===Unresolved conflicts===\nThough [[Early modern France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] recognised Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria ultimately refused to ratify the agreement, and Maria Theresa's husband, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], withheld the Holy Roman Empire's guarantee for Prussian control of the contested province. Prussia, in turn, still withheld its assent to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], thus challenging Maria Theresa's legitimacy as head of the Habsburg Monarchy.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/> Despite dynastic links, British King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French, while Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion.<ref name=\"Shennan 49\">{{Harvp|Shennan|2005|p=49}}</ref> The political and diplomatic conditions that had led to the previous Silesian Wars still held, and further conflict seemed likely.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/>\n\nIn 1746 Maria Theresa formed a defensive agreement with Elizabeth known as the [[Treaty of Two Empresses]], which aligned [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. In 1750 Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact in return for guarantees of Austrian and Russian support in the case of a Prussian attack on the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which George also ruled in [[personal union]].<ref name=\"Shennan 49\"/> At the same time, Maria Theresa, who had been disappointed with Britain's performance as [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|her ally]] in the War of the Austrian Succession, followed the controversial advice of her Chancellor [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] by pursuing warmer relations with Austria's [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|longstanding rival]], the Kingdom of France.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic Revolution===\nBritain elevated tensions in 1755 by offering to finance the deployment of a Russian army that would stand ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the Austrian coalition by allaying King George's concern for Hanover. On 16 January 1756 Prussia and Britain agreed to the [[Convention of Westminster]], under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian alliance]] and incensed the French court.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=297\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nAustria was now seeking warmer relations with France to ensure that the French would not take Prussia's side in a future conflict over Silesia. King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new [[Franco-Austrian alliance]], formalised with the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] in May 1756. This series of political manoeuvres came to be known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvp|Horn|1957|pp=449\u2013464}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Black|1990|pp=301\u2013323}}</ref> Russia, likewise upset by the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As France turned against Prussia and Russia separated from Britain, Kaunitz's plan thus matured into a grand anti-Prussian alliance between Austria, Russia, various lesser German powers, and France.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n===Preparations for war===\n[[File:Crown of Bohemia 1648.png|thumb|alt=Map of political borders in Central Europe in the early 1700s|Map of the [[Central Europe]]an region, prior to Prussia's seizure of Silesia, where the bulk of the war was fought]]\nAs Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757. Rather than wait for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to act preemptively, beginning with an attack against the neighbouring [[Electorate of Saxony]], which he correctly believed was a secret party to the coalition against him.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=310}}</ref> Frederick's broad strategy had three parts. First, he meant to occupy Saxony, gaining [[strategic depth]] and using the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into [[Bohemia]], where he might set up winter quarters and supply his army at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at [[Olm\u00fctz]], and advance on [[Vienna]] to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey 427\">{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=427}}</ref> He hoped to receive financial support from the British, who had also promised to send a naval squadron into the [[Baltic Sea]] to defend Prussia's coast against Russia, if necessary.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=308}}</ref>\n\nTo begin, Frederick divided Prussia's armies in three. He placed a force of 20,000 under [[Field Marshal]] [[Hans von Lehwaldt]] in [[East Prussia]] to guard against any Russian invasion from the east, with a reserve of 8,000 standing in [[Farther Pomerania]]; Russia should have been able to bring irresistible force to bear against East Prussia, but the King trusted to the slowness and disorganisation of the Russian army to defend his north-eastern flank. He also stationed Field Marshal Count [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] in Silesia with 25,000 men to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary. Finally, in August 1756 he personally led the main Prussian army of around 60,000 into Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=317\u2013318}}</ref>\n\n===Methods and technologies===\n{{Further|Early modern warfare}}\nEuropean warfare in the [[early modern period]] was characterised by the widespread adoption of [[firearm]]s in combination with more traditional [[bladed weapons]]. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed [[infantry]] armed with [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock musket]]s and [[bayonet]]s. [[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick's theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals.<ref>{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=67\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe Silesian Wars and most European wars of the eighteenth century were fought as so-called [[cabinet wars]] in which disciplined [[regular armies]] were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|209}}</ref> [[Military logistics]] was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised [[Supply depot|magazines]] and distributed by [[baggage train]]s that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids.<ref>{{Harvp|Creveld|1977|pp=26\u201328}}</ref> Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established [[Cantonment|winter quarters]] in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.<ref name=\"Black 38\"/>\n\n==Course==\n===1756===\n====Invasion of Saxony====\n[[File:Map for the Silesian and Seven Years Wars.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Central Europe with coloured territories|The Central European borders of Brandenburg\u2013Prussia (blue-green) and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (red) in 1756, at the outbreak of the Third Silesian War|upright=1.2]]\nPrussian troops crossed the Saxon frontier on 29 August 1756.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=198\u2013199}}</ref> The Prussian army marched in three columns: on the right were about 15,000 men under the command of [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]; on the left were 18,000 men under the command of the [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Bevern|Duke of Brunswick-Bevern]]; in the centre was Frederick himself, with Field Marshal [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]] commanding a corps of 30,000 troops.

In February [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], the new [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and a determined foe of France, persuaded the British Parliament to firmly and finally commit to the Prussian cause against Austria and France, after which Britain began delivering supplies and badly needed subsidies to Berlin. Parliament also approved the deployment of an [[army of observation]] to defend Hanover (and [[Brandenburg]]) against the coming [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French invasion]] from the west,<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=334\u2013336}}</ref> and Frederick again called for a British naval deployment in the Baltic to deter Russia and an increasingly unfriendly Sweden, though nothing came of it.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=333}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Prussia's aggressive attack on Saxony galvanised the Austrian coalition, and in particular increased France's commitment to offensive war against Prussia. The [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] met in January in [[Regensburg]], where Maria Theresa won enough German princes to her cause that the Holy Roman Empire [[Reichskrieg|declared war on Prussia]] on 17 January; the Diet called for a 40,000-man ''[[Reichsarmee]]'' to be assembled and put at Austria's disposal for the liberation of Saxony.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=331\u2013332}}</ref> In May 1757 the [[Second Treaty of Versailles]] strengthened the Franco-Austrian Alliance, with the French agreeing to contribute 129,000 soldiers to the fighting in Germany, along with subsidies of 12 million [[French livre|livres]] per year until Austria had recovered Silesia.<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nIn return, Austria promised that after the victory was won it would grant France control of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], a long-coveted prize for the French. Russia also committed 80,000 men to the conflict, hoping to seize East Prussia and then exchange that territory with [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] for control of [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]]. Sweden also agreed to invade [[Province of Pomerania (1653\u20131815)|Prussian Pomerania]], looking to recovering the territories [[Treaties of Stockholm (Great Northern War)|lost to Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]].

Prussia could field only 104,000 troops, many of them raw recruits, and there were shortages of even basic supplies like muskets for the infantry. The Prussian army was no longer fit for the sort of aggressive manoeuvers that had previously characterised Frederick's tactics,<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|pp=427\u2013428}}</ref> and the kingdom's situation was desperate.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=491}}</ref> Daun, the chief Austrian commander, also ruled out major offensives for the year and made no plans to even attempt to reconquer Silesia, preferring to concentrate his efforts in Saxony against Prince Henry. Austria's finances were in a state of chaos, and its economy was choked by heavy war taxes. Cooperation between Russian and Austrian forces was breaking down, as the two allied powers grew less willing to pursue each other's goals in the field.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|pp=429\u2013431}}</ref>\n\n====Russian advances====\n[[File:Fall of Kolberg in 1761.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of ragged Prussian soldiers retreating through a winter landscape after abandoning Kolberg|Defeated Prussians withdrawing as Russians [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|take control of Kolberg]], as depicted by Alexander von Kotzebue|upright=1.2]]\nRussian Marshal [[Alexander Buturlin]], the new commander of Russia's forces in the theatre, coordinated with Laudon's Austrians to begin an advance in southern Silesia in April.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=435}}</ref> The Prussian garrison under General [[Karl Christoph von der Goltz]] dug in around Schweidnitz, while field armies under Frederick, Laudon and Buturlin engaged in a prolonged campaign of manoeuver with no major engagements.

The town was strongly defended and held out well, but several Prussian attempts to break the siege were unsuccessful. In October Frederick ordered much of the garrison to withdraw to Berlin and defend Brandenburg; the weakened town finally capitulated on 16 December. The fall of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea,<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=492}}</ref> and it gave Russia a way to supply its armies in Central Europe by sea, rather than overland through Poland.

On 15 May Russia and Prussia formally ended their war with the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], confirming Prussia's pre-war borders in the north and east. Peter went on to mediate the 22 May [[Treaty of Hamburg (1762)|Treaty of Hamburg]], ending the Pomeranian War between Prussia and Sweden, with all of Prussia's Pomeranian territory preserved. After signing a new alliance with Prussia on 1 June, he even placed Chernyshev's corps of 18,000 Russian troops under Frederick's command; a second \"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg\" had occurred.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=457\u2013460}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, French morale had been sapped by prolonged British blockades, defeats in [[French and Indian War|North America]] and [[Third Carnatic War|India]], and a lack of progress in the Rhineland.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=498}}</ref><ref name=\"Fraser 469\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=469}}</ref> After Russia's about-face and Sweden's withdrawal, King Louis realised that France was unlikely to gain its promised reward of the Austrian Netherlands.

Since France had never formally declared war on Prussia, he agreed to a ceasefire with Frederick and evacuated Prussia's territories in the Rhineland, ending France's involvement in the war in Germany.<ref>{{Harvp|Mitford|Schillinger|2013|pp=242\u2013243}}</ref>\n\n====Final campaigns====\n[[File:Sachse 1750 bis 1850 pg63 Die Freiberger Schlacht am 29.

The Prussian army, swollen by forces recalled from the north and soon to be augmented by Chernyshev's Russians, could once again match the Austrians' strength in the field, and in June the Prussians marched again to contest Silesia.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=461}}</ref> However, on 9 July Peter was deposed and replaced by his wife, Empress Catherine II (later to be known as [[Catherine the Great]]); Catherine immediately withdrew from the alliance her husband had formed with Prussia, but she did not rejoin the war on the Austrian side.<ref name=\"Clark 204-5\"/>\n\nDespite the loss of their Russian auxiliaries, the Prussians engaged Daun's army on 21 July near [[Burkersdorf]], north-east of Schweidnitz.

The warring parties eventually agreed to simply restore their respective conquests to each other: Austria would withdraw from Glatz, restoring full Prussian control of Silesia, in exchange for Prussia's evacuation of Saxony, which would be returned to Frederick Augustus, who would receive no other reparations from Prussia. With these swaps, the borders in the region arrived precisely back at the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''.<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> Austria made a further concession by formally renouncing its claim to Silesia; in return, Prussia committed to support Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], in the forthcoming [[1764 Imperial election]].

Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia,<ref>{{Harvp|Browning|2005|p=530}}</ref> which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]] and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]]. It was the last of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThis conflict can be viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War|First]] and [[Second Silesian War]]s of the previous decade. After the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Austria enacted broad reforms and [[Diplomatic Revolution|upended its traditional diplomatic policy]] to prepare for renewed war with Prussia. As with the previous Silesian Wars, no particular triggering event initiated the conflict; rather, Prussia struck opportunistically to disrupt its enemies' plans. The war's cost in blood and treasure was high on both sides, and it ended inconclusively when neither of the main belligerents could sustain the conflict any longer.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] in mid-1756, and it ended in a Prussian diplomatic victory with the 1763 [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. The treaty resulted in no territorial changes, but Austria agreed to recognise Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia in return for Prussia's support for the election of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The conflict formed part of the ongoing [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry]] that would shape German politics for more than a century. The war greatly enhanced the prestige of Prussia, which won general recognition as a major European power, and of Frederick, who cemented his reputation as a preeminent military commander.\n\n==Context and causes==\n{{Further|First Silesian War|Second Silesian War}}\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|alt=Map of European political borders in 1756|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Brandenburg\u2013Prussia]] in violet and the Habsburg Monarchy in gold|upright=1.2]]\nWhile the [[Seven Years' War]] was a global conflict among many belligerents, its [[Central Europe]]an theatre turned on lingering grudges from the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1741\u20131748). The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], which had concluded the latter war, confirmed Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]]'s seizure of the region of [[Silesia]] from the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through two [[Silesian Wars]].<ref name=\"Fraser 202\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=202}}</ref> The defeated Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria nevertheless fully intended to retake the lost province and reassert Austria's hegemony in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; after peace was restored, she set about rebuilding her armed forces and seeking out new alliances.<ref>{{Harvp|Wilson|2016|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n===Unresolved conflicts===\nThough [[Early modern France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] recognised Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria ultimately refused to ratify the agreement, and Maria Theresa's husband, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], withheld the Holy Roman Empire's guarantee for Prussian control of the contested province. Prussia, in turn, still withheld its assent to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], thus challenging Maria Theresa's legitimacy as head of the Habsburg Monarchy.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/> Despite dynastic links, British King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French, while Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion.<ref name=\"Shennan 49\">{{Harvp|Shennan|2005|p=49}}</ref> The political and diplomatic conditions that had led to the previous Silesian Wars still held, and further conflict seemed likely.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/>\n\nIn 1746 Maria Theresa formed a defensive agreement with Elizabeth known as the [[Treaty of Two Empresses]], which aligned [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. In 1750 Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact in return for guarantees of Austrian and Russian support in the case of a Prussian attack on the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which George also ruled in [[personal union]].<ref name=\"Shennan 49\"/> At the same time, Maria Theresa, who had been disappointed with Britain's performance as [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|her ally]] in the War of the Austrian Succession, followed the controversial advice of her Chancellor [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] by pursuing warmer relations with Austria's [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|longstanding rival]], the Kingdom of France.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic Revolution===\nBritain elevated tensions in 1755 by offering to finance the deployment of a Russian army that would stand ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the Austrian coalition by allaying King George's concern for Hanover. On 16 January 1756 Prussia and Britain agreed to the [[Convention of Westminster]], under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian alliance]] and incensed the French court.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=297\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nAustria was now seeking warmer relations with France to ensure that the French would not take Prussia's side in a future conflict over Silesia. King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new [[Franco-Austrian alliance]], formalised with the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] in May 1756. This series of political manoeuvres came to be known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvp|Horn|1957|pp=449\u2013464}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Black|1990|pp=301\u2013323}}</ref> Russia, likewise upset by the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As France turned against Prussia and Russia separated from Britain, Kaunitz's plan thus matured into a grand anti-Prussian alliance between Austria, Russia, various lesser German powers, and France.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n===Preparations for war===\n[[File:Crown of Bohemia 1648.png|thumb|alt=Map of political borders in Central Europe in the early 1700s|Map of the [[Central Europe]]an region, prior to Prussia's seizure of Silesia, where the bulk of the war was fought]]\nAs Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757. Rather than wait for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to act preemptively, beginning with an attack against the neighbouring [[Electorate of Saxony]], which he correctly believed was a secret party to the coalition against him.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=310}}</ref> Frederick's broad strategy had three parts. First, he meant to occupy Saxony, gaining [[strategic depth]] and using the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into [[Bohemia]], where he might set up winter quarters and supply his army at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at [[Olm\u00fctz]], and advance on [[Vienna]] to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey 427\">{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=427}}</ref> He hoped to receive financial support from the British, who had also promised to send a naval squadron into the [[Baltic Sea]] to defend Prussia's coast against Russia, if necessary.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=308}}</ref>\n\nTo begin, Frederick divided Prussia's armies in three. He placed a force of 20,000 under [[Field Marshal]] [[Hans von Lehwaldt]] in [[East Prussia]] to guard against any Russian invasion from the east, with a reserve of 8,000 standing in [[Farther Pomerania]]; Russia should have been able to bring irresistible force to bear against East Prussia, but the King trusted to the slowness and disorganisation of the Russian army to defend his north-eastern flank. He also stationed Field Marshal Count [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] in Silesia with 25,000 men to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary. Finally, in August 1756 he personally led the main Prussian army of around 60,000 into Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=317\u2013318}}</ref>\n\n===Methods and technologies===\n{{Further|Early modern warfare}}\nEuropean warfare in the [[early modern period]] was characterised by the widespread adoption of [[firearm]]s in combination with more traditional [[bladed weapons]]. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed [[infantry]] armed with [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock musket]]s and [[bayonet]]s. [[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick's theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals.<ref>{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=67\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe Silesian Wars and most European wars of the eighteenth century were fought as so-called [[cabinet wars]] in which disciplined [[regular armies]] were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|209}}</ref> [[Military logistics]] was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised [[Supply depot|magazines]] and distributed by [[baggage train]]s that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids.<ref>{{Harvp|Creveld|1977|pp=26\u201328}}</ref> Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established [[Cantonment|winter quarters]] in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.<ref name=\"Black 38\"/>\n\n==Course==\n===1756===\n====Invasion of Saxony====\n[[File:Map for the Silesian and Seven Years Wars.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Central Europe with coloured territories|The Central European borders of Brandenburg\u2013Prussia (blue-green) and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (red) in 1756, at the outbreak of the Third Silesian War|upright=1.2]]\nPrussian troops crossed the Saxon frontier on 29 August 1756.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=198\u2013199}}</ref> The Prussian army marched in three columns: on the right were about 15,000 men under the command of [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]; on the left were 18,000 men under the command of the [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Bevern|Duke of Brunswick-Bevern]]; in the centre was Frederick himself, with Field Marshal [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]] commanding a corps of 30,000 troops. Prince Ferdinand was to advance on the town of [[Chemnitz]] and proceed to [[Leipzig]], while Bevern was to traverse [[Lusatia]] to seize [[Bautzen]]. Meanwhile, Frederick and Keith would advance through [[Torgau]] to attack the Saxon capital at [[Dresden]].<ref name=\"Asprey 427\"/><ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=317}}</ref> Saxony and Austria were unprepared for Frederick's preemptive strike, and their forces were scattered; as Prussians streamed into the Electorate, the main Saxon army fortified itself at [[Pirna]], and the Prussians occupied Dresden on 9 September against little resistance.<ref>{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=428}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=318\u2013319}}</ref>\n\nFrederick and the main Prussian army pressed on into northern Bohemia, looking to engage the Austrians under General [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne]] before they could join forces with the Saxons. Browne took up a defensible position by the village of [[Lobositz]], where the two forces fought the [[Battle of Lobositz]] on 1 October.<ref>{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|pp=430\u2013438}}</ref> The engagement ended inconclusively, with the Austrians inflicting significant losses on the Prussians and then retreating in good order; Frederick thus prevented Browne from reinforcing the isolated Saxons, but Browne stopped Frederick's advance into Bohemia.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=324}}</ref> Turning back to the north, the Prussians fully occupied Saxony, even taking [[Augustus III of Poland|Prince-Elector Frederick Augustus II]] of Saxony prisoner, although he was allowed to withdraw to his other realms on 18 October.

In early October a Russian corps under General [[Gottlob Heinrich Tottleben]] advanced through Neumark and joined Lacy's Austrians in briefly [[Raid on Berlin|occupying Berlin]], where they demanded ransoms, seized arsenals and freed prisoners of war. However, the Russians soon pulled back to Frankfurt an der Oder for want of supplies,<ref name=\"Stone 74\"/> while Lacy's force moved south to support Daun as he sought a decisive engagement with Frederick in Saxony.<ref>{{Harvp|Duffy|1974|p=194}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Szabo|2008|p=293}}</ref>\n\nThe main Prussian and Austrian armies under Frederick, Daun and Lacy finally faced each other on 3 November near Torgau, where the succeeding [[Battle of Torgau]] proved very costly for both sides. In the end the Prussians controlled the field and claimed victory, but both armies were badly weakened and soon retreated to winter quarters. Prussia's [[pyrrhic victory]] at Torgau resulted in few strategic gains, since Daun still controlled Dresden, and Laudon's army still had the run of Silesia;<ref name=\"Duffy 196\">{{Harvp|Duffy|1974|p=196}}</ref> the Prussian currency had to again be devalued over the winter to stabilise the army's finances.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=424}}</ref> On the other hand, the Austrians, who had hoped to decide the war once and for all at Torgau, were bitterly disappointed to have suffered still another defeat at the hands of a smaller Prussian force, and Maria Theresa's deteriorating finances were beginning to constrain the Austrian war effort. The battle left the war-making capacity of both sides so depleted that neither retained any realistic prospect of bringing the Silesian War to a decisive close without outside help.<ref name=\"Duffy 196\"/>\n\n===1761===\n====Dwindling resources==== \nBy early 1761 neither side retained the men or supplies needed to mount a major offensive. Prussia could field only 104,000 troops, many of them raw recruits, and there were shortages of even basic supplies like muskets for the infantry. The Prussian army was no longer fit for the sort of aggressive manoeuvers that had previously characterised Frederick's tactics,<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|pp=427\u2013428}}</ref> and the kingdom's situation was desperate.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=491}}</ref> Daun, the chief Austrian commander, also ruled out major offensives for the year and made no plans to even attempt to reconquer Silesia, preferring to concentrate his efforts in Saxony against Prince Henry. Austria's finances were in a state of chaos, and its economy was choked by heavy war taxes. Cooperation between Russian and Austrian forces was breaking down, as the two allied powers grew less willing to pursue each other's goals in the field.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|pp=429\u2013431}}</ref>\n\n====Russian advances====\n[[File:Fall of Kolberg in 1761.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of ragged Prussian soldiers retreating through a winter landscape after abandoning Kolberg|Defeated Prussians withdrawing as Russians [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|take control of Kolberg]], as depicted by Alexander von Kotzebue|upright=1.2]]\nRussian Marshal [[Alexander Buturlin]], the new commander of Russia's forces in the theatre, coordinated with Laudon's Austrians to begin an advance in southern Silesia in April.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=435}}</ref> The Prussian garrison under General [[Karl Christoph von der Goltz]] dug in around Schweidnitz, while field armies under Frederick, Laudon and Buturlin engaged in a prolonged campaign of manoeuver with no major engagements. The allies ended the campaign with a modest victory by storming the fortress at Schweidnitz on 1 October, after which the Prussians fell back to winter quarters in northern Silesia and Brandenburg.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=452}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces under [[Zakhar Chernyshev]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] had [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|besieged and blockaded]] the Prussian Pomeranian port of [[Kolberg]] beginning on 22 August. The town was strongly defended and held out well, but several Prussian attempts to break the siege were unsuccessful. In October Frederick ordered much of the garrison to withdraw to Berlin and defend Brandenburg; the weakened town finally capitulated on 16 December. The fall of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea,<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=492}}</ref> and it gave Russia a way to supply its armies in Central Europe by sea, rather than overland through Poland. The resulting benefits to Russian logistics threatened to tip the balance of power decisively against Prussia the following year.<ref>{{Harvp|Stone|2006|p=75}}</ref>\n\n===1762===\n====The \"second miracle\"====\nAs 1762 began, the Prussian armies had dwindled to only 60,000 men, and it was doubtful whether they could prevent a renewed Russian and Austrian advance to Berlin. A total Prussian collapse seemed imminent; the British now threatened to withdraw their subsidies if Prussia did not offer concessions to secure peace, a threat that was made good later that year by the new British prime minister, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]].<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=472}}</ref> Then, on 5 January 1762 the ailing Russian Empress Elizabeth died. Her nephew and successor, Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], was an ardent admirer of Frederick's, and he at once reversed Elizabeth's foreign policy and ordered a [[ceasefire]] with Prussia.<ref name=\"Clark 204-5\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=204\u2013205}}</ref>\n\nPeter agreed to an [[armistice]] with Prussia in March and lifted the Russian occupation of East Prussia and Pomerania, redirecting his armies to [[Mecklenburg]] to threaten [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]] with war over his claims on the [[Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp]]. On 15 May Russia and Prussia formally ended their war with the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], confirming Prussia's pre-war borders in the north and east. Peter went on to mediate the 22 May [[Treaty of Hamburg (1762)|Treaty of Hamburg]], ending the Pomeranian War between Prussia and Sweden, with all of Prussia's Pomeranian territory preserved. After signing a new alliance with Prussia on 1 June, he even placed Chernyshev's corps of 18,000 Russian troops under Frederick's command; a second \"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg\" had occurred.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=457\u2013460}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, French morale had been sapped by prolonged British blockades, defeats in [[French and Indian War|North America]] and [[Third Carnatic War|India]], and a lack of progress in the Rhineland.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=498}}</ref><ref name=\"Fraser 469\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=469}}</ref> After Russia's about-face and Sweden's withdrawal, King Louis realised that France was unlikely to gain its promised reward of the Austrian Netherlands. Austria was virtually bankrupt, and without French subsidies Maria Theresa could not afford a new invasion of Silesia; with France similarly exhausted, Louis was no longer willing to finance his ally's war. Since France had never formally declared war on Prussia, he agreed to a ceasefire with Frederick and evacuated Prussia's territories in the Rhineland, ending France's involvement in the war in Germany.<ref>{{Harvp|Mitford|Schillinger|2013|pp=242\u2013243}}</ref>\n\n====Final campaigns====\n[[File:Sachse 1750 bis 1850 pg63 Die Freiberger Schlacht am 29.

The Prussian army, swollen by forces recalled from the north and soon to be augmented by Chernyshev's Russians, could once again match the Austrians' strength in the field, and in June the Prussians marched again to contest Silesia.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=461}}</ref> However, on 9 July Peter was deposed and replaced by his wife, Empress Catherine II (later to be known as [[Catherine the Great]]); Catherine immediately withdrew from the alliance her husband had formed with Prussia, but she did not rejoin the war on the Austrian side.<ref name=\"Clark 204-5\"/>\n\nDespite the loss of their Russian auxiliaries, the Prussians engaged Daun's army on 21 July near [[Burkersdorf]], north-east of Schweidnitz. Frederick persuaded Chernyshev to support the attack, not by actually fighting, but merely by remaining in the area and presenting a potential threat to the Austrians. The resulting Prussian victory in the [[Battle of Burkersdorf]] led to the recovery of most of Silesia from Austrian control.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carlyle|year=1865b|volume=Book XX|title=Chapter XI \u2013 Seventh Campaign Opens|pages=289\u2013299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8IUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA289}}</ref> Daun's forces withdrew to Glatz, and the Prussians [[Siege of Schweidnitz (1762)|besieged Schweidnitz]], recapturing it at length on 9 October.

The warring powers in Central Europe had essentially fought to a stalemate. Prussia's finances were stable, but the country had been devastated by battle and enemy occupation, and its manpower was spent.<ref>{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=343}}</ref> Austria was facing a severe financial crisis and had to reduce the size of its army, greatly decreasing its offensive power; without Russian troops or French subsidies, it had little hope of reconquering Silesia.<ref>{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=345}}</ref> The other belligerents in the wider Seven Years' War had already begun peace talks; now, negotiators from Austria, Prussia and Saxony convened on 30 December at [[Hubertusburg]] palace, near the front lines in Saxony, to discuss terms of peace.<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/><ref name=\"Carlyle XX-XIII\">{{Cite book|last=Carlyle|year=1865b|volume=Book XX|title=Chapter XIII \u2013 Peace of Hubertsburg|pages=329\u2013332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8IUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA329}}</ref>\n\n===1763===\n====Treaty of Hubertusburg====\nFrederick had earlier considered offering East Prussia to Russia in return for Peter's support for his seizure of Saxony, but Catherine's withdrawal meant that Russia was no longer a belligerent and did not participate in the negotiations. The warring parties eventually agreed to simply restore their respective conquests to each other: Austria would withdraw from Glatz, restoring full Prussian control of Silesia, in exchange for Prussia's evacuation of Saxony, which would be returned to Frederick Augustus, who would receive no other reparations from Prussia. With these swaps, the borders in the region arrived precisely back at the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''.<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> Austria made a further concession by formally renouncing its claim to Silesia; in return, Prussia committed to support Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], in the forthcoming [[1764 Imperial election]]. With that, the belligerents agreed to end the Third Silesian War with the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], signed 15 February 1763.<ref name=\"Carlyle XX-XIII\"/>\n\n==Outcomes==\n[[File:Johann Esaias Nilson Hubertusburger Frieden ubs G 0335 II.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving of the faces of the monarchs who participated in the Third Silesian War set against an allegorical scene representing the return of peace|Contemporary engraving celebrating the restoration of peace in Germany, by [[Johannes Esaias Nilson]]|upright=1.2]]\nThe return to territorial ''status quo ante'' meant that none of the belligerents in the Silesian War gained the prizes they had aimed at: Prussia was unable to keep any part of Saxony, while Austria failed to recover its lost province of Silesia. Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia,<ref>{{Harvp|Browning|2005|p=530}}</ref> which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars. More fundamentally, Prussia showed itself to be a credible [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|rival to Austria]] by successfully surviving intact what could have become a war of partition.<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\"/><ref name=\"Fraser 469\"/><ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/>\n\n===Prussia===\nPrussia emerged from the war as a new European [[great power]],<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> establishing itself as the leading power of Protestant Germany.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=215\u2013219}}</ref> The kingdom won general recognition of its sovereignty in Silesia, putting a stop to Austria's attempts to recover the province. Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debts to fortune (Russia's about-face after Elizabeth's death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memories of his energetic leadership and tactical successes were strenuously kept alive.<ref name=\"Marston 90\">{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=90}}</ref> Prussia had held its own while being simultaneously invaded by Austria, Russia, Sweden, and France, an accomplishment that appeared miraculous to contemporary observers.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=200}}</ref> After 1763, armies around the world sent their officers to Prussia to learn the secrets of the state's outsize military power, making Prussia one of the most imitated states in Europe.<ref name=\"Marston 90\"/>\n\nThough sometimes depicted as a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war nonetheless left the kingdom's economy and population devastated, and much of the remainder of Frederick's reign was spent repairing the damage. To mitigate population losses, the King continued his [[Salzburg Protestants|father's policy]] of encouraging Protestant refugees from Catholic realms to resettle in Prussia.<ref name=\"Clark 212\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=212\u2013214}}</ref> The repeated currency devaluations imposed to finance the conflict had led to rapid [[inflation]] and great economic disruption in Prussia (and in Saxony).<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=425}}</ref> After the war the state began using its network of military grain depots and the [[excise]] on grains to stabilize food prices and alleviate grain shortages. Prussia also established a rudimentary [[social welfare]] system for impoverished and disabled veterans of the Silesian Wars.<ref name=\"Clark 212\"/>\n\nPrussia's armed forces had experienced heavy casualties in the war, with around 180,000 men killed,<ref name=\"Clodfelter\"/> and the officer corps was severely depleted.

In 1806 the Prussians were shattered by [[Napoleon]]'s French at the [[Battle of Jena]]; only after a series of reforms motivated by the disasters of 1806\u20131807 did Prussian military power again begin to grow.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=313}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\nThe war exhausted Austria's finances, and its armed forces were greatly weakened, with more than 145,000 men dead or missing in the conflict.<ref name=\"Clodfelter\"/> Austria was not able to retake Silesia or realise any other territorial gains, but it did preserve Saxony from Prussian control, slowing the growth of its new northern rival. Its military performed far more respectably than during the War of the Austrian Succession, which seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms since that war. Thus, the war in great part restored Austria's prestige and preserved its position as a major player in the European system.<ref name=\"Clark 216\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=216}}</ref> By agreeing to vote for Archduke Joseph in the Imperial election, Frederick accepted the continuation of Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire, though this was far less than Austria had hoped to win in the war.<ref>{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=346}}</ref>\n\nPrussia's confirmation as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and army were long-term threats to Austria's hegemony in Germany.<ref name=\"Clark 216\"/>  The Holy Roman Empire held several ambitious middle powers eager to take advantage of Austria's resulting debt and loss of prestige. Frederick Augustus of Saxony was also King of Poland and could call on the resources of that realm to advance his interests in Germany. The Electorate of Hanover had gained tremendously through its personal union with Great Britain and could now bring British power to bear in German conflicts. [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]]'s strength was also waxing, as it asserted military and foreign policies ever more independent from those of the Empire. The Silesian Wars made clear that the Habsburg Monarchy would need continued reform if it was to retain its dominant position in European power politics.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=212}}</ref> Austria's defeat by Prussia would become the driving factor behind wide-ranging efforts to modernise the Habsburg Monarchy over the next half century.<ref>{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=267}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Fred|author-link=Fred Anderson (historian)|title=Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754\u20131766|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York|year=2000|isbn=978-0-375-70636-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyuMqKzZJnUC|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Asprey|first=Robert B.|author-link=Robert B.

It was overshadowed in the public consciousness by the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]'s role during [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940, but the Hurricane inflicted 60 percent of the losses sustained by the [[Luftwaffe]] in the engagement, and fought in all the major theatres of the Second World War.\n\nThe Hurricane originated from discussions between RAF officials and aircraft designer Sir [[Sydney Camm]] about a proposed [[monoplane]] derivative of the [[Hawker Fury]] [[biplane]] in the early 1930s. Despite an institutional preference for biplanes and lack of interest from the [[Air Ministry]], Hawker refined their monoplane proposal, incorporating several innovations which became critical to wartime fighter aircraft, including retractable [[landing gear]] and the more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine. The Air Ministry ordered Hawker's ''Interceptor Monoplane'' in late 1934, and the prototype Hurricane ''K5083'' performed its [[maiden flight]] on 6 November 1935.\n\nIn June 1936, the Hurricane went into production for the Air Ministry; it entered squadron service on 25 December 1937. Its manufacture and maintenance was eased by using conventional construction methods so that squadrons could perform many major repairs without external support. The Hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when the RAF had 18 Hurricane-equipped squadrons in service. The aircraft was relied on to defend against German aircraft operated by the Luftwaffe, including [[dogfight]]ing with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s in multiple theatres of action.\n\nThe Hurricane was developed through several versions, into bomber-interceptors, [[fighter-bomber]]s, and [[Attack aircraft|ground support]] aircraft as well as fighters. Versions designed for the [[Royal Navy]] known as the '''Sea Hurricane''' had modifications enabling operation from ships. Some were converted as catapult-launched convoy escorts. By the end of production in July 1944, 14,487 Hurricanes had been completed in Britain, Canada, Belgium and Yugoslavia.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nDuring the era in which the [[Hawker Aircraft]] company developed the Hurricane, [[RAF Fighter Command]] comprised just 13 squadrons, equipped with the [[Hawker Fury]], [[Hawker Hart#Demon|Hawker Demon]], or the [[Bristol Bulldog]], all [[biplane]]s furnished with fixed-[[Blade pitch|pitch]] wooden propellers and non-retractable undercarriages.<ref name=\"Bader\">Bader 2004, p. 36.</ref><ref name=\"mason 3\">Mason 1967, p. 3.</ref> At the time, there was an institutional reluctance towards change within the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]]; according to aviation author Francis K. Mason, some senior figures were prejudiced against the adoption of [[monoplane]] fighter aircraft, while mid-level officers were typically approachable on the subject and design concepts that made use of such configurations.<ref name=\"mason 3\" />\n\nIn 1934, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[List of Air Ministry specifications#1930\u20131939|Specification F.7/30]] in response to demands within the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) for a new generation of [[fighter aircraft]]. Earlier, during 1933, British aircraft designer [[Sydney Camm]] had conducted discussions with Major John Buchanan of the Directorate of Technical Development on a monoplane based on the existing Fury.<ref name=\"mason 3 4\">Mason 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Mason attributes Camm's discussions with figures within the RAF, such as Squadron Leader [[Ralph Sorley]], as having provoked the specification and some of its details, such as the preference for armaments being installed within the wings instead of within the aircraft's nose.<ref name=\"mason 4\">Mason 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nCamm's initial submission in response to F.7/30, the [[Hawker P.V.3]], was essentially a scaled-up version of the Fury biplane.<ref>Mason 1992, p. 242.</ref> However, the P.V.3 was not among the proposals which the Air Ministry had selected to be constructed as a government-sponsored prototype. After the rejection of the P.V.3 proposal, Camm commenced work upon a new design involving a [[cantilever]] monoplane arrangement, complete with a fixed undercarriage, armed with four machine guns and powered by the [[Rolls-Royce Goshawk]] engine. The original 1934 armament specifications for what would evolve into the Hurricane were for a similar armament fitment to the [[Gloster Gladiator]]: four machine-guns, two in the wings and two in the fuselage, [[Synchronization gear|synchronised]] to fire through the propeller arc. By January 1934, the proposal's detail drawings had been finished, but these failed to impress the Air Ministry enough for a prototype to be ordered.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 30.</ref>\n\nCamm's response to this rejection was to further develop the design, during which a retractable undercarriage was introduced and the unsatisfactory Goshawk engine was replaced by a new Rolls-Royce design, initially designated as the ''PV-12'', which went on to become famous as the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] engine. In August 1934, a one-tenth scale model of the design was produced and dispatched to the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] at [[Teddington]]. A series of [[wind tunnel]] tests confirmed the aerodynamic qualities of the aircraft were in order, and in September 1934, Camm again approached the Air Ministry. This time, the Ministry's response was favourable, and a prototype of the \"Interceptor Monoplane\" was promptly ordered.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Prototype and trials===\n[[File:Hurricane mockup.jpg|thumb|right|An early mock-up for the Hurricane's fuselage, showing side fuselage-mounted [[Synchronization gear|synchronised]] machine gun, like earlier British biplane fighters.]]\nIn July 1934 at a meeting chaired by Air Commodore Tedder, Air Ministry Science Office [[Frederick William Hill|Captain F.W. (\"Gunner\") Hill]] presented his calculation showing that future fighters must carry no fewer than eight machine guns, each capable of firing 1,000 shots a minute.<ref>Keith CH. ''I Hold My Aim''. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London, 1946</ref> Hill's assistant in making his calculations was his teenage daughter. Of the decision to place eight machine guns in fighters, [[Claude Hilton Keith|Keith]] says 'The battle was brisk and was carried into very high quarters before the implementing authority was given. My Branch had made out a sound case for 8-gun fighters and if this recommendation had not been accepted and we had been content with half-measures, it might indeed have gone ill for us during the late summer of 1940'. Present at the meeting was Squadron Leader Ralph Sorley of the Air Ministry's Operational Requirements branch, who played an important role in the decision. In November 1934, the Air Ministry issued Specification F.5/34 which called for new fighter aircraft to be armed with a total of eight guns. However, by this time, work had progressed too far to immediately modify the planned four-gun installation. By January 1935, a wooden mock-up had been finished, and although a number of suggestions for detail changes were made, construction of the prototype was approved, and a new specification (F.36/34) was written around the design. In July 1935, this specification was amended to include installation of eight guns.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 40.</ref><ref name=\"mason 4\" />\n\nBy the end of August 1935, work on the airframe had been completed at Hawker's [[Kingston upon Thames]] facility and the aircraft components were transported to [[Brooklands]], [[Surrey]], where Hawker had an assembly shed; on 23 October 1935, the prototype was fully re-assembled.<ref name=\"mason 4\" /> Ground testing and taxi trials took place over the following two weeks. On 6 November 1935, the prototype ''K5083'' took to the air for the [[maiden flight|first time]] at the hands of Hawker's chief [[test pilot]], [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[George Bulman (pilot)|George Bulman]].<ref name=greatac>Cacutt 1989, pp. 204\u2013212.</ref> Bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing; [[Philip Lucas]] flew some of the experimental test flights, while [[John Stuart Hindmarsh|John Hindmarsh]] conducted the firm's production flight trials.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 37, 40.</ref> As completed, the prototype had been fitted with [[ballast]] to represent the aircraft's armament prior to the acceptance of the final multi-gun wing armament.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Francis K. |date=1962 |title=The Hawker Hurricane |location=London |publisher=MacDonald |page=21 }}</ref>\n\nBy March 1936, the prototype had completed ten flying hours, covering all major portions of the flight envelope. Early testing had gone reasonably well, especially in light of the trial status of the Merlin engine, which had yet to achieve full flight certification at this time and thus severe restrictions had been imposed upon use of the engine.<ref name=\"mason 4\" /> In early 1936, the prototype was transferred to [[RAF Martlesham Heath]], [[Suffolk]], to participate in initial service trials under the direction of squadron leader D.&nbsp;F. Anderson. Sammy Wroath, later to be the founding Commandant of the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]], was the RAF test pilot for the Hurricane: his report was favourable, stating that: \"The aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices\" and proceeded to praise its control response.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 52.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hawker Hurricane before maiden flight 1935.jpg|thumb|''K5083'', the prototype, photographed before its first flight in November 1935]]\nIn the course of RAF trials, despite the Merlin engine proving to be problematic, having suffered numerous failures and necessitating several changes, enthusiastic reports were produced in the aircraft and its performance figures. The trials had observed the aircraft to possess a maximum level speed of 315&nbsp;mph at an altitude of 16,200&nbsp;ft, a time-to-climb to an altitude of 15,000&nbsp;ft from takeoff of 5.7 minutes, and a stalling speed of 57&nbsp;mph (only marginally higher than the Gladiator biplane), the last achieved using its [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]].<ref name=\"mason 4\" />\n\nIn the course of further testing, it was found that the Hurricane had poor [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]] recovery characteristics, in which all [[rudder]] authority could be lost due to shielding of the rudder.<ref name=\"mason 5\" /> Hawker's response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived, but the Air Ministry refused the request;<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 64.</ref> the situation was resolved by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage, and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] and extension of the bottom of the rudder. This discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft, but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.<ref>Mason 1992, p. 254.</ref>\n\nIn early 1936, the Hawker [[Board of Directors]] had decided, in the absence of official authorisation and at company expense, to proceed with issuing the design drawings to the production design office and to commence tooling-up for a production line capable of producing a batch of 1,000 Hurricanes.<ref>\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines \u2013 5th edition\" by [[Bill Gunston]], Sutton Publishing, 2006, p. 188.</ref><ref name=\"mason 4 5\">Mason 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Women assembling Hawker Hurricanes 1942.jpg|thumb|Hurricane production line, 1942]]\n[[File:Royal Air Force Training Command, 1939-1940. C851.jpg|thumb|Trainee aircraft fitters working on instructional partly-assembled Hurricanes, circa 1939\u20131940]]\nIn June 1936, the Hurricane was formally ordered into production, the Air Ministry having placed its first order that month for 600 aircraft.<ref name=\"mason 5\" /> On 26 June 1936, the type name \"Hurricane\", which had been proposed by Hawker, was approved by the Air Ministry; an informal christening ceremony for the aircraft was carried out during the following month during an official visit by [[King Edward VIII]] to Martlesham Heath.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201976.html \"The King Inspects his Air Force.\"] [[Flight International|''Flight'']], 16 July 1936.</ref><ref name=\"mason 5\">Mason 1967, p. 5.</ref>\n\nA key reason for the aircraft's appeal was its relatively simple construction and ease of manufacture. In comparison to the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], it was significantly cheaper and involved less labour, requiring 10,300 man hours to produce versus 15,200 for the Spitfire.<ref name=\"postan\">Postan 1952, p. Chapter IV, footnote 89.</ref> As a large-scale war was looking increasingly likely, and time was of the essence in providing the RAF with an effective fighter aircraft, it was unclear if the more advanced Spitfire would enter production smoothly, while the Hurricane made use of well-understood manufacturing techniques.<ref name=\"postan\" /> This factor was equally applicable for its use within service squadrons as well, which were experienced in working on and repairing aircraft whose construction employed the same principles as the Hurricane, and the simplicity of its design enabled the improvisation of some remarkable repairs in squadron workshops.<ref name=\"postan\" /> A fabric-covered wing patterned upon traditional Hawker designs was initially adopted in order to speed up production; a higher-performing stressed-skin metal wing took its place in late 1939.<ref name=\"mason 5\" />\n\nOn 12 October 1937, the maiden flight took place of the first production Hurricane I, which was powered by a Merlin II engine and flown by Flight Lieutenant Philip Lucas. Production deliveries had been delayed by roughly six months due to a decision to equip the Hurricane only with the improved Merlin II engine, while the earlier Merlin I had been prioritised for the [[Fairey Battle]] and the [[Hawker Henley]].<ref name=\"mason 5\" /> By the following December, the first four aircraft to enter service with the RAF had joined [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|No. 111 Squadron]], stationed at [[RAF Northolt]]. By February 1938, No. 111 Squadron had received 16 Hurricanes.<ref name=\"mason 5\" /> Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, over 550 Hurricanes had been produced, which had equipped a total of 18 squadrons, while a further 3,500 aircraft were on order.<ref>Bader 2004, p. 41.</ref><ref name=\"mason 7\" />\n\nDuring 1940, [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who was the [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], established an organisation in which a number of manufacturers were seconded to repair and overhaul battle-damaged Hurricanes. The [[Civilian Repair Organisation]] also overhauled battle-weary aircraft, which were later sent to training units or to other air forces; one of the factories involved was the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Aero Company]]'s [[Cofton Hackett#Austin Aero Works|Cofton Hackett plant]]. Another was David Rosenfield Ltd, based at [[Barton-upon-Irwell|Barton]] aerodrome near [[Manchester]].\n\nA major manufacturer of the Hurricane was [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] at their factory in [[Fort William, Ontario]], Canada. The facility's chief engineer, [[Elsie MacGill]], became known as the \"Queen of the Hurricanes\".<ref name=\"mason 7\" /> The initiative was commercially led rather than governmentally, but was endorsed by the British government; Hawker, having recognised that a major conflict was all but inevitable after the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Crisis]] of 1938, drew up preliminary plans to expand Hurricane production via a new factory in Canada. Under this plan, samples, pattern aircraft, and a complete set of design documents stored on [[microfilm]], were shipped to Canada; the RCAF ordered 20 Hurricanes to equip one fighter squadron and two more were supplied to Canadian Car and Foundry as pattern aircraft but one probably did not arrive, while the other was sent back to Britain in 1940. The first Hurricane built at Canadian Car and Foundry was officially produced in February 1940.<ref name=\"mason 7\" /> As a result, Canadian-built Hurricanes were shipped to Britain to participate in events such as the [[Battle of Britain]].<ref name=\"mason 7\" />\n\nOverall, some 14,487 Hurricanes and Sea Hurricanes were produced in England and Canada.<ref name=\"Thetford 1994, p. 232\">Thetford 1994, p. 232</ref><!--page ref may be wrong since I have 1982 edition-->{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=It would be nice to know how many fighters versus fighter-bombers versus other variants.

The Austin Aero Company completed 300 Hurricanes.

Recognising that the supply of British-made Merlin engines might not be guaranteed, it was decided to fit one of the Yugoslavian Hurricanes with a [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]] engine instead; this aircraft was [[flight test|test flown]] in 1941.<ref name=\"mason 7\" /> In 1938, a contract for 80 Hurricanes was placed with Fairey's Belgian subsidiary [[Avions Fairey]] SA for the [[Belgian Air Force]]; it was intended to arm these aircraft with an arrangement of four 13.2&nbsp;mm [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]]. Three were built and two flown with this armament by the time of the ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' in May 1940, with at least 12 more constructed by Avions Fairey armed with the conventional eight rifle calibre machine gun armament.<ref name=\"Half pt 4 p34\">''Air International'', July 1987, p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"mason 7\" />\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Hawker Hurricanes at Lille-Seclin - Royal Air Force 1939-1945 Fighter Command C460.jpg|thumb|right|Mk I in France, November 1939, showing original fabric-covered outer wing and two-bladed propeller]]\n[[File:hurricane in planform arp.jpg|thumb|Underside view of ''R4118'', a preserved Hurricane from the [[Battle of Britain]]]]\n\nThe Hawker Hurricane is a low-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] outfitted with retractable undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit for the pilot.<ref name = \"fli 38 468\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, p. 468.</ref> A clean, single-seat fighter, it was developed to provide a competent combatant for aerial combat against the latest fighter designs that were emerging amongst the air services of other powers of the era. The Hurricane was initially armed with an arrangement of eight remotely-operated wing-mounted Browning machine guns, intended for conducting rapid engagements.<ref name = \"fli 38 468 473\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, pp. 468, 473.</ref> The Hurricane was typically equipped for flying under both day and night conditions, being provided with navigation lights, Harley [[landing light]]s, complete blind-flying equipment, and two-way [[radio]]s. Upon its entry to service, much of the performance data was intentionally concealed from the general public, but it was known that the type possessed a speed range of 6:1.<ref name = \"fli 38 473\"/>\n\nThough faster and more advanced than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, the design of the Hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes.<ref name = \"fli 38 467 470\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, pp. 467\u2013470.</ref> Hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior.<ref name = \"fli 38 467 468\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, pp. 467, 468.</ref> The primary structure comprised a [[Warren truss]] box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel [[longerons]] and [[duralumin]] cross-bracing, which were mechanically fastened instead of [[welding|welded]].<ref name = \"fli 38 469\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, p. 469.</ref> Over this, a secondary structure composed of wooden [[former]]s and [[stringer (aircraft)|stringers]] gave the fuselage a rounded external shape, which carried a [[aircraft dope|doped]] [[linen]] covering. The majority of the external surfaces were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.<ref name = \"fli 38 469 470\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, pp. 469, 470.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, a simple steel tube structure in the nose of the fuselage was used to support the engine; detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the engine's areas for inspection or adjustment purposes.<ref name = \"fli 38 472\"/> Installed underneath the fuselage, the liquid-cooled radiator has a rectangular opening to its aft; this is covered by a hinged flap via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level. An atypical feature for the era was the use of [[UNS C69100|Tungum alloy]] pipes throughout the cooling system.<ref name = \"fli 38 472\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, p. 472.</ref>\n\nInitially, the structure of the Hurricane's [[cantilever]] wing consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness.<ref name = \"fli 38 469 471\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, pp. 469\u2013471.</ref> The wing was described by aviation publication [[Flight International|Flight]] as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical [[jig (tool)|jig]]s to attach the two spars, after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and rear spars. [[Hydraulics|Hydraulically]]-actuated split [[trailing edge]] [[flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s were present on the inner end of the wings.<ref name = \"fli 38 471\"/> The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its [[leading edge]]. The majority of the [[Flight control surfaces]], such as the Frise-type [[aileron]]s, also had fabric coverings.<ref name = \"fli 38 471\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, p. 471.</ref>\n\nAn all-metal, stressed-skin wing of [[duralumin]]ium (a DERD specification similar to AA2024) was introduced in April 1939 and was used for all of the later marks.<ref name=greatac /> \"The metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} higher than the fabric-covered ones. They were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings; one trials Hurricane, ''L1877'', was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing. The great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath.\"<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 12\">Hiscock 2003, p. 12.</ref> Several fabric-wing Hurricanes were still in service during the Battle of Britain, although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair.

A hydraulic jack served to actuate the undercarriage, with the carefully set \"pintle\" angle of the strut's upper ends assisting in the folding and pivoting the legs as to reposition the wheel unit rearwards as well as inwards in order to clear the front spar when retracted.<ref name = \"fli 38 472\"/> Two separate hydraulic systems, one being power-operated and the other hand-operated, are present for the deployment and retraction of the undercarriage; in the event of both failing, pilots can release the retaining catches holding the undercarriage in place, deploying the wheels to the 'down' position using weight alone. A wide wheel-track was used to allow for considerable stability during ground movements and to enable tight turns to be performed.<ref name = \"fli 38 471 472\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, pp. 471\u2013472.</ref>\n\nThe prototype and early production Hurricanes were fitted with a Watts two-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller. [[Flight International|''Flight'']] commented of this arrangement: \"Many have expressed surprise that the Hurricane is not fitted with variable-pitch airscrews\".<ref name = \"fli 38 473\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, p. 473.</ref> The original two-bladed propeller was found to be inefficient at low airspeeds and the aircraft required a long ground run to get airborne, which caused concern at Fighter Command. Accordingly, trials with a [[De Havilland]] [[variable-pitch propeller]] demonstrated a reduction in the Hurricane's take-off run from {{convert|1230|to|750|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

Apart from the new scale of speeds that the pilot had to adapt to, the Hurricane had all the qualities of its stable, secure biplane predecessor the [[Hawker Hart|Hart]], but enhanced by livelier controls, greater precision and all this performance.\n| source = <small>[[Roland Beamont]], a trainee pilot, describing his first flight in a Hurricane.<ref>Beamont January 1994, pp. 17, 18.</ref></small>\n| width = 26%\n}}\nCamm's priority was to provide the pilot with good all-round visibility. To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive \"hump-backed\" silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable \"[[stirrup]]\" mounted below the trailing edge of the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both [[wing root]]s were coated with strips of non-slip material.\n\nAn advantage of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding. Even if one of the steel tubes were damaged, the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield. Damage to a [[stressed skin]] structure, as used by the Spitfire, required more specialised equipment to repair.<ref>[http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/spits_and_canes.html \"Best of Battle of Britain.\"] ''[[Air & Space]],'' February\u2013March 2008, p. 4.</ref> The old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of Hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions. Crated Hurricanes were assembled at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] in West Africa and flown across the Sahara to the Middle East theatre and, to save space, some [[Royal Navy]] aircraft carriers carried their reserve Sea Hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies, which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed.\n\nIn contrast, the contemporary Spitfire used all-metal [[monocoque]] construction and was thus both lighter and stronger, though less tolerant to bullet damage. With its ease of maintenance, widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics, the Hurricane remained in use in theatres of operations where reliability, easy handling and a stable gun platform were more important than performance, typically in roles like ground attack. One of the design requirements of the original specification was that both the Hurricane and the Spitfire were also to be used as [[night fighter]]s. The Hurricane proved to be a relatively simple aircraft to fly at night, and shot down several German aircraft on night raids. From early 1941 the Hurricane was also used as an \"intruder\" aircraft, patrolling German airfields in France at night to catch bombers taking off or landing.\n\n==Operational history==\n===Pre-war===\n[[File:Hawker Hurricane Mk IV RP - prepared for presentation.jpg|thumb|Yugoslavian Hurricane Mark.

As a result, there were some modest export sales made to other countries; at the earliest opportunity, a former RAF Hurricane I was dispatched to [[Yugoslavia]] for evaluation purposes.<ref name=\"mason 6\" /> Shortly after this evaluation, an order for 24 Hurricane Mark Is for the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] was received; this was followed by the purchase of a [[Licensed production|production licence]] for the Hurricane by Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"mason 6 7\">Mason 1967, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Yugoslavia Hurricanes saw action against the [[Luftwaffe]] during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941 by the [[Axis powers]].<ref name=\"mason 7\">Mason 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nTo the end of August 1939 seven ex RAF Hurricanes had been sent to South Africa, while another 13 ex RAF Hurricanes were sent to Turkey, 13 Hurricanes had been built for Belgium, 21 for Canada including 1 as a pattern for [[Canadian Car and Foundry]], 1 for Iran, 1 for Poland, 3 for Romania and 12 for Yugoslavia. All the built for export aircraft were taken from the RAF order and so all originally had an RAF serial. Further exports were done in the final 4 months of 1939 and early 1940.\n\nHurricane production was increased as part of a plan to create a reserve of [[attrition warfare|attrition]] aircraft as well as re-equip existing squadrons and newly formed ones such as those of the [[Auxiliary Air Force]]. Expansion scheme E included a target of 500 fighters of all types by the start of 1938. By the time of the [[Munich Crisis]], there were only two fully operational RAF squadrons of the planned 12 to be equipped with Hurricanes.<ref>Shacklady 2000, pp. 47\u201349.</ref> By the time of the [[German invasion of Poland]] there were sixteen operational Hurricane squadrons as well as a further two more that were in the process of converting.<ref>John Foreman, ''Fighter Command War Diaries'' Vol 1 p. 14, Air Research Publications.</ref>\n\n===Phoney War===\n[[File:Hawker Hurricane at Lille-Seclin - Royal Air Force - France 1939-1940 C1512.jpg|thumb|Personnel of [[No. 85 Squadron RAF|85 Sqn]] next to a Hurricane I, [[Lille]], [[Nord (French department)|Seclin]], France, on 10 May 1940]]\n\nOwing to the Hurricane's rugged construction, ease of maintenance and repair in the field, and its docile landing and take-off characteristics, coupled with a wide-track undercarriage, it was selected to go to France as the principal RAF fighter.{{cn|date=July 2019|reason=or perhaps it was more expendable than the spitfire?}} Two Hurricane squadrons, [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1]] and [[No. 73 Squadron RAF|No. 73]], formed 67 Wing of the Advanced Air Striking Force, while two more, No. 85 [[No. 85 Squadron RAF|85 Sqn]] and No. 87, formed 60 Wing of the Air Component, BEF.\n\nWhile the two squadrons of No. 60 Wing had their Hurricanes painted in the standard colour scheme and markings of Home-based fighters, those of No. 67 Wing differed considerably. It was probably because No. 1 and No. 73 Squadrons were operating in close proximity to French fighter squadrons that these units painted Red, White and Blue stripes over the entire height of the rudders on their Hurricanes in a similar manner to the standard French AF National markings.\n\nAs the French squadrons were not familiar with the [British] use of code letters, and there could have been cause for error in aircraft identification, both Hurricane squadrons removed their Squadron identification letters, leaving the grey-painted aircraft letter aft of the [fuselage] roundel. The decision to adopt these special changes in markings seems to have been made at 67 Group HQ (the immediate command authority for the two squadrons involved) to suit local circumstances.<ref name=\"goulding 56\">Goulding 1971, p. 56.</ref>\n\nOn 24 August 1939, the British government gave orders partially to mobilise and [[No. 1 Group RAF]] ([[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Patrick Playfair]]) sent its ten Fairey Battle day-bomber squadrons to France, according to plans established by the British and French earlier in the year. The group was the first echelon of the [[RAF Advanced Air Striking Force]] (AASF) and flew from bases at Abingdon, Harwell, Benson, Boscombe Down and Bicester. The group HQ became the AASF when the order to move to France was received and the home station HQs, 71, 72 74\u201376 Wings.

As Galland has noted, the nature and style of the air battles over the beaches should have provided a warning as to the inherent weaknesses of the Luftwaffe's force structure. Admittedly, the Germans fought at a disadvantage. Although positioned forward at captured airfields, the Bf 109 was at the outer limits of its range and possessed less flying time over Dunkirk than did the \"Hurricanes\" and \"Spitfires\" operating from southern England. German bombers were still located in western Germany and had even farther to fly. Thus, the Luftwaffe could not bring its full weight to bear so that when its bombers hammered those on the beaches or embarking, the RAF intervened in a significant fashion. German aircraft losses were high, and British fighter attacks often prevented German bombers from performing with full effectiveness. Both sides suffered heavy losses. During the nine days from May 26 through June 3, the RAF lost 177 aircraft destroyed or damaged; the Germans lost 240. For much of the Luftwaffe, Dunkirk came as a nasty shock.

It was slightly slower than both the Spitfire I and II and the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, and the thicker wing profiles compromised acceleration; but it could out-turn both of them. In spite of its performance deficiencies against the Bf 109, the Hurricane was still capable of destroying the German fighter, especially at lower altitudes. The standard tactic of the 109s was to attempt to climb higher than the RAF fighters and \"bounce\" them in a dive; the Hurricanes could evade such tactics by turning into the attack or going into a \"corkscrew dive\", which the 109s, with their lower rate of roll, found hard to counter. If a 109 was caught in a dogfight, the Hurricane was just as capable of out-turning the 109 as the Spitfire.

In addition, the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat right in front of the instrument panel, without any form of protection for the pilot. Many Hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could burn through the instrument panel.

Britain's decision to aid the Soviets meant sending supplies by sea to the far northern ports, and as the convoys would need to sail within range of enemy air attack from the Luftwaffe based in neighbouring Finland, it was decided to deliver a number of Hurricane Mk IIBs, flying with [[No. 81 Squadron RAF|Nos. 81]] and [[No. 134 Squadron RAF|134 Squadrons]] of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]], to provide protection. Twenty-four were transported on the [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] ''[[HMS Argus (I49)|Argus]]'', arriving just off [[Murmansk]] on 28 August 1941, and another 15 crated aircraft on board merchant vessels. In addition to their convoy protection duties, the aircraft also acted as escorts to Russian bombers. (See ''[[Operation Benedict]]''.)\n\nEnemy attention to the area declined in October, at which point the RAF pilots trained their Soviet counterparts to operate the Hurricanes themselves. By the end of the year, the RAF's direct role in the region had ended, but the aircraft themselves remained behind and became the first of thousands of Allied aircraft that were accepted by the Soviet Union.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 135\u2013137.</ref> Although Soviet pilots were not universally enthusiastic about the Hurricane, twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] Lt.

First of all, it was 40\u201350&nbsp;km/h (25/31&nbsp;mph) slower than its main opponent, the Bf 109E interceptor, at low and medium height, and had a slower rate of climb. The Messerschmitt could outdive the Hurricane because of the thicker wing profile of the British fighter. But the main source of complaints was the Hurricane's armament. On occasion, the eight or 12 small-calibre machine guns did not damage the sturdy and heavily armoured German aircraft; consequently, Soviet ground crews started to remove the Brownings. Retaining only four or six of the 12 machine guns, two 12.7&nbsp;mm [[Berezin UB]]s or two or even four 20&nbsp;mm [[ShVAK cannon]]s were substituted, but overall performance deteriorated as a result.<ref>Yefim 2008, pp. 483\u2013484.</ref>{{refn|Soviet pilot Nikolai G.

A total of 4,200 mark I were built, 1,924 by Hawker, 1,850 by [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] and 426 by [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] between December 1937 and July 1941. The [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] Hurricanes were shipped to England to be fitted with engines.\n\n;Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1\n:Hurricane Mk I powered by the improved Merlin XX engine with two-speed supercharger. This new engine used a coolant mix of 30 per cent glycol and 70 per cent water. Pure glycol is flammable, so not only was the new mix safer, but the engine also ran approximately {{convert|21|C|F|abbr=on}} cooler, which gave longer engine life and greater reliability.<ref name=\"Schlaiefer p. 220\">Schlaiefer 1950, p. 220.</ref> The new engine was longer than the earlier Merlin and so the Hurricane gained a 4.5 in \"plug\" in front of the cockpit, which made the aircraft slightly more stable due to the slight forward shift in centre of gravity.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 16\">Hiscock 2003, p. 16.</ref> First flew on 11 June 1940 and went into squadron service in September 1940.

Hurricane IIA Series 2 became the Mk IIC in June 1941, using a slightly modified wing. The new wings also included a hardpoint for a {{convert|500|or|250|lb|abbr=on}} bomb and, later in 1941, fuel tanks. By then performance was inferior to the latest German fighters, and the Hurricane changed to the [[ground attack aircraft|ground-attack]] role, sometimes referred to as the '''Hurribomber'''. The mark also served as a [[night fighter]] and [[intruder (air combat)|intruder]] with about three quarters converted to fighter bombers. There were IIC 4,711 built by Hawker between February 1941 and July 1944.\n\n;Hurricane Mk IID\n:Armed with two 40&nbsp;mm (1.57&nbsp;in) anti-tank autocannon in a [[Gun pod|gondola-style pod]], one under each wing and a single Browning machine gun in each wing loaded with tracers for aiming purposes. The first aircraft flew on 18 September 1941 and deliveries started in 1942. Serial-built aircraft had additional armour for the pilot, radiator and engine, and were armed with a Rolls-Royce gun with 12 rounds, later changed to the 40&nbsp;mm (1.57&nbsp;in) [[Vickers S gun]] with 15 rounds. The outer wing attachments were strengthened so that 4G could be pulled at a weight of 8,540 lb (3,874 kg).<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 17\">Hiscock 2003, p. 17.</ref> The weight of guns and armour protection marginally impaired the aircraft's performance. These Hurricanes were nicknamed \"Flying Can Openers\", perhaps a play on the logo of No. 6 Squadron, which flew the Hurricane starting in 1942.  A total of 296 built by Hawker from January 1942 to February 1943\n\n[[File:Hurricane IID 6 Sqn RAF over Western Desert 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane IID of 6 Sqn showing Vokes tropical filter and RAF desert camouflage in 1942.]]\n;Hurricane Mk IIE\n:'''Mk IIE''', this designation was used by the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1942 and 1943 for mark II factory fitted with wing racks, 270 delivered according to the Ministry, the RAF used the IIB or C designation.

All three prototypes had four-bladed propellers. Speed was {{convert|326|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 500&nbsp;ft, which is comparable with the Hurricane I despite being one and a half times as heavy.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 20\"/>\n\n;Hurricane Mk X\n:Canadian-built variant. [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] report building a total of 975 mark II airframes for Holland (1), the RAF (575) and RCAF (400), between July 1941 and May 1943. The mark X designation has been used by the RAF for [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] built mark I but it is usually defined as mark II airframes fitted with a Merlin 28. About two thirds of the [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] built mark II airframes shipped to Britain did so without an engine, the remainder being fitted with Merlin 28 in Canada, but the engine was near automatically removed upon arrival and a Merlin XX fitted instead and the aircraft called mark II by the RAF. Apart from some test flights in Canada and England no Hurricane flew powered by a Merlin 28. Canada only imported 285 Merlin 28 for Hurricanes, all of which were shipped to Britain either as a separate engine or attached to a Hurricane.\n\n;Hurricane Mk XI\n:Canadian-built variant. Designation used for 150 aircraft from the RCAF mark XII order sent to Britain, these aircraft had their Merlin 29 removed and were either shipped without an engine or fitted with a Merlin 28. Fitted with Merlin XX on arrival in Britain and called mark II by the RAF.\n\n;Hurricane Mk XII\n:Canadian-built variant. Single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber. Powered by a 1,300&nbsp;hp (969&nbsp;kW) Packard Merlin 29. Initially armed with 12 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, but this was later changed to four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon.\n\n;Hurricane Mk XIIA\n:Canadian-built variant. Single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber. An order for 400 mark II airframes for the RCAF powered by a {{convert|1,300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Packard Merlin 29, armed with eight 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, production starting in June 1942. 150 sent to Britain in 1943 either engineless or fitted with a Merlin 28. Also a batch of 30 RAF order mark II airframes retained in Canada in late 1941 and initially fitted with Merlin III became mark XII when later fitted with Merlin 29.\n\n;Holland standard Hurricane.\n:Canadian built variant. RAF serial airframe AM270 was completed around early March 1942 to Dutch standards, including US built Merlin, instruments and gun sight, as the prototype of an order for the Netherlands East Indies (KM/KNIL). Given the Dutch serial HC3-287, its subsequent fate is unclear beyond being used by [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] for test flying. AM270 was also used by the RAF for a Consolidated San Diego built Catalina, creating a further level of confusion.\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A9421.jpg|thumb|right]]\n;Sea Hurricane Mk IA\n:The Sea Hurricane Mk IA was a Hurricane Mk I modified by [[General Aircraft Limited]]. These conversions numbered approximately 250 aircraft. They were modified to be carried by [[CAM ship]]s ([[Aircraft catapult|catapult]]-armed [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]), whose ships' crews were Merchant Marine and whose Hurricanes were crewed and serviced by RAF personnel, or Fighter Catapult Ships, which were Naval Auxiliary Vessels crewed by naval personnel and aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm. These ships were equipped with a catapult for launching an aircraft, but without facilities to recover them. Consequently, if the aircraft were not in range of a land base, pilots had to bail out or to ditch.\n:Both of these options had their problems\u2014there was always a chance of striking part of the fuselage when bailing out, and a number of pilots had been killed in this way. Ditching the Hurricane in the sea called for skill as the radiator housing acted as a water brake, pitching the nose of the fighter downwards when it hit the water, while also acting as a very efficient scoop, helping to flood the Hurricane so that a quick exit was necessary before the aircraft sank.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 20\"/> Then the pilot had to be picked up by a ship. More than 80 modifications were needed to convert a Hurricane into a Sea Hurricane, including new radios to conform with those used by the Fleet Air Arm and new instrumentation to read in knots rather than miles per hour.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 19\"/> They were informally known as \"Hurricats\".\n:The majority of the aircraft modified had suffered wear-and-tear serving with front line squadrons, so much so that at least one example used during trials broke up under the stress of a catapult launching. CAM Sea Hurricanes were launched operationally on eight occasions and the Hurricanes shot down six enemy aircraft for the loss of one Hurricane pilot killed.<ref name=\"Brown, Eric p112\">Brown 1980, p. 112.</ref> The first Sea Hurricane IA kill was an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Fw 200C ''Condor'']], shot down on 2 August 1941.<ref>Brown 1980, p. 109.</ref>\n[[File:Hawker Hurricane03.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved Sea Hurricane of the [[Fleet Air Arm]].]]\n;Sea Hurricane Mk IB\n:Hurricane Mk I version equipped with catapult spools plus an arrester hook.<ref name=\"Brown, Eric p114\">Brown 1980, p. 114.</ref> From July 1941 they operated from {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} and from October 1941, they were used on [[merchant aircraft carrier]] (MAC) ships, which were large cargo vessels with a flight deck fitted, enabling aircraft to be launched and recovered. A total of 340 aircraft were converted.

The first three were converted in January 1941. Two carried a pair of [[F24 camera]]s with 8-inch focal length lenses. The third carried one vertical and two oblique F24s with 14-inch focal length lenses mounted in the rear fuselage, close to the trailing edge of the wing, and a fairing was built up over the lenses aft of the radiator housing. A further five Hurricanes were modified in March 1941, and two were converted in a similar manner in Malta during April 1941. During October 1941 a batch of six Hurricane IIs was converted to PR Mark II status and a final batch, thought to be of 12 aircraft, was converted in late 1941. The PR Mark II was said to be capable of slightly over {{convert|350|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and was able to reach {{convert|38,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 18\"/>\n\n;Hurricane Tac R\n:For duties closer to the front lines some Hurricanes were converted to Tactical Reconnaissance (Tac R) aircraft. An additional radio was fitted for liaison with ground forces who were better placed to direct the Hurricane. Some Hurricane Tac R aircraft also had a vertical camera fitted in the rear fuselage, so to compensate for the extra weight either one or two Brownings or two cannons would be omitted. Externally these aircraft were only distinguishable by the missing armament.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 18\"/>\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Yu Hurricane.jpg|thumb|Hawker Hurricane Mk IVRP with Yugoslav Air Force markings, [[Museum of Aviation in Belgrade]], [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]]]\n{{See also|List of Hawker Hurricane operators}}\n\nDue to its lightweight, yet robust, construction and ease of maintenance, the Hurricane had a long operational life in many theatres of war.

It was overshadowed in the public consciousness by the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]'s role during [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940, but the Hurricane inflicted 60 percent of the losses sustained by the [[Luftwaffe]] in the engagement, and fought in all the major theatres of the Second World War.\n\nThe Hurricane originated from discussions between RAF officials and aircraft designer Sir [[Sydney Camm]] about a proposed [[monoplane]] derivative of the [[Hawker Fury]] [[biplane]] in the early 1930s. Despite an institutional preference for biplanes and lack of interest from the [[Air Ministry]], Hawker refined their monoplane proposal, incorporating several innovations which became critical to wartime fighter aircraft, including retractable [[landing gear]] and the more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine. The Air Ministry ordered Hawker's ''Interceptor Monoplane'' in late 1934, and the prototype Hurricane ''K5083'' performed its [[maiden flight]] on 6 November 1935.\n\nIn June 1936, the Hurricane went into production for the Air Ministry; it entered squadron service on 25 December 1937. Its manufacture and maintenance was eased by using conventional construction methods so that squadrons could perform many major repairs without external support. The Hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when the RAF had 18 Hurricane-equipped squadrons in service. The aircraft was relied on to defend against German aircraft operated by the Luftwaffe, including [[dogfight]]ing with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s in multiple theatres of action.\n\nThe Hurricane was developed through several versions, into bomber-interceptors, [[fighter-bomber]]s, and [[Attack aircraft|ground support]] aircraft as well as fighters. Versions designed for the [[Royal Navy]] known as the '''Sea Hurricane''' had modifications enabling operation from ships. Some were converted as catapult-launched convoy escorts. By the end of production in July 1944, 14,487 Hurricanes had been completed in Britain, Canada, Belgium and Yugoslavia.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nDuring the era in which the [[Hawker Aircraft]] company developed the Hurricane, [[RAF Fighter Command]] comprised just 13 squadrons, equipped with the [[Hawker Fury]], [[Hawker Hart#Demon|Hawker Demon]], or the [[Bristol Bulldog]], all [[biplane]]s furnished with fixed-[[Blade pitch|pitch]] wooden propellers and non-retractable undercarriages.<ref name=\"Bader\">Bader 2004, p. 36.</ref><ref name=\"mason 3\">Mason 1967, p. 3.</ref> At the time, there was an institutional reluctance towards change within the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]]; according to aviation author Francis K. Mason, some senior figures were prejudiced against the adoption of [[monoplane]] fighter aircraft, while mid-level officers were typically approachable on the subject and design concepts that made use of such configurations.<ref name=\"mason 3\" />\n\nIn 1934, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[List of Air Ministry specifications#1930\u20131939|Specification F.7/30]] in response to demands within the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) for a new generation of [[fighter aircraft]]. Earlier, during 1933, British aircraft designer [[Sydney Camm]] had conducted discussions with Major John Buchanan of the Directorate of Technical Development on a monoplane based on the existing Fury.<ref name=\"mason 3 4\">Mason 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Mason attributes Camm's discussions with figures within the RAF, such as Squadron Leader [[Ralph Sorley]], as having provoked the specification and some of its details, such as the preference for armaments being installed within the wings instead of within the aircraft's nose.<ref name=\"mason 4\">Mason 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nCamm's initial submission in response to F.7/30, the [[Hawker P.V.3]], was essentially a scaled-up version of the Fury biplane.<ref>Mason 1992, p. 242.</ref> However, the P.V.3 was not among the proposals which the Air Ministry had selected to be constructed as a government-sponsored prototype. After the rejection of the P.V.3 proposal, Camm commenced work upon a new design involving a [[cantilever]] monoplane arrangement, complete with a fixed undercarriage, armed with four machine guns and powered by the [[Rolls-Royce Goshawk]] engine. The original 1934 armament specifications for what would evolve into the Hurricane were for a similar armament fitment to the [[Gloster Gladiator]]: four machine-guns, two in the wings and two in the fuselage, [[Synchronization gear|synchronised]] to fire through the propeller arc. By January 1934, the proposal's detail drawings had been finished, but these failed to impress the Air Ministry enough for a prototype to be ordered.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 30.</ref>\n\nCamm's response to this rejection was to further develop the design, during which a retractable undercarriage was introduced and the unsatisfactory Goshawk engine was replaced by a new Rolls-Royce design, initially designated as the ''PV-12'', which went on to become famous as the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] engine. In August 1934, a one-tenth scale model of the design was produced and dispatched to the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] at [[Teddington]]. A series of [[wind tunnel]] tests confirmed the aerodynamic qualities of the aircraft were in order, and in September 1934, Camm again approached the Air Ministry. This time, the Ministry's response was favourable, and a prototype of the \"Interceptor Monoplane\" was promptly ordered.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Prototype and trials===\n[[File:Hurricane mockup.jpg|thumb|right|An early mock-up for the Hurricane's fuselage, showing side fuselage-mounted [[Synchronization gear|synchronised]] machine gun, like earlier British biplane fighters.]]\nIn July 1934 at a meeting chaired by Air Commodore Tedder, Air Ministry Science Office [[Frederick William Hill|Captain F.W. (\"Gunner\") Hill]] presented his calculation showing that future fighters must carry no fewer than eight machine guns, each capable of firing 1,000 shots a minute.<ref>Keith CH. ''I Hold My Aim''. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London, 1946</ref> Hill's assistant in making his calculations was his teenage daughter. Of the decision to place eight machine guns in fighters, [[Claude Hilton Keith|Keith]] says 'The battle was brisk and was carried into very high quarters before the implementing authority was given. My Branch had made out a sound case for 8-gun fighters and if this recommendation had not been accepted and we had been content with half-measures, it might indeed have gone ill for us during the late summer of 1940'. Present at the meeting was Squadron Leader Ralph Sorley of the Air Ministry's Operational Requirements branch, who played an important role in the decision. In November 1934, the Air Ministry issued Specification F.5/34 which called for new fighter aircraft to be armed with a total of eight guns. However, by this time, work had progressed too far to immediately modify the planned four-gun installation. By January 1935, a wooden mock-up had been finished, and although a number of suggestions for detail changes were made, construction of the prototype was approved, and a new specification (F.36/34) was written around the design. In July 1935, this specification was amended to include installation of eight guns.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 40.</ref><ref name=\"mason 4\" />\n\nBy the end of August 1935, work on the airframe had been completed at Hawker's [[Kingston upon Thames]] facility and the aircraft components were transported to [[Brooklands]], [[Surrey]], where Hawker had an assembly shed; on 23 October 1935, the prototype was fully re-assembled.<ref name=\"mason 4\" /> Ground testing and taxi trials took place over the following two weeks. On 6 November 1935, the prototype ''K5083'' took to the air for the [[maiden flight|first time]] at the hands of Hawker's chief [[test pilot]], [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[George Bulman (pilot)|George Bulman]].<ref name=greatac>Cacutt 1989, pp. 204\u2013212.</ref> Bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing; [[Philip Lucas]] flew some of the experimental test flights, while [[John Stuart Hindmarsh|John Hindmarsh]] conducted the firm's production flight trials.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 37, 40.</ref> As completed, the prototype had been fitted with [[ballast]] to represent the aircraft's armament prior to the acceptance of the final multi-gun wing armament.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Francis K. |date=1962 |title=The Hawker Hurricane |location=London |publisher=MacDonald |page=21 }}</ref>\n\nBy March 1936, the prototype had completed ten flying hours, covering all major portions of the flight envelope. Early testing had gone reasonably well, especially in light of the trial status of the Merlin engine, which had yet to achieve full flight certification at this time and thus severe restrictions had been imposed upon use of the engine.<ref name=\"mason 4\" /> In early 1936, the prototype was transferred to [[RAF Martlesham Heath]], [[Suffolk]], to participate in initial service trials under the direction of squadron leader D.&nbsp;F. Anderson. Sammy Wroath, later to be the founding Commandant of the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]], was the RAF test pilot for the Hurricane: his report was favourable, stating that: \"The aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices\" and proceeded to praise its control response.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 52.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hawker Hurricane before maiden flight 1935.jpg|thumb|''K5083'', the prototype, photographed before its first flight in November 1935]]\nIn the course of RAF trials, despite the Merlin engine proving to be problematic, having suffered numerous failures and necessitating several changes, enthusiastic reports were produced in the aircraft and its performance figures. The trials had observed the aircraft to possess a maximum level speed of 315&nbsp;mph at an altitude of 16,200&nbsp;ft, a time-to-climb to an altitude of 15,000&nbsp;ft from takeoff of 5.7 minutes, and a stalling speed of 57&nbsp;mph (only marginally higher than the Gladiator biplane), the last achieved using its [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]].<ref name=\"mason 4\" />\n\nIn the course of further testing, it was found that the Hurricane had poor [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]] recovery characteristics, in which all [[rudder]] authority could be lost due to shielding of the rudder.<ref name=\"mason 5\" /> Hawker's response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived, but the Air Ministry refused the request;<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 64.</ref> the situation was resolved by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage, and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] and extension of the bottom of the rudder. This discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft, but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.<ref>Mason 1992, p. 254.</ref>\n\nIn early 1936, the Hawker [[Board of Directors]] had decided, in the absence of official authorisation and at company expense, to proceed with issuing the design drawings to the production design office and to commence tooling-up for a production line capable of producing a batch of 1,000 Hurricanes.<ref>\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines \u2013 5th edition\" by [[Bill Gunston]], Sutton Publishing, 2006, p. 188.</ref><ref name=\"mason 4 5\">Mason 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Women assembling Hawker Hurricanes 1942.jpg|thumb|Hurricane production line, 1942]]\n[[File:Royal Air Force Training Command, 1939-1940.

In comparison to the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], it was significantly cheaper and involved less labour, requiring 10,300 man hours to produce versus 15,200 for the Spitfire.<ref name=\"postan\">Postan 1952, p. Chapter IV, footnote 89.</ref> As a large-scale war was looking increasingly likely, and time was of the essence in providing the RAF with an effective fighter aircraft, it was unclear if the more advanced Spitfire would enter production smoothly, while the Hurricane made use of well-understood manufacturing techniques.<ref name=\"postan\" /> This factor was equally applicable for its use within service squadrons as well, which were experienced in working on and repairing aircraft whose construction employed the same principles as the Hurricane, and the simplicity of its design enabled the improvisation of some remarkable repairs in squadron workshops.<ref name=\"postan\" /> A fabric-covered wing patterned upon traditional Hawker designs was initially adopted in order to speed up production; a higher-performing stressed-skin metal wing took its place in late 1939.<ref name=\"mason 5\" />\n\nOn 12 October 1937, the maiden flight took place of the first production Hurricane I, which was powered by a Merlin II engine and flown by Flight Lieutenant Philip Lucas. Production deliveries had been delayed by roughly six months due to a decision to equip the Hurricane only with the improved Merlin II engine, while the earlier Merlin I had been prioritised for the [[Fairey Battle]] and the [[Hawker Henley]].<ref name=\"mason 5\" /> By the following December, the first four aircraft to enter service with the RAF had joined [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|No. 111 Squadron]], stationed at [[RAF Northolt]]. By February 1938, No. 111 Squadron had received 16 Hurricanes.<ref name=\"mason 5\" /> Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, over 550 Hurricanes had been produced, which had equipped a total of 18 squadrons, while a further 3,500 aircraft were on order.<ref>Bader 2004, p. 41.</ref><ref name=\"mason 7\" />\n\nDuring 1940, [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who was the [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], established an organisation in which a number of manufacturers were seconded to repair and overhaul battle-damaged Hurricanes. The [[Civilian Repair Organisation]] also overhauled battle-weary aircraft, which were later sent to training units or to other air forces; one of the factories involved was the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Aero Company]]'s [[Cofton Hackett#Austin Aero Works|Cofton Hackett plant]]. Another was David Rosenfield Ltd, based at [[Barton-upon-Irwell|Barton]] aerodrome near [[Manchester]].\n\nA major manufacturer of the Hurricane was [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] at their factory in [[Fort William, Ontario]], Canada. The facility's chief engineer, [[Elsie MacGill]], became known as the \"Queen of the Hurricanes\".<ref name=\"mason 7\" /> The initiative was commercially led rather than governmentally, but was endorsed by the British government; Hawker, having recognised that a major conflict was all but inevitable after the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Crisis]] of 1938, drew up preliminary plans to expand Hurricane production via a new factory in Canada. Under this plan, samples, pattern aircraft, and a complete set of design documents stored on [[microfilm]], were shipped to Canada; the RCAF ordered 20 Hurricanes to equip one fighter squadron and two more were supplied to Canadian Car and Foundry as pattern aircraft but one probably did not arrive, while the other was sent back to Britain in 1940. The first Hurricane built at Canadian Car and Foundry was officially produced in February 1940.<ref name=\"mason 7\" /> As a result, Canadian-built Hurricanes were shipped to Britain to participate in events such as the [[Battle of Britain]].<ref name=\"mason 7\" />\n\nOverall, some 14,487 Hurricanes and Sea Hurricanes were produced in England and Canada.<ref name=\"Thetford 1994, p. 232\">Thetford 1994, p. 232</ref><!--page ref may be wrong since I have 1982 edition-->{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=It would be nice to know how many fighters versus fighter-bombers versus other variants.

The majority of the external surfaces were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.<ref name = \"fli 38 469 470\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, pp. 469, 470.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, a simple steel tube structure in the nose of the fuselage was used to support the engine; detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the engine's areas for inspection or adjustment purposes.<ref name = \"fli 38 472\"/> Installed underneath the fuselage, the liquid-cooled radiator has a rectangular opening to its aft; this is covered by a hinged flap via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level. An atypical feature for the era was the use of [[UNS C69100|Tungum alloy]] pipes throughout the cooling system.<ref name = \"fli 38 472\">[[Flight International|''Flight'']] 12 May 1938, p. 472.</ref>\n\nInitially, the structure of the Hurricane's [[cantilever]] wing consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness.<ref name = \"fli 38 469 471\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, pp. 469\u2013471.</ref> The wing was described by aviation publication [[Flight International|Flight]] as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical [[jig (tool)|jig]]s to attach the two spars, after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and rear spars. [[Hydraulics|Hydraulically]]-actuated split [[trailing edge]] [[flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s were present on the inner end of the wings.<ref name = \"fli 38 471\"/> The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its [[leading edge]]. The majority of the [[Flight control surfaces]], such as the Frise-type [[aileron]]s, also had fabric coverings.<ref name = \"fli 38 471\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, p. 471.</ref>\n\nAn all-metal, stressed-skin wing of [[duralumin]]ium (a DERD specification similar to AA2024) was introduced in April 1939 and was used for all of the later marks.<ref name=greatac /> \"The metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} higher than the fabric-covered ones. They were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings; one trials Hurricane, ''L1877'', was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing. The great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath.\"<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 12\">Hiscock 2003, p. 12.</ref> Several fabric-wing Hurricanes were still in service during the Battle of Britain, although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair.

A hydraulic jack served to actuate the undercarriage, with the carefully set \"pintle\" angle of the strut's upper ends assisting in the folding and pivoting the legs as to reposition the wheel unit rearwards as well as inwards in order to clear the front spar when retracted.<ref name = \"fli 38 472\"/> Two separate hydraulic systems, one being power-operated and the other hand-operated, are present for the deployment and retraction of the undercarriage; in the event of both failing, pilots can release the retaining catches holding the undercarriage in place, deploying the wheels to the 'down' position using weight alone. A wide wheel-track was used to allow for considerable stability during ground movements and to enable tight turns to be performed.<ref name = \"fli 38 471 472\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, pp. 471\u2013472.</ref>\n\nThe prototype and early production Hurricanes were fitted with a Watts two-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller. [[Flight International|''Flight'']] commented of this arrangement: \"Many have expressed surprise that the Hurricane is not fitted with variable-pitch airscrews\".<ref name = \"fli 38 473\">''Flight'' 12 May 1938, p. 473.</ref> The original two-bladed propeller was found to be inefficient at low airspeeds and the aircraft required a long ground run to get airborne, which caused concern at Fighter Command. Accordingly, trials with a [[De Havilland]] [[variable-pitch propeller]] demonstrated a reduction in the Hurricane's take-off run from {{convert|1230|to|750|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Deliveries of these began in April 1939: this was later replaced by the hydraulically operated constant-speed [[Rotol]] propeller, which came into service in time for the Battle of Britain.<ref>McKnstry 2010, p. 87.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| align = left\n| quote = Then, with tail trimmer set, throttle and mixture lever fully forward... and puffs of grey exhaust smoke soon clearing at maximum r.p.m. came the surprise!

To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive \"hump-backed\" silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable \"[[stirrup]]\" mounted below the trailing edge of the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both [[wing root]]s were coated with strips of non-slip material.\n\nAn advantage of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding. Even if one of the steel tubes were damaged, the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield. Damage to a [[stressed skin]] structure, as used by the Spitfire, required more specialised equipment to repair.<ref>[http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/spits_and_canes.html \"Best of Battle of Britain.\"] ''[[Air & Space]],'' February\u2013March 2008, p. 4.</ref> The old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of Hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions. Crated Hurricanes were assembled at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] in West Africa and flown across the Sahara to the Middle East theatre and, to save space, some [[Royal Navy]] aircraft carriers carried their reserve Sea Hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies, which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed.\n\nIn contrast, the contemporary Spitfire used all-metal [[monocoque]] construction and was thus both lighter and stronger, though less tolerant to bullet damage. With its ease of maintenance, widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics, the Hurricane remained in use in theatres of operations where reliability, easy handling and a stable gun platform were more important than performance, typically in roles like ground attack. One of the design requirements of the original specification was that both the Hurricane and the Spitfire were also to be used as [[night fighter]]s. The Hurricane proved to be a relatively simple aircraft to fly at night, and shot down several German aircraft on night raids. From early 1941 the Hurricane was also used as an \"intruder\" aircraft, patrolling German airfields in France at night to catch bombers taking off or landing.\n\n==Operational history==\n===Pre-war===\n[[File:Hawker Hurricane Mk IV RP - prepared for presentation.jpg|thumb|Yugoslavian Hurricane Mark.

As a result, there were some modest export sales made to other countries; at the earliest opportunity, a former RAF Hurricane I was dispatched to [[Yugoslavia]] for evaluation purposes.<ref name=\"mason 6\" /> Shortly after this evaluation, an order for 24 Hurricane Mark Is for the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] was received; this was followed by the purchase of a [[Licensed production|production licence]] for the Hurricane by Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"mason 6 7\">Mason 1967, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Yugoslavia Hurricanes saw action against the [[Luftwaffe]] during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941 by the [[Axis powers]].<ref name=\"mason 7\">Mason 1967, p. 7.</ref>\n\nTo the end of August 1939 seven ex RAF Hurricanes had been sent to South Africa, while another 13 ex RAF Hurricanes were sent to Turkey, 13 Hurricanes had been built for Belgium, 21 for Canada including 1 as a pattern for [[Canadian Car and Foundry]], 1 for Iran, 1 for Poland, 3 for Romania and 12 for Yugoslavia. All the built for export aircraft were taken from the RAF order and so all originally had an RAF serial. Further exports were done in the final 4 months of 1939 and early 1940.\n\nHurricane production was increased as part of a plan to create a reserve of [[attrition warfare|attrition]] aircraft as well as re-equip existing squadrons and newly formed ones such as those of the [[Auxiliary Air Force]].

As Galland has noted, the nature and style of the air battles over the beaches should have provided a warning as to the inherent weaknesses of the Luftwaffe's force structure. Admittedly, the Germans fought at a disadvantage. Although positioned forward at captured airfields, the Bf 109 was at the outer limits of its range and possessed less flying time over Dunkirk than did the \"Hurricanes\" and \"Spitfires\" operating from southern England. German bombers were still located in western Germany and had even farther to fly. Thus, the Luftwaffe could not bring its full weight to bear so that when its bombers hammered those on the beaches or embarking, the RAF intervened in a significant fashion. German aircraft losses were high, and British fighter attacks often prevented German bombers from performing with full effectiveness. Both sides suffered heavy losses. During the nine days from May 26 through June 3, the RAF lost 177 aircraft destroyed or damaged; the Germans lost 240. For much of the Luftwaffe, Dunkirk came as a nasty shock.

It was slightly slower than both the Spitfire I and II and the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, and the thicker wing profiles compromised acceleration; but it could out-turn both of them. In spite of its performance deficiencies against the Bf 109, the Hurricane was still capable of destroying the German fighter, especially at lower altitudes. The standard tactic of the 109s was to attempt to climb higher than the RAF fighters and \"bounce\" them in a dive; the Hurricanes could evade such tactics by turning into the attack or going into a \"corkscrew dive\", which the 109s, with their lower rate of roll, found hard to counter.

Britain's decision to aid the Soviets meant sending supplies by sea to the far northern ports, and as the convoys would need to sail within range of enemy air attack from the Luftwaffe based in neighbouring Finland, it was decided to deliver a number of Hurricane Mk IIBs, flying with [[No. 81 Squadron RAF|Nos. 81]] and [[No. 134 Squadron RAF|134 Squadrons]] of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]], to provide protection. Twenty-four were transported on the [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] ''[[HMS Argus (I49)|Argus]]'', arriving just off [[Murmansk]] on 28 August 1941, and another 15 crated aircraft on board merchant vessels. In addition to their convoy protection duties, the aircraft also acted as escorts to Russian bombers. (See ''[[Operation Benedict]]''.)\n\nEnemy attention to the area declined in October, at which point the RAF pilots trained their Soviet counterparts to operate the Hurricanes themselves. By the end of the year, the RAF's direct role in the region had ended, but the aircraft themselves remained behind and became the first of thousands of Allied aircraft that were accepted by the Soviet Union.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 135\u2013137.</ref> Although Soviet pilots were not universally enthusiastic about the Hurricane, twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] Lt.

First of all, it was 40\u201350&nbsp;km/h (25/31&nbsp;mph) slower than its main opponent, the Bf 109E interceptor, at low and medium height, and had a slower rate of climb. The Messerschmitt could outdive the Hurricane because of the thicker wing profile of the British fighter. But the main source of complaints was the Hurricane's armament. On occasion, the eight or 12 small-calibre machine guns did not damage the sturdy and heavily armoured German aircraft; consequently, Soviet ground crews started to remove the Brownings. Retaining only four or six of the 12 machine guns, two 12.7&nbsp;mm [[Berezin UB]]s or two or even four 20&nbsp;mm [[ShVAK cannon]]s were substituted, but overall performance deteriorated as a result.<ref>Yefim 2008, pp. 483\u2013484.</ref>{{refn|Soviet pilot Nikolai G.

Produced between 1937 and 1939.\n\n;Hurricane Mk I (revised)\n:A revised Hurricane Mk I series built with a [[de Havilland]] or [[Dowty Rotol|Rotol]] constant speed metal propeller (from mid 1940), metal-covered wings, armour and other improvements. A total of 4,200 mark I were built, 1,924 by Hawker, 1,850 by [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] and 426 by [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] between December 1937 and July 1941. The [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] Hurricanes were shipped to England to be fitted with engines.\n\n;Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1\n:Hurricane Mk I powered by the improved Merlin XX engine with two-speed supercharger. This new engine used a coolant mix of 30 per cent glycol and 70 per cent water. Pure glycol is flammable, so not only was the new mix safer, but the engine also ran approximately {{convert|21|C|F|abbr=on}} cooler, which gave longer engine life and greater reliability.<ref name=\"Schlaiefer p. 220\">Schlaiefer 1950, p. 220.</ref> The new engine was longer than the earlier Merlin and so the Hurricane gained a 4.5 in \"plug\" in front of the cockpit, which made the aircraft slightly more stable due to the slight forward shift in centre of gravity.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 16\">Hiscock 2003, p. 16.</ref> First flew on 11 June 1940 and went into squadron service in September 1940. Hawker built 418 and [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] 33.\n[[File:Hurricane.jpg|thumb|right|Hawker Hurricane Mk IIB ''Z5140'']]\n;Hurricane Mk IIB (Hurricane IIA Series 2)\n:A few were fitted with racks allowing them to carry two 250 lb or two 500 lb bombs. This lowered the top speed of the Hurricane to {{convert|301|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but by this point mixed sweeps of Hurricanes carrying bombs, protected by a screen of fighter Hurricanes were not uncommon. The same racks allowed the Hurricane to carry two 45-gallon (205&nbsp;l) drop tanks instead of the bombs, nearly doubling the Hurricane's fuel load.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 18\">Hiscock 2003, p. 18.</ref>\n\n:Hurricane Mk IIA Series 2 was equipped with a new and slightly longer propeller spinner, and 4 additional wing-mounted .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) Browning machine guns; for a total of 12 guns. The first aircraft were built in February 1941 and were renamed '''Mark IIB''' in April 1941. A total of 3,050 IIB built to November 1942, 1,883 by Hawker, 867 by [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] and 300 by [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Aero Company]].\n\n;Hurricane Mk IIB Trop.\n:For use in North Africa the Hawker Hurricane Mk IIB (and other variants) were tropicalised. They were fitted with Vokes and Rolls-Royce engine dust filters and the pilots were issued with a desert survival kit, including a bottle of water behind the cockpit.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 19\">Hiscock 2003, p. 19.</ref>\n[[File:Hurricane IIC 3 Sqn RAF in flight c1942.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Mk IIC ''BD867'' of 3 Sqn RAF, 1942]]\n;Hurricane Mk IIC (Hurricane Mk IIA Series 2)\n:Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1 equipped with new and slightly longer propeller spinner, and fully replaced the machine-gun armament with four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk II]] cannons, two per side. Hurricane IIA Series 2 became the Mk IIC in June 1941, using a slightly modified wing. The new wings also included a hardpoint for a {{convert|500|or|250|lb|abbr=on}} bomb and, later in 1941, fuel tanks. By then performance was inferior to the latest German fighters, and the Hurricane changed to the [[ground attack aircraft|ground-attack]] role, sometimes referred to as the '''Hurribomber'''. The mark also served as a [[night fighter]] and [[intruder (air combat)|intruder]] with about three quarters converted to fighter bombers. There were IIC 4,711 built by Hawker between February 1941 and July 1944.\n\n;Hurricane Mk IID\n:Armed with two 40&nbsp;mm (1.57&nbsp;in) anti-tank autocannon in a [[Gun pod|gondola-style pod]], one under each wing and a single Browning machine gun in each wing loaded with tracers for aiming purposes. The first aircraft flew on 18 September 1941 and deliveries started in 1942. Serial-built aircraft had additional armour for the pilot, radiator and engine, and were armed with a Rolls-Royce gun with 12 rounds, later changed to the 40&nbsp;mm (1.57&nbsp;in) [[Vickers S gun]] with 15 rounds. The outer wing attachments were strengthened so that 4G could be pulled at a weight of 8,540 lb (3,874 kg).<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 17\">Hiscock 2003, p. 17.</ref> The weight of guns and armour protection marginally impaired the aircraft's performance. These Hurricanes were nicknamed \"Flying Can Openers\", perhaps a play on the logo of No. 6 Squadron, which flew the Hurricane starting in 1942.  A total of 296 built by Hawker from January 1942 to February 1943\n\n[[File:Hurricane IID 6 Sqn RAF over Western Desert 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane IID of 6 Sqn showing Vokes tropical filter and RAF desert camouflage in 1942.]]\n;Hurricane Mk IIE\n:'''Mk IIE''', this designation was used by the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1942 and 1943 for mark II factory fitted with wing racks, 270 delivered according to the Ministry, the RAF used the IIB or C designation.

Additional armour was also fitted around the engine.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 20\">Hiscock 2003, p. 20.</ref> 524 built by Hawker between December 1942 and March 1944.\n\n;Hurricane Mk V\n:The final variant to be produced. Only one was built and 2 mark IV converted, and the variant never reached production. This was planned to be powered by a Merlin 27 but also tested with a Merlin 32 boosted engine to give 1,700&nbsp;hp at low level and was intended as a dedicated ground-attack aircraft to use in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]]. All three prototypes had four-bladed propellers. Speed was {{convert|326|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 500&nbsp;ft, which is comparable with the Hurricane I despite being one and a half times as heavy.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 20\"/>\n\n;Hurricane Mk X\n:Canadian-built variant. [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] report building a total of 975 mark II airframes for Holland (1), the RAF (575) and RCAF (400), between July 1941 and May 1943. The mark X designation has been used by the RAF for [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] built mark I but it is usually defined as mark II airframes fitted with a Merlin 28. About two thirds of the [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] built mark II airframes shipped to Britain did so without an engine, the remainder being fitted with Merlin 28 in Canada, but the engine was near automatically removed upon arrival and a Merlin XX fitted instead and the aircraft called mark II by the RAF. Apart from some test flights in Canada and England no Hurricane flew powered by a Merlin 28. Canada only imported 285 Merlin 28 for Hurricanes, all of which were shipped to Britain either as a separate engine or attached to a Hurricane.\n\n;Hurricane Mk XI\n:Canadian-built variant. Designation used for 150 aircraft from the RCAF mark XII order sent to Britain, these aircraft had their Merlin 29 removed and were either shipped without an engine or fitted with a Merlin 28. Fitted with Merlin XX on arrival in Britain and called mark II by the RAF.\n\n;Hurricane Mk XII\n:Canadian-built variant. Single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber. Powered by a 1,300&nbsp;hp (969&nbsp;kW) Packard Merlin 29. Initially armed with 12 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, but this was later changed to four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon.\n\n;Hurricane Mk XIIA\n:Canadian-built variant. Single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber. An order for 400 mark II airframes for the RCAF powered by a {{convert|1,300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Packard Merlin 29, armed with eight 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, production starting in June 1942. 150 sent to Britain in 1943 either engineless or fitted with a Merlin 28. Also a batch of 30 RAF order mark II airframes retained in Canada in late 1941 and initially fitted with Merlin III became mark XII when later fitted with Merlin 29.\n\n;Holland standard Hurricane.\n:Canadian built variant. RAF serial airframe AM270 was completed around early March 1942 to Dutch standards, including US built Merlin, instruments and gun sight, as the prototype of an order for the Netherlands East Indies (KM/KNIL). Given the Dutch serial HC3-287, its subsequent fate is unclear beyond being used by [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] for test flying. AM270 was also used by the RAF for a Consolidated San Diego built Catalina, creating a further level of confusion.\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A9421.jpg|thumb|right]]\n;Sea Hurricane Mk IA\n:The Sea Hurricane Mk IA was a Hurricane Mk I modified by [[General Aircraft Limited]]. These conversions numbered approximately 250 aircraft. They were modified to be carried by [[CAM ship]]s ([[Aircraft catapult|catapult]]-armed [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]), whose ships' crews were Merchant Marine and whose Hurricanes were crewed and serviced by RAF personnel, or Fighter Catapult Ships, which were Naval Auxiliary Vessels crewed by naval personnel and aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm. These ships were equipped with a catapult for launching an aircraft, but without facilities to recover them. Consequently, if the aircraft were not in range of a land base, pilots had to bail out or to ditch.\n:Both of these options had their problems\u2014there was always a chance of striking part of the fuselage when bailing out, and a number of pilots had been killed in this way. Ditching the Hurricane in the sea called for skill as the radiator housing acted as a water brake, pitching the nose of the fighter downwards when it hit the water, while also acting as a very efficient scoop, helping to flood the Hurricane so that a quick exit was necessary before the aircraft sank.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 20\"/> Then the pilot had to be picked up by a ship. More than 80 modifications were needed to convert a Hurricane into a Sea Hurricane, including new radios to conform with those used by the Fleet Air Arm and new instrumentation to read in knots rather than miles per hour.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 19\"/> They were informally known as \"Hurricats\".\n:The majority of the aircraft modified had suffered wear-and-tear serving with front line squadrons, so much so that at least one example used during trials broke up under the stress of a catapult launching. CAM Sea Hurricanes were launched operationally on eight occasions and the Hurricanes shot down six enemy aircraft for the loss of one Hurricane pilot killed.<ref name=\"Brown, Eric p112\">Brown 1980, p. 112.</ref> The first Sea Hurricane IA kill was an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Fw 200C ''Condor'']], shot down on 2 August 1941.<ref>Brown 1980, p. 109.</ref>\n[[File:Hawker Hurricane03.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved Sea Hurricane of the [[Fleet Air Arm]].]]\n;Sea Hurricane Mk IB\n:Hurricane Mk I version equipped with catapult spools plus an arrester hook.<ref name=\"Brown, Eric p114\">Brown 1980, p. 114.</ref> From July 1941 they operated from {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} and from October 1941, they were used on [[merchant aircraft carrier]] (MAC) ships, which were large cargo vessels with a flight deck fitted, enabling aircraft to be launched and recovered. A total of 340 aircraft were converted. The first Sea Hurricane IB kill occurred on 31 July 1941 when Sea Hurricanes of 880 squadron FAA operating from HMS ''Furious'' shot down a [[Dornier Do 18|Do 18 flying-boat]].<ref>Thetford 1994, p. 228.</ref>\n\n:Apart from the conversions in Britain 50 Sea Hurricane IB were built in Canada and delivered in late 1941 and early 1942.

The first three were converted in January 1941. Two carried a pair of [[F24 camera]]s with 8-inch focal length lenses. The third carried one vertical and two oblique F24s with 14-inch focal length lenses mounted in the rear fuselage, close to the trailing edge of the wing, and a fairing was built up over the lenses aft of the radiator housing. A further five Hurricanes were modified in March 1941, and two were converted in a similar manner in Malta during April 1941. During October 1941 a batch of six Hurricane IIs was converted to PR Mark II status and a final batch, thought to be of 12 aircraft, was converted in late 1941. The PR Mark II was said to be capable of slightly over {{convert|350|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and was able to reach {{convert|38,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 18\"/>\n\n;Hurricane Tac R\n:For duties closer to the front lines some Hurricanes were converted to Tactical Reconnaissance (Tac R) aircraft. An additional radio was fitted for liaison with ground forces who were better placed to direct the Hurricane. Some Hurricane Tac R aircraft also had a vertical camera fitted in the rear fuselage, so to compensate for the extra weight either one or two Brownings or two cannons would be omitted. Externally these aircraft were only distinguishable by the missing armament.<ref name=\"Hiscock p. 18\"/>\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Yu Hurricane.jpg|thumb|Hawker Hurricane Mk IVRP with Yugoslav Air Force markings, [[Museum of Aviation in Belgrade]], [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]]]\n{{See also|List of Hawker Hurricane operators}}\n\nDue to its lightweight, yet robust, construction and ease of maintenance, the Hurricane had a long operational life in many theatres of war. It was also built by, or exported to, several other countries. The Hurricane was unusual in that it was flown operationally by both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis]] during the war. In some cases (e.g., Portugal and Ireland) the Hurricane was pressed into service after being forced to land in a neutral country.\n\nIn 1939 [[Latvia]] ordered and paid for 30 Hurricane fighters, but due to the start of the Second World War later that year, the aircraft were never delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lffb.lv/apskati/latavio.html|title=Latavio|author=Ilm\u0101rs|work=lffb.lv|language=Latvian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218213538/http://www.lffb.lv/apskati/latavio.html|archivedate=18 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n<!---not needed, individual stories are not to be included---\n===Romania===\nThe first Romanian aerial victories of the war were achieved by Lt Horia Agarici of Esc. 53 who, flying a damaged Hawker Hurricane, shot down three Soviet Bombers that had attempted to bomb the Romanian fleet.<ref name= \" Neulen p. 96.\">Neulen 2000, p. 96.</ref>\n--->\n{{div col}}\n* {{AUS}}\n* {{BEL}}\n* {{flag|Canada|1921}}\n* {{flag|Egypt|1922}}\n* {{FRA}}\n* {{FIN}}\n* {{flagcountry|Nazi Germany}}\n* {{flag|Greece|old}}\n* {{flag|British Raj}}\n* {{flag|Iran|1925}}\n* {{IRL}}\n* {{flagcountry|Kingdom of Italy}}\n* {{JPN}}\n* {{flag|Netherlands}}\n* {{NZL}}\n* {{NOR}}\n* {{POL}}\n* {{PRT}}\n* {{flag|Romania}}\n* {{flag|South Africa|1928}}\n* {{URS}}\n* {{TUR}}\n* {{GBR}}\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n* {{YUG}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n[[File:hurricane mkiic of the bbmf arp.jpg|thumb|The last of the 14,583 Hurricanes built, s/n ''[[Hawker Hurricane PZ865|PZ865]]''.

Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].\n\n{{Anchor|Incisional abscess}}\n\n===Incisional abscess===\nAn ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]].

The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.\n\nThe final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Blausen 0007 Abscess.png|A diagram of an abscess\nfile:Pyemic abscesses of kidney.jpg|[[Pyaemia|Pyemic]] abscesses of [[kidney]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:UOTW 66 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Ultrasound showing an abscess of the skin<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #66 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=7 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102223449/http://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|archivedate=2 November 2016}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Ultrasound image of breast 110323101432 1023060.jpg|Ultrasound image of breast abscess, appearing as a mushroom-shaped dark (hypoechoic) area|thumb]]\n\nAn abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by the pyogenic membrane.<ref>Robins/8th/68</ref> [[Ultrasound]] imaging in the emergency department can help in a diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbic|first1=D|last2=Chenkin|first2=J|last3=Cho|first3=DD|last4=Jelic|first4=T|last5=Scheuermeyer|first5=FX|title=In patients presenting to the emergency department with skin and soft tissue infections what is the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of abscess compared to the current standard of care?

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to the possibility of the strep species as a cause, that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin, in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

If foreign objects are not the cause, incising and draining the abscess is standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Surgery: Facts and Figures |last=Green |first=James |author2=Saj Wajed |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 1-900151-96-0}}</ref>\n\nIn critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to the possibility of the strep species as a cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.
