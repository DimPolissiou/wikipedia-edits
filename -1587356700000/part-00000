The film is written and directed by [[Bob Fosse]], adapted from the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Village Voice]]'' article \"Death of a Playmate\" by [[Teresa Carpenter]], the title being taken from Snider's vanity license plates.\n\nThe film stars [[Mariel Hemingway]] as Stratten and [[Eric Roberts]] as Snider, with supporting roles by [[Cliff Robertson]], [[Carroll Baker]], [[Roger Rees]], [[Stuart Damon]], [[Josh Mostel]], and [[David Clennon]]. The film chronicles Stratten's relationship with Snider, their move to [[Los Angeles]] and her success as a ''Playboy'' model, and the eventual dissolution of their relationship and her murder.\n\n''Star 80'' was filmed on-location in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and [[Los Angeles, California]]; the death scene was filmed in the same house in which the murder-suicide took place. [[Hugh Hefner]], disliking the way he was depicted in the film, sued the producers of the picture. In accordance with the family's wishes, Dorothy's mother is never mentioned by name in the movie and the names of her sister and brother were altered. Other names were also changed due to legal concerns. It is the second movie based on the murder of Stratten, preceded by the 1981 television film ''[[Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story]]'' in which [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] portrayed Stratten and [[Bruce Weitz]] portrayed Snider.\n\nThe film had a limited release in November 10, 1983, with a general release three months later in February of the following year. It received critical acclaim, with particular praise directed at Hemingway and Roberts' performances. Roberts won the [[Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor]] and was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]], and Fosse was nominated for the [[Golden Bear]] and the [[Berlin Film Festival]]. It was Fosse's final film as director before his death in 1987.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1978, [[Dorothy Stratten]] was working at a [[Dairy Queen]] in her hometown of [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] when she meets [[Paul Snider]], a brash small-time scam artist and pimp. Snider charms Stratten into letting him take her to her high-school prom. He wins over Stratten with attention and flattery, getting her to pose nude for [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] photographs. Snider uses the photographs to persuade a professional to create a [[Artist's portfolio|portfolio]] of her. Snider forged the signature of Stratten's mother on a consent form and sends the portfolio to ''[[Playboy]]''. ''Playboy'' invites Stratten to Los Angeles to pose for a professional photographer.\n\n''Playboy'' founder and publisher [[Hugh Hefner]] makes Stratten [[List of Playboy Playmates of the Month|Playmate of the Month]] for the August 1979 issue. Hefner provides lodging for Stratten and gives her a job as a [[Playboy Bunny|bunny]] at an L.A. [[Playboy Club]]. Snider pressures Stratten into marrying him. She begins an acting career with small film and television roles and is made 1980's [[List of Playboy Playmates of the Year|Playmate of the Year]].\n\nSnider purchases a Mercedes with the vanity license plate STAR 80 but feels dejected after losing money on failed business ventures and being eclipsed by Stratten's success. At the [[Playboy Mansion]] Stratten catches the eye of movie director Aram Nicholas, who lets her read for a film role. Snider hires a private investigator to follow Stratten and learns Stratten and Nicholas are sleeping together. Snider buys a shotgun after Stratten insists she is going to leave him. Disregarding Nicholas' plea for her to not see Snider again, Stratten agrees to meet with him to arrange a financial settlement. Snider pleads with Stratten not to leave him, then flies into a rage, rapes and shoots her before turning the gun on himself.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Magaux Hemingway as [[Dorothy Stratten]]\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as [[Paul Snider]]\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as [[Hugh Hefner]]\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Dorothy's Mother\n* [[Roger Rees]] as Aram Nicholas\n* [[Stuart Damon]] as Vince Roberts\n* [[David Clennon]] as Geb\n* [[Josh Mostel]] as Private Detective\n* [[Jordan Christopher]] as Peter Rose\n* [[Ernest Thompson]] as Phil Wass\n* Tina Willson as Bobo Weller\n* [[James Luisi]] as Roy\n* [[Sidney Miller (actor)|Sidney Miller]] as Harlan\n* [[Deborah Geffner]] as Billie\n* Lisa Gordon as Eileen\n* Shelly Ingram as Betty\n* [[Neva Patterson]] as Playboy Executive\n* [[Terence Kelly (actor)|Terence Kelly]] as Charlie\n* [[Stanley Kamel]] as Nick\n* Cis Rundle as Meg Davis\n* Kathryn Witt as Robin\n* [[Gwen Welles]] as Leann\n* [[Robert Picardo]] as Interviewer\n* Keith Hefner as Photographer\n* [[Budd Friedman]] as Emcee\n* [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] as Club Comedian\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was screened out of competition at the [[34th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1984/02_programm_1984/02_Programm_1984.html |title=Berlinale: 1984 Programme |accessdate=2011-01-06 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' called it \"Bob Fosse's latest stylish stinker.\" Gene Siskel placed the film on his top-10 list of the best films of 1983, taking into account that the film was very unpleasant to watch.<ref>\"The Best of 1983\", ''Siskel & Ebert at the Movies'', 1983.</ref> Roger Ebert gave the film four-out-of-four stars and deemed it an \"important movie\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-80-1983 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Star 80|via=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n\nAppearing with Siskel on an October 1986 edition of ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers]]'', Ebert said Roberts should have been nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his work on ''Star 80''.

{"title_page": "Daniel L. Overmyer", "text_new": "'''Daniel L. Overmyer''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} (born 1935) is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Asian Studies and the Centre for Chinese Research at the [[University of British Columbia]], Overmyer's publications have concerned Chinese popular thought, religion, and culture; popular religious sects of the late traditional and modern periods and their texts; and local rituals and beliefs practiced in villages, especially North China.\n\nIn 2002 colleagues and former students organized a conference in honor of his retirement. The essays and presentations were published in a [[festschrift]], ''The People and the Dao'', (Monumenta Serica Monograph Series LX). In 1988, he was elected Fellow in the [[Royal Society of Canada]], and elected to the American Society for the Study of Religion <ref>[http://www.assr-religion.org/members.html American Society for the Study of Religion] (Accessed September 23, 2016)</ref> and Honorary Professor in the Faculty of Arts at [[Shanghai Normal University]]. He has been a member of the editorial board of [[China Review International]], [[Journal of Chinese Religions]], Minsu Quyi'' (A Journal Of Chinese Folk Drama, Literature, And Religion), and ''Ching Feng'', a Hong Kong journal of ecumenical Christianity.\n\n==Early life and education==\nOvermyer was born on August 20, 1935, in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He graduated in 1957 from [[Westmar College]] in Le Mars, Iowa, earning his B.A. in Biology. In 1960 he received a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] from [[Evangelical Theological Seminary]] in [[Naperville, Illinois]].{{sfnb|Overmyer|2016| p = 24}} {{sfnb|University_of_Chicago_Divinity_School| }}\n\nHe then earned a [[master's degree]] in the [[history of religions]] in 1966 and a PhD in Chinese religion in 1971 from the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], where he studied with [[Mircea Eliade]], and [[Joseph Kitagawa]] among others. When he suggested that folk popular sects as a topic for his dissertation, one of his advisers, Professor [[Ho Ping-ti]] said that these groups were only rebels and outlaws, but Professor [[Philip Kuhn]] encouraged him to pursue these heretics and bandits as a promising topic.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2016| p = 32-33}}\n\nOvermyer then studied in Taiwan at the Inter-University Center for Chinese Language. He later described a turning point while in Taiwan when he discovered that the \"heretics and bandits\" were in fact popular religious sects much like those found in many parts of the world, including in some forms of Christianity. One evening while attending a scholarly lecture,\n::from across the street I heard the \u201ctok tok\u201d sound of a small wooden drum accompanying the chanting of scriptures, so I left the lecture room and found a small group of people wearing aqua colored jackets and pants dancing slowly in the street while thumping their chests. They appeared to be in trance; as taxis drove by, they were gently herded to the side by others, all of this in front of a small storefront chapel. \nOn an altar in the back of this chapel was the image of a female deity, Yaoji jinmu, \u201cThe Golden Mother of the Jasper Pond\u201d, whom he recognized as a variant of [[Wusheng Laomu]], \u201cThe Eternal Venerable Mother\u201d, the chief deity of the groups he had been studying in traditional written texts.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2016| p = 35}}\n\n==Academic career==\nOvermyer's teaching career began in the Department of Religion at [[Oberlin College]], Ohio, in 1970. After three years, he was invited to the University of British Columbia. He was granted tenure in 1977 and taught Chinese religion and philosophy there until he retired in 2001. During that time held visiting professorships at Princeton University (1983), [[University of Heidelberg]] (1993), and [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (1996\u201398).\n\n==Research interests and impact==\n\nOvermeyer's student Philip Clart wrote that Overmyer's scholarship was unique in its \"attention to religion in its less well-known manifestations, religion located along paths less travelled by scholars,\" the religious life of common people. {{sfnb|ClartCrowe|2009|p = 10}}  Clart continues that Overmyer's \"methodological choice to study religion as it was and is lived by real people rather than as an abstract system of ideas and doctrines is not limited to the study of popular religions, but has applicability across the sphere of Chinese religious traditions.{{sfnb|ClartCrowe|2009|p = 21 }}\n\nHis first book, ''Folk Buddhist Religion: Dissenting Sects in Late Traditional China'', published by Harvard University Press in 1976, grew out of his doctoral dissertation. [[Paul Cohen]]'s ''[[Discovering History in China]]'' says that Overmyer exploits new kinds of sources materials -- sectarian scriptures or \"precious scrolls\" (baojuan) -- to give a \"bottom up\" view and access an \"interior view\" of reality as experienced by participants rather than described by outsiders.\n<ref>{{cite book |last = Cohen |first = Paul A. |year = 2010 |title = Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zzLhbITD4bgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Overmyer&f=false |edition = 2nd|publisher = Columbia University Press| location = New York |isbn = 9780231151924|ref = none}},  [https://books.google.com/books?id=zzLhbITD4bgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Overmyer&f=false pp. 175-177]</ref> A reviewer called it <ref>{{cite |url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies/article/overmyerdaniel-l-folk-buddhist-religion-dissenting-sects-in-late-traditional-china-harvard-east-asian-series-83-xi-295-pp-cambridge-mass-and-london-harvard-university-press-1976-1680-1050/E71BB125E50A77F078C5FF0DA0553D68 | title = Review| journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies| volume = 40 |number= 3 |year =1977| pp = 677\u201378| doi= 10.1017/S0041977X00046802}}</ref> The book was awarded the American Council of Learned Societies Prize in 1979 for \"the best first book written by an historian of religions in the last three years.\"\n\nHis next monograph, ''The Flying Phoenix: Aspects of Chinese Sectarianism in Taiwan'' (Princeton, 1986), written with [[David K. Jordan]], followed by survey written for undergraduates and the general public, ''Religions of China: The World as a Living System'' (Harper & Row, 1986).\n\n''Precious Volumes: an Introduction to Chinese Sectarian Scriptures from the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'' (Harvard, 1999) expanded on his insight that texts play a major role in the religious life of commoners, not only the canonical texts of the great traditions. This volume took these texts as its sole focus, arguing for their value as documents of popular religious thought and windows into the religious experience of commoners. {{sfnb|ClartCrowe|2009|p= 10-11}}\n\nAfter retiring from teaching in 2001, Overmyer continued to publish. He edited ''Local Religion in North China in the Twentieth Century: The Structure and Organization of Community Rituals and Beliefs.'' (E. J. Brill, 2009) and a special issue of ''The China Quarterly'', \"Religion in China Today.\" He was visiting scholar at the Graduate Institute of Religious Studies of [[National Chengchi University]] in Taipei, Taiwan, February to July 2002.\n\nAmong his students at Oberlin were Randall Nadeau<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&pg=PA136&dq=chinese+religion+syncretic#v=onepage&q=overmyer&f=false|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions|isbn=9781444361971|author1=Nadeau|first1=Randall L|date=2012-03-12}}pp. iv-v</ref> and [[Stephen F.

Overmyer''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} (born 1935) is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Asian Studies and the Centre for Chinese Research at the [[University of British Columbia]], Overmyer's publications have concerned Chinese popular thought, religion, and culture; popular religious sects of the late traditional and modern periods and their texts; and local rituals and beliefs practiced in villages, especially North China.\n\nIn 2002 colleagues and former students organized a conference in honor of his retirement. The essays and presentations were published in a [[festschrift]], ''The People and the Dao'', (Monumenta Serica Monograph Series LX). In 1988, he was elected Fellow in the [[Royal Society of Canada]], and elected to the American Society for the Study of Religion <ref>[http://www.assr-religion.org/members.html American Society for the Study of Religion] (Accessed September 23, 2016)</ref> and Honorary Professor in the Faculty of Arts at [[Shanghai Normal University]]. He has been a member of the editorial board of [[China Review International]], [[Journal of Chinese Religions]], Minsu Quyi'' (A Journal Of Chinese Folk Drama, Literature, And Religion), and ''Ching Feng'', a Hong Kong journal of ecumenical Christianity.\n\n==Early life and education==\nOvermyer was born on August 20, 1935, in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He graduated in 1957 from [[Westmar College]] in Le Mars, Iowa, earning his B.A. in Biology. In 1960 he received a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] from [[Evangelical Theological Seminary]] in [[Naperville, Illinois]].{{sfnb|Overmyer|2016| p = 24}} {{sfnb|University_of_Chicago_Divinity_School| }}\n\nHe then earned a [[master's degree]] in the [[history of religions]] in 1966 and a PhD in Chinese religion in 1971 from the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], where he studied with [[Mircea Eliade]], and [[Joseph Kitagawa]] among others. When he suggested that folk popular sects as a topic for his dissertation, one of his advisers, Professor [[Ho Ping-ti]] said that these groups were only rebels and outlaws, but Professor [[Philip Kuhn]] encouraged him to pursue these heretics and bandits as a promising topic.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2016| p = 32-33}}\n\nOvermyer then studied in Taiwan at the Inter-University Center for Chinese Language. He later described a turning point while in Taiwan when he discovered that the \"heretics and bandits\" were in fact popular religious sects much like those found in many parts of the world, including in some forms of Christianity. One evening while attending a scholarly lecture,\n::from across the street I heard the \u201ctok tok\u201d sound of a small wooden drum accompanying the chanting of scriptures, so I left the lecture room and found a small group of people wearing aqua colored jackets and pants dancing slowly in the street while thumping their chests. They appeared to be in trance; as taxis drove by, they were gently herded to the side by others, all of this in front of a small storefront chapel. \nOn an altar in the back of this chapel was the image of a female deity, Yaoji jinmu, \u201cThe Golden Mother of the Jasper Pond\u201d, whom he recognized as a variant of [[Wusheng Laomu]], \u201cThe Eternal Venerable Mother\u201d, the chief deity of the groups he had been studying in traditional written texts.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2016| p = 35}}\n\n==Academic career==\nOvermyer's teaching career began in the Department of Religion at [[Oberlin College]], Ohio, in 1970. After three years, he was invited to the University of British Columbia. He was granted tenure in 1977 and taught Chinese religion and philosophy there until he retired in 2001. During that time held visiting professorships at Princeton University (1983), [[University of Heidelberg]] (1993), and [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (1996\u201398).\n\n==Research interests and impact==\n\nOvermeyer's student Philip Clart wrote that Overmyer's scholarship was unique in its \"attention to religion in its less well-known manifestations, religion located along paths less travelled by scholars,\" the religious life of common people. {{sfnb|ClartCrowe|2009|p = 10}}  Clart continues that Overmyer's \"methodological choice to study religion as it was and is lived by real people rather than as an abstract system of ideas and doctrines is not limited to the study of popular religions, but has applicability across the sphere of Chinese religious traditions.{{sfnb|ClartCrowe|2009|p = 21 }}\n\nHis first book, ''Folk Buddhist Religion: Dissenting Sects in Late Traditional China'', published by Harvard University Press in 1976, grew out of his doctoral dissertation. [[Paul Cohen]]'s ''[[Discovering History in China]]'' says that Overmyer exploits new kinds of sources materials -- sectarian scriptures or \"precious scrolls\" (baojuan) -- to give a \"bottom up\" view and access an \"interior view\" of reality as experienced by participants rather than described by outsiders.\n<ref>{{cite book |last = Cohen |first = Paul A. |year = 2010 |title = Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zzLhbITD4bgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Overmyer&f=false |edition = 2nd|publisher = Columbia University Press| location = New York |isbn = 9780231151924|ref = none}},  [https://books.google.com/books?id=zzLhbITD4bgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Overmyer&f=false pp. 175-177]</ref> A reviewer called it <ref>{{cite |url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies/article/overmyerdaniel-l-folk-buddhist-religion-dissenting-sects-in-late-traditional-china-harvard-east-asian-series-83-xi-295-pp-cambridge-mass-and-london-harvard-university-press-1976-1680-1050/E71BB125E50A77F078C5FF0DA0553D68 | title = Review| journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies| volume = 40 |number= 3 |year =1977| pp = 677\u201378| doi= 10.1017/S0041977X00046802}}</ref> The book was awarded the American Council of Learned Societies Prize in 1979 for \"the best first book written by an historian of religions in the last three years.\"\n\nHis next monograph, ''The Flying Phoenix: Aspects of Chinese Sectarianism in Taiwan'' (Princeton, 1986), written with [[David K. Jordan]], followed by survey written for undergraduates and the general public, ''Religions of China: The World as a Living System'' (Harper & Row, 1986).\n\n''Precious Volumes: an Introduction to Chinese Sectarian Scriptures from the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'' (Harvard, 1999) expanded on his insight that texts play a major role in the religious life of commoners, not only the canonical texts of the great traditions. This volume took these texts as its sole focus, arguing for their value as documents of popular religious thought and windows into the religious experience of commoners. {{sfnb|ClartCrowe|2009|p= 10-11}}\n\nAfter retiring from teaching in 2001, Overmyer continued to publish. He edited ''Local Religion in North China in the Twentieth Century: The Structure and Organization of Community Rituals and Beliefs.'' (E. J. Brill, 2009) and a special issue of ''The China Quarterly'', \"Religion in China Today.\" He was visiting scholar at the Graduate Institute of Religious Studies of [[National Chengchi University]] in Taipei, Taiwan, February to July 2002.\n\nAmong his students at Oberlin were Randall Nadeau<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&pg=PA136&dq=chinese+religion+syncretic#v=onepage&q=overmyer&f=false|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions|isbn=9781444361971|author1=Nadeau|first1=Randall L|date=2012-03-12}}pp. iv-v</ref> and [[Stephen F.

Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.\n\n''Intrinsic'' cognitive load is the effort associated with a specific topic, ''extraneous'' cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner, and ''germane'' cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a [[schema (psychology)|schema]].\n\nCognitive load theory was developed  in the late 1980s out of a study of [[problem solving]] by [[John Sweller]].<ref name=\"Sweller, 1988\">{{cite journal|last1=Sweller|first1=J|title=Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=June 1988|volume=12|issue=2|pages=257\u2013285|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4|url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/1988v12/i02/p0257p0285/main.pdf}}</ref> Sweller argued that [[instructional design]] can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners.\nMuch later, other researchers developed a way to measure perceived mental effort which is indicative of cognitive load.<ref name=Paas1993>{{cite journal|last1=Paas|first1=Fred G.

Working memory, however, is extremely limited in both capacity and duration. These limitations will, under some conditions, impede learning. Heavy cognitive load can have negative effects on task completion, and it is important to note that the experience of cognitive load is not the same in everyone. The elderly, students, and children experience different, and more often higher, amounts of cognitive load. \n\nThe fundamental tenet of cognitive load theory is that the quality of instructional design will be raised if greater consideration is given to the role and limitations, of working memory. As a practical strategy, the application of instructional designer can significantly reduce cognitive load. As a practical example, consistent formatting of elements can greatly reduce cognitive load by minimizing the need for active orientation. \n\nWith increased distractions, particularly from cell phone use, students are more prone to experiencing high cognitive load which can reduce academic success.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frein|first1=Scott T.|last2=Jones|first2=Samantha L.|last3=Gerow|first3=Jennifer E.|title=When it comes to Facebook there may be more to bad memory than just multitasking|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=November 2013|volume=29|issue=6|pages=2179\u20132182|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.031}}</ref>\n\n==Theory==\n\"Cognitive load theory has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance\".<ref name=\"Sweller et al., 1998\">{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Van Merri\u00ebnboer, J. |author3=Paas, F.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1998 |title=Cognitive architecture and instructional design |journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]] |volume= 10 |issue=3 |pages=251\u2013296 |doi=10.1023/A:1022193728205}}</ref> Sweller's theory employs aspects of [[information processing]] theory to emphasize the inherent limitations of concurrent [[working memory]] load on learning during instruction.

In his classic paper,<ref name=\"Miller, 1956\">{{cite journal |author=Miller, G.A. |year=1956 |title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity to process information  |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |pages=81\u201397 |doi=10.1037/h0043158 |pmid=13310704 |issue=2|titlelink=The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }}</ref> Miller was perhaps the first to suggest our [[Working memory#Capacity|working memory capacity]] has inherent limits.  His experimental results suggested that humans are generally able to hold only [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|seven plus or minus two units]] of information in short-term memory. And in the early 1970s Simon and Chase<ref name=\"Simon and Chase, 1973\">{{cite journal |author1=Chase, W.G.  |author2=Simon, H.A. |year=1973 |title=Perception in chess |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=55\u201381 |doi= 10.1016/0010-0285(73)90004-2|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}</ref> were the first to use the term \"chunk\" to describe how people might organize information in short-term memory. This chunking of memory components has also been described as [[schema (psychology)|schema]] construction.\n\nIn the late 1980s [[John Sweller]] developed cognitive load theory (CLT) while studying problem solving.<ref name=\"Sweller, 1988\"/> Studying learners as they solved problems, he and his associates found that learners often use a problem solving strategy called [[means-ends analysis]]. He suggests problem solving by means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity, which may not be devoted to schema construction. Sweller suggests that instructional designers should prevent this unnecessary cognitive load by designing instructional materials which do not involve problem solving. Examples of alternative instructional materials include what are known as worked-examples and goal-free problems.\n\nIn the 1990s, cognitive load theory was applied in several contexts. The empirical results from these studies led to the demonstration of several learning effects: the completion-problem effect;<ref name=\"Paas, 1992\">{{cite journal |author=Paas, F. |year=1992 |title=Training strategies for attaining transfer of problem-solving skill in statistics: A cognitive-load approach |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=429\u2013434 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429}}</ref> [[modality effect]];<ref name=\"Moreno & Mayer, 1999\">{{cite journal |author1=Moreno, R. |author2=Mayer, R.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1999 |title=Cognitive principles of multimedia learning: The role of modality and contiguity |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=358\u2013368 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.358|citeseerx=10.1.1.458.4719  }}</ref><ref name=\"Mousavi, Low, & Sweller, 1995\">{{cite journal |author1=Mousavi, S. |author2=Low, R. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=319\u2013334 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.87.2.319|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.2089 }}</ref> [[split-attention effect]];<ref name=\"Chandler and Sweller, 1992\">{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1992 |title=The split-attention effect as a factor in the design of instruction |journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=62 |issue=2  |pages=233\u2013246 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.1992.tb01017.x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2024a12faabcce9731a0bf4e59ec05d63413dac5 }}</ref> [[worked-example effect]];<ref name=\"Cooper & Sweller, 1987\">{{cite journal |author1=Cooper, G. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=Effects of schema acquisition and rule automation on mathematical problem-solving transfer |journal= Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=347\u2013362 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.4.347}}</ref><ref name=\"Sweller & Cooper, 1985\">{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Cooper, G.A.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1985 |title=The use of worked examples as a substitute for problem solving in learning algebra |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59\u201389 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0201_3}}</ref> and [[expertise reversal effect]].<ref name=\"Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003\">{{cite journal |author1=Kalyuga, S. |author2=Ayres, P.

Specifically, it provides empirically-based guidelines that help instructional designers decrease extraneous cognitive load during learning and thus refocus the learner's attention toward germane materials, thereby increasing germane (schema related) cognitive load. This theory differentiates between three types of cognitive load: intrinsic cognitive load, germane cognitive load, and extraneous cognitive load.<ref name=\"Sweller et al., 1998\" />\n\n===Intrinsic===\n''Intrinsic cognitive load'' is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic. The term was first used in the early 1990s by Chandler and Sweller.<ref name=\"Chandler & Sweller, 1991\">{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P.  |author2=Sweller, J. |year=1991 |title=Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=293\u2013332 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/edupapers/128 }}</ref> According to them, all instructions have an inherent difficulty associated with them (e.g., the calculation of 2 + 2, versus solving a [[differential equation]]). This inherent difficulty may not be altered by an instructor. However, many schemas may be broken into individual \"subschemas\" and taught in isolation, to be later brought back together and described as a combined whole.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1|title=Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=41|issue=2|pages=75\u201386|year=2006|last1=Kirschner|first1=Paul A.|last2=Sweller|first2=John|last3=Clark|first3=Richard E.|url=http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329224506/http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-29|hdl=1874/16899}}</ref>\n\n===Extraneous===\n''Extraneous cognitive load'' is generated by the manner in which information is presented to learners and is under the control of instructional designers.<ref name=\"Chandler & Sweller, 1991\" /> This load can be attributed to the design of the instructional materials. Because there is a single limited cognitive resource using resources to process the extraneous load, the number of resources available to process the intrinsic load and germane load (i.e., learning) is reduced. Thus, especially when intrinsic and/or germane load is high (i.e., when a problem is difficult), materials should be designed so as to reduce the extraneous load.<ref name=\"Ginns, 2006\">{{cite journal |author=Ginns, P. |year= 2006 |title=Integrating information: A meta-analysis of the spatial contiguity and temporal contiguity effects |journal=Learning and Instruction |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=511\u2013525 |doi= 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.10.001}}</ref>\n\nAn example of extraneous cognitive load occurs when there are two possible ways to describe a square to a student.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Clark, R. |author2=Nguyen, F. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2006 |title=Efficiency in Learning: Evidence-Based Guidelines to Manage Cognitive Load |location=San Francisco |publisher=Pfeiffer |isbn=978-0-7879-7728-3}}</ref> A square is a figure and should be described using a figural medium. Certainly an instructor can describe a square in a verbal medium, but it takes just a second and far less effort to see what the instructor is talking about when a learner is shown a square, rather than having one described verbally. In this instance, the efficiency of the visual medium is preferred. This is because it does not unduly load the learner with unnecessary information. This unnecessary cognitive load is described as extraneous.\n\nChandler and Sweller introduced the concept of extraneous cognitive load. This article was written to report the results of six experiments that they conducted to investigate this working memory load. Many of these experiments involved materials demonstrating the [[split attention effect]]. They found that the format of instructional materials either promoted or limited learning. They proposed that differences in performance were due to higher levels of the cognitive load imposed by the format of instruction. \"Extraneous cognitive load\" is a term for this unnecessary (artificially induced) cognitive load.\n\n===Germane===\n''Germane cognitive load'' is the processing, construction and automation of [[schema (psychology)|schemas]]. It was first described by Sweller, Van Merri\u00ebnboer and Paas in 1998. While [[intrinsic cognitive load]] is generally thought to be immutable (although techniques can be applied to manage complexity by segmenting and sequencing complex material), instructional designers can manipulate extraneous and germane load. It is suggested that they limit extraneous load and promote germane load.<ref name=\"Sweller et al., 1998\"/>\n\nUntil the 1998 article by Sweller, Van Merri\u00ebnboer & Paas, cognitive load theory primarily concentrated on the reduction of extraneous cognitive load. With this article, cognitive load researchers began to seek ways of redesigning instruction to redirect what would be extraneous load, to now be focused toward schema construction (germane load). Thus it is very important for instructional designers to \"reduce extraneous cognitive load and redirect learners' attention to cognitive processes that are directly relevant to the construction of schemas\".<ref>(Sweller et al., 1998, p. 265)</ref>\n\n==Measurement==\nPaas and Van Merri\u00ebnboer<ref name=Paas1993/> developed a construct (known as relative condition efficiency) which helps researchers measure perceived mental effort, an index of cognitive load. This construct provides a relatively simple means of comparing instructional conditions. It combines mental effort ratings with performance scores. Group mean z-scores are graphed and may be compared with a one-way [[ANOVA|Analysis of variance (ANOVA)]].\n\nPaas and Van Merri\u00ebnboer used relative condition efficiency to compare three instructional conditions (worked examples, completion problems, and discovery practice). They found learners who studied worked examples were the most efficient, followed by those who used the problem completion strategy. Since this early study many other researchers have used this and other constructs to measure cognitive load as it relates to learning and instruction.<ref name=\"Paas et al.

This chunking of memory components has also been described as [[schema (psychology)|schema]] construction.\n\nIn the late 1980s [[John Sweller]] developed cognitive load theory (CLT) while studying problem solving.<ref name=\"Sweller, 1988\"/> Studying learners as they solved problems, he and his associates found that learners often use a problem solving strategy called [[means-ends analysis]]. He suggests problem solving by means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity, which may not be devoted to schema construction. Sweller suggests that instructional designers should prevent this unnecessary cognitive load by designing instructional materials which do not involve problem solving. Examples of alternative instructional materials include what are known as worked-examples and goal-free problems.\n\nIn the 1990s, cognitive load theory was applied in several contexts. The empirical results from these studies led to the demonstration of several learning effects: the completion-problem effect;<ref name=\"Paas, 1992\">{{cite journal |author=Paas, F. |year=1992 |title=Training strategies for attaining transfer of problem-solving skill in statistics: A cognitive-load approach |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=429\u2013434 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429}}</ref> [[modality effect]];<ref name=\"Moreno & Mayer, 1999\">{{cite journal |author1=Moreno, R. |author2=Mayer, R.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1999 |title=Cognitive principles of multimedia learning: The role of modality and contiguity |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=358\u2013368 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.358|citeseerx=10.1.1.458.4719  }}</ref><ref name=\"Mousavi, Low, & Sweller, 1995\">{{cite journal |author1=Mousavi, S. |author2=Low, R. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=319\u2013334 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.87.2.319|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.2089 }}</ref> [[split-attention effect]];<ref name=\"Chandler and Sweller, 1992\">{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1992 |title=The split-attention effect as a factor in the design of instruction |journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=62 |issue=2  |pages=233\u2013246 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.1992.tb01017.x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2024a12faabcce9731a0bf4e59ec05d63413dac5 }}</ref> [[worked-example effect]];<ref name=\"Cooper & Sweller, 1987\">{{cite journal |author1=Cooper, G. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=Effects of schema acquisition and rule automation on mathematical problem-solving transfer |journal= Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=347\u2013362 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.4.347}}</ref><ref name=\"Sweller & Cooper, 1985\">{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Cooper, G.A.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1985 |title=The use of worked examples as a substitute for problem solving in learning algebra |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59\u201389 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0201_3}}</ref> and [[expertise reversal effect]].<ref name=\"Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003\">{{cite journal |author1=Kalyuga, S. |author2=Ayres, P.

Specifically, it provides empirically-based guidelines that help instructional designers decrease extraneous cognitive load during learning and thus refocus the learner's attention toward germane materials, thereby increasing germane (schema related) cognitive load. This theory differentiates between three types of cognitive load: intrinsic cognitive load, germane cognitive load, and extraneous cognitive load.<ref name=\"Sweller et al., 1998\" />\n\n===Intrinsic===\n''Intrinsic cognitive load'' is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic. The term was first used in the early 1990s by Chandler and Sweller.<ref name=\"Chandler & Sweller, 1991\">{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P.  |author2=Sweller, J. |year=1991 |title=Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=293\u2013332 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/edupapers/128 }}</ref> According to them, all instructions have an inherent difficulty associated with them (e.g., the calculation of 2 + 2, versus solving a [[differential equation]]). This inherent difficulty may not be altered by an instructor. However, many schemas may be broken into individual \"subschemas\" and taught in isolation, to be later brought back together and described as a combined whole.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1|title=Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=41|issue=2|pages=75\u201386|year=2006|last1=Kirschner|first1=Paul A.|last2=Sweller|first2=John|last3=Clark|first3=Richard E.|url=http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329224506/http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-29|hdl=1874/16899}}</ref>\n\n===Extraneous===\n''Extraneous cognitive load'' is generated by the manner in which information is presented to learners and is under the control of instructional designers.<ref name=\"Chandler & Sweller, 1991\" /> This load can be attributed to the design of the instructional materials. Because there is a single limited cognitive resource using resources to process the extraneous load, the number of resources available to process the intrinsic load and germane load (i.e., learning) is reduced. Thus, especially when intrinsic and/or germane load is high (i.e., when a problem is difficult), materials should be designed so as to reduce the extraneous load.<ref name=\"Ginns, 2006\">{{cite journal |author=Ginns, P. |year= 2006 |title=Integrating information: A meta-analysis of the spatial contiguity and temporal contiguity effects |journal=Learning and Instruction |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=511\u2013525 |doi= 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.10.001}}</ref>\n\nAn example of extraneous cognitive load occurs when there are two possible ways to describe a square to a student.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Clark, R. |author2=Nguyen, F. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2006 |title=Efficiency in Learning: Evidence-Based Guidelines to Manage Cognitive Load |location=San Francisco |publisher=Pfeiffer |isbn=978-0-7879-7728-3}}</ref> A square is a figure and should be described using a figural medium. Certainly an instructor can describe a square in a verbal medium, but it takes just a second and far less effort to see what the instructor is talking about when a learner is shown a square, rather than having one described verbally. In this instance, the efficiency of the visual medium is preferred. This is because it does not unduly load the learner with unnecessary information. This unnecessary cognitive load is described as extraneous.\n\nChandler and Sweller introduced the concept of extraneous cognitive load. This article was written to report the results of six experiments that they conducted to investigate this working memory load. Many of these experiments involved materials demonstrating the [[split attention effect]]. They found that the format of instructional materials either promoted or limited learning. They proposed that differences in performance were due to higher levels of the cognitive load imposed by the format of instruction. \"Extraneous cognitive load\" is a term for this unnecessary (artificially induced) cognitive load.\n\n===Germane===\n''Germane cognitive load'' is the processing, construction and automation of [[schema (psychology)|schemas]]. It was first described by Sweller, Van Merri\u00ebnboer and Paas in 1998. While [[intrinsic cognitive load]] is generally thought to be immutable (although techniques can be applied to manage complexity by segmenting and sequencing complex material), instructional designers can manipulate extraneous and germane load. It is suggested that they limit extraneous load and promote germane load.<ref name=\"Sweller et al., 1998\"/>\n\nUntil the 1998 article by Sweller, Van Merri\u00ebnboer & Paas, cognitive load theory primarily concentrated on the reduction of extraneous cognitive load. With this article, cognitive load researchers began to seek ways of redesigning instruction to redirect what would be extraneous load, to now be focused toward schema construction (germane load). Thus it is very important for instructional designers to \"reduce extraneous cognitive load and redirect learners' attention to cognitive processes that are directly relevant to the construction of schemas\".<ref>(Sweller et al., 1998, p. 265)</ref>\n\n==Measurement==\nPaas and Van Merri\u00ebnboer<ref name=Paas1993/> developed a construct (known as relative condition efficiency) which helps researchers measure perceived mental effort, an index of cognitive load. This construct provides a relatively simple means of comparing instructional conditions. It combines mental effort ratings with performance scores. Group mean z-scores are graphed and may be compared with a one-way [[ANOVA|Analysis of variance (ANOVA)]].\n\nPaas and Van Merri\u00ebnboer used relative condition efficiency to compare three instructional conditions (worked examples, completion problems, and discovery practice).
