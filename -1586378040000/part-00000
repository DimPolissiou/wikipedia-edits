As an Independent Liberal and supporter of [[H H Asquith]] he was not the recipient of the [[The Coalition Coupon|coalition \u2018coupon\u2019]] which went instead to his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Coalition Conservative]] opponent, [[Harry Wrightson]]. In a straight fight between Coalition Conservative and Liberal candidates, Wrightson emerged the winner with a healthy majority of 5,668 votes.  Within days of the declaration of poll however, Wrightson contracted [[influenza]], which deteriorated to [[pneumonia]], and he died early in 1919, aged 44, six days before the new Parliament met and so was never able to take his seat.\n\n===Leyton West by-election===\nWrightson's death necessitated a [[1919 Leyton West by-election|by-election]] and Newbould was again chosen to stand for the Liberals. His opponent was another Coalition Conservative, James Francis Mason. Once again there was no [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour candidate]]. In the by-election Newbould's main campaign points were the abolition of conscription and a crackdown on profiteering <ref>The Times, 17 February 1919</ref> the first policy was said to appeal to men and the second to women.<ref>The Times, 1 March 1919</ref> Unfortunately for part of the contest he was confined to bed with a bad cold and his wife was engaged as principal canvasser on his behalf <ref>The Times, 26 February 1919</ref> On a turnout of 42.5%, (down from the general election turnout of 49.9%) Newbould won what was seen as an important victory for the Asquithian Liberals improving his share of the vote from 32.6% at the general election to 57.3% in the by-election. According to psephologist John Ramsden, this amounted to a swing of 24.8% and was statistically one of the worst by-election reverses of the 1918-1922 government.<ref>Chris Cook and John Ramsden, By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press 1997, p16</ref>\n\n===Liberal Reunion===\nNewbould was an advocate of Liberal reunion in the early 1920s, before the fall of the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Lloyd George coalition]]. He co-hosted a function with [[John Wallace (Scottish politician)|John Wallace]] the Coalition Liberal MP for [[Dunfermline Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline Burghs]] in June 1921 attended by about 40 MPs from both sides of the Liberal divide with the aim of stimulating the process of reunion. It was not a gathering which had the approval or endorsement of either  the Independent or Coalition Liberal headquarters but an opportunity for individuals from both wings of the party to re-affirm their beliefs in [[Liberalism]] as a creed and to make public statements in support of traditional Liberal policies such as [[Free Trade]], [[Irish Home Rule|Ireland]] and the economy.<ref>The Times, 22 June 1921</ref> However a few weeks later this particular movement towards reconciliation within the Liberal family foundered, mainly as a result of the Independent Liberals\u2019 fear that their approaches would be viewed as a willingness to become formally associated with [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and their determination to let it be known that they could not contemplate the possibility that Lloyd George might one day lead the party again.<ref>The Times, 23 July 1921</ref>\n\n===Other Parliamentary contests===\nNewbould lost his seat at Leyton West in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] to Conservative candidate [[James Cassels (politician)|James Cassels]] in a three-cornered contest, with Labour candidate Alfred Smith (later MP for Sunderland from 1929\u201331) also entering the fray.  He tried to win it back at the next opportunity in [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]] again facing a three-cornered contest with Cassels and Smith and came agonisingly close to regaining the seat, Cassels holding on by a majority of 64 votes (or 0.2% of the poll). Newbould fought Leyton West again in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]] but this time came third in the poll behind the victorious Cassels and Smith in second place.  He did not stand for Parliament again.<ref>F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918-1949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949  p171</ref>\n\n===Other Liberal activity===\nIn 1927 he was nominated by the London Liberal Federation to sit on a committee of the Liberal Party under the chairmanship of [[Sydney Buxton, 1st Earl Buxton|Lord Buxton]], to look into the organisation and health of the party in London constituencies.\n\nIn 1928 he stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals in the Hackney North constituency at the [[London County Council]] elections.<ref>The Times, 9 March 1928</ref>\n\n==Death==\nNewbould died at [[Ferring]]-by-Sea in [[West Sussex]], where he had his home, aged 78 years on 25 April 1952.<ref name=\"The Times, 6 May 1952\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-par|uk}}\n{{Succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Leyton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leyton West]]\n | years  = [[1919 Leyton West by-election|1919]]\u2013[[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n | before = [[Harry Wrightson]]\n | after  = [[James Cassels (politician)|James Cassels]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Newbould, Alfred Ernest}}\n[[Category:1873 births]]\n[[Category:1952 deaths]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of the Second Boer War]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:People from Burton upon Trent]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1918\u20131922]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the soccer player|Alf Newbold}}\n'''Alfred Ernest Newbould''' (24 October 1873 \u2013 25 April 1952) was a British cinematographer and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician.<ref name=deb>{{Cite book|title=Debrett's House of Commons and the Judicial Bench illustrated with 500 armorial engravings |year=1922 |publisher=Dean & Son |location=London |isbn= |page=118 |pages= |url=https://archive.org/download/debrettshouseo1922londuoft/debrettshouseo1922londuoft_bw.pdf |accessdate=12 May 2009 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Family and Education==\nNewbould was born in [[Burton upon Trent]] in [[Staffordshire]],<ref name=\"The Times, 6 May 1952\">{{Cite news|title=Obituary: Mr A.

By 1916 he was working with his brother George at ''Craig Gardiner & Co'', a firm of accountants in [[Dawson Street]], Dublin. He worked with [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a part-time fellow clerk and the two struck up a friendship. In his spare time McGrath worked as secretary for the Volunteer Dependents' Fund.<ref name=\"Mackay\">James Alexander Mackay, ''Michael Collins: a life'', Mainstream Publishing, 1996</ref>\n\nHe soon joined the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. He fought in [[Marrowbone Lane]] in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. McGrath was arrested after the rising, and jailed in [[Wormwood Scrubs]] and [[Brixton]] prisons in England. In the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]], he was elected as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] for the [[Dublin St James's (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin St James's]] constituency, later sitting in the [[First D\u00e1il]].<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=990|title=Joseph McGrath|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[Irish Republican Army]], the [[guerrilla]] army of the [[Irish Republic]], and successfully organised many bank robberies during the [[Irish war of Independence]] (1919\u20131921), where a small percentage of the proceeds was retained as a reward by him and his fellow-soldiers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Marie |last=Coleman |title=The Irish Sweep: a History of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstake, 1930\u201387 |year=2009 |publisher=University College Dublin Press |place=Dublin |isbn=978-1-906359-40-9 }}</ref> During this time he was interred briefly at [[Abercorn Barracks|Ballykinlar Internment Camp]].

When the [[Provisional Government of Ireland]] was set up in January 1922, McGrath was appointed as [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]].\n\nIn the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922\u20131923, he took the pro-treaty side and was made Director of Intelligence, replacing [[Liam Tobin]].  In a strongly worded letter, written in red ink, McGrath warned Collins not to take his last, ill-fated trip to Cork.<ref name=\"Mackay\"/>\n\nHe was later put in charge of the police Intelligence service of the new [[Irish Free State]], the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Ireland)|Criminal Investigation Department]] or CID. It was modelled on the London [[Metropolitan Police]] department of the same name, but was accused of the torture and killing of a number of [[Irish republican|republican]] (anti-treaty) prisoners during the civil war. It was disbanded at the war's end; the official reason given was that it was unnecessary for a police force in peacetime. McGrath went on to serve as [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]] in the [[Second D\u00e1il]] and the [[Provisional Government of Ireland]]. He also served in the 1st and 2nd [[Government of Ireland|Executive Councils]] holding the Industry and Commerce portfolio.\n\nMcGrath resigned from office in April 1924 because of dissatisfaction with the government's attitude to the [[Irish Army Mutiny|Army Mutiny]] officers and as he said himself,\n:''government by a clique and by the officialdom of the old regime.''\nBy this he meant that former IRA fighters were being overlooked and that the Republican goals on all Ireland had been sidelined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie:80/D/0006/D.0006.192404030029.html |work=D\u00e1il Debates |title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 6 |date=3 April 1924 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609194406/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0006/D.0006.192404030029.html |archivedate= 9 June 2011 }}</ref> McGrath and eight other TDs who had resigned from Cumann na nGaedheal then resigned their seats to contest by-elections, running as the [[National Party (Ireland, 1924)|National Party]]. However, Cumann na nGaedheal won seven of these and Sinn F\u00e9in won the other two.\n\n==Business interests==\nFollowing his political career he went on to become involved in the building trade. In 1925 he became labour adviser to [[Siemens-Schuckert]], German contractors for the [[Ardnacrusha power plant|Ardnacrusha]] hydro-electric scheme near [[Limerick]]. McGrath founded the [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake]] in 1930, and the success of its sweepstakes made him an extremely wealthy man. He used his IRA connections to promote the lottery worldwide, mostly in jurisdictions where it was illegal.

By 1916 he was working with his brother George at ''Craig Gardiner & Co'', a firm of accountants in [[Dawson Street]], Dublin. He worked with [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a part-time fellow clerk and the two struck up a friendship. In his spare time McGrath worked as secretary for the Volunteer Dependents' Fund.<ref name=\"Mackay\">James Alexander Mackay, ''Michael Collins: a life'', Mainstream Publishing, 1996</ref>\n\nHe soon joined the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. He fought in [[Marrowbone Lane]] in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. McGrath was arrested after the rising, and jailed in [[Wormwood Scrubs]] and [[Brixton]] prisons in England. In the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]], he was elected as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] for the [[Dublin St James's (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin St James's]] constituency, later sitting in the [[First D\u00e1il]].<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=990|title=Joseph McGrath|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[Irish Republican Army]], the [[guerrilla]] army of the [[Irish Republic]], and successfully organised many bank robberies during the [[Irish war of Independence]] (1919\u20131921), where a small percentage of the proceeds was retained as a reward by him and his fellow-soldiers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Marie |last=Coleman |title=The Irish Sweep: a History of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstake, 1930\u201387 |year=2009 |publisher=University College Dublin Press |place=Dublin |isbn=978-1-906359-40-9 }}</ref> During this time he was interred briefly at [[Abercorn Barracks|Ballykinlar Internment Camp]].

When the [[Provisional Government of Ireland]] was set up in January 1922, McGrath was appointed as [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]].\n\nIn the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922\u20131923, he took the pro-treaty side and was made Director of Intelligence, replacing [[Liam Tobin]].  In a strongly worded letter, written in red ink, McGrath warned Collins not to take his last, ill-fated trip to Cork.<ref name=\"Mackay\"/>\n\nHe was later put in charge of the police Intelligence service of the new [[Irish Free State]], the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Ireland)|Criminal Investigation Department]] or CID. It was modelled on the London [[Metropolitan Police]] department of the same name, but was accused of the torture and killing of a number of [[Irish republican|republican]] (anti-treaty) prisoners during the civil war. It was disbanded at the war's end; the official reason given was that it was unnecessary for a police force in peacetime. McGrath went on to serve as [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]] in the [[Second D\u00e1il]] and the [[Provisional Government of Ireland]]. He also served in the 1st and 2nd [[Government of Ireland|Executive Councils]] holding the Industry and Commerce portfolio.\n\nMcGrath resigned from office in April 1924 because of dissatisfaction with the government's attitude to the [[Irish Army Mutiny|Army Mutiny]] officers and as he said himself,\n:''government by a clique and by the officialdom of the old regime.''\nBy this he meant that former IRA fighters were being overlooked and that the Republican goals on all Ireland had been sidelined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie:80/D/0006/D.0006.192404030029.html |work=D\u00e1il Debates |title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 6 |date=3 April 1924 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609194406/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0006/D.0006.192404030029.html |archivedate= 9 June 2011 }}</ref> McGrath and eight other TDs who had resigned from Cumann na nGaedheal then resigned their seats to contest by-elections, running as the [[National Party (Ireland, 1924)|National Party]]. However, Cumann na nGaedheal won seven of these and Sinn F\u00e9in won the other two.\n\n==Business interests==\nFollowing his political career he went on to become involved in the building trade. In 1925 he became labour adviser to [[Siemens-Schuckert]], German contractors for the [[Ardnacrusha power plant|Ardnacrusha]] hydro-electric scheme near [[Limerick]]. McGrath founded the [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake]] in 1930, and the success of its sweepstakes made him an extremely wealthy man. He used his IRA connections to promote the lottery worldwide, mostly in jurisdictions where it was illegal. He was criticised for dubious business practices, such as finding ticket holders who had drawn a horse and offering them a fraction of its value. There were also accusations that the trefoil of a winning ticket would sometimes simply disappear, and the excuse given that customs had seized it; these were never successfully proven.
