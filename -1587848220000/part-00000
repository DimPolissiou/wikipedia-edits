During the [[First World War]], the neighborhood was known as \"Red Wedding\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the [[Joint State Political Directorate|Soviet secret police]], Mielke described his father as \"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). After his remarriage to \"a seamstress,\" the elder Mielke and his new wife joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and remained members when it was renamed the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD). His son Erich claimed \"My younger brother Kurt and two sisters were Communist sympathisers.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), p. 44.</ref>\n\nDespite his family's poverty, Erich Mielke was academically gifted enough to be awarded a free scholarship in the prestigious [[:de: K\u00f6llnisches Gymnasium|K\u00f6llnisches Gymnasium]], but was expelled on 19 February 1929, for being \"unable to meet the great demands of this school.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 44-45.</ref> While attending the Gymnasium, Mielke joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in 1925, and worked as a reporter for the [[communist]] newspaper ''[[Rote Fahne]]'' from 1928 to 1931. \n\nDuring the [[Weimar Republic]], the KPD was the largest communist party in [[Europe]] and was seen as the \"leading party\" of the communist movement outside the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): ''Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918\u20131933'', London: Lawrence & Wishart, p. 2</ref> Under [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]]'s leadership, the KPD was completely obedient to Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], and from 1928 the Party was both funded and controlled by the [[Comintern]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=\"Hoppe\">{{cite book |last=Hoppe |first=Bert |year=2011 |title=In Stalins Gefolgschaft: Moskau und die KPD 1928\u20131933 |url= |location= |publisher= Oldenbourg Verlag |page= |isbn= 9783486711738 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\nUntil the end of the Republic, the KPD viewed the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), which dominated German politics between 1918 and 1931, as their mortal enemy.<ref name=\"Hoppe\" /> In keeping with Stalin's policy towards [[Social Democracy]], the KPD considered all SPD members to be \"[[social fascism|social fascists]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Winner |first=David |date= |title=How the left enabled fascism: Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, leader of Germany's radical left in the last years of the Weimar Republic, thought the centre left was a greater danger than the right|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2018/10/how-left-enabled-fascism |work=[[New Statesman]] |location= |access-date= }}</ref> The KPD also believed that all other [[political party|political parties]] were \"[[fascist]]\" and regarded itself as \"the only [[anti-fascist]] Party\" in Germany.<ref name=\"Hoppe\" /><!-- p. 195 --> Nevertheless, the KPD closely collaborated with the [[Nazi Party]] during the early [[1930s]] and both Parties intended to replace the democratically-elected government of the [[Weimar Republic]] with a [[totalitarian]] [[single party state]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fippel |first1=G\u00fcnter|year= 2003 |title=Antifaschisten in \"antifaschistischer\" Gewalt: mittel- und ostdeutsche Schicksale in den Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Demokratie und Diktatur (1945 bis 1961)|url= |location= |publisher= A.

At the time, the ''Parteiselbstschutz'' in Berlin was commanded by KPD [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Representatives [[Hans Kippenberger]] and [[Heinz Neumann]].\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"Mielke was a special protege of Kippenberger's having taken to his [[paramilitary]] training with the enthusiasm of a [[Prussian Junker]]. [[World War I]] veterans taught the novices how to handle pistols, rifles, [[machine gun]]s, and [[hand grenade]]s. This clandestine training was conducted in the sparsely populated, pastoral countryside surrounding Berlin. Mielke also pleased Kippenberger by being an exceptional student in classes on the arts of conspiratorial behavior and [[espionage]], taught by comrades who had studied at the secret M-school of the [[GRU]] in [[Moscow]].\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 38\">Koehler (1999), page 38.</ref>\n\nAccording to John Koehler, members of the ''Parteiselbstschutz'' \"served as [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s at Party meetings and specialized in cracking heads during street battles with political enemies.\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 38\"/> Besides the ruling SPD and it's paramilitary [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]] forces, the arch-enemies of the ''Parteiselbstschutz'' were the [[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]], which was the armed wing of the [[Monarchist]] [[German National People's Party]] (DVNP), [[Trotskyism|Trotskyites]], and \"radical nationalist parties.\" \n\nAccording to Koehler, the KPD's Selbstschutz men \"always carried a ''Stahlrute'', two steel springs that telescoped into a tube seven inches long, which when extended became a deadly, fourteen-inch weapon. Not to be outdone by the Nazis, these street-fighters were often armed with [[pistol]]s as well.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', p. 38.</ref>\n\nIn a 1931 biography written for the Cadre Division of the [[Comintern]],<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 43-44.</ref> Mielke recalled, \"We took care of all kinds of work; terror acts, protecting illegal demonstrations and meetings, arms-trafficking, etc. The last work, which was accomplished by a Comrade and myself, was the B\u00fclowplatz Affair\" ({{lang-de|\"Wir erledigten hier alle m\u00f6glichen Arbeiten, Terrorakte, Schutz illegaler Demonstrationen und Versammlungen, Waffentransport und reinigung usw.

Today it is the Berlin headquarters of the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party.]]]]\nDuring the last days of the [[Weimar Republic]], the KPD in Berlin had a policy of assassinating a [[Berlin police]] officer in retaliation for every KPD member killed by the police. On August 2, 1931, KPD Members of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] [[Heinz Neumann (politician)|Heinz Neumann]] and [[Hans Kippenberger]] received a dressing down from [[Walter Ulbricht]], the Party's leader in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Enraged by police interference and by Neumann and Kippenberger's failure to follow the policy, Ulbricht snarled, \"At home in [[Saxony]] we would have done something about the police a long time ago. Here in Berlin we will not fool around much longer. Soon we will hit the police in the head.\"<ref>John Koehler, ''The Stasi'', p. 36.</ref>\n\nEnraged by Ulbricht's words, Kippenberger and Neumann decided to assassinate [[Paul Anlauf]], the forty-two-year-old Captain of the Berlin Police's Seventh Precinct. Captain Anlauf, a widower with three daughters, had been nicknamed ''Schweinebacke'', or \"Pig Face\" by the KPD. \n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"Of all the policemen in strife-torn Berlin, the reds hated Anlauf the most. His precinct included the area around [[Karl-Liebknecht-Haus|KPD headquarters]], which made it the most dangerous in the city. The captain almost always led the riot squads that broke up illegal rallies of the Communist Party.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', p. 36.</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Sunday 9 August 1931, Kippenberger and Neumann gave a last briefing to the hit-team in a room at the Lassant beer hall. Mielke and [[Erich Ziemer]] were selected as the shooters. During the meeting, [[Max Matern]] gave a [[Luger pistol]] to fellow lookout Max Thunert and said, \"Now we're getting serious... We're going to give ''Schweinebacke'' something to remember us by.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', pp. 38-39.</ref>\n\nKippenberger then asked Mielke and Ziemer, \"Are you sure that you are ready to shoot ''Schweinebacke''?\"<ref>John Koehler, ''The Stasi'', p. 39.</ref> Mielke responded that he had seen Captain Anlauf many times during police searches of Party Headquarters. Kippenberger then instructed them to wait at a nearby beer hall which would permit them to overlook the entire [[Rosa Luxemburg Platz|B\u00fclow-Platz]]. He further reminded them that Captain Anlauf was accompanied everywhere by Senior Sergeant Max Willig, whom the KPD had nicknamed, ''[[Hussar]]''.\n\nKippenberger concluded, \"When you spot ''Schweinebacke'' and ''Hussar'', you take care of them.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', p. 39.</ref> Mielke and Ziemer were informed that, after the assassinations were completed, a diversion would assist in their escape. They were then to return to their homes and await further instructions.\n\nThat evening, Captain Anlauf was lured to [[Rosa Luxemburg Platz|B\u00fclow-Platz]] by a violent rally demanding the dissolution of the [[Prussian Parliament]]. \n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"As was often the case when it came to battling the dominant SPD, the KPD and the Nazis had combined forces during the pre-[[plebiscite]] campaign. At one point in this particular campaign, [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] propaganda chief [[Joseph Goebbels]] even shared a speaker's platform with KPD agitator [[Walter Ulbricht]]. Both parties wanted the parliament dissolved because they were hoping that new elections would oust the SPD, the sworn enemy of all radicals. That fact explained why the atmosphere was particularly volatile this Sunday.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', pp. 39-40.</ref>\n\n===Murder at the Babylon Cinema===\n[[File:Berlin Babylon 2005.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Babylon Cinema,\" the site of the assassinations of Captains Anlauf and Lenck, as it appears today.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12159, Berlin, Trauerzug f\u00fcr ermordete Polizisten.jpg|thumb|right|The funeral of Captains Anlauf and Lenck was attended by thousands of Berliners.]]\n\nAt eight o'clock that evening, Mielke and Ziemer waited in a doorway as Captain Anlauf, Sergeant Willig, and Captain [[Franz Lenck]] walked toward the Babylon Cinema, which was located at the corner of B\u00fclowplatz and Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stra\u00dfe. As they reached the door of the movie house, the policemen heard someone scream, \"''Schweinebacke''!\"<ref name=\"Stasi41\">''The Stasi'', p. 41.</ref>\n\nAs Captain Anlauf turned toward the sound, Mielke and Ziemer opened fire at point blank range. Sergeant Willig was wounded in the left arm and the stomach. However, he managed to draw his [[Luger pistol]] and fired a full magazine at the assailants. Captain Franz Lenck was shot in the chest and fell dead in front of the entrance. Willig crawled over and cradled the head of Captain Anlauf, who had taken two bullets in the neck. As his life drained away, the Captain gasped, \"''Wiedersehen... Gruss...''\" (\"So Long... Goodbye...\").<ref name=\"Stasi41\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Mielke and Ziemer made their escape by running into the theater and out an emergency exit. They tossed their pistols over a fence, where they were later found by Homicide Detectives from the elite ''Mordkommission''. Mielke and Ziemer then returned to their homes.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 41-42.</ref>\n\nAccording to Koehler, \"Back at B\u00fclowplatz, the killings had triggered a major police action. At least a thousand officers poured into the square, and a bloody street battle ensued. Rocks and bricks were hurled from the rooftops. Communist [[sniper|gunmen]] fired indiscriminately from the roofs of surrounding apartment houses. As darkness fell, police searchlights illuminated the buildings. Using megaphones, officers shouted, 'Clear the streets! Move away from the windows! We are returning fire!' By now the rabble had fled the square, but shooting continued as riot squads combed the tenements, arresting hundreds of residents suspected of having fired weapons. The battle lasted until one o'clock the next morning. In addition to the two police officers, the casualties included one Communist who died of a gunshot wound and seventeen others who were seriously wounded.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 42.</ref>\n\nCaptain Anlauf's wife had died three weeks earlier of kidney failure.<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 41\">Koehler (1999), page 41.</ref> The KPD's murder of Captain Anlauf thus left their three daughters as orphans.

Note 6.</ref>\n\nAfter the murders, the act was celebrated at the ''Lichtenberger Hof'', a favorite [[beer hall]] of the [[Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund]], where Mielke boasted: \"Today we celebrate a job that I pulled!\" ({{lang-de|\"Heute wird ein Ding gefeiert, das ich gedreht habe!\"}})<ref name=\"Mielke\">{{cite web|url=http://home.snafu.de/erich.mielke/Erich_Mielke_/erich_mielke_.html  |title=Erich Mielke - Freund und Genosse (in German)|publisher=Dynamosport.de - Private website on the BFC Dynamo|date=|accessdate=30 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive===\n[[File:Rotmord - Fahndungsplakat der Berliner Polizei (1933).jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"Wanted\" poster, September 1933. \"Help with the Search for the Red Murderers.\" Mielke is top right.]]\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"Kippenberger was alarmed when word reached him that Sergeant Willig had survived the shooting. Not knowing whether the sergeant could talk and identify the attackers, Kippenberger was taking no chances. He directed a runner to summon Mielke and Ziemer to his apartment at 74 Bellermannstrasse, only a few minutes walk from where the two lived. When the assassins arrived, Kippenberger told them the news and ordered them to leave Berlin at once. The parliamentarian's wife Thea, an unemployed schoolteacher and as staunch a Communist Party member as her husband, shepherded the young murderers to the [[Belgium|Belgian]] border. Agents of the Communist International ([[Comintern]]) in the port city of [[Antwerp]] supplied them with money and forged [[passport]]s. Aboard a merchant ship, they sailed for [[Leningrad]]. When their ship docked, they were met by another Comintern representative, who escorted them to [[Moscow]].\"<ref>''The Stasi'', pages 42-43.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1932, Mielke attended the [[Comintern]]'s Military Political school under the alias '''Paul Bach'''. He later graduated from the [[Lenin School]] shortly before being recruited into the [[OGPU]].\n\n===Trial===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C00678, Berlin, Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, Kranzniederlegung.jpg|thumb|right|German policemen lay a wreath on the monument to Captains Anlauf and Lenck during the Day of the German Police, 16 January 1937. Despite the fact that Captains Anlauf and Lenck were members of the SPD, the [[Nazi salute]] is given by many of those present. In 1951, Mielke ordered the demolition of the monument.]]\n\n\nAccording to Koehler, \"In mid-March 1933, while attending the Lenin School, Mielke received word from his OGPU sponsors that [[Berlin police]] had arrested Max Thunert, one of the conspirators in the Anlauf and Lenck murders. Within days, fifteen other members of the assassination team were in custody. Mielke had to wait six more months before the details of the police action against his Berlin comrades reached Moscow. On September 14, 1933, Berlin newspapers reported that all fifteen had confessed to their roles in the murders. Arrest warrants were issued for ten others who had fled, including Mielke, Ziemer, Ulbricht, Kippenberger, and Neumann.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 45.</ref>\n\nKoehler also stated, \"Defenders of Mielke later claimed that confessions had been obtained under torture by the Nazi [[Gestapo]]. However, all suspects were in the custody of the regular Berlin city criminal investigation bureau, most of whose detectives were SPD members. Some of the suspects had been nabbed by Nazi [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] men and probably beaten before they were turned over to police. In the [[1993]] trial of Mielke, the court gave the defense the benefit of the doubt and threw out a number of suspect confessions.\"<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 416.</ref>\n\nOn 19 June 1934, the 15 conspirators were convicted of [[first degree murder]]. The three deemed most culpable, Michael Klause, [[Max Matern]], and Friedrich Br\u00f6de were sentenced to [[death penalty|death]]. Their co-defendants received sentences ranging from nine months to fifteen years incarceration at hard labor. Klause's sentence was commuted to life in prison based upon his cooperation. Br\u00f6de hanged himself in his cell. As a result, only Matern was left to be executed by [[Decapitation|beheading]] on 22 May 1935.\n\nMatern was subsequently glorified as a [[martyr]] by KPD and East German [[propaganda]]. Ziemer was officially [[killed in action]] while fighting on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican-side]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Mielke, however, would not face trial for the murders until 1993.\n\n== Career in Soviet intelligence ==\n\n===The Great Terror===\n[[File:NKVD1936.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of Felix Dzerzhinsky during a 1936 parade in [[Red Square]].]]\nAlthough Moscow's German Communist community was decimated during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]],<ref>Stephane Coutois, ''et al''.

([[Soviet Union]]), I participated in all Party discussions of the K.P.D. and also in the problems concerning the establishment of [[socialism]] and in the [[Moscow Show Trials|trials]] against the traitors and [[enemy of the people|enemies]] of the S.U.\"<ref>John O. Koehler, ''The Stasi; The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police'', page 51.</ref>\n\nAmong the German communists executed as a result of these \"discussions\" were Mielke's former mentors [[Heinz Neumann]] and [[Hans Kippenberger]].\n\nMielke further recalled, \"I was a guest on the honor [[grandstand]] of [[Red Square]] during the [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] and [[October Revolution]] parades. I became acquainted with many comrades of the Federation of World Communist Parties and the War Council of the Special Commission of the [[Comintern]]. I will never forget my meeting with [[Georgi Dimitrov|Comrade Dimitrov]], the Chairman of the Comintern, whom I served as an aide together with another comrade. I saw [[Joseph Stalin|Comrade Stalin]] during all demonstrations at Red Square, especially when I stood on the grandstand. I mention these meetings because all these comrades are our models and teachers for our work.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 52.</ref>\n\nDuring his time in the USSR, Mielke also developed a lifelong reverence for [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], the [[Polish nobility|Polish aristocrat]] who founded of the [[Soviet secret police]]. Mielke also began an equally permanent habit of calling himself a [[Cheka|Chekist]].<ref>Koehler (1999), page 31.</ref>\n\nIn a citation written decades later, Mielke described his philosophy of life, \"The Chekist is the political combatant. He is the loyal son of... the [[working class|workers' class]]. He stands at the head of the battle to strengthen the power of our workers' and peasants' state.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 66.</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n[[File:Flag of the International Brigades.svg|thumb|right|225px|The flag of the International Brigades was the [[Spanish Republican flag]] with the three-pointed star of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] in the center]]\nFrom 1936 to 1939, Mielke served in Spain as an operative of the [[Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Militar]], the [[political police]] of the [[Second Spanish Republic]].<ref name=\"Stasi48\">John Koehler, \"The Stasi,\" p. 48.</ref> While attached to the staff of future Stasi minister [[Wilhelm Zaisser]], Mielke used the alias '''Fritz Leissner'''.<ref name=\"Mielke\"/> Bernd Kaufmann, the director of the Stasi's espionage school later said, \"The Soviets trusted Mielke implicitly.

According to author [[Donald Rayfield]], \"Stalin, [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]], and [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]] distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]], journalists like [[Mikhail Koltsov|Koltsov]] were open to infection by the heresies, especially [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s, prevalent among the Republic's supporters. NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on [[Red Terror (Spain)|abducting and murdering]] anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and [[International Brigade]] commanders than on fighting [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin's eyes, was caused not by the NKVD's diversionary efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.\"<ref>Donald Rayfield, ''Stalin and his Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him'', [[Random House]], 2004. pp. 362-363.</ref>\n\nIn a 1991 interview,<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 416-417.</ref> [[Walter Janka]], a fellow German communist exile and company commander in the [[International Brigade]], recalled his encounters with Mielke. During the winter of 1936, Janka was summoned by the SIM and interrogated by Mielke. Mielke demanded to know why Janka had voluntarily traveled to Spain rather than being assigned there by the Party. When he told Mielke to get lost, the SIM demoted Janka to the ranks and then expelled him from the International Brigade. Years later, Janka recalled, \"While I was fighting at the front, shooting at the [[Fascists]], Mielke served in the rear, shooting [[Trotskyites]] and [[Anarchists]].\"<ref name=\"Stasi48\"/>\n\nUpon the defeat of the Spanish Republic, Mielke fled across the Pyrenees Mountains to France, where he was [[internment|interned]] at [[Camp de Rivesaltes]], [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]]. Mielke, however, managed to send a message to exiled KPD members and, in May 1939, escaped to [[Belgium]]. Although the [[Staatsanwaltschaft|Public Prosecutor]] of Berlin learned of Mielke's presence and filed for his [[extradition]], the Belgian Government refused to comply, regarding the assassinations of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as \"a political crime.\"<ref>Wilfriede Otto, ''Erich Mielke.

It horrified numerous Pro-Soviet Westerners who had been witnesses, including [[John Dos Passos]], [[Arthur Koestler]] and [[George Orwell]], and caused them to permanently turn against the USSR.<ref>[[John Patrick Diggins|Diggins, John Patrick]], \"'Organization is Death': John Dos Passos,\" and \"Visions of Order: Dos Passos,\" in ''Up From Communism'', 1975, [[Columbia University Press]], then Harper & Row, pp. 74-117, and pp. 233-268.</ref>\n\nMielke's belief that anti-Soviet Marxists had collaborated with Franco and stabbed the Republic in the back continued to shape his attitudes for the rest of his life. In a 1982 speech before a group of senior Stasi officers, he said, \"We are not immune from villains among us. If I knew of any already, they wouldn't live past tomorrow. Short shrift. It's because I'm a [[Secular Humanism|Humanist]], that I'm of this view.\"<ref name=\"Funder 2003, page 57\">Funder (2003), page 57.</ref>\n\nIn the same speech, Mielke also said, \"All this blithering over to execute or not to execute, for the [[death penalty]] or against-- all rot, Comrades. Execute! And, when necessary, without a court judgment.\"<ref name=\"Funder 2003, page 57\"/>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Soviet guerilla.jpg|thumb|250px|Belarusian partisans in the forest near [[Polotsk]], [[Byelorussian SSR]] September 1943.]]\nDuring [[World War II]], Mielke's movements remain mysterious. In a biography written after the war, he claimed to have infiltrated [[Organisation Todt]] under the alias '''Richard Hebel'''.<ref>''The Stasi'', page 51.</ref>, but historian John O. Koehler considers this unlikely.\n\nKoehler admits, however, \"Mielke's exploits must have been substantial. By war's end, he had been decorated with the [[Order of the Red Banner]], the [[Order of the Great Patriotic War]] First Class, and twice with the [[Order of Lenin]]. It is likely that he served as an NKVD agent, at least part of the time with [[guerrilla]] units behind German lines, for he knew all the [[Soviet partisan|partisan]] songs by heart and sang them in faultless Russian.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', page 50.</ref>\n\n==Occupied Germany==\n\n=== ''Komissariat-5''===\n[[File:Karlshorst GER-RUS museum.jpg|thumb|left|Former Soviet military and NKGB Headquarters in Karlshorst. Now the German-Russian Museum.]]\nIn 1945, Mielke was ordered by the [[NKGB]] to return to [[Occupied Germany]] as a police inspector, with a mandate to build up a security force which would ensure the dominance of the Communist Party in the [[Soviet Zone]] of [[Occupied Germany]]. Mielke was a protege of NKGB General [[Ivan Serov]], who was headquartered at the Berlin [[suburb]] of [[Karlshorst]]. \n\nOn 16 August 1947, Serov ordered the creation of ''Kommissariat 5'', the first German [[political police]] since the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>John Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 52.</ref> [[Wilhelm Zaisser]] was appointed the organization's head and Mielke was installed as his deputy.\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"The K-5 was essentially an arm of the Soviet secret police. Its agents were carefully selected veteran German communists who had survived the Nazi era in Soviet exile or in concentration camps and prisons. Their task was to track down Nazis and anti-communists, including hundreds of members of the Social Democratic Party. Mielke and his fellow bloodhounds performed this task with ruthless precision. The number of arrests became so great that the regular prisons could not hold them. Thus, Serov ordered the establishment or re-opening of eleven [[concentration camp]]s, including the former Nazi [[death camps]] of [[Buchenwald concentration camp#Soviet Special Camp 2|Buchenwald]] and [[NKVD special camp Nr. 7|Sachsenhausen]].\"<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 52.</ref>\n\nAccording to Edward N. Peterson, \"Not surprisingly, K-5 acquired a reputation as bad as that of Stalin's secret police and worse than that of the Gestapo. At least with the Nazis, albeit fanatically [[racist]], their victims did not suddenly disappear into the [[GULAG]].\"<ref>Peterson (2002), pages 19-20.</ref>\n\n===The Amalgamation===\n[[File:Flagge der SED.svg|thumb|right|The red flag of the SED bore the SED logo, which portrayed the handshake between [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]] [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Otto Grotewohl]] when their parties merged in 1946.]]\nDespite the K-5's mass arrests of SPD members in the Soviet Zone, the number of members continued to grow. By March 1946, the number of SPD members outnumbered KPD members by more than 100,000. Fearing that they would lose the elections scheduled for the autumn, the leadership of the KPD asked for and received Stalin's permission to merge the two Parties. When the SPD's leadership agreed only to schedule a vote for the rank and file to decide, permission was denied by the Soviet occupation authorities. The K-5 then began mass arrests of SPD members who refused to support the merger.\n\nOn 22 April 1946, the leaders of the SPD in the Soviet Zone announced that they had united with the KPD to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED). The SPD in the western zones of Occupied Germany responded by forming the SPD East Bureau in order to support and finance those who refused to accept the merger. Those who joined or worked with the East Bureau were in serious danger of arrest by the K-5 and tried by Soviet [[military tribunal]]s. By 1950, more than 5,000 SPD members and sympathisers had been imprisoned in the Soviet Zone or transferred to the [[GULAG]]. More than 400 were either executed or died during their imprisonments.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 126-127.</ref>\n\n===Investigation===\n[[File:Berlin Kollegienhaus.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''The [[Kammergericht]]'']]\nIn January 1947, two retired [[Berlin police]]men recognized Mielke at an official function. Informing the head of the [[Kripo|criminal police]] in [[West Berlin]], the policemen demanded that Mielke be arrested and prosecuted for the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck.<ref name=\"Stasi53\">Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 53.</ref> [[Wilhelm K\u00fchnast]], the [[Staatsanwaltschaft|Public Prosecutor]] of Berlin, was immediately informed and ordered a search of the [[Kammergericht]] archives. To his astonishment, the files of the 1931 murders had survived the wartime bombing of Germany. Finding ample evidence of Mielke's involvement, K\u00fchnast ordered the arrest of the communist policeman.\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"At that time, the city administration, including the police, was under the control of the [[Allied Control Commission]], which consisted of U.S., British, French, and Soviet military officers. All actions by city officials, including the judiciary, were to be reported to the Commission. The Soviet representative alerted the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]]. Action was swift. [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Vasily Sokolovsky]], who had replaced [[Zhukov]], protested, and his representatives at the Commission launched a vicious campaign to discredit K\u00fchnast.\"<ref name=\"Stasi53\"/>\n\nThe Soviet representatives falsely claimed that K\u00fchnast, a jurist with an impeccable [[German Resistance|anti-Nazi]] record, had been an official of [[Roland Freisler]]'s [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]].<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', pages 53-54.</ref> Taking the Soviets at their word, the [[Western Allies]] removed K\u00fchnast from his position and placed him under [[house arrest]]. During the [[Berlin airlift]], K\u00fchnast fled from his home in [[East Berlin]] and was granted [[political asylum]] in the [[American Zone]].<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 54.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Soviet authorities confiscated all documents relating to the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck. According to Koehler, \"The Soviets handed the court records to Mielke. Instead of destroying the incriminating papers, he locked them in his private safe, where they were found when his home was searched in 1990. They were used against him in his trial for murder.\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 417\">Koehler (1999), page 417.</ref>\n\n=== ''Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission'' ===\nIn 1948, Mielke was appointed as security chief of the [[German Economic Commission]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission}}), the precursor to the future East German government.\n\nMielke's task was to investigate the theft and sale of State property on the [[black market]]. He was also charged with intercepting the growing number of refugees fleeing to the [[French Zone|French]], [[British Zone|British]], and [[American Zone]]s.\n\nThose his security forces caught while attempting to defect were used as slave labor in the [[uranium]] mines that were providing raw material for the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]].<ref>Koehler (1999), page 54.</ref>\n\n==German Democratic Republic==\nIn 1949, the Soviet Military Administration ceded its legal functions to the newly created [[German Democratic Republic]]. On 14 January 1950, Marshal [[Vasili Chuikov]] announced that all Soviet \"internment camps\" on German soil had been closed. Soon after, the DWK was absorbed into the newly created Ministry for State Security, which East Germans immediately dubbed the \"Stasi\". With the approval of the Soviets, Mielke's commanding officer from Spain, [[Wilhelm Zaisser]], was appointed as the Stasi's head. Mielke was appointed to his staff with the rank of State Secretary. In 1971, after Walter Ulbricht's overturn as First Secretary of the SED, Mielke was also granted a seat in the SED's ruling [[Politburo]].<ref>Koehler (1999), page 55.</ref>\n\n== Tenure as Stasi head ==\n[[File:Milkes.office.radio.JPG|thumb|right|Erich Mielke's Office, Stasi Museum, Berlin.]]\nMielke headed the [[Stasi]] from 1957 until the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.   There was, under the East German system, no provision for parliamentary oversight.<ref name=MielkelautGrossmann/>   However, starting in 1971 Mielke was required to provide a detailed intelligence briefing to [[Leadership of East Germany|party secretary]] [[Erich Honecker]] each Tuesday, directly following the weekly Politburo meeting.<ref name=MielkelautGrossmann>{{cite journal|title=\"In allen Parteien gut vertreten\"   ....

New recruits were required to take a solemn oath pledging \"to fight alongside the state security organs of all socialist countries against all enemies of socialism\" on pain of \"the severest punishment under the Republic's laws and the contempt of the workers.\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 147\">Koehler (1999), page 147.</ref> Recruits were also required to sign a security pledge vowing never to make unauthorized visits to any \"capitalist countries\" and to report on any members of their families who did so.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 147-148.</ref>\n\nViolations of the oath resulted in expulsion from the Stasi and [[blacklist]]ing from all but the most menial jobs. Serious violations were tried before secret tribunals and led an estimated 200 Stasi agents to be shot. Colonel Rainer Wiegand once said, \"There was only one way to leave the MfS without being haunted for the rest of your life. You either retired or you died.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 148.</ref>\n\n===Domestic activities===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-69281-0005, Erich Mielke.jpg|thumb|right|Erich Mielke, 1959.]]\nUnder Erich Mielke's leadership, the Stasi employed 85,000 full-time domestic spies and 170,000 civilian informants ({{lang-de|Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter}}) (IMs). East Germans coined a term to describe the Stasi's pervasive surveillance of the population \"All-Covered\". ({{lang-de|Fl\u00e4chendeckend}}).<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 147\"/> For this reason, Anna Funder has referred to East Germany as, \"the most perfected surveillance state of all time.\"<ref name=\"Funder 2003, page 57\"/>\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"...the Stasi's tentacles probed every aspect of life. Full-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants. Without exception, one [[wikt:tenant|tenant]] in every building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the ''[[Volkspolizei]]''...In turn, the police officer was the Stasi's man. If a relative or friend came to stay overnight, it was reported.  Schools, universities and hospitals were infiltrated from top to bottom. German academe was shocked to learn that [[Heinrich Fink]], professor of [[theology]] and vice-chancellor of East Berlin's [[Humboldt University]], had been a Stasi informer since 1968. After Fink's Stasi connections came to light, he was summarily fired. Doctors, lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, and sports figures were co-opted by Stasi officers, as were waiters and hotel personnel. [[Phone tapping|Tapping]] about 100,000 telephone lines in East Germany and [[West Berlin]] around the clock was the job of 2,000 officers... [[Christianity in East Germany|Churchmen]], including high officials of both [[Evangelical Church of Germany|Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic Church in Germany|Catholic]] denominations, were recruited en masse as secret informants. Their offices and [[confessional]]s were infested with eavesdropping devices. Even the director of [[Leipzig]]'s famous [[Thomanerchor|Thomas Church choir]], [[Hans-Joachim Rotzsch]], was forced to resign when he was unmasked as a ''Spitzel'', the people's pejorative for a Stasi informant.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 9.</ref>\n\nIn an interview with journalist [[Anna Funder]], an ex-Stasi officer recalled, \"Most often, people we approached would inform for us. It was very rare that they would not. However, sometimes we felt that we might need to know where their weak points were, just in case. For example, if we wanted a [[pastor]], we'd find out if he'd had an [[adultery|affair]], or had a [[alcoholism|drinking problem]]--things that we could use as leverage. Mostly though, people said yes.\"<ref>Anna Funder, ''Stasiland: True Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall'', Granta Books, 2004. Page 198.</ref>\n\nOn Mielke's orders, and with his full knowledge, Stasi officers also engaged in arbitrary arrest, [[kidnapping]], brutal harassment of political dissidents, [[torture]], and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of citizens.\n\nIn a 1991 interview, [[Jewish people|Jewish]] [[Holocaust]] survivor and [[Nazi hunter]] [[Simon Wiesenthal]] said, \"The Stasi was much, much worse than the [[Gestapo]], if you consider only the oppression of [[German people|its own people]].

During the [[Jerusalem]] trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], Stasi agents sent letters to West German [[Neo-Nazi]]s and [[Waffen-SS]] veterans, urging them to speak out and to raise money for Eichmann's [[defense attorney]].

Col. Wiegand had been sickened by the 1972 [[Munich massacre]] and was horrified that the GDR would treat the man who ordered it as an honored guest. When he protested, Wiegand was told that Abu Daoud was, \"a friend of our country, a high-ranking political functionary,\" and that there was no proof that he was a [[terrorist]].<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 365-366.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, Wiegand secretly blackmailed a [[Libya]]n [[diplomat]] into spying on his colleagues. Wiegand's informant told him that the [[La Belle bombing]] and other terrorist attacks against American and West German citizens were being planned at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin. When Wiegand showed him a detailed report, Mielke informed the SED's Politburo, which ordered the Colonel to continue surveillance but not interfere with the plans of the Libyans.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 325-357.</ref>\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"Murder, [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[bank robbery]], and [[arson]] were felonies under the East German criminal code. However, if these offenses were committed under the banner of the 'anti-imperialist struggle,' the communist system would look the other way. Moreover, it had assigned the Stasi to make sure that terrorists were properly trained for murder and mayhem.

Its personnel were carefully selected members of the counterespionage and counterterrorism directorate. They were equipped with special batons similar to electric [[cattle prod]]s but much more powerful. In a secret speech to top-ranking Stasi officers on June 29, Mielke warned that, 'hostile opposing forces and groups have already achieved a measure of power and are using all methods to achieve a change in the balance of power. Former Stasi Colonel [[Rainer Wiegand]] told me he was horrified when Mielke compared the situation with that of [[China]] two months earlier. Chinese students in [[Beijing]] had begun massive protests in April and in May, during a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|student demonstration]] in [[Tiananmen Square]], security troops had opened fire on them killing hundreds. 'Mielke said our situation was comparable and we had to be ready to counter it with all means and methods,'  Wiegand recalled.

At the least hint of a disturbance of the celebration, isolate and arrest them.\"<ref>Peterson (2002), page 202.</ref>\n\nOne former Stasi Major recalled, \"We mixed inconspicuously with the demonstrators, accompanied by our IMs. Hundreds of us stood at the sides of the street in order to stop any activity before it got started. We barely got any sleep toward the end. Never did I sense that the people were afraid of the MfS. The Stasi was more afraid of the people than the people were of them.\"<ref>Peterson (2002), pages 202-203.</ref>\n\nAccording to Koehler, \"Despite the unrest, the regime celebrated its fortieth with a huge, pompous ceremony in [[Berlin]] on October 7, while tens of thousands of {{clarify|date=February 2016}}outside the ornate building of the State Council. The [[Volkspolizei|People's Police]] cordons were utterly ineffectual.

The old men on the podium wore light-grey suits studded with medals. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] stood next to Honecker, but he looked uncomfortable among the much older Germans. He had come to tell them that it was over, to convince the leadership to adopt his reformist policies. He had spoken openly about the danger of not 'responding to reality.' He pointedly told the Politburo that, 'life punishes those who come too late.' Honecker and Mielke ignored him, just as they ignored the crowds when they chanted, \"Gorby, help us! Gorby, help us!\"<ref>Funder (2003), page 64.</ref>\n\n===Plan X===\n[[File:Burg Ranis.jpg|thumb|right|Ranis Castle in Thuringia was among the locations selected for an internment camp under ''Plan X''. In Stasi documents, it was referred to as \"Rosebush\" ({{lang-de|Rosenstock}}).<ref>Koehler (1999), page 142.</ref>]]  \nOn 8 October 1989, Mielke and Honecker ordered the Stasi to implement \"Plan X\"\u2014the SED's plan to arrest and indefinitely detain 85,939 East Germans during a [[state of emergency]]. According to John Koehler, Plan X had been in preparation since 1979 and was, \"a [[carbon copy]] of how the [[Nazi concentration camps]] got their start after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] [[Nazi seizure of power|came to power in 1933]].\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 143\">Koehler (1999), page 143.</ref>\n\nBy 1984, 23 sites had been selected for \"isolation and internment camps.\" Those who were to be imprisoned in them ran into six categories; including anyone who had ever been under surveillance for anti-state activities, including all members of peace movements which were not under Stasi control.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 142-143.</ref>\n\nAccording to Anna Funder, \"The plans contained exact provisions for the use of all available prisons and camps, and when those were full for the conversion of other buildings: Nazi detention centers, schools, hospitals, and factory holiday hostels. Every detail was foreseen, from where the doorbell was located on the house of each person to be arrested to the adequate supply of barbed wire and the rules of dress and etiquette in the camps...\"<ref>Funder (2003), page 62.</ref>\n\nHowever, when Mielke sent the orders, codenamed \"Shield\" ({{lang-de|Schild}}),<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 143\"/> to each local Stasi precinct to begin the planned arrests, he was not obeyed. Terrified of an East German version of the mass [[lynching]]s of [[State Protection Authority|Hungarian secret police]] agents during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|1956 Revolution]], Stasi agents throughout the GDR fortified their office-buildings and barricaded themselves inside.<ref>Funder (2003), pages 63-64.</ref>\n\n===Toppling Honecker===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild Y 10-0097-91, 30 Jahre MfS, Erich Honecker, Erich Mielke.jpg|thumb|Mielke receives an award from [[Erich Honecker]] 8 February 1980.]]\nEven as orders were going out to implement ''Plan X'', Mielke had already thrown his support behind the anti-Honecker faction in the SED's Politburo. Although he was of the same generation as Honecker and had matured in an environment where following orders was the rule, he was sober enough and politically savvy enough to realize this approach no longer worked.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Collapse: The Accidental Opening of the Berlin Wall|last=Sarotte|first=Mary Elise|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=9780465064946|page=87}}</ref> During a session on 10 October 1989, Mielke delivered a report attacking Honecker's desire to violently suppress the demonstrations rather than offer concessions.\n\nIn what Edward N. Peterson has called \"a remarkable disclaimer of responsibility for the violence,\" Mielke declared that Honecker's orders to him \"were built on false situation judgments.\" He added that Honecker's commands on 7 and 8 October \"were false and undifferentiated condemnations of those who think differently. Despite this evaluation, there was never any instructions to use violence against persons. There is nothing in our basic principles to consider a demonstration as part of a possible [[counterrevolutionary]] [[coup d'etat|coup]].\"<ref>Peterson (2002), pages 204-205.</ref>\n\nMielke also claimed that \"the Party judged the situation falsely. We tried to tell them the true situation, but enough was not done.\" Mielke argued in favor of solving the demonstrations politically and giving \"every DDR citizen the right to travel.\"<ref>Peterson (2002), page 205.</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1989, Mielke and the rest of the GDR's Politburo met to follow Gorbachev's demand, voiced in August, for Honecker be removed as General Secretary of the SED and State Council chairman.<ref>Peterson (2002), pages 208-209.</ref> Suspecting that Honecker's personal bodyguards might try to arrest the members of the Central Committee when they met to vote Honecker out in favour of [[Egon Krenz]], Mielke saw to it that Stasi agents who were loyal to him were stationed near the meeting room.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref> While deliberations were underway, Mielke told Honecker that \"we simply cannot start shooting with tanks,\" and tried to impress upon Honecker that it was \"the end\".<ref>Sarotte, p. 88</ref>\n\nAfter the vote to oust Honecker passed, Mielke \"got nasty,\" and accused Honecker of [[political corruption|corruption]]. Honecker responded that Mielke should not open his mouth so much.<ref name=\"Peterson 2002, page 209\">Peterson (2002), page 209.</ref> Mielke responded by putting the last nail into Honecker's coffin. He announced that the MfS had a file on the now-ousted leader. It contained proof of Honecker's corrupt business practices, sexual activities, and how, as a member of the underground [[Communist Party of Germany]] during the Nazi years, he had been arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and had named names.<ref name=\"Peterson 2002, page 209\"/>\n\nTo the shock of both the Politburo and the Stasi, Krenz's first televised addresses failed to win popular support. Despite his assurances that the SED was at last ready to embrace Gorbachev's policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], Krenz's approval ratings remained extremely low.<ref name=\"Buckley 2004, page 175\">Buckley (2004), page 175.</ref>\n\nFormer Politburo member [[G\u00fcnter Schabowski]] later recalled, \"We made a palace revolution without offering a real alternative...

They shredded the files until the [[paper shredder|shredders]] collapsed. Among other shortages in the East, there was a shredder shortage, so they had to send agents out under cover to [[West Berlin]] to buy more. In Building 8 alone, the citizens' movement found over a hundred burnt out shredders.<ref>Funder (2003), page 67.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], \"In the weeks after November 9, Stasi offices were stormed in various cities around East Germany. Stasi [[commissar]]s in three of those cities committed suicide. But not one was lynched or executed.\"<ref>Buckley (2004), page 186.</ref>\n\n===Televised humiliation===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0325-037, Festveranstaltung SV Dynamo, Erich Mielke.jpg|thumb|left|Mielke addressing the ''[[SV Dynamo]]'', 25 March 1983.]]\nOn 13 November 1989, Mielke was summoned to deliver a briefing about the protests to the GDR parliament, or ''[[Volkskammer]]''. Formerly a \"rubber stamp parliament,\" the disintegration of the SED's power had allowed the ''Volkskammer'' to begin exercising real authority over the GDR. Therefore, Mielke, as the head of the Stasi (known as the \"shield and sword of the [SED] party\"), was summoned before the newly empowered parliament to justify his position in Government.\n\nAs his speech was broadcast live, Mielke began by using overly bombastic, [[flag-waving]] language, saying \"We have, comrades, dear assembly members, an extraordinarily high amount of contact with all working people\" ({{lang-de|\"Wir haben, Genossen, liebe Abgeordnete, einen au\u00dferordentlich hohen Kontakt zu allen werkt\u00e4tigen Menschen.\"}}).<ref name=\"chronik-der-mauer.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/opfer/Start/Detail/id/618085/page/12/ |title=Rede von Stasi-Minister Erich Mielke in der DDR-Volkskammer, 13.

I am not afraid to stand here and to give you an honest answer\" ({{lang-de|\"Ja, wir haben den Kontakt, ihr werdet gleich h\u00f6ren - ihr werdet gleich h\u00f6ren, warum. Ich f\u00fcrchte mich nicht, ohne Rededisposition hier Antwort zu stehen.\"}}). Mielke continued, speaking of the \"triumph\" of the socialist economy, continuing all the while to address the members of the Volkskammer as \"Comrades\" ({{lang-de|\"Genossen\"}}).  In response, Volkskammer member [[Dietmar Czok]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], rose from his seat  and raised his hand. The Volkskammer's President, [[G\u00fcnther Maleuda]], interrupted Mielke and urged Czok to speak.\n\nWith his voice dripping with contempt, Czok told Mielke, \"As a point of order, let me remind you that there are more people sitting in this Chamber than just your Comrades!\"<ref name=\"chronik-der-mauer.de\"/> ({{lang-de|\"Zur Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung: Ich bitte doch endlich daf\u00fcr zu sorgen. In dieser Kammer sitzen nicht nur Genossen!\"}}). In response, many in the Volkskammer burst into applause, cheers, and shouts of \"We are not your Comrades!\" ({{lang-de|\"Wir sind nicht deine Genossen!\"}})\n\nTrying to appear magnanimous, Mielke responded, \"This is a natural, Humanistic question! This is just a question of formality.\"  ({{lang-de|Das ist doch nur 'ne nat\u00fcrliche, menschliche Frage! Das ist doch nur eine formale Frage!\"}}), leading to further shouts of displeasure from the members of the Volkskammer. In a last ditch effort, Mielke \"raised his arms like an evangelist,\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 407\">Koehler (1999), page 407.</ref> and cried, \"I love all \u2013 all Humanity! I really do!

John Koehler later wrote, \"Mielke was finished.\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 407\"/>\n\nMielke's address to the ''Volkskammer'' remains the most famous broadcast in the history of German television.

The following day, Mielke's tenure in office ended when the ''Volkskammer'' appointed ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' Wolfgang Schwanitz as the new director of the AfNS.\n\nOn 1 December 1989, the ''Volkskammer'' nullified the clause of the GDR constitution that enshrined the SED's \"leading role\" in the government and formally ending Communist rule in East Germany.<ref name=\"Buckley 2004, page 175\"/> Two days later,the SED announced that Mielke's party membership had been permanently revoked.

Victims are dubiously honored to find his signature in their files: on plans for someone to be observed 'with all possible methods', on commands for arrest, for [[kidnapping]], instructions to judges for sentencing, orders for 'liquidation'. The honor is dubious because... he signed so many.\"<ref>Funder (2003), page 56.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the museum at the former Stasi headquarters opened Mielke's office as a permanent exhibit. Soon after, ''[[The Guardian]]'' correspondent [[Tam Eastley]] visited the exhibit and numerous sites in Berlin connected to Mielke's life, times, and legacy. When she visited Mielke's grave, Eastley found that it had become a shrine for adherents of ''[[Ostalgie]]''.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2012/mar/02/stasi-museum-berlin-erch-mielke \"The Guardian\" 2 March 2012]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nErich Mielke was a fitness enthusiast, a non-smoker, and drank very little. He was a keen hunter and owned a large area of ground where he would hunt animals with other East German and visiting Soviet officials.\n\nDuring the late 1940s, when Mielke was working as security chief of the DWK, he began a relationship with Gertrud Mueller, a seamstress. On 18 December 1948, shortly after the birth of their son Frank Mielke, Erich and Gertrud married in a civil ceremony.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 54-55.</ref>\n\nAccording to the newspaper ''[[Bild]]'', the Mielkes adopted an orphaned girl named Ingrid, who was born in 1950. Like her adopted brother Frank, Ingrid Mielke attended the [[Wilhelm Pieck]] School. She ultimately became a Captain in the Stasi and married a Stasi Lieutenant named Norbert Knappe. The Knappes had both refused to grant an interview to ''Bild'' reporters.<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 417\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nErich Mielke has appeared as a character in both films and novels set in the GDR.\n\n* [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s ''[[The Legend of Rita]]'' (2000), which focuses on Stasi collusion with the [[West German]] [[far-left]] [[terrorist organization]] ''[[Rote Armee Fraktion]]''. In conversation with fictional Stasi officer Erwin Hull ([[Martin Wuttke]]), Mielke ([[Dietrich K\u00f6rner]]) expresses admiration for the RAF's campaign against the [[United States]], [[West Germany]], and the [[State of Israel]], which he compares with his own activities against the [[Weimar Republic]] and the Nazis. The RAF members are then brought to a training camp, where Stasi agents instruct them in the use of grenade launchers and other kinds of military hardware. Mielke's name is never disclosed and Agent Hull addresses him only as, \"Comrade General.\" ({{lang-de|\"Genosse General.\"}})\n* [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]]'s ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' (2006), which focuses on the Stasi's surveillance and repression of the East German population. In the film, a previously loyal GDR playwright named Georg Dreymann ([[Sebastian Koch]]) publishes an anonymous article in the West German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' which accuses East Germany's Minister of Culture of having persecuted a [[blacklist]]ed stage director until he hanged himself. Soon after the article goes to press, Mielke's voice is heard over the telephone giving a dressing down to fictional Stasi Lieutenant Colonel Anton Grubitz ([[Ulrich Tukur]]). Addressed only as \"Genosse [[Armeegeneral]]\" (Mielke was the only person to ever hold that rank in the [[Stasi]]), Mielke threatens to throw Grubitz in front of a [[firing squad]] if he fails to identify and arrest the article's author.\n* In [[Philip Kerr]]'s novel ''[[Field Gray|Field Grey]]'' (2010), Mielke first appears in 1931 [[Berlin]], when protagonist Bernie Gunther saves him from being murdered by Nazi [[Brownshirts]]. The novel then flashes forward to 1954, when Gunther is recruited into a [[CIA]] plot to abduct Mielke from [[East Berlin]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-philip-kerrs-field-gray/2011/04/18/AFP6RjdE_story.html Book Review: Philip Kerr's 'Field Gray'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 24 April 2011.</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nMielke received a large number of awards and commemorative medals from organisations within the German Democratic Republic and from allied states.

During the [[First World War]], the neighborhood was known as \"Red Wedding\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the [[Joint State Political Directorate|Soviet secret police]], Mielke described his father as \"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). After his remarriage to \"a seamstress,\" the elder Mielke and his new wife joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and remained members when it was renamed the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD). His son Erich claimed \"My younger brother Kurt and two sisters were Communist sympathisers.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), p. 44.</ref>\n\nDespite his family's poverty, Erich Mielke was academically gifted enough to be awarded a free scholarship in the prestigious [[:de: K\u00f6llnisches Gymnasium|K\u00f6llnisches Gymnasium]], but was expelled on 19 February 1929, for being \"unable to meet the great demands of this school.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 44-45.</ref> While attending the Gymnasium, Mielke joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in 1925, and worked as a reporter for the [[communist]] newspaper ''[[Rote Fahne]]'' from 1928 to 1931. \n\nDuring the [[Weimar Republic]], the KPD was the largest communist party in [[Europe]] and was seen as the \"leading party\" of the communist movement outside the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): ''Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918\u20131933'', London: Lawrence & Wishart, p. 2</ref> Under [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]]'s leadership, the KPD was completely obedient to Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], and from 1928 the Party was both funded and controlled by the [[Comintern]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=\"Hoppe\">{{cite book |last=Hoppe |first=Bert |year=2011 |title=In Stalins Gefolgschaft: Moskau und die KPD 1928\u20131933 |url= |location= |publisher= Oldenbourg Verlag |page= |isbn= 9783486711738 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\nUntil the end of the Republic, the KPD viewed the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), which dominated German politics between 1918 and 1931, as their mortal enemy.<ref name=\"Hoppe\" /> In keeping with Stalin's policy towards [[Social Democracy]], the KPD considered all SPD members to be \"[[social fascism|social fascists]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Winner |first=David |date= |title=How the left enabled fascism: Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, leader of Germany's radical left in the last years of the Weimar Republic, thought the centre left was a greater danger than the right|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2018/10/how-left-enabled-fascism |work=[[New Statesman]] |location= |access-date= }}</ref> The KPD also believed that all other [[political party|political parties]] were \"[[fascist]]\" and regarded itself as \"the only [[anti-fascist]] Party\" in Germany.<ref name=\"Hoppe\" /><!-- p. 195 --> Nevertheless, the KPD closely collaborated with the [[Nazi Party]] during the early [[1930s]] and both Parties intended to replace the democratically-elected government of the [[Weimar Republic]] with a [[totalitarian]] [[single party state]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fippel |first1=G\u00fcnter|year= 2003 |title=Antifaschisten in \"antifaschistischer\" Gewalt: mittel- und ostdeutsche Schicksale in den Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Demokratie und Diktatur (1945 bis 1961)|url= |location= |publisher= A.

At the time, the ''Parteiselbstschutz'' in Berlin was commanded by KPD [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Representatives [[Hans Kippenberger]] and [[Heinz Neumann]].\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"Mielke was a special protege of Kippenberger's having taken to his [[paramilitary]] training with the enthusiasm of a [[Prussian Junker]]. [[World War I]] veterans taught the novices how to handle pistols, rifles, [[machine gun]]s, and [[hand grenade]]s. This clandestine training was conducted in the sparsely populated, pastoral countryside surrounding Berlin. Mielke also pleased Kippenberger by being an exceptional student in classes on the arts of conspiratorial behavior and [[espionage]], taught by comrades who had studied at the secret M-school of the [[GRU]] in [[Moscow]].\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 38\">Koehler (1999), page 38.</ref>\n\nAccording to John Koehler, members of the ''Parteiselbstschutz'' \"served as [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s at Party meetings and specialized in cracking heads during street battles with political enemies.\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 38\"/> Besides the ruling SPD and it's paramilitary [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]] forces, the arch-enemies of the ''Parteiselbstschutz'' were the [[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]], which was the armed wing of the [[Monarchist]] [[German National People's Party]] (DVNP), [[Trotskyism|Trotskyites]], and \"radical nationalist parties.\" \n\nAccording to Koehler, the KPD's Selbstschutz men \"always carried a ''Stahlrute'', two steel springs that telescoped into a tube seven inches long, which when extended became a deadly, fourteen-inch weapon. Not to be outdone by the Nazis, these street-fighters were often armed with [[pistol]]s as well.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', p. 38.</ref>\n\nIn a 1931 biography written for the Cadre Division of the [[Comintern]],<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 43-44.</ref> Mielke recalled, \"We took care of all kinds of work; terror acts, protecting illegal demonstrations and meetings, arms-trafficking, etc. The last work, which was accomplished by a Comrade and myself, was the B\u00fclowplatz Affair\" ({{lang-de|\"Wir erledigten hier alle m\u00f6glichen Arbeiten, Terrorakte, Schutz illegaler Demonstrationen und Versammlungen, Waffentransport und reinigung usw.

Today it is the Berlin headquarters of the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party.]]]]\nDuring the last days of the [[Weimar Republic]], the KPD in Berlin had a policy of assassinating a [[Berlin police]] officer in retaliation for every KPD member killed by the police. On August 2, 1931, KPD Members of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] [[Heinz Neumann (politician)|Heinz Neumann]] and [[Hans Kippenberger]] received a dressing down from [[Walter Ulbricht]], the Party's leader in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Enraged by police interference and by Neumann and Kippenberger's failure to follow the policy, Ulbricht snarled, \"At home in [[Saxony]] we would have done something about the police a long time ago. Here in Berlin we will not fool around much longer. Soon we will hit the police in the head.\"<ref>John Koehler, ''The Stasi'', p. 36.</ref>\n\nEnraged by Ulbricht's words, Kippenberger and Neumann decided to assassinate [[Paul Anlauf]], the forty-two-year-old Captain of the Berlin Police's Seventh Precinct. Captain Anlauf, a widower with three daughters, had been nicknamed ''Schweinebacke'', or \"Pig Face\" by the KPD. \n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"Of all the policemen in strife-torn Berlin, the reds hated Anlauf the most. His precinct included the area around [[Karl-Liebknecht-Haus|KPD headquarters]], which made it the most dangerous in the city. The captain almost always led the riot squads that broke up illegal rallies of the Communist Party.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', p. 36.</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Sunday 9 August 1931, Kippenberger and Neumann gave a last briefing to the hit-team in a room at the Lassant beer hall. Mielke and [[Erich Ziemer]] were selected as the shooters. During the meeting, [[Max Matern]] gave a [[Luger pistol]] to fellow lookout Max Thunert and said, \"Now we're getting serious...

Kippenberger then instructed them to wait at a nearby beer hall which would permit them to overlook the entire [[Rosa Luxemburg Platz|B\u00fclow-Platz]]. He further reminded them that Captain Anlauf was accompanied everywhere by Senior Sergeant Max Willig, whom the KPD had nicknamed, ''[[Hussar]]''.\n\nKippenberger concluded, \"When you spot ''Schweinebacke'' and ''Hussar'', you take care of them.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', p. 39.</ref> Mielke and Ziemer were informed that, after the assassinations were completed, a diversion would assist in their escape. They were then to return to their homes and await further instructions.\n\nThat evening, Captain Anlauf was lured to [[Rosa Luxemburg Platz|B\u00fclow-Platz]] by a violent rally demanding the dissolution of the [[Prussian Parliament]]. \n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"As was often the case when it came to battling the dominant SPD, the KPD and the Nazis had combined forces during the pre-[[plebiscite]] campaign. At one point in this particular campaign, [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] propaganda chief [[Joseph Goebbels]] even shared a speaker's platform with KPD agitator [[Walter Ulbricht]]. Both parties wanted the parliament dissolved because they were hoping that new elections would oust the SPD, the sworn enemy of all radicals. That fact explained why the atmosphere was particularly volatile this Sunday.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', pp. 39-40.</ref>\n\n===Murder at the Babylon Cinema===\n[[File:Berlin Babylon 2005.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Babylon Cinema,\" the site of the assassinations of Captains Anlauf and Lenck, as it appears today.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12159, Berlin, Trauerzug f\u00fcr ermordete Polizisten.jpg|thumb|right|The funeral of Captains Anlauf and Lenck was attended by thousands of Berliners.]]\n\nAt eight o'clock that evening, Mielke and Ziemer waited in a doorway as Captain Anlauf, Sergeant Willig, and Captain [[Franz Lenck]] walked toward the Babylon Cinema, which was located at the corner of B\u00fclowplatz and Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stra\u00dfe. As they reached the door of the movie house, the policemen heard someone scream, \"''Schweinebacke''!\"<ref name=\"Stasi41\">''The Stasi'', p. 41.</ref>\n\nAs Captain Anlauf turned toward the sound, Mielke and Ziemer opened fire at point blank range. Sergeant Willig was wounded in the left arm and the stomach. However, he managed to draw his [[Luger pistol]] and fired a full magazine at the assailants. Captain Franz Lenck was shot in the chest and fell dead in front of the entrance. Willig crawled over and cradled the head of Captain Anlauf, who had taken two bullets in the neck. As his life drained away, the Captain gasped, \"''Wiedersehen... Gruss...''\" (\"So Long... Goodbye...\").<ref name=\"Stasi41\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Mielke and Ziemer made their escape by running into the theater and out an emergency exit. They tossed their pistols over a fence, where they were later found by Homicide Detectives from the elite ''Mordkommission''. Mielke and Ziemer then returned to their homes.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 41-42.</ref>\n\nAccording to Koehler, \"Back at B\u00fclowplatz, the killings had triggered a major police action. At least a thousand officers poured into the square, and a bloody street battle ensued. Rocks and bricks were hurled from the rooftops. Communist [[sniper|gunmen]] fired indiscriminately from the roofs of surrounding apartment houses. As darkness fell, police searchlights illuminated the buildings. Using megaphones, officers shouted, 'Clear the streets! Move away from the windows! We are returning fire!' By now the rabble had fled the square, but shooting continued as riot squads combed the tenements, arresting hundreds of residents suspected of having fired weapons. The battle lasted until one o'clock the next morning. In addition to the two police officers, the casualties included one Communist who died of a gunshot wound and seventeen others who were seriously wounded.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 42.</ref>\n\nCaptain Anlauf's wife had died three weeks earlier of kidney failure.<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 41\">Koehler (1999), page 41.</ref> The KPD's murder of Captain Anlauf thus left their three daughters as orphans.

Not knowing whether the sergeant could talk and identify the attackers, Kippenberger was taking no chances. He directed a runner to summon Mielke and Ziemer to his apartment at 74 Bellermannstrasse, only a few minutes walk from where the two lived. When the assassins arrived, Kippenberger told them the news and ordered them to leave Berlin at once. The parliamentarian's wife Thea, an unemployed schoolteacher and as staunch a Communist Party member as her husband, shepherded the young murderers to the [[Belgium|Belgian]] border. Agents of the Communist International ([[Comintern]]) in the port city of [[Antwerp]] supplied them with money and forged [[passport]]s. Aboard a merchant ship, they sailed for [[Leningrad]]. When their ship docked, they were met by another Comintern representative, who escorted them to [[Moscow]].\"<ref>''The Stasi'', pages 42-43.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1932, Mielke attended the [[Comintern]]'s Military Political school under the alias '''Paul Bach'''. He later graduated from the [[Lenin School]] shortly before being recruited into the [[OGPU]].\n\n===Trial===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C00678, Berlin, Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, Kranzniederlegung.jpg|thumb|right|German policemen lay a wreath on the monument to Captains Anlauf and Lenck during the Day of the German Police, 16 January 1937. Despite the fact that Captains Anlauf and Lenck were members of the SPD, the [[Nazi salute]] is given by many of those present. In 1951, Mielke ordered the demolition of the monument.]]\n\n\nAccording to Koehler, \"In mid-March 1933, while attending the Lenin School, Mielke received word from his OGPU sponsors that [[Berlin police]] had arrested Max Thunert, one of the conspirators in the Anlauf and Lenck murders. Within days, fifteen other members of the assassination team were in custody. Mielke had to wait six more months before the details of the police action against his Berlin comrades reached Moscow. On September 14, 1933, Berlin newspapers reported that all fifteen had confessed to their roles in the murders. Arrest warrants were issued for ten others who had fled, including Mielke, Ziemer, Ulbricht, Kippenberger, and Neumann.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 45.</ref>\n\nKoehler also stated, \"Defenders of Mielke later claimed that confessions had been obtained under torture by the Nazi [[Gestapo]]. However, all suspects were in the custody of the regular Berlin city criminal investigation bureau, most of whose detectives were SPD members. Some of the suspects had been nabbed by Nazi [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] men and probably beaten before they were turned over to police. In the [[1993]] trial of Mielke, the court gave the defense the benefit of the doubt and threw out a number of suspect confessions.\"<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 416.</ref>\n\nOn 19 June 1934, the 15 conspirators were convicted of [[first degree murder]]. The three deemed most culpable, Michael Klause, [[Max Matern]], and Friedrich Br\u00f6de were sentenced to [[death penalty|death]]. Their co-defendants received sentences ranging from nine months to fifteen years incarceration at hard labor. Klause's sentence was commuted to life in prison based upon his cooperation. Br\u00f6de hanged himself in his cell. As a result, only Matern was left to be executed by [[Decapitation|beheading]] on 22 May 1935.\n\nMatern was subsequently glorified as a [[martyr]] by KPD and East German [[propaganda]]. Ziemer was officially [[killed in action]] while fighting on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican-side]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Mielke, however, would not face trial for the murders until 1993.\n\n== Career in Soviet intelligence ==\n\n===The Great Terror===\n[[File:NKVD1936.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of Felix Dzerzhinsky during a 1936 parade in [[Red Square]].]]\nAlthough Moscow's German Communist community was decimated during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]],<ref>Stephane Coutois, ''et al''. (1999), ''The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression,'' [[Harvard University Press]]. Pages 301-303.</ref> Mielke survived and was promoted. \n\nIn a handwritten autobiography prepared after [[World War II]], Mielke recalled, \"During my stay in the S.U. ([[Soviet Union]]), I participated in all Party discussions of the K.P.D. and also in the problems concerning the establishment of [[socialism]] and in the [[Moscow Show Trials|trials]] against the traitors and [[enemy of the people|enemies]] of the S.U.\"<ref>John O. Koehler, ''The Stasi; The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police'', page 51.</ref>\n\nAmong the German communists executed as a result of these \"discussions\" were Mielke's former mentors [[Heinz Neumann]] and [[Hans Kippenberger]].\n\nMielke further recalled, \"I was a guest on the honor [[grandstand]] of [[Red Square]] during the [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] and [[October Revolution]] parades. I became acquainted with many comrades of the Federation of World Communist Parties and the War Council of the Special Commission of the [[Comintern]]. I will never forget my meeting with [[Georgi Dimitrov|Comrade Dimitrov]], the Chairman of the Comintern, whom I served as an aide together with another comrade. I saw [[Joseph Stalin|Comrade Stalin]] during all demonstrations at Red Square, especially when I stood on the grandstand. I mention these meetings because all these comrades are our models and teachers for our work.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 52.</ref>\n\nDuring his time in the USSR, Mielke also developed a lifelong reverence for [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], the [[Polish nobility|Polish aristocrat]] who founded of the [[Soviet secret police]]. Mielke also began an equally permanent habit of calling himself a [[Cheka|Chekist]].<ref>Koehler (1999), page 31.</ref>\n\nIn a citation written decades later, Mielke described his philosophy of life, \"The Chekist is the political combatant. He is the loyal son of... the [[working class|workers' class]]. He stands at the head of the battle to strengthen the power of our workers' and peasants' state.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 66.</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n[[File:Flag of the International Brigades.svg|thumb|right|225px|The flag of the International Brigades was the [[Spanish Republican flag]] with the three-pointed star of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] in the center]]\nFrom 1936 to 1939, Mielke served in Spain as an operative of the [[Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Militar]], the [[political police]] of the [[Second Spanish Republic]].<ref name=\"Stasi48\">John Koehler, \"The Stasi,\" p. 48.</ref> While attached to the staff of future Stasi minister [[Wilhelm Zaisser]], Mielke used the alias '''Fritz Leissner'''.<ref name=\"Mielke\"/> Bernd Kaufmann, the director of the Stasi's espionage school later said, \"The Soviets trusted Mielke implicitly.

According to author [[Donald Rayfield]], \"Stalin, [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]], and [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]] distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]], journalists like [[Mikhail Koltsov|Koltsov]] were open to infection by the heresies, especially [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s, prevalent among the Republic's supporters. NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on [[Red Terror (Spain)|abducting and murdering]] anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and [[International Brigade]] commanders than on fighting [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin's eyes, was caused not by the NKVD's diversionary efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.\"<ref>Donald Rayfield, ''Stalin and his Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him'', [[Random House]], 2004. pp. 362-363.</ref>\n\nIn a 1991 interview,<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 416-417.</ref> [[Walter Janka]], a fellow German communist exile and company commander in the [[International Brigade]], recalled his encounters with Mielke. During the winter of 1936, Janka was summoned by the SIM and interrogated by Mielke. Mielke demanded to know why Janka had voluntarily traveled to Spain rather than being assigned there by the Party. When he told Mielke to get lost, the SIM demoted Janka to the ranks and then expelled him from the International Brigade. Years later, Janka recalled, \"While I was fighting at the front, shooting at the [[Fascists]], Mielke served in the rear, shooting [[Trotskyites]] and [[Anarchists]].\"<ref name=\"Stasi48\"/>\n\nUpon the defeat of the Spanish Republic, Mielke fled across the Pyrenees Mountains to France, where he was [[internment|interned]] at [[Camp de Rivesaltes]], [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]]. Mielke, however, managed to send a message to exiled KPD members and, in May 1939, escaped to [[Belgium]]. Although the [[Staatsanwaltschaft|Public Prosecutor]] of Berlin learned of Mielke's presence and filed for his [[extradition]], the Belgian Government refused to comply, regarding the assassinations of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as \"a political crime.\"<ref>Wilfriede Otto, ''Erich Mielke.

It horrified numerous Pro-Soviet Westerners who had been witnesses, including [[John Dos Passos]], [[Arthur Koestler]] and [[George Orwell]], and caused them to permanently turn against the USSR.<ref>[[John Patrick Diggins|Diggins, John Patrick]], \"'Organization is Death': John Dos Passos,\" and \"Visions of Order: Dos Passos,\" in ''Up From Communism'', 1975, [[Columbia University Press]], then Harper & Row, pp. 74-117, and pp. 233-268.</ref>\n\nMielke's belief that anti-Soviet Marxists had collaborated with Franco and stabbed the Republic in the back continued to shape his attitudes for the rest of his life. In a 1982 speech before a group of senior Stasi officers, he said, \"We are not immune from villains among us. If I knew of any already, they wouldn't live past tomorrow. Short shrift. It's because I'm a [[Secular Humanism|Humanist]], that I'm of this view.\"<ref name=\"Funder 2003, page 57\">Funder (2003), page 57.</ref>\n\nIn the same speech, Mielke also said, \"All this blithering over to execute or not to execute, for the [[death penalty]] or against-- all rot, Comrades. Execute!

In a biography written after the war, he claimed to have infiltrated [[Organisation Todt]] under the alias '''Richard Hebel'''.<ref>''The Stasi'', page 51.</ref>, but historian John O. Koehler considers this unlikely.\n\nKoehler admits, however, \"Mielke's exploits must have been substantial. By war's end, he had been decorated with the [[Order of the Red Banner]], the [[Order of the Great Patriotic War]] First Class, and twice with the [[Order of Lenin]]. It is likely that he served as an NKVD agent, at least part of the time with [[guerrilla]] units behind German lines, for he knew all the [[Soviet partisan|partisan]] songs by heart and sang them in faultless Russian.\"<ref>''The Stasi'', page 50.</ref>\n\n==Occupied Germany==\n\n=== ''Komissariat-5''===\n[[File:Karlshorst GER-RUS museum.jpg|thumb|left|Former Soviet military and NKGB Headquarters in Karlshorst. Now the German-Russian Museum.]]\nIn 1945, Mielke was ordered by the [[NKGB]] to return to [[Occupied Germany]] as a police inspector, with a mandate to build up a security force which would ensure the dominance of the Communist Party in the [[Soviet Zone]] of [[Occupied Germany]]. Mielke was a protege of NKGB General [[Ivan Serov]], who was headquartered at the Berlin [[suburb]] of [[Karlshorst]]. \n\nOn 16 August 1947, Serov ordered the creation of ''Kommissariat 5'', the first German [[political police]] since the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>John Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 52.</ref> [[Wilhelm Zaisser]] was appointed the organization's head and Mielke was installed as his deputy.\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"The K-5 was essentially an arm of the Soviet secret police. Its agents were carefully selected veteran German communists who had survived the Nazi era in Soviet exile or in concentration camps and prisons. Their task was to track down Nazis and anti-communists, including hundreds of members of the Social Democratic Party. Mielke and his fellow bloodhounds performed this task with ruthless precision. The number of arrests became so great that the regular prisons could not hold them. Thus, Serov ordered the establishment or re-opening of eleven [[concentration camp]]s, including the former Nazi [[death camps]] of [[Buchenwald concentration camp#Soviet Special Camp 2|Buchenwald]] and [[NKVD special camp Nr. 7|Sachsenhausen]].\"<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 52.</ref>\n\nAccording to Edward N. Peterson, \"Not surprisingly, K-5 acquired a reputation as bad as that of Stalin's secret police and worse than that of the Gestapo. At least with the Nazis, albeit fanatically [[racist]], their victims did not suddenly disappear into the [[GULAG]].\"<ref>Peterson (2002), pages 19-20.</ref>\n\n===The Amalgamation===\n[[File:Flagge der SED.svg|thumb|right|The red flag of the SED bore the SED logo, which portrayed the handshake between [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]] [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Otto Grotewohl]] when their parties merged in 1946.]]\nDespite the K-5's mass arrests of SPD members in the Soviet Zone, the number of members continued to grow. By March 1946, the number of SPD members outnumbered KPD members by more than 100,000. Fearing that they would lose the elections scheduled for the autumn, the leadership of the KPD asked for and received Stalin's permission to merge the two Parties. When the SPD's leadership agreed only to schedule a vote for the rank and file to decide, permission was denied by the Soviet occupation authorities. The K-5 then began mass arrests of SPD members who refused to support the merger.\n\nOn 22 April 1946, the leaders of the SPD in the Soviet Zone announced that they had united with the KPD to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED). The SPD in the western zones of Occupied Germany responded by forming the SPD East Bureau in order to support and finance those who refused to accept the merger. Those who joined or worked with the East Bureau were in serious danger of arrest by the K-5 and tried by Soviet [[military tribunal]]s. By 1950, more than 5,000 SPD members and sympathisers had been imprisoned in the Soviet Zone or transferred to the [[GULAG]]. More than 400 were either executed or died during their imprisonments.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 126-127.</ref>\n\n===Investigation===\n[[File:Berlin Kollegienhaus.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''The [[Kammergericht]]'']]\nIn January 1947, two retired [[Berlin police]]men recognized Mielke at an official function. Informing the head of the [[Kripo|criminal police]] in [[West Berlin]], the policemen demanded that Mielke be arrested and prosecuted for the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck.<ref name=\"Stasi53\">Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 53.</ref> [[Wilhelm K\u00fchnast]], the [[Staatsanwaltschaft|Public Prosecutor]] of Berlin, was immediately informed and ordered a search of the [[Kammergericht]] archives. To his astonishment, the files of the 1931 murders had survived the wartime bombing of Germany. Finding ample evidence of Mielke's involvement, K\u00fchnast ordered the arrest of the communist policeman.\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"At that time, the city administration, including the police, was under the control of the [[Allied Control Commission]], which consisted of U.S., British, French, and Soviet military officers. All actions by city officials, including the judiciary, were to be reported to the Commission. The Soviet representative alerted the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]]. Action was swift. [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Vasily Sokolovsky]], who had replaced [[Zhukov]], protested, and his representatives at the Commission launched a vicious campaign to discredit K\u00fchnast.\"<ref name=\"Stasi53\"/>\n\nThe Soviet representatives falsely claimed that K\u00fchnast, a jurist with an impeccable [[German Resistance|anti-Nazi]] record, had been an official of [[Roland Freisler]]'s [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]].<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', pages 53-54.</ref> Taking the Soviets at their word, the [[Western Allies]] removed K\u00fchnast from his position and placed him under [[house arrest]]. During the [[Berlin airlift]], K\u00fchnast fled from his home in [[East Berlin]] and was granted [[political asylum]] in the [[American Zone]].<ref>Koehler, ''The Stasi'', page 54.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Soviet authorities confiscated all documents relating to the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck. According to Koehler, \"The Soviets handed the court records to Mielke. Instead of destroying the incriminating papers, he locked them in his private safe, where they were found when his home was searched in 1990. They were used against him in his trial for murder.\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 417\">Koehler (1999), page 417.</ref>\n\n=== ''Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission'' ===\nIn 1948, Mielke was appointed as security chief of the [[German Economic Commission]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission}}), the precursor to the future East German government.\n\nMielke's task was to investigate the theft and sale of State property on the [[black market]]. He was also charged with intercepting the growing number of refugees fleeing to the [[French Zone|French]], [[British Zone|British]], and [[American Zone]]s.\n\nThose his security forces caught while attempting to defect were used as slave labor in the [[uranium]] mines that were providing raw material for the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]].<ref>Koehler (1999), page 54.</ref>\n\n==German Democratic Republic==\nIn 1949, the Soviet Military Administration ceded its legal functions to the newly created [[German Democratic Republic]]. On 14 January 1950, Marshal [[Vasili Chuikov]] announced that all Soviet \"internment camps\" on German soil had been closed. Soon after, the DWK was absorbed into the newly created Ministry for State Security, which East Germans immediately dubbed the \"Stasi\". With the approval of the Soviets, Mielke's commanding officer from Spain, [[Wilhelm Zaisser]], was appointed as the Stasi's head. Mielke was appointed to his staff with the rank of State Secretary. In 1971, after Walter Ulbricht's overturn as First Secretary of the SED, Mielke was also granted a seat in the SED's ruling [[Politburo]].<ref>Koehler (1999), page 55.</ref>\n\n== Tenure as Stasi head ==\n[[File:Milkes.office.radio.JPG|thumb|right|Erich Mielke's Office, Stasi Museum, Berlin.]]\nMielke headed the [[Stasi]] from 1957 until the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.

Serious violations were tried before secret tribunals and led an estimated 200 Stasi agents to be shot. Colonel Rainer Wiegand once said, \"There was only one way to leave the MfS without being haunted for the rest of your life.

East Germans coined a term to describe the Stasi's pervasive surveillance of the population \"All-Covered\". ({{lang-de|Fl\u00e4chendeckend}}).<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 147\"/> For this reason, Anna Funder has referred to East Germany as, \"the most perfected surveillance state of all time.\"<ref name=\"Funder 2003, page 57\"/>\n\nAccording to John Koehler, \"...the Stasi's tentacles probed every aspect of life. Full-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants. Without exception, one [[tenant]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} in every building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the ''[[Volkspolizei]]''...In turn, the police officer was the Stasi's man. If a relative or friend came to stay overnight, it was reported.  Schools, universities and hospitals were infiltrated from top to bottom. German academe was shocked to learn that [[Heinrich Fink]], professor of [[theology]] and vice-chancellor of East Berlin's [[Humboldt University]], had been a Stasi informer since 1968. After Fink's Stasi connections came to light, he was summarily fired. Doctors, lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, and sports figures were co-opted by Stasi officers, as were waiters and hotel personnel.

[[Christianity in East Germany|Churchmen]], including high officials of both [[Evangelical Church of Germany|Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic Church in Germany|Catholic]] denominations, were recruited en masse as secret informants. Their offices and [[confessional]]s were infested with eavesdropping devices. Even the director of [[Leipzig]]'s famous [[Thomanerchor|Thomas Church choir]], [[Hans-Joachim Rotzsch]], was forced to resign when he was unmasked as a ''Spitzel'', the people's pejorative for a Stasi informant.\"<ref>Koehler (1999), page 9.</ref>\n\nIn an interview with journalist [[Anna Funder]], an ex-Stasi officer recalled, \"Most often, people we approached would inform for us. It was very rare that they would not. However, sometimes we felt that we might need to know where their weak points were, just in case.

Col. Wiegand had been sickened by the 1972 [[Munich massacre]] and was horrified that the GDR would treat the man who ordered it as an honored guest.

However, if these offenses were committed under the banner of the 'anti-imperialist struggle,' the communist system would look the other way.

Its personnel were carefully selected members of the counterespionage and counterterrorism directorate. They were equipped with special batons similar to electric [[cattle prod]]s but much more powerful. In a secret speech to top-ranking Stasi officers on June 29, Mielke warned that, 'hostile opposing forces and groups have already achieved a measure of power and are using all methods to achieve a change in the balance of power. Former Stasi Colonel [[Rainer Wiegand]] told me he was horrified when Mielke compared the situation with that of [[China]] two months earlier. Chinese students in [[Beijing]] had begun massive protests in April and in May, during a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|student demonstration]] in [[Tiananmen Square]], security troops had opened fire on them killing hundreds. 'Mielke said our situation was comparable and we had to be ready to counter it with all means and methods,'  Wiegand recalled.

The old men on the podium wore light-grey suits studded with medals. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] stood next to Honecker, but he looked uncomfortable among the much older Germans. He had come to tell them that it was over, to convince the leadership to adopt his reformist policies. He had spoken openly about the danger of not 'responding to reality.' He pointedly told the Politburo that, 'life punishes those who come too late.' Honecker and Mielke ignored him, just as they ignored the crowds when they chanted, \"Gorby, help us!

Terrified of an East German version of the mass [[lynching]]s of [[State Protection Authority|Hungarian secret police]] agents during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|1956 Revolution]], Stasi agents throughout the GDR fortified their office-buildings and barricaded themselves inside.<ref>Funder (2003), pages 63-64.</ref>\n\n===Toppling Honecker===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild Y 10-0097-91, 30 Jahre MfS, Erich Honecker, Erich Mielke.jpg|thumb|Mielke receives an award from [[Erich Honecker]] 8 February 1980.]]\nEven as orders were going out to implement ''Plan X'', Mielke had already thrown his support behind the anti-Honecker faction in the SED's Politburo. Although he was of the same generation as Honecker and had matured in an environment where following orders was the rule, he was sober enough and politically savvy enough to realize this approach no longer worked.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Collapse: The Accidental Opening of the Berlin Wall|last=Sarotte|first=Mary Elise|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=9780465064946|page=87}}</ref> During a session on 10 October 1989, Mielke delivered a report attacking Honecker's desire to violently suppress the demonstrations rather than offer concessions.\n\nIn what Edward N. Peterson has called \"a remarkable disclaimer of responsibility for the violence,\" Mielke declared that Honecker's orders to him \"were built on false situation judgments.\" He added that Honecker's commands on 7 and 8 October \"were false and undifferentiated condemnations of those who think differently. Despite this evaluation, there was never any instructions to use violence against persons. There is nothing in our basic principles to consider a demonstration as part of a possible [[counterrevolutionary]] [[coup d'etat|coup]].\"<ref>Peterson (2002), pages 204-205.</ref>\n\nMielke also claimed that \"the Party judged the situation falsely. We tried to tell them the true situation, but enough was not done.\" Mielke argued in favor of solving the demonstrations politically and giving \"every DDR citizen the right to travel.\"<ref>Peterson (2002), page 205.</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1989, Mielke and the rest of the GDR's Politburo met to follow Gorbachev's demand, voiced in August, for Honecker be removed as General Secretary of the SED and State Council chairman.<ref>Peterson (2002), pages 208-209.</ref> Suspecting that Honecker's personal bodyguards might try to arrest the members of the Central Committee when they met to vote Honecker out in favour of [[Egon Krenz]], Mielke saw to it that Stasi agents who were loyal to him were stationed near the meeting room.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref> While deliberations were underway, Mielke told Honecker that \"we simply cannot start shooting with tanks,\" and tried to impress upon Honecker that it was \"the end\".<ref>Sarotte, p. 88</ref>\n\nAfter the vote to oust Honecker passed, Mielke \"got nasty,\" and accused Honecker of [[political corruption|corruption]]. Honecker responded that Mielke should not open his mouth so much.<ref name=\"Peterson 2002, page 209\">Peterson (2002), page 209.</ref> Mielke responded by putting the last nail into Honecker's coffin. He announced that the MfS had a file on the now-ousted leader.

They shredded the files until the [[paper shredder|shredders]] collapsed. Among other shortages in the East, there was a shredder shortage, so they had to send agents out under cover to [[West Berlin]] to buy more. In Building 8 alone, the citizens' movement found over a hundred burnt out shredders.<ref>Funder (2003), page 67.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], \"In the weeks after November 9, Stasi offices were stormed in various cities around East Germany. Stasi [[commissar]]s in three of those cities committed suicide.

Formerly a \"rubber stamp parliament,\" the disintegration of the SED's power had allowed the ''Volkskammer'' to begin exercising real authority over the GDR. Therefore, Mielke, as the head of the Stasi (known as the \"shield and sword of the [SED] party\"), was summoned before the newly empowered parliament to justify his position in Government.\n\nAs his speech was broadcast live, Mielke began by using overly bombastic, [[flag-waving]] language, saying \"We have, comrades, dear assembly members, an extraordinarily high amount of contact with all working people\" ({{lang-de|\"Wir haben, Genossen, liebe Abgeordnete, einen au\u00dferordentlich hohen Kontakt zu allen werkt\u00e4tigen Menschen.\"}}).<ref name=\"chronik-der-mauer.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/opfer/Start/Detail/id/618085/page/12/ |title=Rede von Stasi-Minister Erich Mielke in der DDR-Volkskammer, 13.

I am not afraid to stand here and to give you an honest answer\" ({{lang-de|\"Ja, wir haben den Kontakt, ihr werdet gleich h\u00f6ren - ihr werdet gleich h\u00f6ren, warum. Ich f\u00fcrchte mich nicht, ohne Rededisposition hier Antwort zu stehen.\"}}). Mielke continued, speaking of the \"triumph\" of the socialist economy, continuing all the while to address the members of the Volkskammer as \"Comrades\" ({{lang-de|\"Genossen\"}}).  In response, Volkskammer member [[Dietmar Czok]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], rose from his seat  and raised his hand. The Volkskammer's President, [[G\u00fcnther Maleuda]], interrupted Mielke and urged Czok to speak.\n\nWith his voice dripping with contempt, Czok told Mielke, \"As a point of order, let me remind you that there are more people sitting in this Chamber than just your Comrades!\"<ref name=\"chronik-der-mauer.de\"/> ({{lang-de|\"Zur Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung: Ich bitte doch endlich daf\u00fcr zu sorgen.

In response, many in the Volkskammer burst into applause, cheers, and shouts of \"We are not your Comrades!\" ({{lang-de|\"Wir sind nicht deine Genossen!\"}})\n\nTrying to appear magnanimous, Mielke responded, \"This is a natural, Humanistic question! This is just a question of formality.\"  ({{lang-de|Das ist doch nur 'ne nat\u00fcrliche, menschliche Frage! Das ist doch nur eine formale Frage!\"}}), leading to further shouts of displeasure from the members of the Volkskammer. In a last ditch effort, Mielke \"raised his arms like an evangelist,\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 407\">Koehler (1999), page 407.</ref> and cried, \"I love all \u2013 all Humanity! I really do!

John Koehler later wrote, \"Mielke was finished.\"<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 407\"/>\n\nMielke's address to the ''Volkskammer'' remains the most famous broadcast in the history of German television.

The honor is dubious because... he signed so many.\"<ref>Funder (2003), page 56.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the museum at the former Stasi headquarters opened Mielke's office as a permanent exhibit. Soon after, ''[[The Guardian]]'' correspondent [[Tam Eastley]] visited the exhibit and numerous sites in Berlin connected to Mielke's life, times, and legacy. When she visited Mielke's grave, Eastley found that it had become a shrine for adherents of ''[[Ostalgie]]''.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2012/mar/02/stasi-museum-berlin-erch-mielke \"The Guardian\" 2 March 2012]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nErich Mielke was a fitness enthusiast, a non-smoker, and drank very little. He was a keen hunter and owned a large area of ground where he would hunt animals with other East German and visiting Soviet officials.\n\nDuring the late 1940s, when Mielke was working as security chief of the DWK, he began a relationship with Gertrud Mueller, a seamstress. On 18 December 1948, shortly after the birth of their son Frank Mielke, Erich and Gertrud married in a civil ceremony.<ref>Koehler (1999), pages 54-55.</ref>\n\nAccording to the newspaper ''[[Bild]]'', the Mielkes adopted an orphaned girl named Ingrid, who was born in 1950. Like her adopted brother Frank, Ingrid Mielke attended the [[Wilhelm Pieck]] School. She ultimately became a Captain in the Stasi and married a Stasi Lieutenant named Norbert Knappe. The Knappes had both refused to grant an interview to ''Bild'' reporters.<ref name=\"Koehler 1999, page 417\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nErich Mielke has appeared as a character in both films and novels set in the GDR.\n\n* [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s ''[[The Legend of Rita]]'' (2000), which focuses on Stasi collusion with the [[West German]] [[far-left]] [[terrorist organization]] ''[[Rote Armee Fraktion]]''. In conversation with fictional Stasi officer Erwin Hull ([[Martin Wuttke]]), Mielke ([[Dietrich K\u00f6rner]]) expresses admiration for the RAF's campaign against the [[United States]], [[West Germany]], and the [[State of Israel]], which he compares with his own activities against the [[Weimar Republic]] and the Nazis. The RAF members are then brought to a training camp, where Stasi agents instruct them in the use of grenade launchers and other kinds of military hardware. Mielke's name is never disclosed and Agent Hull addresses him only as, \"Comrade General.\" ({{lang-de|\"Genosse General.\"}})\n* [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]]'s ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' (2006), which focuses on the Stasi's surveillance and repression of the East German population. In the film, a previously loyal GDR playwright named Georg Dreymann ([[Sebastian Koch]]) publishes an anonymous article in the West German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' which accuses East Germany's Minister of Culture of having persecuted a [[blacklist]]ed stage director until he hanged himself. Soon after the article goes to press, Mielke's voice is heard over the telephone giving a dressing down to fictional Stasi Lieutenant Colonel Anton Grubitz ([[Ulrich Tukur]]). Addressed only as \"Genosse [[Armeegeneral]]\" (Mielke was the only person to ever hold that rank in the [[Stasi]]), Mielke threatens to throw Grubitz in front of a [[firing squad]] if he fails to identify and arrest the article's author.\n* In [[Philip Kerr]]'s novel ''[[Field Gray|Field Grey]]'' (2010), Mielke first appears in 1931 [[Berlin]], when protagonist Bernie Gunther saves him from being murdered by Nazi [[Brownshirts]]. The novel then flashes forward to 1954, when Gunther is recruited into a [[CIA]] plot to abduct Mielke from [[East Berlin]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-philip-kerrs-field-gray/2011/04/18/AFP6RjdE_story.html Book Review: Philip Kerr's 'Field Gray'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 24 April 2011.</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nMielke received a large number of awards and commemorative medals from organisations within the German Democratic Republic and from allied states.

Most games consist of four players, but there are also two- and six-player variants. Differences include where the players line up and infraction penalties, among others. The materials used in roundnet include a small [[trampoline]]-like object with string netting, a small [[bouncing ball]] with a 12-inch circumference, and four players. Players initially line up directly across from one another, forming an even diamond around the net at the start of a point. In all versions, the game starts with a [[serve (volleyball)|serve]] from one team to another, continues as long as the ball is being hit by players back to the net, and ends when an infraction occurs between either the players or the ball. The game is constantly evolving, with new defensive strategies, serving stances, and playstyles being developed every season. The first ever Roundnet World Championship is scheduled this September 2020 in Belgium.\n\n==Roundnet Basics==\nSometimes referred to as [[Spikeball]], this sport features elements from other sports such as Volleyball and [[Four square|4-Square]]. First, 2 teams of 2 people are formed. Players are positioned at 4 points around the net, with partners located at neighboring positions. From here, one player serves the ball across the net to an opposing team member. The opposing team then has 3 hits to return the ball to the net. After the serve, there are no boundaries of play. Participants are free to run, set, and spike the ball from anywhere around the net. Play continues until a team fails to return the ball or the ball hits a rim piece, at which point the point ends, and the other team receives 1 point.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc1pEqCGWnw</ref>\n\n== Rules==\nSource:<ref name=\":1\">https://tournaments.spikeball.com/pages/official-rules-1</ref>\n\n=== Setup ===\nMaterials needed for roundnet include a trampoline-like net, and a small ball with a 12-inch circumference. Players line up in a square around the net with their partner to one side, and a member of the opposing team on the other. Each partner is ninety degrees away from the next player. Before the point starts, players will always be across the net from an opponent and next to their teammate. \n\nEach point begins with a serve, usually done by the team who won the previous point. To determine who serves first in the match, teams will play a game of rock paper scissors with the winner of the rock paper scissors game receiving the option to serve first or receive first. During the serve, all players who are not receiving the serve have to line up in their designated positions outside of 6 feet from their section of the rim. The returner can stand wherever they want prior to the serve.\n\nOnce the ball is served, all players on both teams can move wherever they may like. After the ball is served, the possession is assumed by the returning team. Once the ball is hit and returned by the non-serving team and hits the net, the possession is flipped. This continues throughout the point, as possession changes whenever the ball hits the net. During each possession, teams have three hits but do not have to use all of their hits.\n\nTo account for harsh sunlight, wind, or any other condition outside of the game; players will rotate serving positions ninety degrees every five points. Only a maximum of 3 touches are permitted.\n\n=== Serving ===\nThe first serve starts the game, and the setup is dictated by the first receiver. The server then stands directly across from the receiver, and only the designated receiver may receive the serve. To serve, the server must throw the ball at least 4 inches away from the release point to begin the serve. The ball is not allowed to be interfered with during the serve. For each point, the server is allowed two serves to complete a legal serve. If they catch, swing at and miss, or drop the tossed ball, it results in a service fault. Servers must be behind the six-foot line away from the net to be eligible for the play. The server cannot lean over the line in order to get closer to the net, and their feet and entire body must be behind the line until the ball is contacted. The server is allowed to take a pivot step, but cannot move further than a pivot. The server can hit the ball at any speed and direction including drop shots. For the serve to be eligible, the ball must not go any higher than the receiver's raised hand. If the ball does this, the receivers must call fault before a second touch occurs or the ball hits the ground. The serving team will have one more try to serve it correctly, or they lose the point. When serving, if the ball hits what is known as a \"pocket\" (the area of the net that is right next to the rim) then the receiving team can call a fault and the server can attempt another serve. If a fault is not called, then the play continues. If two faults occur back to back, the receiving team is awarded the point and possession switches sides. If the serving team wins the point, the server must switch places with their teammate to serve to the other receiver. If the receiving team wins the point, they get to serve the next point.\n\n=== Contacting the ball ===\nRules and regulations exist when the ball is in play. When a team has possession, they must alternate touches, so no double hits happen. The ball must be hit; it cannot be lifted, caught or thrown. Players must use one hand to hit the ball; two-hand hits result in an [[infraction]] and loss of point. Any part of the body may be used to hit the ball. However, if the ball hits any part of the body (even if not the hands), then it may not be hit a second time. In other words, you cannot hit the ball twice in a row no matter what part of the body the ball touches, including if the ball touches elsewhere than the hands. If the ball hits the ground or the rim at any point during the rally, the play ends and a point is given to the other team. If the teams could not determine whether the ball hit the rim or a pocket, the play is replayed. When the ball hits the net, it must clear the rim for the play to be continued. If the ball hits the net again, a double bounce is called and point given to the assuming receiving team. If during a rally the ball hits the pocket, the rally continues. Pockets are only a fault during serves. If the ball makes contact with the net and then proceeds to roll up into the rim, this is known as a \"roll-up\". If this occurs during a serve, the receiving team may call a fault and the serve is tried again. If a roll-up occurs during a rally, it is treated as a pocket, and the rally continues.\n\nInfractions exist even if a team does not have assumed possession, these are called hinders. These include if a defensive player gets in the way of the team going for the ball. It is required that defensive players make an effort to get out of the way to avoid interference. If a player gets in the way of the play, the opposing team must call \"hinder\". They will then be able to replay the point. The offensive team must have a legitimate reason to call \"hinder\". If the defensive player makes an attempt to play at the ball if they do not have possession, they lose the point. If a player hits a shot that hits off the net and hits either themselves or their teammate, they lose the point. If a player makes contact with the set, it results in the loss of the point. Even if the player hit a \"kill shot\", you will lose the point if you touch the set until the ball makes contact with the ground.\n[[File:Roundnet Serve.jpg|thumb|An amateur player shows off the eponymous \"spike\" of Spikeball]]\n\n=== Scoring ===\nScoring in roundnet is dictated by \"rally scoring\", meaning that a team may earn a point whether they are serving or not. Games are usually played to 21 points, but the tournament organizer can change that at his/her discretion. As is common with similar games such as [[Table tennis|ping-pong]], [[tennis]], and volleyball, teams can only win by two points. This can lead to [[Glossary of tennis terms#D|deuces]] and point-advantages until a team wins by 2 points.

(This includes during serves)\n* The ball does not bounce off the net on a single bounce, also known as a double hit.

Most games consist of four players, but there are also two- and six-player variants. Differences include where the players line up and infraction penalties, among others. The materials used in roundnet include a small [[trampoline]]-like object with string netting, a small [[bouncing ball]] with a 12-inch circumference, and four players. Players initially line up directly across from one another, forming an even diamond around the net at the start of a point. In all versions, the game starts with a [[serve (volleyball)|serve]] from one team to another, continues as long as the ball is being hit by players back to the net, and ends when an infraction occurs between either the players or the ball. The game is constantly evolving, with new defensive strategies, serving stances, and playstyles being developed every season. The first ever Roundnet World Championship is scheduled this September 2020 in Belgium.\n\n==Roundnet Basics==\nSometimes referred to as [[Spikeball]], this sport features elements from other sports such as Volleyball and [[Four square|4-Square]]. First, 2 teams of 2 people are formed. Players are positioned at 4 points around the net, with partners located at neighboring positions. From here, one player serves the ball across the net to an opposing team member. The opposing team then has 3 hits to return the ball to the net. After the serve, there are no boundaries of play. Participants are free to run, set, and spike the ball from anywhere around the net. Play continues until a team fails to return the ball or the ball hits a rim piece, at which point the point ends, and the other team receives 1 point.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc1pEqCGWnw</ref>\n\n== Rules==\nSource:<ref name=\":1\">https://tournaments.spikeball.com/pages/official-rules-1</ref>\n\n=== Setup ===\nMaterials needed for roundnet include a trampoline-like net, and a small ball with a 12-inch circumference. Players line up in a square around the net with their partner to one side, and a member of the opposing team on the other. Each partner is ninety degrees away from the next player. Before the point starts, players will always be across the net from an opponent and next to their teammate. \n\nEach point begins with a serve, usually done by the team who won the previous point. To determine who serves first in the match, teams will play a game of rock paper scissors with the winner of the rock paper scissors game receiving the option to serve first or receive first. During the serve, all players who are not receiving the serve have to line up in their designated positions outside of 6 feet from their section of the rim. The returner can stand wherever they want prior to the serve.\n\nOnce the ball is served, all players on both teams can move wherever they may like. After the ball is served, the possession is assumed by the returning team. Once the ball is hit and returned by the non-serving team and hits the net, the possession is flipped. This continues throughout the point, as possession changes whenever the ball hits the net. During each possession, teams have three hits but do not have to use all of their hits.\n\nTo account for harsh sunlight, wind, or any other condition outside of the game; players will rotate serving positions ninety degrees every five points. Only a maximum of 3 touches are permitted.\n\n=== Serving ===\nThe first serve starts the game, and the setup is dictated by the first receiver. The server then stands directly across from the receiver, and only the designated receiver may receive the serve. To serve, the server must throw the ball at least 4 inches away from the release point to begin the serve. The ball is not allowed to be interfered with during the serve. For each point, the server is allowed two serves to complete a legal serve. If they catch, swing at and miss, or drop the tossed ball, it results in a service fault. Servers must be behind the six-foot line away from the net to be eligible for the play. The server cannot lean over the line in order to get closer to the net, and their feet and entire body must be behind the line until the ball is contacted. The server is allowed to take a pivot step, but cannot move further than a pivot. The server can hit the ball at any speed and direction including drop shots. For the serve to be eligible, the ball must not go any higher than the receiver's raised hand. If the ball does this, the receivers must call fault before a second touch occurs or the ball hits the ground. The serving team will have one more try to serve it correctly, or they lose the point. When serving, if the ball hits what is known as a \"pocket\" (the area of the net that is right next to the rim) then the receiving team can call a fault and the server can attempt another serve. If a fault is not called, then the play continues. If two faults occur back to back, the receiving team is awarded the point and possession switches sides. If the serving team wins the point, the server must switch places with their teammate to serve to the other receiver. If the receiving team wins the point, they get to serve the next point.\n\n=== Contacting the ball ===\nRules and regulations exist when the ball is in play. When a team has possession, they must alternate touches, so no double hits happen. The ball must be hit; it cannot be lifted, caught or thrown. Players must use one hand to hit the ball; two-hand hits result in an [[infraction]] and loss of point. Any part of the body may be used to hit the ball. However, if the ball hits any part of the body (even if not the hands), then it may not be hit a second time. In other words, you cannot hit the ball twice in a row no matter what part of the body the ball touches, including if the ball touches elsewhere than the hands. If the ball hits the ground or the rim at any point during the rally, the play ends and a point is given to the other team. If the teams could not determine whether the ball hit the rim or a pocket, the play is replayed. When the ball hits the net, it must clear the rim for the play to be continued. If the ball hits the net again, a double bounce is called and point given to the assuming receiving team. If during a rally the ball hits the pocket, the rally continues. Pockets are only a fault during serves. If the ball makes contact with the net and then proceeds to roll up into the rim, this is known as a \"roll-up\". If this occurs during a serve, the receiving team may call a fault and the serve is tried again. If a roll-up occurs during a rally, it is treated as a pocket, and the rally continues.\n\nInfractions exist even if a team does not have assumed possession, these are called hinders. These include if a defensive player gets in the way of the team going for the ball. It is required that defensive players make an effort to get out of the way to avoid interference. If a player gets in the way of the play, the opposing team must call \"hinder\". They will then be able to replay the point. The offensive team must have a legitimate reason to call \"hinder\". If the defensive player makes an attempt to play at the ball if they do not have possession, they lose the point. If a player hits a shot that hits off the net and hits either themselves or their teammate, they lose the point. If a player makes contact with the set, it results in the loss of the point. Even if the player hit a \"kill shot\", you will lose the point if you touch the set until the ball makes contact with the ground.\n[[File:Roundnet Serve.jpg|thumb|An amateur player shows off the eponymous \"spike\" of Spikeball]]\n\n=== Scoring ===\nScoring in roundnet is dictated by \"rally scoring\", meaning that a team may earn a point whether they are serving or not.

Harvard Arnason]], a Canadian-born man of [[Iceland]]ic descent, who worked as an art historian and became the director of the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1951, and Elizabeth Hickcox Yard Arnason, a social worker by profession who spent her childhood in a missionary community in [[western China]]. Arnason is the niece of the American feminist [[Molly Yard]] and her maternal grandparents were both Methodist missionaries. This [[Methodism|Methodist]] influence would be visible in her works, most notably in ''Ring of Swords''.<ref name=\"tvbookshelf.ws\">http://tvbookshelf.ws/Arnason.mov</ref>\n\nFrom 1949 to 1960, Arnason and her parents lived in Walker's \"Idea House #2\", a futuristic dwelling built next to the Walker Art Center. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516080443/http://www.citypages.com/databank/19/927/article5962.asp] Arnason has said that her experience growing up around [[avant-garde]] artists in a futurist house, in addition to the influence of her feminist, socialist mother contributed to her preoccupation with the future, and consequently science fiction. Prior to 1949, Arnason's family moved frequently: from New York City to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; London; Paris; and St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nShe graduated from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1964, with a B.A. in art history, and continued her education in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, until 1967. She spent the next seven years working as an office clerk in Brooklyn and then Detroit. Her time in these blue-collar, racially diverse areas helped to shape her understanding about class consciousness, conflict, and revolution\u2014notions that are reflected in her works. Arnason moved back to [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] in 1974 and continued to work in offices, warehouses, a large art museum, and more recently, a series of small nonprofits devoted to history, peace, justice, and art.<ref>Arnason, Eleanor.

She became involved in the Student Peace Union and attended demonstrations during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. ''Ring of Swords'', Arnason's {{Not a typo|Hwarhath}} novel, illustrates peacebuilding after a long war; an endeavor both representative of Arnason's peace beliefs and of the [[make love, not war]] politics of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1963, Arnason went to the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] with her mother. This had a profound impact that would be reflected in her story \"Big Brown Mama and Brer Rabbit\" in which Brer Rabbit transforms into an African-American man in the early 20th century. Arnason has often opted for racially diverse characters, including, but not limited to, a heroine of Chinese descent in ''A Woman of the Iron People'' and a Hispanic heroine in Ring of Swords. In addition, her Lydia Duluth stories present a future in which an overwhelming majority of humans have dark brown and black toned skins as the best protection against the radiation of many stars.\n\nArnason had intermittent activist politics outside of her work as an author, working in a campaign office in New York, collecting and transporting supplies for striking coal miners in Kentucky, becoming a local and national official in the [[National Writers Union]] and engaging in [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] precinct politics.\n\n==Published works==\n\n===Standalone Novels===\n*''[[The Sword Smith]]'' (1978)\n*''To the Resurrection Station'' (1986)\n*''Daughter of the Bear King'' (1987)\n*Woman of the Iron People series\n**Part 1 ''In the Light of Sigma Draconis'' (1991)\n**Part 2 ''Changing Women'' (1991)\n**''[[A Woman of the Iron People]]'' (1991)\n\n===Standalone Short Stories===\n*\"A Clear Day in the Motor City\" (1973)\n*\"The Warlord of Saturn's Moons\" (1974)\n*\"Ace 167\" (1974)\n*\"The House by the Sea\" (1975)\n*\"The Face on the Barroom Floor\" (1976) with [[Ruth Berman]]\n*\"Going Down\" (1977)\n*\"A Ceremony of Discontent\" (1981)\n*\"The Ivory Comb\" (1982)\n*\"Glam's Story\" (1987)\n*\"Among the Featherless Bipeds\" (1988)\n*\"A Brief History of the Order of St. Cyprian the Athlete\" (1992)\n*\"The Dog's Story\" (1996)\n*\"The Venetian Method\" (1998)\n*\"Feeding the Mother: A {{Not a typo|Hwarhath}} Religious Anecdote\" (1998)\n*\"The Grammarian's Five Daughters\" (1999), [https://web.archive.org/web/20130421083220/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040329/grammarian.shtml available online]\n*\"Origin Story\" (2000)\n*\"Moby Quilt\" (2001)\n*\"The Lost Mother: A Story Told by the Divers\" (2002)\n*\"Knapsack Poems\" (2002)\n*\"The Potter of Bones\" (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20101013180312/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0401/bones.shtml available online]\n*\"Big Black mama and Tentacle Man\" (2003)\n*\"Big Ugly Mama and the Zk\" (2003)\n*\"Big Green Mama Falls in Love\" (2006) in ''[[Eidolon I]]'' (ed.

In addition, her Lydia Duluth stories present a future in which an overwhelming majority of humans have dark brown and black toned skins as the best protection against the radiation of many stars.\n\nArnason had intermittent activist politics outside of her work as an author, working in a campaign office in New York, collecting and transporting supplies for striking coal miners in Kentucky, becoming a local and national official in the [[National Writers Union]] and engaging in [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] precinct politics.\n\n==Published works==\n\n===Standalone Novels===\n*''[[The Sword Smith]]'' (1978)\n*''To the Resurrection Station'' (1986)\n*''Daughter of the Bear King'' (1987)\n*Woman of the Iron People series\n**Part 1 ''In the Light of Sigma Draconis'' (1991)\n**Part 2 ''Changing Women'' (1991)\n**''[[A Woman of the Iron People]]'' (1991)\n\n===Standalone Short Stories===\n*\"A Clear Day in the Motor City\" (1973)\n*\"The Warlord of Saturn's Moons\" (1974)\n*\"Ace 167\" (1974)\n*\"The House by the Sea\" (1975)\n*\"The Face on the Barroom Floor\" (1976) with [[Ruth Berman]]\n*\"Going Down\" (1977)\n*\"A Ceremony of Discontent\" (1981)\n*\"The Ivory Comb\" (1982)\n*\"Glam's Story\" (1987)\n*\"Among the Featherless Bipeds\" (1988)\n*\"A Brief History of the Order of St. Cyprian the Athlete\" (1992)\n*\"The Dog's Story\" (1996)\n*\"The Venetian Method\" (1998)\n*\"Feeding the Mother: A {{Not a typo|Hwarhath}} Religious Anecdote\" (1998)\n*\"The Grammarian's Five Daughters\" (1999), [https://web.archive.org/web/20130421083220/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040329/grammarian.shtml available online]\n*\"Origin Story\" (2000)\n*\"Moby Quilt\" (2001)\n*\"The Lost Mother: A Story Told by the Divers\" (2002)\n*\"Knapsack Poems\" (2002)\n*\"The Potter of Bones\" (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20101013180312/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0401/bones.shtml available online]\n*\"Big Black mama and Tentacle Man\" (2003)\n*\"Big Ugly Mama and the Zk\" (2003)\n*\"Big Green Mama Falls in Love\" (2006) in ''[[Eidolon I]]'' (ed.

Median sediment concentration in the river water is 3.78 grammes per litre, but may go up to 97 g/L.

These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding [[baseflow]]. These flash floods mostly occur during the evening or night, because the convective rain showers occur in the afternoon.<ref name=\"chapriver\"/>\n\n===Changes over time===\nEvidence given by [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War II#Italian reconnaissance over Ethiopia|Italian aerial photographs of the catchment, taken in the 1930s]] show that 51% of the catchment was covered with woody vegetation (against 45% in 2014). This vegetation could slow down runoff and the runoff coefficient was smaller (8% in 1935 against 12% in 2014). As a consequence, discharges in the river were less and the river was narrower than today.<ref>[https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8543686 Etefa Guyassa, 2017. PhD thesis.

These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding [[baseflow]]. These flash floods mostly occur during the evening or night, because the convective rain showers occur in the afternoon.<ref name=\"chapriver\"/>\n\n===Changes over time===\nEvidence given by [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War II#Italian reconnaissance over Ethiopia|Italian aerial photographs of the catchment, taken in the 1930s]] show that 51% of the catchment was covered with woody vegetation (against 45% in 2014). This vegetation could slow down runoff and the runoff coefficent was smaller (8% in 1935 against 12% in 2014). As a consequence, discharges in the river were less and the river was narrower than today.<ref>[https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8543686 Etefa Guyassa, 2017. PhD thesis.

In 1989, Bischoff would become an on-air interviewer in and host of the AWA until the company folded in 1991. Bischoff at first worked in the sales department on the [[AWA All-Star Wrestling|AWA's syndicated programming]], and became an on-air personality virtually by accident and at the last minute. Larry Nelson, whom at the time was employed by the AWA as an announcer, was arrested under suspicion of a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]].<ref>[http://www.gerweck.net/larryzbyszkointerview.htm Interview Recaps: Larry Zbyszko] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231942/http://gerweck.net/larryzbyszkointerview.htm |date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref> Because of Nelson's sudden unavailability, Verne Gagne and his son, [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg]], opted to recruit Bischoff (who initially had no desire to be in front of the camera) to fill-in on the interviews. Bischoff believed that the Gagnes thought that he would be a good replacement due to his immediate availability in the television studio, and the fact that he was already wearing a suit and tie.\n\nDuring the gradual demise of the AWA, the company was unable to meet payroll, and Bischoff auditioned for an announcer's position with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1990, but was not hired.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1991\u20132001)===\n====Arrival and ascent to power====\nIn 1991, Bischoff joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#C|C-show]] announcer, debuting at [[The Great American Bash (1991)|The Great American Bash]]. As an  announcer, Bischoff reported to producer [[Tony Schiavone]] and WCW's Vice President of Broadcasting, [[Jim Ross]]. In 1993, after WCW President [[Bill Watts]] resigned from the company, Bischoff went to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] executive Bill Shaw and WCW Vice President Bob Dhue to apply for the job of Executive Producer. Ross and Schiavone seemed to be the two top candidates, however, Bischoff was hired in Watts' place.<ref>Foley, Mick. Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.237)</ref> Schiavone remained a producer and commentator until the company's demise, but Ross was granted his release from WCW and went to work for the WWF.<ref>Foley, Mick. Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.238)</ref> Initially, Bischoff and Dhue worked together as partners, but frequently clashed over the direction of the company.\n\nIn 1994, Bischoff was promoted from Executive Producer to Executive Vice President, putting him in charge of everything WCW. Dhue resigned, as did event manager Don Sandefeur and junior vice president [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]]. Bischoff convinced Turner executives to better finance WCW in order to compete with the WWF. He moved WCW production to [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. [[Hulk Hogan]], who was filming a show called ''[[Thunder in Paradise]]'' at Disney-MGM Studios, was approached by Bischoff and [[Ric Flair]] and signed to a contract with WCW. He also invested money in production values and increased the number of WCW [[pay-per-view]]s (first seven a year, then 10, and then once a month). The changes paid off, and in 1995, WCW turned a profit for the first time in the company's history. By 1997, Bischoff's official job title was President of World Championship Wrestling.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====The New World Order====\n{{Main|The New World Order (professional wrestling)}}\nIn 1996, Bischoff signed WWF superstar [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], better known at the time as \"Razor Ramon\". Two weeks later on ''Nitro'', Hall was joined by [[Kevin Nash]], most previously known as \"Diesel\" in the WWF, to become \"[[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]]\". Bischoff intentionally depicted the duo as WWF rebels who were not under contract to WCW. To avoid legal action by the WWF, Bischoff in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#W|worked]] interview at [[The Great American Bash (1996)|The Great American Bash]], asked point blank if they worked for the WWF, which both Hall and Nash denied. The Outsiders expanded and became the New World Order (nWo) when perennial [[face (professional wrestling)|fan-favorite]] Hulk Hogan [[Heel (professional wrestling)|aligned]] himself with the Outsiders in July 1996.\n\nThe nWo was depicted as a rival company engaging in a \"hostile takeover\" of WCW. Week to week, the angle grew more complex, with a mixture of main-eventers, mid-carders, executives, referees, managers, and announcers involved in various subplots related to the onscreen \"WCW vs nWo\" power-struggle. Led by the nWo storyline, WCW overtook the WWF as the number one wrestling promotion in America with ''Nitro'' defeating ''Raw'' in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] by a wide margin for 84 consecutive weeks. During this era, Bischoff moved from his role as commentator and joined the nWo as a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. His television character, dubbed \"Eazy E\" by Hall (\"Sleazy E\" by the WCW commentators), became a dictator and egomaniac as the nWo boss. In the summer of 1998, Bischoff hosted a ''Tonight Show'' like segment on WCW programming with [[Miss Elizabeth]].  [[Ted DiBiase]] has said in shoot interviews that Bischoff originally hired DiBiase to be the spokesperson and financial backer for the nWo, but when the nWo was getting to be a more prominent storyline, Bischoff replaced DiBiase as nWo spokesperson.\n\nBischoff also enjoyed some mainstream exposure at the time, appearing on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Arliss|Arli$$]]'' as well as ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.\n\n====Downfall of WCW====\nWhen the WWF rebranded their product as \"WWF Attitude\" and began to focus on new superstars such as [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Mick Foley]], and [[Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson|The Rock]], and made owner/longtime announcer [[Vince McMahon]] into a character, this eventually resulted in a ratings turnaround for WWF.  On April 13, 1998, WWF ended WCW's year and a half run on top of the ratings war. Despite losing in the ratings to WWF, WCW continued to post strong ratings, attendance, and PPV buyrates throughout 1998. In 1998 WCW built one of its first homegrown superstars in [[Bill Goldberg]], and gave him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on July 6, 1998 at the [[Georgia Dome]] in front of 39,919 people on ''Nitro''.\n\nIn early 1999, Bischoff promoted Kevin Nash to head booker. Despite Goldberg drawing at the box office and doing three shows in December/January that did nearly a $1,000,000 gate, the decision was made to end Goldberg's undefeated streak and put the belt on Nash. On the January 4 ''Nitro'', at the Georgia Dome, Nash dropped the title to Hogan in a match that became known as the [[Fingerpoke of Doom]], and the nWo was rebranded. By March ratings began dropping, and WCW began experiencing an endless streak of ratings losses.\n\nThroughout 1999, Bischoff reverted to focusing on aging WCW stars such as Hogan, [[Diamond Dallas Page]], [[Randy Savage]], [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Roddy Piper|Rowdy Roddy Piper]], Nash, [[Ric Flair]], and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. In an effort to improve ratings, WCW also began to focus heavily on several celebrities such as [[Master P.]], [[Chad Brock]], [[Megadeth]], [[Dennis Rodman]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. One of the last deals Bischoff structured was a deal with the members of the rock band Kiss to have their own wrestling character known as The Kiss Demon.\n\nBy late 1999, WCW began losing around five million dollars a month. Attendance, PPV buys and ratings were down significantly. On September 10, 1999, the decision was made to relieve Bischoff of power.\n\n====Replacement====\nOn September 10, 1999, Bischoff was relieved of his management position with WCW by TBS Sports chief [[Harvey Schiller]]. The job title \"President of WCW\" was eliminated. He was replaced with WCW Vice President of Strategic Planning Bill Busch, who was named Senior Vice President (Handling the creative of the company with Brad Siegel handling the day to day ops). One of Busch's first acts in charge was the additions of former WWF head writer [[Vince Russo]] and his colleague [[Ed Ferrara]] (both of whom had worked on ''Raw'' when the show began to overtake ''Nitro'' in the ratings) to head up WCW's creative direction.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Mooneyham |title=Vince Russo Joins WCW |url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F90215A2-0B7B-4911-8AA85373C58C1CFE |publisher=The Wrestling Gospel |date=September 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204090247/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F90215A2-0B7B-4911-8AA85373C58C1CFE |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2000, Bischoff returned as an on-air character alongside Vince Russo to lead the heel faction [[The New Blood]]; Bischoff also worked on writing the shows with Russo during this time. Bischoff's last on-camera role in WCW was in July 2000 at the [[Bash at the Beach (2000)|Bash at the Beach 2000]] pay-per-view when Russo did a [[Worked shoot#Worked shoots|worked-shoot]] promo on Hulk Hogan.\n\n====Attempted purchase of WCW====\nOn January 11, 2001 with WCW facing major financial woes, Siegel accepted Bischoff's offer to purchase the company.

He resurrected his characteristic brand of smarminess with the general manager position, again playing the arrogant heel character he had employed as the nWo boss in WCW. During his debut on ''Raw'' he told the audience about how he was president of WCW, creator of the nWo and how he forced Vince McMahon to change the ways he does business.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_4/ai_94123540|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208030817/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_4/ai_94123540|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 8, 2006|title=Putting the raw in \"Raw\"|publisher=Wrestling Digest | first=Chad | last=Johnson | year=2002 }}</ref> Bischoff is in second place of the longest reigns as general manager in WWE History, with three years in total. Former rival and former general manager of [[WWE Smackdown|WWE ''Smackdown'']] [[Theodore Long]] surpassed Bischoff's record with a combined number of six years. Bischoff's wrestling innovations in WWE included the \"[[WWE Raw|Raw Roulette]]\" and the [[Elimination Chamber]], as well as [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Shane McMahon]], [[John Cena]], [[SmackDown]] General Manager [[Stephanie McMahon]], and former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] owner [[Paul Heyman]]. At [[Taboo Tuesday (2004)|Taboo Tuesday 2004]] Bischoff had his head shaved after failing to beat his ([[kayfabe]]) nephew [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]]. Bischoff then began a face turn after his head got shaved. He favoured face wrestlers such as [[Randy Orton]], [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chris Jericho]]. Bischoff subsequently took a vacation after allowing Randy Orton's team to become General Managers for up to four weeks with every member being the general manager once a week.\n\nBischoff began favoring heels again after then-WWE Champion [[John Cena]], who was drafted to ''Raw'' in June 2005, refused to participate in Bischoff's vendetta against an impending [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|revival]].<ref name=\"May 16, 2005 Raw Results\">{{cite web|title=The Betrayal|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05162005/|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate=September 14, 2007}}</ref> As a result, Bischoff \"declared war\" on Cena (citing disdain for Cena's rapping and \"thug nature\") and made wrestlers such as [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] try to take away the WWE Championship from Cena. In November, Bischoff aligned himself with [[Kurt Angle]]. Following several months of ''Raw'' and ''Smackdown'' Invasions, Bischoff lost to ''Smackdown'' general manager Theodore Long at [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series 2005]] after [[The Boogeyman (wrestler)|The Boogeyman]] helped Long beat Bischoff.\n\nOn the December 5 episode of ''Raw'', Bischoff was ([[kayfabe]]) \"fired\" as general manager, when Cena body slammed him and Vince McMahon tossed him into a garbage truck - following a \"trial\" where his history of unscrupulous actions were listed - and had him driven out of the arena. Bischoff then sat out the remainder of the year and spent the start of 2006 writing a book that would become ''Controversy Creates Cash''. Bischoff was against writing a wrestling book initially, as he believes \"most are bitter, self-serving revisionist history at best\u2014and monuments to bullshit at their worst.\"<ref>Bischoff, E: \"Controversy Creates Cash\", page 3. [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]], 2006</ref>\n\n====Sporadic appearances and departure (2006\u20132007)====\nOn September 25, 2006, Bischoff appeared on WWE TV for the first time in close to a year, and after being brought into the ring by [[Jonathan Coachman]], he proceeded to promote his recently finished book ''Controversy Creates Ca$h'' ({{ISBN|1-4165-2729-X}}), giving a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|worked shoot]] on McMahon and WWE. During his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|segment]], Bischoff stated, \"Without ''Monday Nitro'' there would be no ''Monday Night Raw''...without the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] there would be no [[D-Generation X|DX]]...and without Eric Aaron Bischoff there would be no Vincent Kennedy McMahon\". After this statement, Bischoff's microphone was immediately cut off, and he was escorted from the arena by security.\n\nA few days later [[John Layfield|John Bradshaw Layfield]] conducted a four-part interview with Bischoff, further discussing his book on WWE.com. During the interview, Bischoff discussed various topics, such as his true feelings towards [[Lex Luger]], his thoughts on ECW promoter Paul Heyman, his decision of giving Kevin Nash [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#B|booking power]], and his overall reaction to the Monday Night Wars. The book was released on October 17, 2006 and became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best seller]].\n\nBischoff was chosen as the special guest referee for the [[D-Generation X]] vs. [[Rated-RKO]] match at [[Cyber Sunday (2006)|Cyber Sunday]] on November 5, with 60% of the vote. He then cheated DX out of the win, leaving Orton and Edge the victors. The next night on ''Raw'', Bischoff was reinstated as General Manager for one night only. During his time as the GM on ''Raw'', he restarted matches if he did not like the outcome. He also got revenge on [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] for her statement made in his trial the year before by making her face [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]], forced John Cena to \"take the night off,\" and banned DX from the building. He restarted the match between [[Jeff Hardy]] and [[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] after Hardy won by DQ. Bischoff restarted that match as a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Disqualification match]], and Nitro took advantage of that using [[Melina Perez|Melina]] to distract Hardy and striking him with the title belt. At the end of the show, DX interfered in the main event when Bischoff tried to help Edge and Randy Orton win the tag team title, and forced him to be humiliated by \"Big Dick Johnson\" as revenge for costing them their match the night before.\n\nOn March 5, 2007, Bischoff made a brief appearance on Raw in Phoenix, Arizona to give [[Vince McMahon]] his thoughts on the WrestleMania 23 match against [[Donald Trump]]. On December 10, 2007, Bischoff made his last contracted appearance with WWE on Raw for its 15th Anniversary Special, and was confronted by [[Chris Jericho]], the man whom he fired on Raw on August 22, 2005.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===\n\n====Immortal (2010\u20132012)====\n{{Main|Immortal (professional wrestling)}}\nIn October 2009, Bischoff helped negotiate a deal among [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), Hulk Hogan, and himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1256669519.php?style=dark|title=Update: Bischoff to join Hogan in TNA|accessdate=October 27, 2009|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref>\nHe premiered alongside Hogan on the January 4, 2010, episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]'' as part of an alliance to take over and rebuild the franchise.

In 1989, Bischoff would become an on-air interviewer in and host of the AWA until the company folded in 1991. Bischoff at first worked in the sales department on the [[AWA All-Star Wrestling|AWA's syndicated programming]], and became an on-air personality virtually by accident and at the last minute. Larry Nelson, whom at the time was employed by the AWA as an announcer, was arrested under suspicion of a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]].<ref>[http://www.gerweck.net/larryzbyszkointerview.htm Interview Recaps: Larry Zbyszko] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231942/http://gerweck.net/larryzbyszkointerview.htm |date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref> Because of Nelson's sudden unavailability, Verne Gagne and his son, [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg]], opted to recruit Bischoff (who initially had no desire to be in front of the camera) to fill-in on the interviews. Bischoff believed that the Gagnes thought that he would be a good replacement due to his immediate availability in the television studio, and the fact that he was already wearing a suit and tie.\n\nDuring the gradual demise of the AWA, the company was unable to meet payroll, and Bischoff auditioned for an announcer's position with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1990, but was not hired.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1991\u20132001)===\n====Arrival and ascent to power====\nIn 1991, Bischoff joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#C|C-show]] announcer, debuting at [[The Great American Bash (1991)|The Great American Bash]]. As an  announcer, Bischoff reported to producer [[Tony Schiavone]] and WCW's Vice President of Broadcasting, [[Jim Ross]]. In 1993, after WCW President [[Bill Watts]] resigned from the company, Bischoff went to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] executive Bill Shaw and WCW Vice President Bob Dhue to apply for the job of Executive Producer. Ross and Schiavone seemed to be the two top candidates, however, Bischoff was hired in Watts' place.<ref>Foley, Mick.

Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.238)</ref> Initially, Bischoff and Dhue worked together as partners, but frequently clashed over the direction of the company.\n\nIn 1994, Bischoff was promoted from Executive Producer to Executive Vice President, putting him in charge of everything WCW. Dhue resigned, as did event manager Don Sandefeur and junior vice president [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]]. Bischoff convinced Turner executives to better finance WCW in order to compete with the WWF. He moved WCW production to [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. [[Hulk Hogan]], who was filming a show called ''[[Thunder in Paradise]]'' at Disney-MGM Studios, was approached by Bischoff and [[Ric Flair]] and signed to a contract with WCW. He also invested money in production values and increased the number of WCW [[pay-per-view]]s (first seven a year, then 10, and then once a month). The changes paid off, and in 1995, WCW turned a profit for the first time in the company's history. By 1997, Bischoff's official job title was President of World Championship Wrestling.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====The New World Order====\n{{Main|The New World Order (professional wrestling)}}\nIn 1996, Bischoff signed WWF superstar [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], better known at the time as \"Razor Ramon\". Two weeks later on ''Nitro'', Hall was joined by [[Kevin Nash]], most previously known as \"Diesel\" in the WWF, to become \"[[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]]\". Bischoff intentionally depicted the duo as WWF rebels who were not under contract to WCW. To avoid legal action by the WWF, Bischoff in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#W|worked]] interview at [[The Great American Bash (1996)|The Great American Bash]], asked point blank if they worked for the WWF, which both Hall and Nash denied. The Outsiders expanded and became the New World Order (nWo) when perennial [[face (professional wrestling)|fan-favorite]] Hulk Hogan [[Heel (professional wrestling)|aligned]] himself with the Outsiders in July 1996.\n\nThe nWo was depicted as a rival company engaging in a \"hostile takeover\" of WCW. Week to week, the angle grew more complex, with a mixture of main-eventers, mid-carders, executives, referees, managers, and announcers involved in various subplots related to the onscreen \"WCW vs nWo\" power-struggle. Led by the nWo storyline, WCW overtook the WWF as the number one wrestling promotion in America with ''Nitro'' defeating ''Raw'' in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] by a wide margin for 84 consecutive weeks. During this era, Bischoff moved from his role as commentator and joined the nWo as a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. His television character, dubbed \"Eazy E\" by Hall (\"Sleazy E\" by the WCW commentators), became a dictator and egomaniac as the nWo boss. In the summer of 1998, Bischoff hosted a ''Tonight Show'' like segment on WCW programming with [[Miss Elizabeth]].  [[Ted DiBiase]] has said in shoot interviews that Bischoff originally hired DiBiase to be the spokesperson and financial backer for the nWo, but when the nWo was getting to be a more prominent storyline, Bischoff replaced DiBiase as nWo spokesperson.\n\nBischoff also enjoyed some mainstream exposure at the time, appearing on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Arliss|Arli$$]]'' as well as ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.\n\n====Downfall of WCW====\nWhen the WWF rebranded their product as \"WWF Attitude\" and began to focus on new superstars such as [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Mick Foley]], and [[Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson|The Rock]], and made owner/longtime announcer [[Vince McMahon]] into a character, this eventually resulted in a ratings turnaround for WWF.  On April 13, 1998, WWF ended WCW's year and a half run on top of the ratings war. Despite losing in the ratings to WWF, WCW continued to post strong ratings, attendance, and PPV buyrates throughout 1998. In 1998 WCW built one of its first homegrown superstars in [[Bill Goldberg]], and gave him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on July 6, 1998 at the [[Georgia Dome]] in front of 39,919 people on ''Nitro''.\n\nIn early 1999, Bischoff promoted Kevin Nash to head booker. Despite Goldberg drawing at the box office and doing three shows in December/January that did nearly a $1,000,000 gate, the decision was made to end Goldberg's undefeated streak and put the belt on Nash. On the January 4 ''Nitro'', at the Georgia Dome, Nash dropped the title to Hogan in a match that became known as the [[Fingerpoke of Doom]], and the nWo was rebranded. By March ratings began dropping, and WCW began experiencing an endless streak of ratings losses.\n\nThroughout 1999, Bischoff reverted to focusing on aging WCW stars such as Hogan, [[Diamond Dallas Page]], [[Randy Savage]], [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Roddy Piper|Rowdy Roddy Piper]], Nash, [[Ric Flair]], and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. In an effort to improve ratings, WCW also began to focus heavily on several celebrities such as [[Master P.]], [[Chad Brock]], [[Megadeth]], [[Dennis Rodman]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. One of the last deals Bischoff structured was a deal with the members of the rock band Kiss to have their own wrestling character known as The Kiss Demon.\n\nBy late 1999, WCW began losing around five million dollars a month. Attendance, PPV buys and ratings were down significantly. On September 10, 1999, the decision was made to relieve Bischoff of power.\n\n====Replacement====\nOn September 10, 1999, Bischoff was relieved of his management position with WCW by TBS Sports chief [[Harvey Schiller]]. The job title \"President of WCW\" was eliminated. He was replaced with WCW Vice President of Strategic Planning Bill Busch, who was named Senior Vice President (Handling the creative of the company with Brad Siegel handling the day to day ops). One of Busch's first acts in charge was the additions of former WWF head writer [[Vince Russo]] and his colleague [[Ed Ferrara]] (both of whom had worked on ''Raw'' when the show began to overtake ''Nitro'' in the ratings) to head up WCW's creative direction.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Mooneyham |title=Vince Russo Joins WCW |url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F90215A2-0B7B-4911-8AA85373C58C1CFE |publisher=The Wrestling Gospel |date=September 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204090247/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=F90215A2-0B7B-4911-8AA85373C58C1CFE |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2000, Bischoff returned as an on-air character alongside Vince Russo to lead the heel faction [[The New Blood]]; Bischoff also worked on writing the shows with Russo during this time. Bischoff's last on-camera role in WCW was in July 2000 at the [[Bash at the Beach (2000)|Bash at the Beach 2000]] pay-per-view when Russo did a [[Worked shoot#Worked shoots|worked-shoot]] promo on Hulk Hogan.\n\n====Attempted purchase of WCW====\nOn January 11, 2001 with WCW facing major financial woes, Siegel accepted Bischoff's offer to purchase the company. Bischoff and a group of investors known as Fusient Media Ventures signed a letter of intent to buy the company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive2001/jan11_wcwsale-can.html|title=WCW sold to Fusient Media Ventures: Eric Bischoff firmly in charge again|publisher=SLAM Wrestling|accessdate=July 8, 2018|date=January 11, 2001}}</ref> However, the new head of Turner Broadcasting, [[Jamie Kellner]] then canceled all WCW programming from its television networks.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bret|last=Hart| title=Wrestling monopoly|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBretHart/030124-sun.html |publisher=Calgary Sun|date=March 24, 2001}}</ref> With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Bischoff and Fusient (Bischoff: \"It made absolutely no sense for us to do the deal under those circumstances.\"),<ref>{{cite news|first=Ed |last=De La Garza |title=WCW goes off the air, promises exciting finale Monday |url=http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol66/115/shobiz/shobiz-index.html |publisher=The Daily Cougar Sports |date=March 21, 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041130202911/http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol66/115/shobiz/shobiz-index.html |archivedate=November 30, 2004 }}</ref> whose offer depended on being able to continue to air WCW programming on the Turner networks.

He resurrected his characteristic brand of smarminess with the general manager position, again playing the arrogant heel character he had employed as the nWo boss in WCW. During his debut on ''Raw'' he told the audience about how he was president of WCW, creator of the nWo and how he forced Vince McMahon to change the ways he does business.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_4/ai_94123540|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208030817/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_4/ai_94123540|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 8, 2006|title=Putting the raw in \"Raw\"|publisher=Wrestling Digest | first=Chad | last=Johnson | year=2002 }}</ref> Bischoff is in second place of the longest reigns as general manager in WWE History, with three years in total. Former rival and former general manager of [[WWE Smackdown|WWE ''Smackdown'']] [[Theodore Long]] surpassed Bischoff's record with a combined number of six years. Bischoff's wrestling innovations in WWE included the \"[[WWE Raw|Raw Roulette]]\" and the [[Elimination Chamber]], as well as [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Shane McMahon]], [[John Cena]], [[SmackDown]] General Manager [[Stephanie McMahon]], and former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] owner [[Paul Heyman]]. At [[Taboo Tuesday (2004)|Taboo Tuesday 2004]] Bischoff had his head shaved after failing to beat his ([[kayfabe]]) nephew [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]]. Bischoff then began a face turn after his head got shaved. He favoured face wrestlers such as [[Randy Orton]], [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chris Jericho]]. Bischoff subsequently took a vacation after allowing Randy Orton's team to become General Managers for up to four weeks with every member being the general manager once a week.\n\nBischoff began favoring heels again after then-WWE Champion [[John Cena]], who was drafted to ''Raw'' in June 2005, refused to participate in Bischoff's vendetta against an impending [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|revival]].<ref name=\"May 16, 2005 Raw Results\">{{cite web|title=The Betrayal|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05162005/|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate=September 14, 2007}}</ref> As a result, Bischoff \"declared war\" on Cena (citing disdain for Cena's rapping and \"thug nature\") and made wrestlers such as [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] try to take away the WWE Championship from Cena. In November, Bischoff aligned himself with [[Kurt Angle]]. Following several months of ''Raw'' and ''Smackdown'' Invasions, Bischoff lost to ''Smackdown'' general manager Theodore Long at [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series 2005]] after [[The Boogeyman (wrestler)|The Boogeyman]] helped Long beat Bischoff.\n\nOn the December 5 episode of ''Raw'', Bischoff was ([[kayfabe]]) \"fired\" as general manager, when Cena body slammed him and Vince McMahon tossed him into a garbage truck - following a \"trial\" where his history of unscrupulous actions were listed - and had him driven out of the arena. Bischoff then sat out the remainder of the year and spent the start of 2006 writing a book that would become ''Controversy Creates Cash''. Bischoff was against writing a wrestling book initially, as he believes \"most are bitter, self-serving revisionist history at best\u2014and monuments to bullshit at their worst.\"<ref>Bischoff, E: \"Controversy Creates Cash\", page 3. [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]], 2006</ref>\n\n====Sporadic appearances and departure (2006\u20132007)====\nOn September 25, 2006, Bischoff appeared on WWE TV for the first time in close to a year, and after being brought into the ring by [[Jonathan Coachman]], he proceeded to promote his recently finished book ''Controversy Creates Ca$h'' ({{ISBN|1-4165-2729-X}}), giving a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|worked shoot]] on McMahon and WWE. During his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|segment]], Bischoff stated, \"Without ''Monday Nitro'' there would be no ''Monday Night Raw''...without the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] there would be no [[D-Generation X|DX]]...and without Eric Aaron Bischoff there would be no Vincent Kennedy McMahon\". After this statement, Bischoff's microphone was immediately cut off, and he was escorted from the arena by security.\n\nA few days later [[John Layfield|John Bradshaw Layfield]] conducted a four-part interview with Bischoff, further discussing his book on WWE.com. During the interview, Bischoff discussed various topics, such as his true feelings towards [[Lex Luger]], his thoughts on ECW promoter Paul Heyman, his decision of giving Kevin Nash [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#B|booking power]], and his overall reaction to the Monday Night Wars. The book was released on October 17, 2006 and became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best seller]].\n\nBischoff was chosen as the special guest referee for the [[D-Generation X]] vs. [[Rated-RKO]] match at [[Cyber Sunday (2006)|Cyber Sunday]] on November 5, with 60% of the vote. He then cheated DX out of the win, leaving Orton and Edge the victors. The next night on ''Raw'', Bischoff was reinstated as General Manager for one night only. During his time as the GM on ''Raw'', he restarted matches if he did not like the outcome. He also got revenge on [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] for her statement made in his trial the year before by making her face [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]], forced John Cena to \"take the night off,\" and banned DX from the building. He restarted the match between [[Jeff Hardy]] and [[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] after Hardy won by DQ. Bischoff restarted that match as a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Disqualification match]], and Nitro took advantage of that using [[Melina Perez|Melina]] to distract Hardy and striking him with the title belt. At the end of the show, DX interfered in the main event when Bischoff tried to help Edge and Randy Orton win the tag team title, and forced him to be humiliated by \"Big Dick Johnson\" as revenge for costing them their match the night before.\n\nOn March 5, 2007, Bischoff made a brief appearance on Raw in Phoenix, Arizona to give [[Vince McMahon]] his thoughts on the WrestleMania 23 match against [[Donald Trump]]. On December 10, 2007, Bischoff made his last contracted appearance with WWE on Raw for its 15th Anniversary Special, and was confronted by [[Chris Jericho]], the man whom he fired on Raw on August 22, 2005.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===\n\n====Immortal (2010\u20132012)====\n{{Main|Immortal (professional wrestling)}}\nIn October 2009, Bischoff helped negotiate a deal among [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), Hulk Hogan, and himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1256669519.php?style=dark|title=Update: Bischoff to join Hogan in TNA|accessdate=October 27, 2009|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref>\nHe premiered alongside Hogan on the January 4, 2010, episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]'' as part of an alliance to take over and rebuild the franchise.

However, there were two serious attempts to capture the town; the first, from October to December 1643, the second, January to February 1645. The town was finally relieved in February 1646.    \n\n==Background==\n{{Location map many|West Country|caption = Western England, 1642 to 1646|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = left\n|label =  BraddockDown|pos=left|lat_deg= 50|lat_min= 26|lon_deg = -4 |lon_min = -34\n|label2 = Exeter|pos2=right|lat2_deg= 50|lat2_min= 43|lon2_deg = -3 |lon2_min = -32\n|label3 = Bridestowe |pos3= top|lat3_deg=50|lat3_min = 44|lon3_deg = -4|lon3_min = 0\n|label4 = Wells|pos4= top|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 13|lon4_deg = -2|lon4_min = -39\n|label5 = Barnstaple|pos5=left|lat5_deg=51|lat5_min =05 |lon5_deg = -4 |lon5_min = -3\n|label6 = Sherborne|pos6=bottom|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =57 |lon6_deg = -2 |lon6_min = -31\n|label7 = |pos7=left|lat7_deg=50|lat7_min = 28 |lon7_deg = -4 |lon7_min = -43\n|label8 = Launceston|pos8=left|lat8_deg=50|lat8_min = 38 |lon8_deg = -4 |lon8_min = -22\n|label9 = Roundway Down|pos9=top|lat9_deg=51|lat9_min = 21 |lon9_deg = -2 |lon9_min = 00\n|label10 = Minehead|pos10=left|lat10_deg=51|lat10_min = 12 |lon10_deg = -3 |lon10_min = -29\n|label12 = Stratton|pos12=left|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min = 50 |lon12_deg = -4 |lon12_min = -31\n|label13 = Plymouth|pos13=right|lat13_deg=50|lat13_min = 22 |lon13_deg = -4 |lon13_min = -9\n|label11 = Torrington|pos11=left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min = 57 |lon11_deg = -4 |lon11_min = -8\n|label14 = Langport|pos14=left|lat14_deg=51|lat14_min = 03 |lon14_deg = -2 |lon14_min = -48\n|label15 = Truro|pos15=bottom|lat15_deg=50|lat15_min = 16 |lon15_deg = -5 |lon15_min = -03\n}}\nWhen the war began in August 1642, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces secured most of southern and western England, including the ports of [[Plymouth]] and [[Exeter]], and the bulk of the [[Royal Navy]]. This prevented Royalist efforts to import arms and men from Europe.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=119-120}}\n\nShortly after the war began in August 1642, Plymouth was cut off by Royalist forces, who set up their headquarters in nearby [[Plymstock]]. They prevented supplies being brought in by land, and blocked the supply of fresh water; with refugees increasing the population to over 10,000, this caused the spread of disease, including [[typhus]]. However, the Royalist army lacked the means to take it by force, and a messenger asking the town to surrender was turned away and told never to return.

In the early stages of the war, most soldiers on both sides were poorly trained and equipped [[Trained bands|militia]]. An exception was Plymouth, where the garrison was commanded by Colonel William Ruthven, and a contingent of experienced Scots mercenaries; their ship stopped to pick up supplies returning from Ireland in early October, and the Parliamentary town council hired them to defend the city.{{sfn|Barratt|2005|pp=35-38}}\n\nParliamentary control of the [[Royal Navy]] made Plymouth largely impregnable from the sea, and allowed them to bring in supplies and reinforcements as needed. The garrison constructed defences on high ground to the north, strengthening it against attack from the land; strongpoints were constructed at Lipson, Holiwell, Maudlyn, Pennycomequick and New Worke. Additional self-supporting forts at Lipson Mill and Stonehouse prevented the town from being fired on from the land, making its capture very difficult.{{sfn|Worth|1890|p=99}}\n\nIn June 1643, Hopton inflicted a serious defeat on [[William_Waller|Waller's]] 'Army of the Southern Association' at [[Battle_of_Roundway_Down|Roundway Down]] on 13 July.

However, there were two serious attempts to capture the town; the first, from October to December 1643, the second, January to February 1645. The town was finally relieved in February 1646.    \n\n==Background==\n{{Location map many|West Country|caption = Western England, 1642 to 1646|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = left\n|label =  BraddockDown|pos=left|lat_deg= 50|lat_min= 26|lon_deg = -4 |lon_min = -34\n|label2 = Exeter|pos2=right|lat2_deg= 50|lat2_min= 43|lon2_deg = -3 |lon2_min = -32\n|label3 = Bridestowe |pos3= top|lat3_deg=50|lat3_min = 44|lon3_deg = -4|lon3_min = 0\n|label4 = Wells|pos4= top|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 13|lon4_deg = -2|lon4_min = -39\n|label5 = Barnstaple|pos5=left|lat5_deg=51|lat5_min =05 |lon5_deg = -4 |lon5_min = -3\n|label6 = Sherborne|pos6=bottom|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =57 |lon6_deg = -2 |lon6_min = -31\n|label7 = |pos7=left|lat7_deg=50|lat7_min = 28 |lon7_deg = -4 |lon7_min = -43\n|label8 = Launceston|pos8=left|lat8_deg=50|lat8_min = 38 |lon8_deg = -4 |lon8_min = -22\n|label9 = Roundway Down|pos9=top|lat9_deg=51|lat9_min = 21 |lon9_deg = -2 |lon9_min = 00\n|label10 = Minehead|pos10=left|lat10_deg=51|lat10_min = 12 |lon10_deg = -3 |lon10_min = -29\n|label12 = Stratton|pos12=left|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min = 50 |lon12_deg = -4 |lon12_min = -31\n|label13 = Plymouth|pos13=right|lat13_deg=50|lat13_min = 22 |lon13_deg = -4 |lon13_min = -9\n|label11 = Torrington|pos11=left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min = 57 |lon11_deg = -4 |lon11_min = -8\n|label14 = Langport|pos14=left|lat14_deg=51|lat14_min = 03 |lon14_deg = -2 |lon14_min = -48\n|label15 = Truro|pos15=bottom|lat15_deg=50|lat15_min = 16 |lon15_deg = -5 |lon15_min = -03\n}}\nWhen the war began in August 1642, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces secured most of southern and western England, including the ports of [[Plymouth]] and [[Exeter]], and the bulk of the [[Royal Navy]]. This prevented Royalist efforts to import arms and men from Europe.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=119-120}}\n\nShortly after the war began in August 1642, Plymouth was cut off by Royalist forces, who set up their headquarters in nearby [[Plymstock]]. They prevented supplies being brought in by land, and blocked the supply of fresh water; with refugees increasing the population to over 10,000, this caused the spread of disease, including [[typhus]]. However, the Royalist army lacked the means to take it by force, and a messenger asking the town to surrender was turned away and told never to return.

It concerns the controversial [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] leader [[Louis Riel]], who was executed in 1885, and is one of Somers' biggest pieces.\n\nIt is arguably the most famous Canadian opera. Somers set the music to an English and French [[libretto]] by [[Mavor Moore]] and Jacques Languirand. The opera was commissioned by the Floyd S. Chalmers Foundation and produced by the [[Canadian Opera Company]] with financial assistance from the Canadian Centennial Commission, the [[Canada Council]], and the Province of Ontario Council for the Arts ([[Ontario Arts Council]]).\n\n== Performance history ==\n''Louis Riel'' had its first performances at the [[O'Keefe Centre]] in [[Toronto]] 23 and 28 September and 11 October 1967 and at the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, [[Place des Arts]], in [[Montreal]] 19 and 21&nbsp;October 1967. [[Victor Feldbrill]] conducted, [[Leon Major]] directed, and Murray Laufer and Marie Day designed the sets and costumes. The original cast included Bernard Turgeon as Riel, Cornelis Opthof as [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], [[Joseph Rouleau]] as [[Alexandre-Antonin Tach\u00e9|Monseigneur Tach\u00e9]], Patricia Rideout as Riel's mother, Mary Morrison as his sister [[Sara Riel|Sara]], Roxolana Roslak as his wife, [[Howell Glynne]] as [[William McDougall (politician)|William McDougall]], and [[Remo Marinucci]] as Baptiste L\u00e9pine.\n\nThe libretto depicts the post-[[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] political events bounded by the Indian and M\u00e9tis uprisings of 1869\u201370 ([[Red River Rebellion]]) and 1884\u20135 ([[North-West Rebellion]]) and the personal tragedy of the leader of the uprisings, the Manitoba schoolteacher and M\u00e9tis hero Louis Riel. After the premiere, Kenneth Winters described the opera in the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' (25 September 1967) as a 'pastiche ... big, efficient, exciting, heterogeneous ... It had no ring of eternity but it was a vigorous harnessing of current and choice; a brash, smart, cool hand on the pulse of a number of fashions, social, dramatic and musical.' The production was repeated in 1968 in Toronto\u2014six performances with the assistance of the Chalmers Foundation\u2014and was adapted by [[Franz Kraemer]] in 1969 for [[CBC Television|CBC TV]].\n\nIn 1975 ''Louis Riel'' was revived by the [[Canadian Opera Company]] for several performances, including one in Toronto, 27 September, honouring the [[International Music Council]]'s 16th General Assembly; three (14, 16, and 18 October) at the [[National Arts Centre]], [[Ottawa]]; and one (23 October, the U.S. premiere) at the [[Kennedy Center]], [[Washington, D.C.]], as part of Canada's contribution to the United States' bicentennial celebrations. Wendell Margrave of the ''[[Washington Star]]'' described the opera as 'one of the most imaginative and powerful scores to have been written in this century.'\n\nUsing a broadcast tape from the 1975 US performance, [[Centrediscs]] produced a three-record set of the complete opera (CMC-24/25/2685-3), which was launched in November 1985 at the 'Image of Riel in Canadian Culture' conference in [[Guelph]], Ontario. Feldbrill conducted the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], Turgeon and Roslak repeated their roles, and were joined by Donald Rutherford (Sir John A. Macdonald), Jean-Pierre Hurteau (Bishop Tach\u00e9), Diane Loeb (Riel's mother), Ann Cooper (his sister), Ronald Bermingham (McDougall), and Remo Marinucci (L\u00e9pine).\n\n'Kuyas'\u2014the lullaby sung in Act III by Riel's wife to their child\u2014was used prior to the opera's premiere as the test piece for the [[Montreal International Competition]] in 1967.

It concerns the controversial [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] leader [[Louis Riel]], who was executed in 1885, and is one of Somers' biggest pieces.\n\nIt is arguably the most famous Canadian opera. Somers set the music to an English and French [[libretto]] by [[Mavor Moore]] and Jacques Languirand. The opera was commissioned by the Floyd S. Chalmers Foundation and produced by the [[Canadian Opera Company]] with financial assistance from the Canadian Centennial Commission, the [[Canada Council]], and the Province of Ontario Council for the Arts ([[Ontario Arts Council]]).\n\n== Performance history ==\n''Louis Riel'' had its first performances at the [[O'Keefe Centre]] in [[Toronto]] 23 and 28 September and 11 October 1967 and at the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, [[Place des Arts]], in [[Montreal]] 19 and 21&nbsp;October 1967. [[Victor Feldbrill]] conducted, [[Leon Major]] directed, and Murray Laufer and Marie Day designed the sets and costumes. The original cast included Bernard Turgeon as Riel, Cornelis Opthof as [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], [[Joseph Rouleau]] as [[Alexandre-Antonin Tach\u00e9|Monseigneur Tach\u00e9]], Patricia Rideout as Riel's mother, Mary Morrison as his sister [[Sara Riel|Sara]], Roxolana Roslak as his wife, [[Howell Glynne]] as [[William McDougall (politician)|William McDougall]], and [[Remo Marinucci]] as Baptiste L\u00e9pine.\n\nThe libretto depicts the post-[[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] political events bounded by the Indian and M\u00e9tis uprisings of 1869\u201370 ([[Red River Rebellion]]) and 1884\u20135 ([[North-West Rebellion]]) and the personal tragedy of the leader of the uprisings, the Manitoba schoolteacher and M\u00e9tis hero Louis Riel. After the premiere, Kenneth Winters described the opera in the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' (25 September 1967) as a 'pastiche ... big, efficient, exciting, heterogeneous ... It had no ring of eternity but it was a vigorous harnessing of current and choice; a brash, smart, cool hand on the pulse of a number of fashions, social, dramatic and musical.' The production was repeated in 1968 in Toronto\u2014six performances with the assistance of the Chalmers Foundation\u2014and was adapted by [[Franz Kraemer]] in 1969 for [[CBC Television|CBC TV]].\n\nIn 1975 ''Louis Riel'' was revived by the [[Canadian Opera Company]] for several performances, including one in Toronto, 27 September, honouring the [[International Music Council]]'s 16th General Assembly; three (14, 16, and 18 October) at the [[National Arts Centre]], [[Ottawa]]; and one (23 October, the U.S. premiere) at the [[Kennedy Center]], [[Washington, D.C.]], as part of Canada's contribution to the United States' bicentennial celebrations. Wendell Margrave of the ''[[Washington Star]]'' described the opera as 'one of the most imaginative and powerful scores to have been written in this century.'\n\nUsing a broadcast tape from the 1975 US performance, [[Centrediscs]] produced a three-record set of the complete opera (CMC-24/25/2685-3), which was launched in November 1985 at the 'Image of Riel in Canadian Culture' conference in [[Guelph]], Ontario. Feldbrill conducted the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], Turgeon and Roslak repeated their roles, and were joined by Donald Rutherford (Sir John A. Macdonald), Jean-Pierre Hurteau (Bishop Tach\u00e9), Diane Loeb (Riel's mother), Ann Cooper (his sister), Ronald Bermingham (McDougall), and Remo Marinucci (L\u00e9pine).\n\n'Kuyas'\u2014the lullaby sung in Act III by Riel's wife to their child\u2014was used prior to the opera's premiere as the test piece for the [[Montreal International Competition]] in 1967. It was recorded in 1983 by Roslak on Centrediscs CMC-1183.\n\n''Louis Riel'' was not presented again until Opera McGill gave the first full staging in 30 years, at [[Place des Arts]], 27\u201328 January 2005, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of [[McGill University]]'s music program.

Mexico's military and diplomatic capabilities had declined after it attained independence which left the northern half of the country vulnerable to the [[Apache]], [[Comanche]], and [[Navajo people|Navajo]]. These tribes, especially the Comanche, took advantage of Mexico's weakness by undertaking large-scale raids hundreds of miles deep into the country to steal livestock for their own use and to supply an expanding market in Texas and the United States.  These raids left thousands of people dead and devastated northern Mexico. When American troops entered northern [[Mexico]] in 1846 they found a demoralized people and little resistance from the civilian population.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Mexicans|Mexican]] rustlers were a major issue during the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865); the Mexican government was accused of supporting the habit. American rustlers also stole Mexican cattle from across the border.

In the 20th century, so called \"suburban rustling\" became more common, with rustlers anesthetizing cattle and taking them directly to auction. This often takes place at night, posing problems for law enforcement, because on very large ranches it can take several days for the loss of cattle to be noticed and reported. Convictions are rare to nonexistent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Patagonia and Araucan\u00eda===\n{{See also|Mal\u00f3n|Banditry in Chile}}\n[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''El Mal\u00f3n'', [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858)]]\n[[File:\u00c1ngel DELLA Valle - La vuelta del mal\u00f3n - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|''La vuelta del [[mal\u00f3n]]'' (The Return of the Raiders) by [[\u00c1ngel Della Valle]] (1892).]]\nCattle raiding became a major issue at the end of the 19th century in Argentina, where cattle stolen during ''[[mal\u00f3n|malones]]'' were taken through ''[[Camino de los chilenos]]'' across the [[Andes]] to [[Chile]], where they were exchanged for alcoholic beverages and [[firearm]]s. Several indigenous groups and outlaws, such as the [[Boroano people|Boroano]] and [[Ranquel]] peoples, and the [[Pincheira brothers]], ravaged the southern frontier of Argentina in search of cattle. To prevent the cattle raiding, the Argentine government built a system of trenches called [[Zanja de Alsina]] in the 1870s.

Mexico's military and diplomatic capabilities had declined after it attained independence which left the northern half of the country vulnerable to the [[Apache]], [[Comanche]], and [[Navajo people|Navajo]]. These tribes, especially the Comanche, took advantage of Mexico's weakness by undertaking large-scale raids hundreds of miles deep into the country to steal livestock for their own use and to supply an expanding market in Texas and the United States.  These raids left thousands of people dead and devastated northern Mexico. When American troops entered northern [[Mexico]] in 1846 they found a demoralized people and little resistance from the civilian population.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Mexicans|Mexican]] rustlers were a major issue during the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865); the Mexican government was accused of supporting the habit. American rustlers also stole Mexican cattle from across the border. Failure to [[Livestock branding|brand]] [[maverick (animal)|new calves]] facilitated theft.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nConflict over alleged rustling was a major issue in the [[Johnson County War]] of 1892 in [[Wyoming]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe transition from [[open range]] to fenced grazing gradually reduced the practice of rustling in North America. In the 20th century, so called \"suburban rustling\" became more common, with rustlers anesthetizing cattle and taking them directly to auction. This often takes place at night, posing problems for law enforcement, because on very large ranches it can take several days for the loss of cattle to be noticed and reported. Convictions are rare to nonexistent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Patagonia and Araucan\u00eda===\n{{See also|Mal\u00f3n|Banditry in Chile}}\n[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''El Mal\u00f3n'', [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858)]]\n[[File:\u00c1ngel DELLA Valle - La vuelta del mal\u00f3n - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|''La vuelta del [[mal\u00f3n]]'' (The Return of the Raiders) by [[\u00c1ngel Della Valle]] (1892).]]\nCattle raiding became a major issue at the end of the 19th century in Argentina, where cattle stolen during ''[[mal\u00f3n|malones]]'' were taken through ''[[Camino de los chilenos]]'' across the [[Andes]] to [[Chile]], where they were exchanged for alcoholic beverages and [[firearm]]s. Several indigenous groups and outlaws, such as the [[Boroano people|Boroano]] and [[Ranquel]] peoples, and the [[Pincheira brothers]], ravaged the southern frontier of Argentina in search of cattle. To prevent the cattle raiding, the Argentine government built a system of trenches called [[Zanja de Alsina]] in the 1870s. Most cattle raids ended after the military campaigns of the [[Conquest of the Desert]] in the 1870s, and the following partition of [[Patagonia]] established by the [[Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe return of Chilean veterans from the [[War of the Pacific]] coincided with the Chilean Army's crushing of [[Mapuche]] resistance in the [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda]] (1861\u20131883).
