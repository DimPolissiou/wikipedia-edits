The club was founded in 1901 and joined the Football League in 1921. Since 1909, Barrow have played their home games at [[Holker Street]], (currently sponsored for the 2019/2020 season as the \"Progression Solicitors Stadium\"), close to the town centre and approximately half a mile from [[Barrow-in-Furness railway station|Barrow Railway Station]].\n\nThe club spent fifty one years in [[the Football League]] between 1921 and 1972,  achieving promotion to Division 3 by finishing 3rd in the [[Football League Fourth Division]] in the 1966\u201367 season. The highest ever league placing in the club's history came in the 1967\u201368 season, finishing 8th in League Division 3. At one stage in the season, Barrow led the way and went top of the table for the one and only time in their history. They did so, courtesy of a 1\u20134 away win at [[Hartlepool]]. Life in the third tier of English football was to be short-lived and relegation back to Division 4 came just two seasons later, at the end of 1969\u201370 season. Fortunes never improved and after being successfully re-elected to the Football League after finishing rock bottom of Division 4 in 1970\u201371, the following season, 1971\u201372 was to be Barrow\u2019s last as a Football League club and after a failed bid for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]], Barrow were voted out of the Football League, to be replaced by [[Hereford_United_F.C.|Hereford United]] of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. Barrow have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football, having been promoted five times to the Conference (of which they were a [[1979\u201380 Alliance Premier League|founder member]]), most recently as [[Conference North]] champions in [[2014\u201315 Football Conference|2014\u201315]]. In addition they have twice won non-league football's most prestigious cup competition, the [[FA Trophy]] \u2013 in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only club to have won the Trophy at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums.\n\nThe club colours are blue and white, though the combination of these has varied over time, leading to their nickname \"The Bluebirds\". \n\nThe record attendance at [[Holker Street]] is 16,874 and was set against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] in the [[FA Cup]] Third Round in 1954.\n\n==Club history==\n\n===Early years===\nBarrow were founded on 16 July 1901 at the old Drill Hall (later the Palais) in the Strand and played initially at the Strawberry Ground, before moving to Ainslie Street<ref name=\"Beautiful\">[http://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/barrow/ Barrow] The Beautiful History.

[[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Cumbria]].<ref>http://www.nwemail.co.uk/Full-time-regime-benefiting-Barrow-AFC-44df27c5-f75f-4a5e-94b6-2a04e6b0275b-ds</ref>\n\nThe club currently participates in the Vanarama [[National League (division)|National League]], the fifth tier of the English league system. The club was founded in 1901 and joined the Football League in 1921. Since 1909, Barrow have played their home games at [[Holker Street]], (currently sponsored for the 2019/2020 season as the \"Progression Solicitors Stadium\"), close to the town centre and approximately half a mile from [[Barrow-in-Furness railway station|Barrow Railway Station]].\n\nThe club spent fifty one years in [[the Football League]] between 1921 and 1972,  achieving promotion to Division 3 by finishing 3rd in the [[Football League Fourth Division]] in the 1966\u201367 season. The highest ever league placing in the club's history came in the 1967\u201368 season, finishing 8th in League Division 3. At one stage in the season, Barrow led the way and went top of the table for the one and only time in their history. They did so, courtesy of a 1\u20134 away win at [[Hartlepool]]. Life in the third tier of English football was to be short-lived and relegation back to Division 4 came just two seasons later, at the end of 1969\u201370 season. Fortunes never improved and after being successfully re-elected to the Football League after finishing rock bottom of Division 4 in 1970\u201371, the following season, 1971\u201372 was to be Barrow\u2019s last as a Football League club and after a failed bid for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]], Barrow were voted out of the Football League, to be replaced by [[Hereford_United_F.C.|Hereford United]] of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. Barrow have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football, having been promoted five times to the Conference (of which they were a [[1979\u201380 Alliance Premier League|founder member]]), most recently as [[Conference North]] champions in [[2014\u201315 Football Conference|2014\u201315]]. In addition they have twice won non-league football's most prestigious cup competition, the [[FA Trophy]] \u2013 in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only club to have won the Trophy at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums.\n\nThe club colours are blue and white, though the combination of these has varied over time, leading to their nickname \"The Bluebirds\". \n\nThe record attendance at [[Holker Street]] is 16,874 and was set against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] in the [[FA Cup]] Third Round in 1954.\n\n==Club history==\n\n===Early years===\nBarrow were founded on 16 July 1901 at the old Drill Hall (later the Palais) in the Strand and played initially at the Strawberry Ground, before moving to Ainslie Street<ref name=\"Beautiful\">[http://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/barrow/ Barrow] The Beautiful History.

She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. At a fashion show in London, filmmaker [[Kaizad Gustad]] spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in ''[[Boom (film)|Boom]]'' (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, ''[[Malliswari (2004 film)|Malliswari]]'' (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies ''[[Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?]]'' (2005) and ''[[Namastey London]]'' (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and inclination to [[Androcentrism|male-dominated]] films.\n\nKaif's performance in the terrorism drama ''[[New York (2009 film)|New York]]'' (2009) was better received, earning her a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]] nomination. After starring roles in ''[[Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani]]'' (2009), ''[[Raajneeti]]'' (2010) and ''[[Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara]]'' (2011), she received her second [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]] nomination for her performance in ''[[Mere Brother Ki Dulhan]]'' (2011). Kaif's highest-grossing films came with the action thrillers ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'' (2012), ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013) and ''[[Bang Bang!]]'' (2014), all of which rank among the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]]. She followed this with roles in a series of films that did not perform well commercially, with the exception of the action sequel ''[[Tiger Zinda Hai]]'' (2017) and the drama ''[[Bharat (film)|Bharat]]'' (2019), but received praise for playing an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama ''[[Zero (2018 film)|Zero]]'' (2018), for which she received a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nIn addition to acting, Kaif is involved with her mother's charity and participates in stage shows. She is guarded about her personal life, which is a subject of media scrutiny, as is her background.\n\n== Early life and background ==\nKatrina Kaif was born in [[Hong Kong]] with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983.{{efn|name=A|Although Kaif has said that she was born in 1983, her birth year has been quoted (or inferred) in reliable sources as 1983 or 1984.<ref>{{cite video|date=12 July 2011 |title=Katrina, Hrithik Do A Jig At India TV Broadcast Centre |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maiuTjFv3-Y&t=14m27s |publisher=YouTube |quote=Event occurs at 14:27 |accessdate=3 August 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lalwani|first=Vickey|title=Salman Khan's there for me: Katrina Kaif|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-29/news-interviews/29716644_1_yash-chopra-priyanka-film|accessdate=4 October 2013|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=29 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010512/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-29/news-interviews/29716644_1_yash-chopra-priyanka-film|archive-date=5 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Katrina Kaif turns 30!

[[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], Kaif and her family lived in several countries before she moved to [[London]]. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. At a fashion show in London, filmmaker [[Kaizad Gustad]] spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in ''[[Boom (film)|Boom]]'' (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, ''[[Malliswari (2004 film)|Malliswari]]'' (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies ''[[Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?]]'' (2005) and ''[[Namastey London]]'' (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and inclination to [[Androcentrism|male-dominated]] films.\n\nKaif's performance in the terrorism drama ''[[New York (2009 film)|New York]]'' (2009) was better received, earning her a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]] nomination. After starring roles in ''[[Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani]]'' (2009), ''[[Raajneeti]]'' (2010) and ''[[Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara]]'' (2011), she received her second [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]] nomination for her performance in ''[[Mere Brother Ki Dulhan]]'' (2011). Kaif's highest-grossing films came with the action thrillers ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]'' (2012), ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013) and ''[[Bang Bang!]]'' (2014), all of which rank among the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]]. She followed this with roles in a series of films that did not perform well commercially, with the exception of the action sequel ''[[Tiger Zinda Hai]]'' (2017) and the drama ''[[Bharat (film)|Bharat]]'' (2019), but received praise for playing an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama ''[[Zero (2018 film)|Zero]]'' (2018), for which she received a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nIn addition to acting, Kaif is involved with her mother's charity and participates in stage shows.

The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer.

Under Bank of America the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.\n\n[[File:Bank of America footprint.png|thumb|left|Bank of America footprint]]\nBank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In 2006, Bank of America sold BankBoston's operations to Brazilian bank Banco Ita\u00fa, in exchange for Ita\u00fa shares. The BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction and, as part of the sale agreement, cannot be used by Bank of America (ending the BankBoston brand).\n\nIn May 2006, Bank of America and [[Banco Ita\u00fa]] (Investimentos Ita\u00fa S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement through which Ita\u00fa agreed to acquire BankBoston's operations in Brazil and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America's operations in [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. The deal was signed in August 2006 under which Ita\u00fa agreed to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay. Prior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Ita\u00fa stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Ita\u00fa to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of [[The United States Trust Company]] for $3.3&nbsp;billion, from the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]].

The [[Federal Reserve Board]] gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer. The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140&nbsp;billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.\n\n[[File:Bank of America footprint.png|thumb|left|Bank of America footprint]]\nBank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In 2006, Bank of America sold BankBoston's operations to Brazilian bank Banco Ita\u00fa, in exchange for Ita\u00fa shares. The BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction and, as part of the sale agreement, cannot be used by Bank of America (ending the BankBoston brand).\n\nIn May 2006, Bank of America and [[Banco Ita\u00fa]] (Investimentos Ita\u00fa S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement through which Ita\u00fa agreed to acquire BankBoston's operations in Brazil and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America's operations in [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. The deal was signed in August 2006 under which Ita\u00fa agreed to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay. Prior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Ita\u00fa stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Ita\u00fa to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of [[The United States Trust Company]] for $3.3&nbsp;billion, from the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]].

Many of LaSalle's branches and offices had already taken over smaller regional banks within the previous decade, such as Lansing and Detroit based [[Michigan National Bank]].
