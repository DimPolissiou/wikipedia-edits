King Fahd first responded by ignoring their requests and when they persisted, reformists were harshly persecuted, imprisoned and fired from their jobs.\n\nDuring King Fahd's rule, the royal family's lavish spending of the country's wealth reached its height.

Up to this day, the country is reliant on imports for nearly all its light and heavy machinery.\n\nKing Fahd established a Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs directed by senior family members and technocrats in 1994. The council was planned to function as an ombudsman of Islamic activity concerning educational, economic and foreign policy matters. The chairman of the council was [[Prince Sultan]].

The moka pot is an Italian invention, first produced by [[Bialetti]] in the early 1930s. The flavor of moka pot coffee depends greatly on bean variety, roast level, fineness of grind, and the level of heat used. Due to the higher-than-atmospheric pressure involved, the mixture of water and steam reaches temperatures well above 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, causing a more efficient extraction of caffeine and flavors from the grounds, and resulting in a stronger brew than that obtained by drip brewing.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Vacuum coffee==\n{{Main|Vacuum coffee maker}}\n\nA [[Vacuum coffee maker|vacuum coffee]] maker brews coffee using two chambers where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee.

The drink consists of a single or double-shot of espresso combined with between 1 and 16 fluid ounces (30\u2013470 ml) of hot water. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso added. In the United States, \"Americano\" is used broadly to mean combining hot water and espresso in either order. Variations include [[long black]] and [[lungo]].\n\n; Caff\u00e8 Lungo\n{{Main|Lungo}}\n\nThe [[Lungo|caff\u00e8 lungo]] (or allong\u00e9 in French) is similar to a [[Caff\u00e8 Americano]] or a [[long black]]. However, instead of adding water to an espresso, all the water is brewed. The lungo is generally smaller than an Americano or a long black. \n\n; Manilo\n{{Main|Manilo}}\n\nA Manilo coffee consists of a regular espresso shot and less than 100ml of silky milk. Popularised due to its strength and taste, without a lot of milk. Similar to a half flat white, but slightly smaller.\n\n; ''Caf\u00e9 Cubano''\n{{Main|Cuban espresso}}\n\nCuban tradition is to drink coffee strong and sweet, often mixing the sugar with the coffee beans before brewing. The traditional method of brewing coffee was a filter method using a cloth cone; this has mostly been replaced with an aluminium ''cafetera'' or [[coffeemaker]]\u2014in tourist areas some caf\u00e9s will have an espresso machine, though espresso machines are expensive, so espresso is not a common drink for most Cubans.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmwoqEURqFkC&pg=PA139|page=139|title=From Cuba with Love: Recipes and Memories|author= Ramona V.

The same recipe for coffee which is called \"Kopi Susu Panas\" (Malaysia) or \"Gafeh Rorn\" [lit: hot coffee] (Thailand) has already been around for decades and is very popular in \"mamak\" stalls and \"kopitiams\" in Malaysia. A caf\u00e9 bomb\u00f3n, however, uses espresso served with sweetened condensed milk in a 1:1 ratio whereas the Asian version uses ground coffee and sweetened condensed milk at the same ratio. On the Canary Islands a variety named \"Caf\u00e9 Proprio\" or \"Largo Condensada\" is served using the same amount of condensed milk but a \"caf\u00e9 largo\" or espresso lungo. For caf\u00e9 bomb\u00f3n, the condensed milk is added to the espresso. For visual effect, a glass is used, and the condensed milk is added slowly to sink underneath the coffee and create two separate bands of contrasting colour \u2013 though these layers are customarily stirred together before consumption.

It is typical of Spain and according to folk etymology, its origin dates to the Spanish occupation of Cuba. The troops combined coffee with rum to give them courage (coraje in Spanish, hence \"corajillo\" and more recently \"carajillo\"). There are many different ways of making a carajillo, ranging from black coffee with the spirit simply poured in to heating the spirit with lemon, sugar and cinnamon and adding the coffee last. A similar Italian drink is known as [[caff\u00e8 corretto]]. The American version of a Spanish Coffee uses a heated sugar-rimmed Spanish coffee mug with 3/4 ounce of rum and 1/2 ounce of [[triple sec]].

It is very popular in [[Greece]] especially during summer, but has now spread on to other countries.\n\nThere are numerous ways in which this coffee can be tailored to the individual's taste such as: all water-no milk; half-half; all milk and; varying levels of sweetness. Frappe is also extremely popular in the country of Cyprus where fresh milk is used as opposed to condensed.\nIn French, when describing a drink, the word frapp\u00e9 means shaken or chilled; however, in popular Greek culture, the word frapp\u00e9 is predominantly taken to refer to the shaking associated with the preparation of a caf\u00e9 frapp\u00e9.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n=== Greek Freddo preparations ===\n\n==== Freddo Espresso ====\n[[Freddo Espresso]] is a foam-covered iced coffee made from espresso. It is found in every caf\u00e9 and coffee shop in Greece. It is undoubtedly popular among the young people during summer, or on hot days. Because of the very hot summers in Greece, and the need to escape from the heat, people began to make cold variations of the popular coffee styles. It consists of two shots of espresso (30-50 ml), sugar, and ice (60-100 ml) 1:2 ( espresso shots:ice). The espresso is mixed with the sugar in a [[Frapiera|''frapi\u00e8ra'']] (a drink mixer). The [[frapiera]] mixes the coffee with the sugar, producing a foam from the oils of espresso, and lowers the temperature. The coffee is then poured over ice into its serving glass. The melting of the ice cubes dilutes the coffee and results in a desirable level of bitterness and strength.\n\n==== Freddo Cappuccino ====\n[[Freddo Cappuccino]] is another variation of the original cappuccino. It is as popular as the freddo espresso. It follows the same process as the [[freddo espresso]], but at the end foamed and creamed milk is added in ratio 1:2 (espresso shots:milk), and 1:2 ( espresso shots:ice). Recently the Coffee Island coffee shop (a coffee shop franchise in Greece), established a new foam and cream trend in freddo cappuccino. They use plant based milk creamed in the ''[[Frapiera|frapi\u00e8ra]]''. The result is a stiffer and sweeter cream.\n\n=== Other ===\n;Mazagran\n[[Mazagran (coffee beverage)|Mazagran]] (sometimes misspelled as [[Mazagrin]]) is a cold coffee drink that originated in Algeria. It is typically served in a tall glass, and is made with coffee and ice. Sometimes sugar, [[rum]], lemon or water is added. Sometimes a fast version is achieved by pouring a previously sweetened espresso in a cup with ice cubes and a slice of lemon.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n;Palazzo\nA Palazzo is an iced coffee variant, popular in Southern California. It is two shots of [[espresso]], chilled immediately after brewing and mixed with sweetened cream. A Palazzo is typically made using a [[moka pot]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n;Ice Shot\nOriginating in Australia and similar to the Mazagran, the minimal Ice Shot is a single shot of fresh espresso poured into an ordinary latt\u00e9 glass that has been filled with ice. The hot coffee, in melting some of the ice is diluted, re-freezing to a granita-like texture. The addition of a single scoop of ice-cream on top is a popular variant. No milk, sugar, extra flavouring or cream are involved.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n;Shakerato\n[[Shakerato]] is an iced coffee made by shaking [[espresso]] and ice cubes.\n\n==Instant coffee==\n{{main|Instant coffee}}\n[[File:Instant coffee.jpg|thumb|Instant coffee.]]\n[[Instant coffee]] is a drink derived from brewed coffee beans.

The Double-Double coffee will taste exactly the same in any cup size, from the small 10oz cup to the extra large 24oz cup. The chain achieves flavor consistency across cup sizes by employing a pair of countertop vending machines, one dispensing cream and the other dispensing sugar, with a button for each of the four cup sizes. The name \"double-double\" refers to the number of shots of each added, that is, two shots of cream and two shots of sugar. The terms \"single-single\" or \"regular\" and \"triple-triple\", though not as common as the \"double-double\", refer to coffee with one shot of sugar and cream and coffee with three shots of sugar and cream, respectively. The machines are calibrated regularly to ensure they dispense a perfect shot of cream or sugar to exacting specifications.

Turkish coffee is prepared by immersing the coffee grounds in water and heating until it just boils. This method produces the maximum amount of foam. If the coffee is left to boil longer, less foam remains. In Turkey, four degrees of sweetness are used. The Turkish terms and approximate amounts are as follows: ''sade'' (plain; no sugar), ''az \u015fekerli'' (little sugar; half a level teaspoon of sugar), ''orta \u015fekerli'' (medium sugar; one level teaspoon), ''\u00e7ok \u015fekerli'' (a lot of sugar).

The moka pot is an Italian invention, first produced by [[Bialetti]] in the early 1930s. The flavor of moka pot coffee depends greatly on bean variety, roast level, fineness of grind, and the level of heat used. Due to the higher-than-atmospheric pressure involved, the mixture of water and steam reaches temperatures well above 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, causing a more efficient extraction of caffeine and flavors from the grounds, and resulting in a stronger brew than that obtained by drip brewing.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Vacuum coffee==\n{{Main|Vacuum coffee maker}}\n\nA [[Vacuum coffee maker|vacuum coffee]] maker brews coffee using two chambers where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee.

The drink consists of a single or double-shot of espresso combined with between 1 and 16 fluid ounces (30\u2013470 ml) of hot water. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso added. In the United States, \"Americano\" is used broadly to mean combining hot water and espresso in either order.

It might have been re-created and modified to suit European tastebuds as in many parts of Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. The same recipe for coffee which is called \"Kopi Susu Panas\" (Malaysia) or \"Gafeh Rorn\" [lit: hot coffee] (Thailand) has already been around for decades and is very popular in \"mamak\" stalls and \"kopitiams\" in Malaysia. A caf\u00e9 bomb\u00f3n, however, uses espresso served with sweetened condensed milk in a 1:1 ratio whereas the Asian version uses ground coffee and sweetened condensed milk at the same ratio. On the Canary Islands a variety named \"Caf\u00e9 Proprio\" or \"Largo Condensada\" is served using the same amount of condensed milk but a \"caf\u00e9 largo\" or espresso lungo.

It is typical of Spain and according to folk etymology, its origin dates to the Spanish occupation of Cuba. The troops combined coffee with rum to give them courage (coraje in Spanish, hence \"corajillo\" and more recently \"carajillo\"). There are many different ways of making a carajillo, ranging from black coffee with the spirit simply poured in to heating the spirit with lemon, sugar and cinnamon and adding the coffee last. A similar Italian drink is known as [[caff\u00e8 corretto]]. The American version of a Spanish Coffee uses a heated sugar-rimmed Spanish coffee mug with 3/4 ounce of rum and 1/2 ounce of [[triple sec]]. The drink is then flamed to caramelize the sugar, with 2 ounces of coffee liqueur then added to put out the flame, and then topped off with 3 to 4 ounces of coffee, and whipped cream.\n*[[Gunfire (drink)]] has its origins in the British Army, typically made by mixing black tea with rum, though in Australia and New Zealand it is more often made with black coffee instead.

Frappe is also extremely popular in the country of Cyprus where fresh milk is used as opposed to condensed.\nIn French, when describing a drink, the word frapp\u00e9 means shaken or chilled; however, in popular Greek culture, the word frapp\u00e9 is predominantly taken to refer to the shaking associated with the preparation of a caf\u00e9 frapp\u00e9.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n=== Greek Freddo preparations ===\n\n==== Freddo Espresso ====\n[[Freddo Espresso]] is a foam-covered iced coffee made from espresso. It is found in every caf\u00e9 and coffee shop in Greece. It is undoubtedly popular among the young people during summer, or on hot days. Because of the very hot summers in Greece, and the need to escape from the heat, people began to make cold variations of the popular coffee styles. It consists of two shots of espresso (30-50 ml), sugar, and ice (60-100 ml) 1:2 ( espresso shots:ice). The espresso is mixed with the sugar in a [[Frapiera|''frapi\u00e8ra'']] (a drink mixer). The [[frapiera]] mixes the coffee with the sugar, producing a foam from the oils of espresso, and lowers the temperature. The coffee is then poured over ice into its serving glass. The melting of the ice cubes dilutes the coffee and results in a desirable level of bitterness and strength.\n\n==== Freddo Cappuccino ====\n[[Freddo Cappuccino]] is another variation of the original cappuccino. It is as popular as the freddo espresso. It follows the same process as the [[freddo espresso]], but at the end foamed and creamed milk is added in ratio 1:2 (espresso shots:milk), and 1:2 ( espresso shots:ice). Recently the Coffee Island coffee shop (a coffee shop franchise in Greece), established a new foam and cream trend in freddo cappuccino. They use plant based milk creamed in the ''[[Frapiera|frapi\u00e8ra]]''. The result is a stiffer and sweeter cream.\n\n=== Other ===\n;Mazagran\n[[Mazagran (coffee beverage)|Mazagran]] (sometimes misspelled as [[Mazagrin]]) is a cold coffee drink that originated in Algeria. It is typically served in a tall glass, and is made with coffee and ice. Sometimes sugar, [[rum]], lemon or water is added. Sometimes a fast version is achieved by pouring a previously sweetened espresso in a cup with ice cubes and a slice of lemon.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n;Palazzo\nA Palazzo is an iced coffee variant, popular in Southern California.

The hot coffee, in melting some of the ice is diluted, re-freezing to a granita-like texture. The addition of a single scoop of ice-cream on top is a popular variant. No milk, sugar, extra flavouring or cream are involved.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n;Shakerato\n[[Shakerato]] is an iced coffee made by shaking [[espresso]] and ice cubes.\n\n==Instant coffee==\n{{main|Instant coffee}}\n[[File:Instant coffee.jpg|thumb|Instant coffee.]]\n[[Instant coffee]] is a drink derived from brewed coffee beans.

It consists of a cup of drip coffee with two creams and two sugars (or double cream, double sugar).  The Double-Double coffee will taste exactly the same in any cup size, from the small 10oz cup to the extra large 24oz cup. The chain achieves flavor consistency across cup sizes by employing a pair of countertop vending machines, one dispensing cream and the other dispensing sugar, with a button for each of the four cup sizes. The name \"double-double\" refers to the number of shots of each added, that is, two shots of cream and two shots of sugar. The terms \"single-single\" or \"regular\" and \"triple-triple\", though not as common as the \"double-double\", refer to coffee with one shot of sugar and cream and coffee with three shots of sugar and cream, respectively. The machines are calibrated regularly to ensure they dispense a perfect shot of cream or sugar to exacting specifications.  The coffee is always poured over the cream and sugar, important to achieve the correct flavor. It is brewed using the pour-over drip brewing method and the coffee maker used is manufactured by [[Bunn-o-Matic Corporation]].\n\n;Indian filter coffee\n[[Indian filter coffee|South Indian Coffee]], also known as ''Mysore Filter Coffee'' or ''Kaapi'' (South Indian phonetic rendering of \"coffee') is a sweet milky coffee made from dark roasted coffee beans (70%\u201380%) and chicory (20%\u201330%), especially popular in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The most commonly used coffee beans are Koffeey Arabica (Coffee Arabica grown from [[Arehalli]] Village) Peaberry (preferred), Arabica, Malabar and Robusta grown in the hills of [[Karnataka]] (Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru), [[Kerala]] (Malabar region) and [[Tamil Nadu]] (Nilgiris District, Yercaud and Kodaikanal).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n;Pocillo\nA shot or small portion of unsweetened coffee, now usually made either using an [[espresso]] machine or a [[moka pot]], but traditionally made using a cloth drip, usually served in cups made for the purpose, called ''\"tazitas de pocillo.\"'' It is widely drunk in Latin America, usually as an afternoon or after-dinner coffee. The defining feature is the size, usually half to a quarter the size of the usual ~{{convert|8|USoz|ml}} coffee cups. There are a number of small-sized drinks that use ''tazitas de pocillo,'' including such sweetened varieties as ''[[caf\u00e9 cubano]]'' and ''[[caf\u00e9 cortado]],'' but these are usually not called a ''pocillo;'' rather, the Spanish diminutive suffix \"-ito\" is usually added to the name of the drink wanted in a ''pocillo'' size cup. For example, a ''pocillo''-sized ''cortado'' is usually called a ''cortadito.''{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Coffee}}\n* [[List of coffee dishes]]\n* [[Coffee substitute]]\n* [[Coffee preparation#Presentation|Coffee preparation and Presentation]]\n* [[Non-dairy creamer]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Coffee by type}}\n\n{{Coffee|nocat=1}}\n{{Lists of beverages}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Coffee Beverages}}\n[[Category:Coffee drinks| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of drinks|Coffee beverages]]\n", "name_user": "2001:4898:80e8:a:89a5:c3bc:1888:d2a0", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(9T1H2d40571o#*d)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coffee_drinks"}

Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away.  Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.  And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirty fold, and sixty fold and a hundredfold.(Mark 4:3-8)<ref name=\"Erickson33\">{{cite book | title=At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision Of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Erickson, K | publisher=William B.

Tapwave announced the system in May 2003 and began shipping in October of that same year. The Zodiac was designed to be a high-performance mobile entertainment system centered on [[video game]]s, [[music]], photos, and [[video]] for 18- to 34-year-old gamers and technology enthusiasts. By running an enhanced version of the Palm Operating System (5.2T), Zodiac also provided access to Palm's personal information management software and many other applications from the Palm developer community. The company was based in [[Mountain View, California]].<ref>[http://www.pcvsconsole.com/news.php?nid=2195 The Tapwave Zodiac Console Now Shipping]</ref>\n\nThe Zodiac console was initially available in two models, Zodiac 1 (32MB) for US$299, and Zodiac 2 (128MB) for US$399. Some of the game titles for the product included ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]'' ([[Activision]]); ''Mototrax'' (Activision); ''[[Spy Hunter]]'' ([[Midway Games|Midway]]); ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'' ([[Electronic Arts|EA]]/MDM); ''[[Doom II]]'' ([[id Software]]); ''[[Golden Axe III]]'' and ''[[Altered Beast]]'' ([[Sega]]); ''[[Warfare Incorporated]]'' ([[Handmark]]); and ''[[Duke Nukem]] Mobile'' ([[3D Realms]]/MachineWorks).\n\nDue to insufficient funding and strong competitive pressure from the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) from [[Sony]] (which was pre-announced at E3 on May 16, 2003 and shipped in North America on March 24, 2005), and the  [[Nintendo DS|DS]] from [[Nintendo]] (released on November 21, 2004), Tapwave sold the company to an undisclosed multibillion-dollar corporation in Asia in July 2005.\n\nThe Zodiac console garnered strong product reviews and received many industry awards including ''[[Popular Science]]''{{'}}s Best of What's New Award, [[Stuff (magazine)|''Stuff'' magazine]]'s Top 10 Gadgets of the Year, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine's Fetish Award, [[CNET]]'s Editor's Choice Award, ''[[PC World]]'{{'}}s 2004 Next Gear Innovations Award; ''[[PC Magazine]]''{{'}}s 1st Place Last Gadget Standing at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]; ''Handheld Computing'' magazine's Most Innovative PDA of 2003; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] Best Gear of 2003; and the ''[[Business Week]]'' Best Products of 2003.\n\n== History of Tapwave ==\n* May 2001: Tapwave was founded by former [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]] executives\n* May 2002: Tapwave closed initial Series-A funding\n* May 2002: Tapwave signed [[Palm OS]] licensing agreement with PalmSource\n* May 2003: Company was formally launched at Palm Developers Conference & [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]]\n* September 2003: Zodiac entertainment console launched at DEMO conference\n* October 2003: Zodiac console began shipping to customers directly from livescribe.com\n* November 2003: Tapwave announced that \u201cover 1200 game developers\u201d had signed up for the Tapwave developer program\n* February 2004: [[PalmGear]] and Tapwave announced partnership to launch an online store to feature the best applications, game titles and ebooks available on the Palm OS platform\n* April 2004: [[Synchronization]] between Zodiac and [[Mac OS X]] desktops enabled by MarkSpace\n* June 2004: Zodiac launched into [[United States]]. retail distribution with CompUSA\n* October 2004: Zodiac launched in [[United Kingdom]] and sold through [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]], [[Dixons (UK)|Dixons]] and [[Currys]].\n* October 2004: Zodiac launched in [[Singapore]] and distributed by ECS\n* November 2004: Zodiac launched in [[South Korea]] and co-branded with Sonokong (OEM)\n* December 2004: Audible announces audio book support for Zodiac\n* December 2004: Tapwave announce [[Wi-Fi]] [[SD card]] for the Zodiac with \u201cenhanced mail application and web browser\u201d.\n* January 2005: Tapwave and [[Virgin Digital]] announced strategic alliance for audio download and subscription services.\n* July 2005: Tapwave discontinued the sale of the Zodiac mobile entertainment console<ref>[http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/7990/tapwave-discontinues-zodiac-business Tapwave Discontinues Zodiac Business]</ref> and sold substantially all of its assets to an [[undisclosed]] multibillion-dollar corporation in Asia and wound down operations.\n\n==Primary features==\n[[File:Tapwave-Zodiac2-Bottom-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The back of the Zodiac]]\n'''Music, images, and video'''\n\nAn [[MP3]] music player is included in the system's applications, and allows the creation of custom playlists using drag-and-dropping of files. MP3 music files can be played from either SD slot, or the internal memory of the device.  MP3 files can also be used as alarms, along with conventional Palm OS alarms.\n\nPhotos ([[JPEG]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] format) could be downloaded to the device using the Palm Desktop software or loaded onto [[SD card]]s, and could be shared and made into a slideshow (with background music) on the device.\n\nThe bundled video player on the device, Kinoma, would only play videos in a proprietary format, converted using the Kinoma Producer software (which supported conversion of MPEG1, MPEG4, QuickTime, AVI and DivX). The software however was limited in its conversion abilities, enticing users to pay for the full version{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. It has been suggested{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} that this difficulty in converting video for the device diminished the Zodiac's success. Several aftermarket [[DivX]] and [[XviD]] players have been developed (such as the [[The Core Pocket Media Player|TCPMP]]), and, at the time of bankruptcy, Tapwave were working on an update to supply [[MPEG-4]] hardware decoding{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\n'''Device design'''\n\nDue to the metal construction of the Zodiac, the device was seen to be more solid than other [[PDA]]s. However, on some models the adhesive on the shoulder buttons failed, and occasionally the screen was scratched by the screen cover when grit entered{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Furthermore, due to the insecure clip holding the stylus, they could be knocked loose and potentially lost. Some alternative cases solved this problem with their own stylus holder.\n\n'''Compatibility'''\n\nThe Zodiac is a [[Palm OS]] 5-compatible device, and most software compatible with Palm OS 5 runs without issue.  In particular, most Palm OS 5-compatible games play on the Zodiac.  Tapwave also provided proprietary APIs to allow developers to take advantage of the Zodiac's graphics and sound hardware. A great deal of [[freeware]] and [[shareware]] games and [[emulators]] are therefore available. For example, there are versions of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic|Hexen]]'', ''[[Hexen II]]'', and ''[[Heretic (computer game)|Heretic]]'' as well as versions of emulators such as [[Unix Amiga Emulator|UAE]], [[ScummVM]], and LJZ/[[Little John Palm|LJP]], a multi-system emulator. There have also been attempts to emulate [[PlayStation]] games onto the Zodiac, the most successful emulator being PPSX.<ref>[http://www.emuboards.com/invision/index.php?showtopic=24315 Now closed]. Emuboards (2013-05-05). Retrieved on 2013-08-23.</ref> It is, however, nowhere near completion and many games are not playable yet.\n\n'''Battery'''\n\nThe device has a total battery life of about 3 hours when using video, backlight+screen and CPU-intensive tasks, and while running as a dedicated audio player it is closer to 6 hours. The original battery was a 1500mAh [[Li-Ion]]; third party replacements with 2000mAh capacity are still available from some manufacturers.\n\n'''Software'''\n\nThe Zodiac used a modified version of the Palm OS, designated version 5.2T. The main navigation menus consisted of 8 radially-arranged choices selected using either the touchscreen or thumbstick. It also came with the Palm OS Productivity Suite (containing a calendar, to do list etc.), an eBook reader, the Wordsmith word processor and the powerOne graphing application. It came bundled with two games, [[AcidSolitare]] (by Red Mercury) and [[Stunt Car Extreme]] (by Vasara Games).\n\n'''Models'''\n\nThe Zodiac console was initially available in two models, Zodiac 1 (32MB), and Zodiac 2 (128MB). The Zodiac 2 was $100 more expensive than the original Zodiac.\n\n==Games==\n\nGames which utilized some or all of the Zodiac's hardware/software are incompatible with standard Palm OS devices. This does exclude platforms outside of Palm OS (e.g., Doom II is also out for PC, but the Zodiac version listed here won't run on standard Palm OS handhelds). This list also excludes standard Palm OS games which are also available for Zodiac handhelds, which were either identical or slightly improved on Zodiac, called \"Zodiac tuned\" (e.g. a game available for standard Palm OS only has the extra features of vibration and shoulder buttons as extra usable buttons when played on Zodiac).\n\nSome of the games were never released due to the discontinuation of the Zodiac in July 2005. However, the testing builds of some of these games were leaked and are playable.\n\n'''Zodiac exclusive titles'''\n* ''Animated Dudes''\n* ''Avalanche''\n* ''Firefly'': Pacman clone\n* ''Gloop Zero'' by AeonFlame: (was shareware, but is now freeware) puzzle game where you direct the flow of liquid slime material to its goal by drawing platform lines and using other tools.\n* ''Orbz'' (was shareware, but is now freeware as of September 2006)\n* ''StarPong''\n* ''Stunt Car Extreme'': 3D, 1st-person or 3rd-person racing game.

Tapwave announced the system in May 2003 and began shipping in October of that same year. The Zodiac was designed to be a high-performance mobile entertainment system centered on [[video game]]s, [[music]], photos, and [[video]] for 18- to 34-year-old gamers and technology enthusiasts. By running an enhanced version of the Palm Operating System (5.2T), Zodiac also provided access to Palm's personal information management software and many other applications from the Palm developer community. The company was based in [[Mountain View, California]].<ref>[http://www.pcvsconsole.com/news.php?nid=2195 The Tapwave Zodiac Console Now Shipping]</ref>\n\nThe Zodiac console was initially available in two models, Zodiac 1 (32MB) for US$299, and Zodiac 2 (128MB) for US$399. Some of the game titles for the product included ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]'' ([[Activision]]); ''Mototrax'' (Activision); ''[[Spy Hunter]]'' ([[Midway Games|Midway]]); ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'' ([[Electronic Arts|EA]]/MDM); ''[[Doom II]]'' ([[id Software]]); ''[[Golden Axe III]]'' and ''[[Altered Beast]]'' ([[Sega]]); ''[[Warfare Incorporated]]'' ([[Handmark]]); and ''[[Duke Nukem]] Mobile'' ([[3D Realms]]/MachineWorks).\n\nDue to insufficient funding and strong competitive pressure from the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) from [[Sony]] (which was pre-announced at E3 on May 16, 2003 and shipped in North America on March 24, 2005), and the  [[Nintendo DS|DS]] from [[Nintendo]] (released on November 21, 2004), Tapwave sold the company to an undisclosed multibillion-dollar corporation in Asia in July 2005.\n\nThe Zodiac console garnered strong product reviews and received many industry awards including ''[[Popular Science]]''{{'}}s Best of What's New Award, [[Stuff (magazine)|''Stuff'' magazine]]'s Top 10 Gadgets of the Year, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine's Fetish Award, [[CNET]]'s Editor's Choice Award, ''[[PC World]]'{{'}}s 2004 Next Gear Innovations Award; ''[[PC Magazine]]''{{'}}s 1st Place Last Gadget Standing at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]; ''Handheld Computing'' magazine's Most Innovative PDA of 2003; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] Best Gear of 2003; and the ''[[Business Week]]'' Best Products of 2003.\n\n== History of Tapwave ==\n* May 2001: Tapwave was founded by former [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]] executives\n* May 2002: Tapwave closed initial Series-A funding\n* May 2002: Tapwave signed [[Palm OS]] licensing agreement with PalmSource\n* May 2003: Company was formally launched at Palm Developers Conference & [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]]\n* September 2003: Zodiac entertainment console launched at DEMO conference\n* October 2003: Zodiac console began shipping to customers directly from livescribe.com\n* November 2003: Tapwave announced that \u201cover 1200 game developers\u201d had signed up for the Tapwave developer program\n* February 2004: [[PalmGear]] and Tapwave announced partnership to launch an online store to feature the best applications, game titles and ebooks available on the Palm OS platform\n* April 2004: [[Synchronization]] between Zodiac and [[Mac OS X]] desktops enabled by MarkSpace\n* June 2004: Zodiac launched into [[United States]]. retail distribution with CompUSA\n* October 2004: Zodiac launched in [[United Kingdom]] and sold through [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]], [[Dixons (UK)|Dixons]] and [[Currys]].\n* October 2004: Zodiac launched in [[Singapore]] and distributed by ECS\n* November 2004: Zodiac launched in [[South Korea]] and co-branded with Sonokong (OEM)\n* December 2004: Audible announces audio book support for Zodiac\n* December 2004: Tapwave announce [[Wi-Fi]] [[SD card]] for the Zodiac with \u201cenhanced mail application and web browser\u201d.\n* January 2005: Tapwave and [[Virgin Digital]] announced strategic alliance for audio download and subscription services.\n* July 2005: Tapwave discontinued the sale of the Zodiac mobile entertainment console<ref>[http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/7990/tapwave-discontinues-zodiac-business Tapwave Discontinues Zodiac Business]</ref> and sold substantially all of its assets to an [[undisclosed]] multibillion-dollar corporation in Asia and wound down operations.\n\n==Primary features==\n[[File:Tapwave-Zodiac2-Bottom-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The back of the Zodiac]]\n'''Music, images, and video'''\n\nAn [[MP3]] music player is included in the system's applications, and allows the creation of custom playlists using drag-and-dropping of files. MP3 music files can be played from either SD slot, or the internal memory of the device.  MP3 files can also be used as alarms, along with conventional Palm OS alarms.\n\nPhotos ([[JPEG]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] format) could be downloaded to the device using the Palm Desktop software or loaded onto [[SD card]]s, and could be shared and made into a slideshow (with background music) on the device.\n\nThe bundled video player on the device, Kinoma, would only play videos in a proprietary format, converted using the Kinoma Producer software (which supported conversion of MPEG1, MPEG4, QuickTime, AVI and DivX). The software however was limited in its conversion abilities, enticing users to pay for the full version{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. It has been suggested{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} that this difficulty in converting video for the device diminished the Zodiac's success. Several aftermarket [[DivX]] and [[XviD]] players have been developed (such as the [[The Core Pocket Media Player|TCPMP]]), and, at the time of bankruptcy, Tapwave were working on an update to supply [[MPEG-4]] hardware decoding{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\n'''Device design'''\n\nDue to the metal construction of the Zodiac, the device was seen to be more solid than other [[PDA]]s. However, on some models the adhesive on the shoulder buttons failed, and occasionally the screen was scratched by the screen cover when grit entered{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Furthermore, due to the insecure clip holding the stylus, they could be knocked loose and potentially lost. Some alternative cases solved this problem with their own stylus holder.\n\n'''Compatibility'''\n\nThe Zodiac is a [[Palm OS]] 5-compatible device, and most software compatible with Palm OS 5 runs without issue.  In particular, most Palm OS 5-compatible games play on the Zodiac.  Tapwave also provided proprietary APIs to allow developers to take advantage of the Zodiac's graphics and sound hardware. A great deal of [[freeware]] and [[shareware]] games and [[emulators]] are therefore available. For example, there are versions of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic|Hexen]]'', ''[[Hexen II]]'', and ''[[Heretic (computer game)|Heretic]]'' as well as versions of emulators such as [[Unix Amiga Emulator|UAE]], [[ScummVM]], and LJZ/[[Little John Palm|LJP]], a multi-system emulator. There have also been attempts to emulate [[PlayStation]] games onto the Zodiac, the most successful emulator being PPSX.<ref>[http://www.emuboards.com/invision/index.php?showtopic=24315 Now closed]. Emuboards (2013-05-05). Retrieved on 2013-08-23.</ref> It is, however, nowhere near completion and many games are not playable yet.\n\n'''Battery'''\n\nThe device has a total battery life of about 3 hours when using video, backlight+screen and CPU-intensive tasks, and while running as a dedicated audio player it is closer to 6 hours. The original battery was a 1500mAh [[Li-Ion]]; third party replacements with 2000mAh capacity are still available from some manufacturers.\n\n'''Software'''\n\nThe Zodiac used a modified version of the Palm OS, designated version 5.2T. The main navigation menus consisted of 8 radially-arranged choices selected using either the touchscreen or thumbstick. It also came with the Palm OS Productivity Suite (containing a calendar, to do list etc.), an eBook reader, the Wordsmith word processor and the powerOne graphing application. It came bundled with two games, [[AcidSolitare]] (by Red Mercury) and [[Stunt Car Extreme]] (by Vasara Games).\n\n'''Models'''\n\nThe Zodiac console was initially available in two models, Zodiac 1 (32MB), and Zodiac 2 (128MB). The Zodiac 2 was $100 more expensive than the original Zodiac.\n\n==Games==\n\nGames which utilized some or all of the Zodiac's hardware/software are incompatible with standard Palm OS devices. This does exclude platforms outside of Palm OS (e.g., Doom II is also out for PC, but the Zodiac version listed here won't run on standard Palm OS handhelds). This list also excludes standard Palm OS games which are also available for Zodiac handhelds, which were either identical or slightly improved on Zodiac, called \"Zodiac tuned\" (e.g. a game available for standard Palm OS only has the extra features of vibration and shoulder buttons as extra usable buttons when played on Zodiac).\n\nSome of the games were never released due to the discontinuation of the Zodiac in July 2005. However, the testing builds of some of these games were leaked and are playable.\n\n'''Zodiac exclusive titles'''\n* ''Animated Dudes''\n* ''Avalanche''\n* ''Firefly'': Pacman clone\n* ''Gloop Zero'' by AeonFlame: (was shareware, but is now freeware) puzzle game where you direct the flow of liquid slime material to its goal by drawing platform lines and using other tools.\n* ''Orbz'' (was shareware, but is now freeware as of September 2006)\n* ''StarPong''\n* ''Stunt Car Extreme'': 3D, 1st-person or 3rd-person racing game.

While new settlements and factions emerged, a group called the Authority declared themselves the new military power. The game's prologue begins in Walker's home, Vineland, a city founded by former Ark residents and their descendants. Vineland gets stormed by the Authority's rebuilt Abadon mutant armies, and Walker's adoptive Aunt Prowley is killed by General Cross. Prowley leaves a pre-recorded holotape asking Walker to carry out Project Dagger, a mission conceived to stop General Cross. Walker is inducted as the last Ranger, a group of Ark survivors whose nanotrite-powered suits give them enhanced combat abilities. They are asked by Prowley's recording to find the three other members of Project Dagger; Loosum Hagar, Marshall, and Dr. Kvasir. Prowley's biological daughter, Lily, provides Walker with the Phoenix, an indestructible vehicle to travel the Wasteland, and promises to rebuild Vineland in the Ranger's absence.\n\nMarshall is found in the town of Gunbarrel. Walker is asked to assist him in restoring power to Gunbarrel before Marshall and retrieving Gulo, a scout sent by Marshall from an hostile enemy clan named the Immortal Shrouded. The scout's last defiant act was to swallow the recorder with the bunker's location, which Walker recovers from her already-carved-out gut. They proceed to the bunker, wiping out both the Immortal Shrouded and the Authority patrol sent to dislodge them, and secures the data necessary to penetrate the Authority's security scans.\n\nLoosum Hagar is the mayor of Wellspring, a major travel hub in the Wasteland. When Walker arrives at her office, the Ranger is forced to fight off an assassination attempt against the mayor, who she suspects Wasteland tycoon Klegg Clayton of masterminding the attack. Klegg tries to kill Walker after admitting he was on a first name basis with General Cross. Fighting through Klegg's henchmen, Walker warns Loosum of the plot against Wellspring and uncovers a Xerxes MK III Authority Predator tank hidden in Klegg's catacombs beneath the town. The Ranger follows Klegg to an Authority bunker, to witness General Cross put down his unsuccessful lackey for failing to deliver Wellspring. Exploring deeper into the facility, Walker finds evidence that the Authority is building massive Abadon mutants piece by piece, calling them \"Titans\" and planning to unleash them on the rest of the Wasteland. Walker tears the fusion core out of a huge, half-build Titan, causing a chain reaction that destroys the facility and simultaneously securing a power source for the Xerxes III Predator tank that is necessary to complete Project Dagger.\n\nDr. Anton Kvasir is a master of genetic manipulation tasked to create a nanotrite virus that would disable General Cross' ability to clone himself indefinitely to prolong his life. The scientist invites Walker into his sanctum, where he says he is held back from finishing his project by insufficient computing power. Walker is asked to land Eco-Pod 15, the last of a series of satellites tasked with re-seeding the Earth with life in the event that the Apophis meteor rendered the planet barren after impact. After entering EDEN Space Center, Kvasir hacks the Vault mainframe to grant Walker the status of [[President of the United States|POTUS]] to ensure they can access every aspect of the EDEN Project. Successful in lowering Eco-Pod 15 back to Earth, Walker slaves its processor to Kvasir's mainframe before being forced to fight off an Authority strike force. Kvasir sends Walker on a mission to retrieve a DNA sample from General Cross. Raiding an Authority base for the sample, Walker frees captives from Vineland whose DNA was used in horrific cloning and mutant experiments. Walker decapitates General Cross after defeating him in battle, though a fresh clone of the General escapes. Back at Kvasir's lab, the doctor uses Cross' severed head to produce the nanotrite virus that was his part of Project Dagger.\n\nWith the three components, Walker initiates the final phase of Project Dagger by infiltrating the Authority HQ. Able to gain entry to the compound by impersonating General Cross, the Ranger is discovered by the real general. General Cross meets Walker while riding a gigantic Cyber Titan, and the two battle. Killing the Titan, Walker stabs Cross in the eye with the Nanotrite Virus, causing his DNA to be corrupted to prevent future clones from being created. However, unbeknownst to Walker due to Kvasir's manipulation, the Ranger's own nanotrites are also susceptible to the virus. Choking to death alongside the broken body of General Cross, Walker is saved by the intervention of Lily, who returns them to Hagar's Wellspring office for medical treatment. With Lily's gun to his head, Dr. Kvasir works frantically to save the Ranger. When he succeeds, the doctor begs for his life from the enraged Lily, who spares him. The game ends with Walker regaining consciousness and thanking Lily for her help, promising to continue helping the Wasteland as the Last Ranger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/rage-2-rage-1-story-1202840312/|title=Bethesda Confirms 'Rage 2' Will Continue 'Rage 1's' Storyline|first=Vikki|last=Blake|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 12, 2018|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n''Rage 2'' is a joint development between [[id Software]] and [[Avalanche Studios]].

Willits added that ''Rage 2'' was designed to be the player's \"power fantasy\", thus they ensured that they will not feel underpowered at the beginning of the game.

The game's prologue begins in Walker's home, Vineland, a city founded by former Ark residents and their descendants. Vineland gets stormed by the Authority's rebuilt Abadon mutant armies, and Walker's adoptive Aunt Prowley is killed by General Cross. Prowley leaves a pre-recorded holotape asking Walker to carry out Project Dagger, a mission conceived to stop General Cross. Walker is inducted as the last Ranger, a group of Ark survivors whose nanotrite-powered suits give them enhanced combat abilities. They are asked by Prowley's recording to find the three other members of Project Dagger; Loosum Hagar, Marshall, and Dr. Kvasir. Prowley's biological daughter, Lily, provides Walker with the Phoenix, an indestructible vehicle to travel the Wasteland, and promises to rebuild Vineland in the Ranger's absence.\n\nMarshall is found in the town of Gunbarrel. Walker is asked to assist him in restoring power to Gunbarrel before Marshall and retrieving Gulo, a scout sent by Marshall from an hostile enemy clan named the Immortal Shrouded. The scout's last defiant act was to swallow the recorder with the bunker's location, which Walker recovers from her already-carved-out gut. They proceed to the bunker, wiping out both the Immortal Shrouded and the Authority patrol sent to dislodge them, and secures the data necessary to penetrate the Authority's security scans.\n\nLoosum Hagar is the mayor of Wellspring, a major travel hub in the Wasteland. When Walker arrives at her office, the Ranger is forced to fight off an assassination attempt against the mayor, who she suspects Wasteland tycoon Klegg Clayton of masterminding the attack. Klegg tries to kill Walker after admitting he was on a first name basis with General Cross. Fighting through Klegg's henchmen, Walker warns Loosum of the plot against Wellspring and uncovers a Xerxes MK III Authority Predator tank hidden in Klegg's catacombs beneath the town. The Ranger follows Klegg to an Authority bunker, to witness General Cross put down his unsuccessful lackey for failing to deliver Wellspring. Exploring deeper into the facility, Walker finds evidence that the Authority is building massive Abadon mutants piece by piece, calling them \"Titans\" and planning to unleash them on the rest of the Wasteland. Walker tears the fusion core out of a huge, half-build Titan, causing a chain reaction that destroys the facility and simultaneously securing a power source for the Xerxes III Predator tank that is necessary to complete Project Dagger.\n\nDr. Anton Kvasir is a master of genetic manipulation tasked to create a nanotrite virus that would disable General Cross' ability to clone himself indefinitely to prolong his life. The scientist invites Walker into his sanctum, where he says he is held back from finishing his project by insufficient computing power. Walker is asked to land Eco-Pod 15, the last of a series of satellites tasked with re-seeding the Earth with life in the event that the Apophis meteor rendered the planet barren after impact. After entering EDEN Space Center, Kvasir hacks the Vault mainframe to grant Walker the status of [[President of the United States|POTUS]] to ensure they can access every aspect of the EDEN Project. Successful in lowering Eco-Pod 15 back to Earth, Walker slaves its processor to Kvasir's mainframe before being forced to fight off an Authority strike force. Kvasir sends Walker on a mission to retrieve a DNA sample from General Cross. Raiding an Authority base for the sample, Walker frees captives from Vineland whose DNA was used in horrific cloning and mutant experiments. Walker decapitates General Cross after defeating him in battle, though a fresh clone of the General escapes. Back at Kvasir's lab, the doctor uses Cross' severed head to produce the nanotrite virus that was his part of Project Dagger.\n\nWith the three components, Walker initiates the final phase of Project Dagger by infiltrating the Authority HQ. Able to gain entry to the compound by impersonating General Cross, the Ranger is discovered by the real general. General Cross meets Walker while riding a gigantic Cyber Titan, and the two battle. Killing the Titan, Walker stabs Cross in the eye with the Nanotrite Virus, causing his DNA to be corrupted to prevent future clones from being created. However, unbeknownst to Walker due to Kvasir's manipulation, the Ranger's own nanotrites are also susceptible to the virus. Choking to death alongside the broken body of General Cross, Walker is saved by the intervention of Lily, who returns them to Hagar's Wellspring office for medical treatment. With Lily's gun to his head, Dr. Kvasir works frantically to save the Ranger. When he succeeds, the doctor begs for his life from the enraged Lily, who spares him. The game ends with Walker regaining consciousness and thanking Lily for her help, promising to continue helping the Wasteland as the Last Ranger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/rage-2-rage-1-story-1202840312/|title=Bethesda Confirms 'Rage 2' Will Continue 'Rage 1's' Storyline|first=Vikki|last=Blake|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 12, 2018|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n''Rage 2'' is a joint development between [[id Software]] and [[Avalanche Studios]].

According to [[Tim Willits]], the team hoped that the sequel could deliver on the promise made by the first game, which was limited by technology during its time of release. Willits added that ''Rage 2'' was designed to be the player's \"power fantasy\", thus they ensured that they will not feel underpowered at the beginning of the game.
