She was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank Buffay and Lily Buffay. Her birth-mother's name was Phoebe Abbott. She has a twin sister named Ursula Buffay, who is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe can speak several languages, including French and Italian. She appeared in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its [[The Pilot (Friends)|premiere]] on September 24, 1994 to its [[The Last One (Friends)|finale]] on May 6, 2004. She is a [[masseuse]] and musician, notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was [[Monica Geller]]'s roommate before [[Rachel Green]], which is how she was introduced to the group. Phoebe is best friends with Monica and Rachel, along with their neighbors, [[Chandler Bing]] and [[Joey Tribbiani]], and also Monica's brother [[Ross Geller]]. She plays a [[Gibson Gospel]] and sings at Central Perk. During the show's [[Friends (season 9)|ninth season]], Phoebe and Joey decide to choose a blind date for each other. Phoebe finds someone for him, but Joey forgets about their deal and doesn't find anyone for her. So a couple of minutes before the date, Joey accidentally finds Mike who agrees to go on a blind date with Phoebe. Mike Hannigan (played by actor [[Paul Rudd]]) and Phoebe begin a romantic relationship. They later get engaged and then marry.\n\nFor her portrayal of Phoebe Buffay, Kudrow received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination and won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], a [[Satellite Award]], and an [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy Award]].\n\n==Role==\nIn the pilot episode, Phoebe is introduced as one of the six original friends, including neighbors [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] ([[Matt LeBlanc]]) and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] ([[Matthew Perry]]), former roommate [[Monica Geller|Monica]] ([[Courteney Cox]]), Rachel Green ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), and Monica's brother, [[Ross Geller|Ross]] ([[David Schwimmer]]). She is a musician at their typical meeting place, [[Central Perk]], where she plays guitar and sings self-written songs. During the first season, she has myriad boyfriends, including Tony,<ref>{{Cite episode |title=[[The One with the East German Laundry Detergent]] |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=[[Friends]] |series-link= |first1=David |last1=Crane |first2=Marta |last2=Kauffman |network=NBC |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number=5|minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> a [[physicist]] named David, played by [[Hank Azaria]],<ref>{{Cite episode |title=[[The One with the Monkey]] |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=[[Friends]] |series-link= |first1=David |last1=Crane |first2=Marta |last2=Kauffman |network=[[NBC]] |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number=10|minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> and a [[psychologist]] named Roger, played by [[Fisher Stevens]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=[[The One with the Boobies]] |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=[[Friends]] |series-link= |first1=David |last1=Crane |first2=Marta |last2=Kauffman |network=NBC |station= |date= |season=1 |series-no= |number=13 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Phoebe's twin sister, Ursula Buffay, a character originally created for and appearing in the American [[sitcom]] ''[[Mad About You]]'' as a waitress, is also introduced in the first season, in \"The One with Two Parts\". Ursula is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe works as a [[Temporary work|temporary]] secretary for Chandler for a brief period of time in \"The One with the Ick Factor\". It is revealed that the woman Phoebe believed was her mother, Lily Buffay, committed suicide when Phoebe was about 14, by means of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].\n\nIn the episode \"The One with Phoebe's Husband\", it is revealed that Phoebe was married to a supposedly gay Canadian [[ice dancer]], Duncan Sullivan, in order to allow him to get a green card, for six years. The two agree to get a [[divorce]] after he comes to the realization that he is, in fact, [[heterosexual]], and wants to marry another woman. In \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\", Phoebe is  temporarily replaced as the primary singer for Central Perk by a professional singer named Stephanie Schiffer, played by singer [[Chrissie Hynde]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=[[The One with the Baby on the Bus]] |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=[[Friends]] |series-link= |first1=David |last1=Crane |first2=Marta |last2=Kauffman |network=[[NBC]] |station= |date= |season=2 |series-no= |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Phoebe's song \"Smelly Cat\" is introduced in the same episode. In \"The One Where Eddie Moves In\" \"Smelly Cat\" is discovered by a record company, and Phoebe stars in a fictional music video for the track, in which her voice is dubbed over by another singer.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=[[The One Where Eddie Moves In]] |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=[[Friends]] |series-link= |first1=David |last1=Crane |first2=Marta |last2=Kauffman |network=NBC |station= |date= |season=2 |series-no= |number=17|minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the facets of Phoebe's character are manifold and extremely complex, Phoebe can generally be classified as kind-hearted, but ditzy and whimsical. Due in no small part to her extremely traumatic childhood, Phoebe has developed a child-like na\u00efvet\u00e9 in an attempt to shield her from the world's evils. In addition to being a [[vegetarian]] and an avid [[Environmentalism|tree hugger]], she also displays a remarkable lack of experience with the \"darker sides\" of life. In \"The One Where Old Yeller Dies\", it is shown that her deceased mother Lily would always turn off films before anything traumatic would happen, including the death of [[Old Yeller]] or [[Bambi]]'s mother being shot. It is also revealed that she was never told the truth about [[Santa Claus]]. This is made all the more prominent as one of the running jokes during the show is Phoebe's seemingly infinite criminal track record. She repeatedly makes reference to her underworld connections and crimes she committed while living on the streets.\n\nPhoebe is shown to have a very strained relationship with her sister Ursula, who she almost never gets in touch with. Despite multiple efforts to get her crass twin sister (who is one minute older than her) to care about family affairs or other things that concern her, Phoebe nearly always goes home empty-handed and none the wiser. When it is revealed Ursula performs in [[porn]] under Phoebe's name, the latter eventually gets her revenge by cashing in Ursula's pay slips.\n\nVery in tune with her emotions and those of others, Phoebe sometimes serves as a rock to her friends. She especially shows a great deal of maternal instinct towards her younger brother Frank, despite the latter's lack of intelligence.\n\nMuch to the dismay of her friends (especially [[Ross Geller|Ross]]), Phoebe dabbles in [[New Age]] ideas and [[superstition]]s throughout the series. She is convinced she can feel the presence of her dead grandmother in her old apartment, she [[The One with the Cat|senses the spirit of her mother in a lost cat]], [[The One with the Tea Leaves|reads tea leaves]], and dismisses [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution as \"too easy\" in \"The One Where Heckles Dies\".\n\nSimilar to the short-lived Monica/Chandler/Richard love triangle, Phoebe had two serious romantic interests that overlapped with each other at one point during the series. David ([[Hank Azaria]]), known as \"The scientist guy\", has a romance with Phoebe in the [[Friends (season 1)|first season of the series]], but breaks her heart when he decides to leave for [[Minsk]] on a three-year research trip. He makes a few more appearances throughout the series, most notably trying to get back together with her and kissing her when they get interrupted by Phoebe's then-boyfriend Mike ([[Paul Rudd]]). Mike had been introduced to Phoebe in [[Friends (season 9)|the ninth season of the show]], when Joey forgot he was supposed to find Phoebe a double date and decided to shout for a random guy called \"Mike\" in the coffee shop instead. After a whirlwind romance, Phoebe and Mike eventually break up and she briefly reunites with David [[The One in Barbados|in Barbados]]. Mike beats David to the punch, however, and proposes to Phoebe before the latter gets a chance. She rejects David as she realized she was in love with Mike. She also rejects Mike, on the basis that she did not need a proposal from him, but an indication that their relationship was progressing. She ends up [[The One with Phoebe's Wedding|marrying Mike]].\n\n==Jokes and sarcasm==\n\n===\"Smelly Cat\"===\nThe show's running gag and one of Phoebe's trademark characteristics is her song \"Smelly Cat,\" which she performs at Central Perk. The song is about a cat who is shunned by society because of its foul stench as a result of [[flatulence]] (\"What are they feeding you?\"). However Phoebe sympathizes with it because she can relate to being an outcast. The verses consist of Phoebe rattling off a list of ways in which the cat is disliked (\"They won't take you to the [[veterinarian|vet]]\", \"you're obviously not their favorite pet\", etc.) while the chorus ends with the uplifting message to anyone who is different or unique that \"it's not your fault\". In the episode, \"The One Where Eddie Moves In,\" Phoebe is discovered by a record producer who wants to make a music video for \"Smelly Cat\". Phoebe is delighted with the end result, somehow missing what her friends spot immediately \u2013 that the voice used in the video belongs to another woman. Phoebe turns down the opportunity, feeling bad for the woman who will not get any recognition for her voice because she does not have the \"right look\" \u2013 declaring that the woman IS, in fact, Smelly Cat. In the episode, \"The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner,\" Phoebe's former singing partner, Leslie, portrayed by [[Elizabeth Daily|E.G. Daily]], wants them to get back together. The partnership fails again when Leslie sells the song \"Smelly Cat\" to a commercial agency against Phoebe's wishes. Phoebe teaches the song to [[Chrissie Hynde]], who releases it in a 1999 album.<ref name=\"Leszczak2015\">{{cite book|author=Bob Leszczak|title=From Small Screen to Vinyl: A Guide to Television Stars Who Made Records, 1950-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpucCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA269|date=25 June 2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-4274-6|page=269}}</ref> On August 26, 2015, Kudrow performed the song as a duet with [[Taylor Swift]] during Swift's concert in Los Angeles as a part of her [[The 1989 World Tour|1989 World Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34074546/taylor-swift-sang-smelly-cat-with-lisa-kudrow-on-stage|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Taylor Swift sang Smelly Cat with Lisa Kudrow on stage|date=2015-08-27|accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n===Age===\nHer age seemed to have differed throughout the series. In \"The One with the Mugging\", it is implied that Phoebe is older than Ross, seeing as she was fourteen when he was 12. This episode made her possibly the oldest in the group. In \"[[The One with the Jellyfish]]\" (Season 4), Phoebe states that she is twenty-nine, placing her birth in approximately 1968. However, in \"The One Where They're Going to Party,\" (Season 4), Ross states he is also 29, which does not work with the previously mentioned two-year age gap. According to \"The One with Frank Jr.\", Phoebe was born on February 16; however, in Season 9 (\"The One with Phoebe's Birthday Dinner\") Phoebe's birthday is sometime in early November, since they could not make the reservations and the dinner had to be moved back to October 31. In \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\" (Season 7), it is revealed that Phoebe was born a year earlier than she thought, believing she was 30 but was truly 31, which further adds to the inconsistency of her age throughout the show's run. Phoebe also tries on at least one occasion to manipulate the other friends into celebrating her birthday again within months of a previous birthday party.\n\n===\"Regina Phalange\"===\nPhoebe occasionally uses the [[alter ego]] Regina Phalange. The first reference to Regina Phalange is during season 5 following Ross saying \"Rachel\" instead of \"Emily\" at his wedding. She pretends to be \"Doctor Phalange\", Ross's brain doctor, claiming that names are interchangeable in his mind. When the friends go to [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], Phoebe introduces herself to the blackjack dealer as Regina Phalange. When Phoebe, Rachel, and Melissa go out to lunch (The One with Rachel's Big Kiss), and Melissa asks if she was in a sorority, she pretends to be a member of \"Thigh Mega Tampon\", a fictional sorority that was allegedly shut down when Regina Phalange died of alcohol poisoning. She also used her fake name to show Chandler and Monica how easily people lie about their names and to help Chandler with his interviewing skills in season 8 episode 4, when Joey says, \"Hi, I'm Ken Adams\" she replies, \"Regina Phalange\". In the season 10 episode \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\", Phoebe attempts to spare Joey from humiliation by introducing herself as \"R\u00e9gine Philange\" and stating that Joey is speaking an obscure regional dialect from her \"hometown\" of \"[[Est\u00e9e Lauder (businesswoman)|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]\". She immediately switches to French and claims that Joey is her younger brother who is \"un peu retard\u00e9\" (a little slow), and requesting that the casting director humor Joey's French-speaking abilities. The last reference is in the series finale when Phoebe successfully stalls Rachel's plane to Paris by saying there is a problem with the \"left phalange\", causing everyone on the plane to evacuate. The passengers are eventually convinced to return to the plane. When a woman skeptically asks an airport employee if \"the phalange\" was fixed, he replies, \"Yes, the phalange is fixed! As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard, just in case!\"\n\n==Production==\nPhoebe's pregnancy during Season 4 was to account for [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s actual pregnancy.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Kathy Griffin]], [[Jane Lynch]], and [[Megan Mullally]] all auditioned for the role of Phoebe. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her recurring role as Ursula, the waitress in ''[[Mad About You]]''.<ref name=\"BrightFT\">{{Cite video |last = Bright |first = Kevin S. |title = Friends: Final Thoughts |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2036371/ | date = November 15, 2005 |publisher = New Wave Entertainment}}</ref><ref name=\"W209\">{{Cite book |last1 = Wild |first1 = David |authorlink1 = David Wild |year = 2004 |title = Friends ...'Til the End |location = London |publisher = Headline |isbn = 0-7553-1321-6 |page = 209|title-link = Friends 'til the end (book) }}</ref> The characters were connected to make them twin sisters.

Phoebe teaches the song to [[Chrissie Hynde]], who releases it in a 1999 album.<ref name=\"Leszczak2015\">{{cite book|author=Bob Leszczak|title=From Small Screen to Vinyl: A Guide to Television Stars Who Made Records, 1950-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpucCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA269|date=25 June 2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-4274-6|page=269}}</ref> On August 26, 2015, Kudrow performed the song as a duet with [[Taylor Swift]] during Swift's concert in Los Angeles as a part of her [[The 1989 World Tour|1989 World Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34074546/taylor-swift-sang-smelly-cat-with-lisa-kudrow-on-stage|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Taylor Swift sang Smelly Cat with Lisa Kudrow on stage|date=2015-08-27|accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n===Age===\nHer age seemed to have differed throughout the series. In \"The One with the Mugging\", it is implied that Phoebe is older than Ross, seeing as she was fourteen when he was 12. This episode made her possibly the oldest in the group. In \"[[The One with the Jellyfish]]\" (Season 4), Phoebe states that she is twenty-nine, placing her birth in approximately 1968. However, in \"The One Where They're Going to Party,\" (Season 4), Ross states he is also 29, which does not work with the previously mentioned two-year age gap. According to \"The One with Frank Jr.\", Phoebe was born on February 16; however, in Season 9 (\"The One with Phoebe's Birthday Dinner\") Phoebe's birthday is sometime in early November, since they could not make the reservations and the dinner had to be moved back to October 31. In \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\" (Season 7), it is revealed that Phoebe was born a year earlier than she thought, believing she was 30 but was truly 31, which further adds to the inconsistency of her age throughout the show's run. Phoebe also tries on at least one occasion to manipulate the other friends into celebrating her birthday again within months of a previous birthday party.\n\n===\"Regina Phalange\"===\nPhoebe occasionally uses the [[alter ego]] Regina Phalange. The first reference to Regina Phalange is during season 5 following Ross saying \"Rachel\" instead of \"Emily\" at his wedding. She pretends to be \"Doctor Phalange\", Ross's brain doctor, claiming that names are interchangeable in his mind. When the friends go to [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], Phoebe introduces herself to the blackjack dealer as Regina Phalange. When Phoebe, Rachel, and Melissa go out to lunch (The One with Rachel's Big Kiss), and Melissa asks if she was in a sorority, she pretends to be a member of \"Thigh Mega Tampon\", a fictional sorority that was allegedly shut down when Regina Phalange died of alcohol poisoning. She also used her fake name to show Chandler and Monica how easily people lie about their names and to help Chandler with his interviewing skills in season 8 episode 4, when Joey says, \"Hi, I'm Ken Adams\" she replies, \"Regina Phalange\". In the season 10 episode \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\", Phoebe attempts to spare Joey from humiliation by introducing herself as \"R\u00e9gine Philange\" and stating that Joey is speaking an obscure regional dialect from her \"hometown\" of \"[[Est\u00e9e Lauder (businesswoman)|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]\". She immediately switches to French and claims that Joey is her younger brother who is \"un peu retard\u00e9\" (a little slow), and requesting that the casting director humor Joey's French-speaking abilities. The last reference is in the series finale when Phoebe successfully stalls Rachel's plane to Paris by saying there is a problem with the \"left phalange\", causing everyone on the plane to evacuate. The passengers are eventually convinced to return to the plane. When a woman skeptically asks an airport employee if \"the phalange\" was fixed, he replies, \"Yes, the phalange is fixed! As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard, just in case!\"\n\n==Production==\nPhoebe's pregnancy during Season 4 was to account for [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s actual pregnancy.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Kathy Griffin]], [[Jane Lynch]], and [[Megan Mullally]] all auditioned for the role of Phoebe. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her recurring role as Ursula, the waitress in ''[[Mad About You]]''.<ref name=\"BrightFT\">{{Cite video |last = Bright |first = Kevin S. |title = Friends: Final Thoughts |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2036371/ | date = November 15, 2005 |publisher = New Wave Entertainment}}</ref><ref name=\"W209\">{{Cite book |last1 = Wild |first1 = David |authorlink1 = David Wild |year = 2004 |title = Friends ...'Til the End |location = London |publisher = Headline |isbn = 0-7553-1321-6 |page = 209|title-link = Friends 'til the end (book) }}</ref> The characters were connected to make them twin sisters.

Important biologics include:\n\n* [[Whole blood]] and other blood components\n* [[organ transplantation|Organs]] and [[tissue transplant]]s\n* [[Stem cell therapy]]\n* [[Antibodies]] for [[passive immunization]] (e.g., to treat a [[virus]] infection)\n* [[Breast milk|Human breast milk]]\n* [[Fecal microbiota transplant|Fecal microbiota]]\n* [[Human fertilization|Human reproductive cells]]\n\nSome biologics that were previously extracted from animals, such as insulin, are now more commonly produced by [[recombinant DNA]].\n\n===Produced by recombinant DNA===\n{{see also|Biologics for immunosuppression}}\n\nAs indicated the term \"biologics\" can be used to refer to a wide range of biological products in medicine. However, in most cases, the term \"biologics\" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:\n# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) \"[[growth hormone]]\" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.\n# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are \"custom-designed\" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.\n# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.\n\nBiologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications. This factor has been particularly relevant since many biological medications are used for the treatment of [[chronic diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of otherwise untreatable cancer during the remainder of life. The cost of treatment with a typical monoclonal antibody therapy for relatively common indications is generally in the range of \u20ac7,000\u201314,000 per patient per year.\n\nOlder patients who receive biologic therapy for diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], or [[ankylosing spondylitis]] are at increased risk for life-threatening infection, adverse cardiovascular events, and [[malignancy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr LD | title = The use of biologic agents in the geriatric population | journal = J Musculoskel Med | volume = 27 | pages = 175\u2013180 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/arthritis/content/article/1145622/1562177}}</ref>\n\nThe first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic \"human\" [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]]. Sometimes referred to as rHI, under the [[trade name]] [[Humulin]], was developed by [[Genentech]], but licensed to [[Eli Lilly and Company]], who manufactured and marketed it starting in 1982.\n\nMajor kinds of biopharmaceuticals include:\n*Blood factors ([[Factor VIII]] and [[Factor IX]])\n*Thrombolytic agents ([[tissue plasminogen activator]])\n*[[Hormones]] ([[insulin]], glucagon, growth hormone, gonadotrophins)\n*Haematopoietic growth factors ([[Erythropoietin]], [[colony stimulating factors]])\n*[[Interferons]] (Interferons-\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b3)\n*[[Interleukin]]-based products (Interleukin-2)\n*[[Vaccines]] ([[Hepatitis B]] surface [[antigen]])\n*[[Monoclonal antibodies]] (Various)\n*Additional products ([[tumour necrosis factor]], therapeutic enzymes)\n\nResearch and development investment in new medicines by the biopharmaceutical industry stood at $65.2 billion in 2008.<ref>{{cite web \n| author=BriskFox Financial\n| title=Biopharmaceutical sector sees rising R&D despite credit crunch, finds analysis  \n| url=http://www.briskfox.com/open/years/2009_q1/do_v_c44751.php\n| access-date=2009-03-11 }}</ref> A few examples of biologics made with [[recombinant DNA]] technology include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, in most cases, the term \"biologics\" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:\n# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) \"[[growth hormone]]\" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.\n# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are \"custom-designed\" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.\n# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.\n\nBiologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications. This factor has been particularly relevant since many biological medications are used for the treatment of [[chronic diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of otherwise untreatable cancer during the remainder of life. The cost of treatment with a typical monoclonal antibody therapy for relatively common indications is generally in the range of \u20ac7,000\u201314,000 per patient per year.\n\nOlder patients who receive biologic therapy for diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], or [[ankylosing spondylitis]] are at increased risk for life-threatening infection, adverse cardiovascular events, and [[malignancy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr LD | title = The use of biologic agents in the geriatric population | journal = J Musculoskel Med | volume = 27 | pages = 175\u2013180 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/arthritis/content/article/1145622/1562177}}</ref>\n\nThe first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic \"human\" [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]].

This had climbed to 15,600 in 1995, and by 2001 there were 34,527 patent applications.<ref name=\"scientific_thomson_2006\">{{cite web | first=Luke |last=Foster| title=Patenting in the Biopharmaceutical Industry&mdash;comparing the US with Europe| url=http://scientific.thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/| access-date=2006-06-23 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060316164416/http://scientific.thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-03-16}}</ref> In 2012 the US had the highest IP (Intellectual Property) generation within the biopharmaceutical industry, generating 37 percent of the total number of granted patents worldwide; however, there is still a large margin for growth and innovation within the industry.

This production is a significant risk for the investor, due to production failure or scrutiny from regulatory bodies based on perceived risks and ethical issues. Biopharmaceutical crops also represent a risk of cross-contamination with non-engineered crops, or crops engineered for non-medical purposes.\n\nOne potential approach to this technology is the creation of a transgenic mammal that can produce the biopharmaceutical in its milk, blood, or urine. Once an animal is produced, typically using the [[Microinjection#Pronuclear injection|pronuclear microinjection]] method, it becomes efficacious to use cloning technology to create additional offspring that carry the favorable modified genome.<ref name=\"pmid11017040\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dove A | title = Milking the genome for profit | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 18 | issue = 10 | pages = 1045\u20138 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11017040 | doi = 10.1038/80231 }}</ref> The first such drug manufactured from the milk of a genetically modified [[goat]] was [[ATryn]], but marketing permission was blocked by the [[European Medicines Agency]] in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web | author=Phillip B.

Approval may require several years of [[clinical trials]], including trials with human volunteers. Even after the drug is released, it will still be monitored for performance and safety risks. The manufacture process must satisfy the FDA's \"Good Manufacturing Practices\", which are typically manufactured in a [[clean room]] environment with strict limits on the amount of airborne particles and other microbial contaminants that may alter the efficacy of the drug.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kingham|first1=Richard|last2=Klasa|first2=Gabriela|last3=Carver|first3=Krista | name-list-format = vanc |title=Key Regulatory Guidelines for the Development of Biologics in the United States and Europe|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|pages=75\u201388|url=https://www.cov.com/-/media/files/corporate/publications/2013/10/chapter4_key_regulatory_guidlines_for_the_development_of_biologics_in_the_united_states_and_europe.pdf|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], biologics (as well as radiopharmaceuticals) are reviewed through the Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate within [[Health Canada]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/branches-agencies/health-products-food-branch/biologics-genetic-therapies-directorate.html|title=Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Antibody-drug conjugate]]\n* [[Genetic engineering]]\n* [[Host cell protein]]\n* [[List of pharmaceutical companies]]\n* [[List of recombinant proteins]]\n* [[Nanobiopharmaceutics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MeshName|Biological+Products}}\n* {{cite web | url = http://bio.org/speeches/pubs/er/BiotechGuide.pdf | title = Guide to Biotechnology | access-date = 2007-12-17 | author = Debbie Strickland | year = 2007 | publisher = Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222631/http://bio.org/speeches/pubs/er/BiotechGuide.pdf | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | url-status = dead }}\n* {{cite web | url =  http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/biotech/genbio062001.pdf | title = Report for USA Specialty Pharmaceuticals: Generic Biologics: The Next Frontier | access-date = 2007-12-17 |author1=Timothy B.

They provide original songs and harmonies, strung together by comic banter.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Live shows===\nTripod emerged from the thriving Melbourne live music pub scene of the mid nineties, supporting popular local cover bands in such places as the Station Hotel, [[Esplanade Hotel (Melbourne)|The Esplanade]], the Central Club, the New Orleans Tavern and the Ritz, St Kilda. They were very much a cover band at first, performing three part harmony versions on hits by the likes of [[Elvis Costello]], [[David Bowie|Bowie]], [[the Beach Boys]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Prior to this they did their time as buskers in Melbourne malls with a far-fetched prop act of which no record exists. They garnered a local following via regular residencies at the Commercial Hotel, Yarraville, just after it stopped being a biker bar.\n\nThey soon became regulars at the Prince Patrick Hotel in [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], a Melbourne comedy venue, where they honed their skills in residencies and appearances from 1998 through to its demise in 2003.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/28/1043534054339.htm ''The Age'' newspaper],</ref>\n\nTripod are stalwarts of their home festival, the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]], where they often performed since 1997, when they took their pub act and jammed it into a one-hour festival format at [[St Martins Youth Arts Centre]], in a show entitled ''Welcome to My Wonderwall''. They have appeared on music festival stages including the [[Falls Festival]], the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]], the [[Queenscliff Music Festival]] and the [[Woodford Folk Festival]].\n\nTripod have appeared internationally, including the Montreal [[Just for Laughs|Just For Laughs]] festival and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre|Upright Citizens Brigade]] theatre in New York and Los Angeles. They have played the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]] numerous times.\n\nThey have also toured the Australian rural countryside including long stints with the MICF Roadshow.\n\nTripod alternate the form of their shows between the song-and-sketch cabaret gig format (such as ''Self Saucing'' and ''Men of Substance'') and narrative musicals. Their first \"story\" show was ''Tripod Tells the Tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (not very well)'', which premiered at the MICF before touring nationally.\n\nTheir narrative show, ''Lady Robots'', was first previewed at the 2002 Adelaide Fringe Festival before it was performed at the [[MICF]] later that year. The show was a musical comedy telling the story of three men who are hurled into space where they come across a planet populated only by Lady Robots. Tripod performed a re-jigged version of the show, ''Lady Robots v1.1'' at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Theatre]] at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2005, before a national tour culminating in a hit season at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. No recordings are known to exist.\n\nOn 30 January 2010, Tripod held the world premiere of their comedic musical ''Tripod versus the Dragon'' at the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] in North Adams, Massachusetts, United States. [[Elana Stone]] co-starred in the production in the role of \"The Dungeon Master\"/\"Dragon\" after [[Megan Washington]], who had been co-writing songs for the production, declined the role due to scheduling conflicts. The production is based on the [[Dungeons and Dragons]] [[role-playing game]].<ref>[http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 MASS MoCA Event page for Tripod versus the Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719030702/http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 |date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> Tripod went on to perform this show at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the Sydney Opera House, and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2010, as well as subsequent seasons in Perth, Brisbane, regional Victoria and the Przeglad Piosenki Aktorskiej festival in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Wroclaw]], Poland.\n\nIn January 2013, Tripod joined forces with Australian performer [[Eddie Perfect]] to create ''Perfect Tripod'', a show of classic Australian songs arranged in four-part harmony, inspired by their cover of ''Meet Me in the Middle of the Air'' performed on ''[[The Sideshow]]'' on 13 October 2007. Perfect Tripod toured concert halls throughout the nation and have collaborated with such Australian pop music greats as [[Gotye]] and [[Missy Higgins]].\n\nIn October 2014, Tripod performed live at the international gaming convention, [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX (Penny Arcade Expo)]], in Melbourne at the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. There they performed a short preview of ''This Gaming Life'', an original collaboration between Tripod, Grammy nominated composer [[Austin Wintory]] and the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nIn 2015 ''This Gaming Life'' played to rapturous houses at [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]], Victorian Arts Centre, with a 55 piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Wintory. The show was a full scale two-act orchestral love letter to the culture and relationships of passionate video gamers, and has been described as the \"Stand By Me of the gamer generation.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===TV===\nThe band got their first break appearing on ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"[[Red Faces]]\" contest, where they performed a parodic medley of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] hits that demonstrated similarities between the songs.<ref>[http://everguide.com.au/entertainment/comedy/interview/seven-unusual-things-happening-to-tripod.aspx Seven Unusual Things Happening to Tripod], \"Everguide.com\", 5 April 2013</ref>\n\nTheir first regular TV appearances were on ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' (IMT) with [[Frankie J.

In it they had one hour to write and arrange a coherent song based on incoherent listener suggestions and then perform said song to an eager national audience.

They recorded a live album of the show in April 2006 entitled ''[[Songs from Self Saucing]]'', recorded and mixed by regular collaborator Nao Anzai, which was nominated for Best Comedy Release at the 2007 [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] awards.\n\nTripod's first DVD was also released in 2006: a live recording of their 2005 show \"[[Pod August Night|POD August Nights]]\". The DVD includes numerous special features including a music video for their song \"Gonna Make You Happy Tonight\" from their 2004 album, ''Middleborough Rd''. Tripod's 2001 show, \"''Tripod tells the tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (Not Very Well)''\" was also released on DVD in 2006, following the original 2001 VHS release.\n\nTripod released a Christmas album in 2010, an album of original material from their much loved Xmas shows, entitled ''For the Love of God'', and toured nationally with the songs, performing in the Sydney Opera House that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smartartists.com.au/media/tripod_bio_2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124182726/http://www.smartartists.com.au/media/tripod_bio_2009.pdf |archivedate=24 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Tripod released a DVD of a live performance at the [[Woodford Folk Festival]].

They provide original songs and harmonies, strung together by comic banter.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Live shows===\nTripod emerged from the thriving Melbourne live music pub scene of the mid nineties, supporting popular local cover bands in such places as the Station Hotel, [[Esplanade Hotel (Melbourne)|The Esplanade]], the Central Club, the New Orleans Tavern and the Ritz, St Kilda. They were very much a cover band at first, performing three part harmony versions on hits by the likes of [[Elvis Costello]], [[David Bowie|Bowie]], [[the Beach Boys]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Prior to this they did their time as buskers in Melbourne malls with a far-fetched prop act of which no record exists. They garnered a local following via regular residencies at the Commercial Hotel, Yarraville, just after it stopped being a biker bar.\n\nThey soon became regulars at the Prince Patrick Hotel in [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], a Melbourne comedy venue, where they honed their skills in residencies and appearances from 1998 through to its demise in 2003.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/28/1043534054339.htm ''The Age'' newspaper],</ref>\n\nTripod are stalwarts of their home festival, the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]], where they often performed since 1997, when they took their pub act and jammed it into a one-hour festival format at [[St Martins Youth Arts Centre]], in a show entitled ''Welcome to My Wonderwall''. They have appeared on music festival stages including the [[Falls Festival]], the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]], the [[Queenscliff Music Festival]] and the [[Woodford Folk Festival]].\n\nTripod have appeared internationally, including the Montreal [[Just for Laughs|Just For Laughs]] festival and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre|Upright Citizens Brigade]] theatre in New York and Los Angeles. They have played the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]] numerous times.\n\nThey have also toured the Australian rural countryside including long stints with the MICF Roadshow.\n\nTripod alternate the form of their shows between the song-and-sketch cabaret gig format (such as ''Self Saucing'' and ''Men of Substance'') and narrative musicals. Their first \"story\" show was ''Tripod Tells the Tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (not very well)'', which premiered at the MICF before touring nationally.\n\nTheir narrative show, ''Lady Robots'', was first previewed at the 2002 Adelaide Fringe Festival before it was performed at the [[MICF]] later that year. The show was a musical comedy telling the story of three men who are hurled into space where they come across a planet populated only by Lady Robots. Tripod performed a re-jigged version of the show, ''Lady Robots v1.1'' at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Theatre]] at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2005, before a national tour culminating in a hit season at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. No recordings are known to exist.\n\nOn 30 January 2010, Tripod held the world premiere of their comedic musical ''Tripod versus the Dragon'' at the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] in North Adams, Massachusetts, United States. [[Elana Stone]] co-starred in the production in the role of \"The Dungeon Master\"/\"Dragon\" after [[Megan Washington]], who had been co-writing songs for the production, declined the role due to scheduling conflicts. The production is based on the [[Dungeons and Dragons]] [[role-playing game]].<ref>[http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 MASS MoCA Event page for Tripod versus the Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719030702/http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 |date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> Tripod went on to perform this show at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the Sydney Opera House, and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2010, as well as subsequent seasons in Perth, Brisbane, regional Victoria and the Przeglad Piosenki Aktorskiej festival in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Wroclaw]], Poland.\n\nIn January 2013, Tripod joined forces with Australian performer [[Eddie Perfect]] to create ''Perfect Tripod'', a show of classic Australian songs arranged in four-part harmony, inspired by their cover of ''Meet Me in the Middle of the Air'' performed on ''[[The Sideshow]]'' on 13 October 2007. Perfect Tripod toured concert halls throughout the nation and have collaborated with such Australian pop music greats as [[Gotye]] and [[Missy Higgins]].\n\nIn October 2014, Tripod performed live at the international gaming convention, [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX (Penny Arcade Expo)]], in Melbourne at the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. There they performed a short preview of ''This Gaming Life'', an original collaboration between Tripod, Grammy nominated composer [[Austin Wintory]] and the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nIn 2015 ''This Gaming Life'' played to rapturous houses at [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]], Victorian Arts Centre, with a 55 piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Wintory.
