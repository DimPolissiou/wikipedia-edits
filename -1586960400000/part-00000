While his regiment was stationed in Britain on training exercises, Beadles was a [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] boy. In 1915, his unit took part in the [[landing at Suvla Bay]] in [[Gallipoli]] where, despite still being under the minimum age, he served on the frontline as a rifleman.

After training as a manager in one of the company's pubs and hotels, he was handed control of ''The Shakespeare'' pub in White Chapel and later the ''Cattle Market Inn'' in Stanley.

Having become an avid Liverpool supporter, still attending games well into old age,<ref name=\"Liverpoolbiog\"/> after his time at the club, Beadles became well known for his final bar calls at the pub, declaring '' \"Time gentlemen please, and Evertonian's\"''.<ref name=\"Dundalkprofile\"/>\n\nHe impressed the brewery's managers so much that he was put in charge of the company's main hotel, ''The Hillside'' in [[Huyton]],<ref name=\"grave\"/> [[Liverpool]] in 1939 and the pub later became popular with American officers who were stationed at nearby [[RAF Burtonwood]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In the late 1940s, his health declined and he was unable to continue running such a large hotel and, after running a smaller pub, he was forced into early retirement in the 1950s.

He escaped from prison several times. During one of these escapes he allegedly became a [[cannibal]], murdering his companions one by one.

Retrieved 2008-11-02.</ref> He continued to commit various petty offences whilst in the penal colony in Van Diemen's Land, from which he soon escaped. The 18 May 1822 edition of the ''[[Hobart Town Gazette]]'' reported this escape and advertised a \u00a310 reward for his recapture. When caught, he was charged with absconding and forging an order, a serious crime. For this he received a second sentence of transportation, this time to the new secondary penal establishment at [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station|Sarah Island]] in [[Macquarie Harbour]].\n\n==Escape and cannibalism==\n\n[[Image:Copy of the death sentence pronounced on Alexander Pearce - 1824.jpg|thumb|110px|left|Copy of the death sentence pronounced on Alexander Pearce]]\n\nOn 20 September 1822, Pearce along with seven other convicts of [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station]]: Alexander Dalton, Thomas Bodenham, William Kennerly, Matthew Travers, Edward Brown, Robert Greenhill and John Mather escaped while working on the eastern side of the harbour. Greenhill, who had the axe, appointed himself leader, supported by his friend Travers, with whom he had been sent to Macquarie Harbour for stealing businessman [[Anthony Fenn Kemp]]'s [[schooner]] in an attempt to escape. About 15 days into the journey, the men were starving and [[Sortition|drew lots]] to see who would be killed for food.<ref name=\"theage\"/> Thomas Bodenham (or perhaps Alexander Dalton: see below) drew the short straw and Greenhill despatched him with an axe. At this point three of the company \u2013 Dalton, Kennerly and Brown \u2013 took fright and decamped. Kennerly and Brown reached Macquarie Harbour, but Dalton seemed to have died of [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]]. That left Greenhill, Travers, John Mather and Alexander Pearce. With Greenhill and Travers acting as a team, it would be Mather's or Pearce's turn next. Pearce seems to have sided with Greenhill and Travers at this point, and Mather was the next victim. It was then that Pearce had some luck: Travers was bitten on the foot by a snake. Greenhill insisted they carry him for five days, but when it became clear he would not recover, killed him.<ref name=\"sprod\">Sprod, Dan, ''Alexander Pearce of Macquarie Harbour'', Cat & Fiddle Press, Hobart 1977</ref>\n\nAfter that, it was a [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse game]]. Greenhill had the axe, but they were both starving, and they had to sleep. In the end it was Pearce who prevailed. He grabbed the axe, killed Greenhill and dined on his body. He later raided an Aboriginal campsite and stole more food. When he saw sheep, he knew he had reached the settled districts. He was lucky again, as the shepherd who came upon him eating a lamb was an old friend. Pearce was inducted into a sheep-stealing ring, and was eventually picked up with William Davis and Ralph Churton, who were both hanged for bushranging and escaping from a military escort.\n\nIn total, Pearce had been on the run for 113 days, a little less than half of which was spent in the wilderness. Locked up in Hobart, Pearce made a confession to the Rev. [[Robert Knopwood]], the magistrate and chaplain. However, Knopwood did not believe the cannibalism story and was convinced the others were still living as [[bushranger]]s. He sent Pearce back to Macquarie Harbour.<ref name=\"theage\"/>\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Pearce's story. He made three confessions \u2013 the Knopwood confession; a confession to Lt. Cuthbertson, Commandant of Macquarie Harbour when he was in hospital after the second escape (in this version, Dalton is the first victim); and a confession to Father Phillip Connolly, the colony's Catholic priest, the night before his execution \u2013 and some of the details differed. What is incontrovertible is that eight men went into the bush at Macquarie Harbour, and only three came out; and of the four men alive when Dalton, Kennerly and Brown decamped, only one survived.\n\nWithin a year, Pearce escaped a second time, joined by a young convict named Thomas Cox. Pearce was captured within ten days and taken to the [[Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land]] in Hobart, where he was tried and convicted of murdering and cannibalising Thomas Cox. Observers noted Pearce did not look like a cannibal. He was only {{convert|1.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height, which was under average for that time, but had a strong wiry frame. He did not seem to be someone who was \"laden with the weight of human blood, and believed to have banqueted on human flesh\" as the ''Hobart Town Gazette'' wrote on 25 June 1824. His captors had found parts of Cox's body in Pearce's pockets, even though he still had food left, and his guilt was beyond doubt this time. Pearce confessed he had killed Cox because when they reached [[King River (Tasmania)|King's River]], he discovered that Cox could not swim. Pearce was the first felon to be executed by the new Supreme Court and the first confessed cannibal to pass through the Tasmanian court system.<ref name=\"sprod\"/>\n\nAlexander Pearce was hanged at the [[Hobart Town Gaol]] at 9am on 19 July 1824, after receiving the last rites from Father Connolly.<ref>The ''Hobart Town Gazette'', Friday 23 July 1824.</ref> It is reported that just before he was hanged, Pearce said, \"Man\u2019s flesh is delicious. It tastes far better than fish or pork.\"<ref>[http://www.australianhistory.org/other-bushrangers.php Alexander Pierce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209021729/http://australianhistory.org/other-bushrangers.php |date=9 December 2010 }}.

He escaped from prison several times. During one of these escapes he allegedly became a [[cannibal]], murdering his companions one by one. In another escape, with one companion, he allegedly killed him and ate him in pieces. He was eventually captured and was hanged and dissected in [[Hobart]] for murder.<ref name=theage>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/28/1035683357802.html |title=A journey through hell's gate |publisher=[[The Age]]|date=29 October 2002 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nPearce was born in [[County Monaghan]], Ireland.<ref>Convict Indent, CON13/1/2 p19, Tasmanian Archives</ref> A [[Roman Catholic]] farm labourer, he was sentenced at [[Armagh]] in 1819 to [[penal transportation]] to [[Van Diemen's Land]] for \"the theft of six pairs of shoes\".<ref>[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=349 The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027222859/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=349 |date=27 October 2008 }} Anne-Marie Marquess, culturenorthernireland.org. Retrieved 2008-11-02.</ref> He continued to commit various petty offences whilst in the penal colony in Van Diemen's Land, from which he soon escaped. The 18 May 1822 edition of the ''[[Hobart Town Gazette]]'' reported this escape and advertised a \u00a310 reward for his recapture. When caught, he was charged with absconding and forging an order, a serious crime. For this he received a second sentence of transportation, this time to the new secondary penal establishment at [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station|Sarah Island]] in [[Macquarie Harbour]].\n\n==Escape and cannibalism==\n\n[[Image:Copy of the death sentence pronounced on Alexander Pearce - 1824.jpg|thumb|110px|left|Copy of the death sentence pronounced on Alexander Pearce]]\n\nOn 20 September 1822, Pearce along with seven other convicts of [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station]]: Alexander Dalton, Thomas Bodenham, William Kennerly, Matthew Travers, Edward Brown, Robert Greenhill and John Mather escaped while working on the eastern side of the harbour. Greenhill, who had the axe, appointed himself leader, supported by his friend Travers, with whom he had been sent to Macquarie Harbour for stealing businessman [[Anthony Fenn Kemp]]'s [[schooner]] in an attempt to escape. About 15 days into the journey, the men were starving and [[Sortition|drew lots]] to see who would be killed for food.<ref name=\"theage\"/> Thomas Bodenham (or perhaps Alexander Dalton: see below) drew the short straw and Greenhill despatched him with an axe. At this point three of the company \u2013 Dalton, Kennerly and Brown \u2013 took fright and decamped. Kennerly and Brown reached Macquarie Harbour, but Dalton seemed to have died of [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]], and Kennerly and Brown reportedly died soon after. That left Greenhill, Travers, John Mather and Alexander Pearce. With Greenhill and Travers acting as a team, it would be Mather's or Pearce's turn next. Pearce seems to have sided with Greenhill and Travers at this point, and Mather was the next victim. It was then that Pearce had some luck: Travers was bitten on the foot by a snake. Greenhill insisted they carry him for five days, but when it became clear he would not recover, killed him.<ref name=\"sprod\">Sprod, Dan, ''Alexander Pearce of Macquarie Harbour'', Cat & Fiddle Press, Hobart 1977</ref>\n\nAfter that, it was a [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse game]]. Greenhill had the axe, but they were both starving, and they had to sleep. In the end it was Pearce who prevailed. He grabbed the axe, killed Greenhill and dined on his body. He later raided an Aboriginal campsite and stole more food. When he saw sheep, he knew he had reached the settled districts. He was lucky again, as the shepherd who came upon him eating a lamb was an old friend. Pearce was inducted into a sheep-stealing ring, and was eventually picked up with William Davis and Ralph Churton, who were both hanged for bushranging and escaping from a military escort.\n\nIn total, Pearce had been on the run for 113 days, a little less than half of which was spent in the wilderness. Locked up in Hobart, Pearce made a confession to the Rev. [[Robert Knopwood]], the magistrate and chaplain. However, Knopwood did not believe the cannibalism story and was convinced the others were still living as [[bushranger]]s. He sent Pearce back to Macquarie Harbour.<ref name=\"theage\"/>\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Pearce's story. He made three confessions \u2013 the Knopwood confession; a confession to Lt. Cuthbertson, Commandant of Macquarie Harbour when he was in hospital after the second escape (in this version, Dalton is the first victim); and a confession to Father Phillip Connolly, the colony's Catholic priest, the night before his execution \u2013 and some of the details differed. What is incontrovertible is that eight men went into the bush at Macquarie Harbour, and only three came out; and of the four men alive when Dalton, Kennerly and Brown decamped, only one survived.\n\nWithin a year, Pearce escaped a second time, joined by a young convict named Thomas Cox. Pearce was captured within ten days and taken to the [[Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land]] in Hobart, where he was tried and convicted of murdering and cannibalising Thomas Cox. Observers noted Pearce did not look like a cannibal. He was only {{convert|1.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height, which was under average for that time, but had a strong wiry frame. He did not seem to be someone who was \"laden with the weight of human blood, and believed to have banqueted on human flesh\" as the ''Hobart Town Gazette'' wrote on 25 June 1824. His captors had found parts of Cox's body in Pearce's pockets, even though he still had food left, and his guilt was beyond doubt this time. Pearce confessed he had killed Cox because when they reached [[King River (Tasmania)|King's River]], he discovered that Cox could not swim. Pearce was the first felon to be executed by the new Supreme Court and the first confessed cannibal to pass through the Tasmanian court system.<ref name=\"sprod\"/>\n\nAlexander Pearce was hanged at the [[Hobart Town Gaol]] at 9am on 19 July 1824, after receiving the last rites from Father Connolly.<ref>The ''Hobart Town Gazette'', Friday 23 July 1824.</ref> It is reported that just before he was hanged, Pearce said, \"Man\u2019s flesh is delicious.

{"title_page": "Relative pronoun", "text_new": " A relative  pronoun is a word that is the word or the word who whom whs witch that In some linguistic theories, a '''relative pronoun''' is a term for a word that marks a type of subordinate clause - often called a [[relative clause]],  [[adjective clause]] or [[defining clause]], among other names - as a means to conjoin modifying information about an antecedent [[referent]] in the main clause of a sentence. \n\nAn example is the word ''that'' in the sentence \"This is the house that Jack built.\" Here the relative pronoun ''that'' conjoins the relative clause \"Jack built,\" which modifies the noun ''house'' in the main sentence. ''That'' has an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric relationship]] to its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] \"house\" in the main clause.\n\nIn the English language, the following are the most common relative pronouns: which, that, whose, whoever, whomever, who and whom.\n\nIn conjoining a subordinate clause and a main clause, a relative pronoun functions as a subordinating [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]. According to some [[dependency grammar]] theories, a relative pronoun does not simply mark the subordinate (relative) clause but also may be considered to play the role of a noun within that clause. For example, in the relative clause \"that Jack built\" given above, the pronoun \"that\" may be construed to syntactically  function as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb \"built.\" Compare this with \"Jack built the house after he married,\" where the conjunction ''after'' marks the subordinate clause ''after he married'', but does not play the role of any noun within that clause.  \n\nIn a relative clause, a relative pronoun takes the number (singular or plural) and the person (first, second or third) of its antecedent. \n\nFor more information on the formation and uses of relative clauses\u2014with and without relative pronouns\u2014see [[Relative clause]]. For detailed information about relative clauses and relative pronouns in English, see [[English relative clause]].\n\n==Antecedents==\nThe element in the main clause that the relative pronoun in the relative clause stands for (''house'' in the above example) is the [[Antecedent (grammar)|''antecedent'']] of that pronoun. In most cases the antecedent is a nominal (noun or noun phrase), though the pronoun can also refer to a whole [[proposition]], as in \"The train was late, which annoyed me greatly\", where the antecedent of the relative pronoun ''which'' is the clause \"The train was late\" (the thing that annoyed me was the fact of the train's being late). \n\nIn a [[free relative clause]], a relative pronoun has no antecedent: the relative clause itself plays the role of the co-referring element in the main clause. For example, in \"I like what you did\", ''what'' is a relative pronoun, but without an antecedent. The clause ''what you did'' itself plays the role of a nominal (the object of ''like'') in the main clause. A relative pronoun used this way is sometimes called a '''fused relative pronoun''', since the antecedent appears fused into the pronoun (''what'' in this example can be regarded as a fusion of ''that which'').\n\n==Absence==\nNot all relative clauses contain relative pronouns. Some languages, such as [[Mandarin Chinese]],  do not have relative pronouns at all, and form relative clauses (or their equivalents) [[Relative_clause#Mandarin|by different methods]]. English can also make relative clauses without relative pronouns in some cases. For example, in \"The man you saw yesterday was my uncle\", the relative clause ''you saw yesterday'' contains no relative pronoun. It can be said to have a gap, or [[zero (linguistics)|zero]], in the position of the object of the verb ''saw''.\n\n==Role==\nOther arguments can be relativised using relative pronouns:\n;Subject: ''Hunter is the boy who helped Jessica.''\n;Indirect object: ''Hunter is the boy to whom Jessica gave a gift.''/''Hunter is the boy whom Jessica gave a gift to.''\n;Prepositional complement: ''Jack built the house in which I now live.'' (Similarly with prepositions and prepositional phrases in general, for example, ''These are the walls between which Jack ran.'')\n;Possessor: ''Jack is the boy whose friend built my house.''\n\n==Variant forms==\nIn some languages with [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and noun [[declension]]s\u2014such as [[German language|German]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and [[Latin]]\u2014the relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and number, while its [[Grammatical case|case]] indicates its relationship with the verb in the relative or main clause.{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 1999 | pp = 36\u201337}} In some other languages, the relative pronoun is an invariable word.\n\nWords used as relative pronouns often originally had other functions. For example, the English ''which'' is also an [[interrogative word]]. This suggests that relative pronouns might be a fairly late development in many languages.{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 1999 | pp = 16\u201319}} Some languages, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], have no relative pronouns.\n\nIn English, different pronouns are sometimes used if the antecedent is a human being, as opposed to a non-human or an inanimate object (as in ''who'' vs. ''that''). \n:(1)  ''This is a bank.  This bank accepted my identification.''\n:(2)  ''She is a bank teller.  She helped us open an account.''\n\nWith the relative pronouns, sentences (1) and (2) would read like this:\n\n:(3)  ''This is the bank that accepted my identification.''\n:(4)  ''She is the bank teller who helped us open an account.''\n\nIn sentences (3) and (4), the words ''that'' and ''who'' are the relative pronouns.  The word ''that'' is used because the bank is a thing; the word ''who'' is used because the teller is a person.

The [[Gibson ES-175|ES-175]] was introduced in 1949. Gibson hired [[Ted McCarty]] in 1948, who became President in 1950. He led an expansion of the guitar line with new guitars such as the \"Les Paul\" guitar introduced in 1952, endorsed by [[Les Paul]], a popular musician in the 1950s. The guitar was offered in Custom, Standard, Special, and Junior models.<ref>{{harvnb|Hembree|2007|p=74&mdash;85}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Thinline series was produced, which included a line of thinner guitars like the [[Gibson Byrdland|Byrdland]]. The first Byrdlands were slim, custom built, L-5 models for guitarists Billy Byrd and [[Hank Garland]]. Later, a shorter neck was added. Other models such as the ES-350T and the [[Gibson ES-225|ES-225T]] were introduced as less costly alternatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Duchossoir|1998|p=55&mdash;62}}</ref> In 1958, Gibson introduced the [[ES-335]]T model. Similar in size to the hollow-body Thinlines, the ES-335 family had a solid center, giving the string tone a longer sustain.\n\nIn the 1950s, Gibson also produced the [[Tune-o-matic]] bridge system and its version of the [[humbucking]] pickup, the [[PAF (pickup)|PAF]] (\"Patent Applied For\"), first released in 1957 and still sought after for its sound.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn 1958, Gibson produced two new designs: the eccentrically shaped [[Gibson Explorer|Explorer]] and [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]]. These \"modernistic\" guitars did not sell initially. It was only in the late 1960s and early 70s when the two guitars were reintroduced to the market that they sold  well. The [[Gibson Firebird|Firebird]], in the early 60s, was a reprise of the modernistic idea, though less extreme.\n\n===Modernization===\nIn the late 50s, McCarty knew that Gibson was seen as a traditional company and began an effort to create more modern guitars. In 1961 the body design of the Les Paul was changed due to the demand for a double-cutaway body design.<ref>{{harvnb|Hembree|2007|p=110}}</ref> The new body design then became known as the [[Gibson SG|SG]] (for \"solid guitar\"), due to disapproval from Les Paul himself. The original Les Paul design returned to the Gibson catalog in 1968.\n\nOn December 22, 1969, Gibson parent company Chicago Musical Instruments was taken over by the South American brewing conglomerate ECL. Gibson remained under the control of CMI until 1974 when it became a subsidiary of Norlin Musical Instruments. Norlin Musical Instruments was a member of Norlin Industries which was named for ECL president '''Nor'''ton Stevens and CMI president Arnold Ber'''lin'''.

In 2014, Gibson acquired the Woox consumer electronics brand from Royal Philips. In October 2017, Gibson announced plans to relocate its Memphis operations to a smaller location and plans to sell the Memphis property. Gibson opened its Memphis facility 18 years before, which occupies just a portion of a massive 127,620 square foot complex. According to the ''[[Memphis Daily News]]'', Gibson plans to search for a new facility for its Memphis operations and will stay in the current spot for the next 18 to 24 months. The facility, which sits across from the [[FedExForum]] along South B.B. King Boulevard, is expected to list for $17 million.\n\nSince its opening, the Gibson Memphis shop has mostly focused on building hollow and semi-hollowbody guitars, such as the famed ES series. Presumably, this shuffling of assets is meant to address Gibson's well-publicized financial troubles.\n\nGibson issued a press release about the move, with former CEO Henry Juszkiewicz stating:\n:\"We are extremely excited about this next phase of growth that we believe will benefit both our employees, and the Memphis community. I remember when our property had abandoned buildings, and Beale Street was in decline. It is with great pride that I can see the development of this area with a basketball arena, hotels, and a resurgent pride in the musical heritage of the great city of Memphis.

The [[Gibson ES-175|ES-175]] was introduced in 1949. Gibson hired [[Ted McCarty]] in 1948, who became President in 1950. He led an expansion of the guitar line with new guitars such as the \"Les Paul\" guitar introduced in 1952, endorsed by [[Les Paul]], a popular musician in the 1950s. The guitar was offered in Custom, Standard, Special, and Junior models.<ref>{{harvnb|Hembree|2007|p=74&mdash;85}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Thinline series was produced, which included a line of thinner guitars like the [[Gibson Byrdland|Byrdland]]. The first Byrdlands were slim, custom built, L-5 models for guitarists Billy Byrd and [[Hank Garland]]. Later, a shorter neck was added. Other models such as the ES-350T and the [[Gibson ES-225|ES-225T]] were introduced as less costly alternatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Duchossoir|1998|p=55&mdash;62}}</ref> In 1958, Gibson introduced the [[ES-335]]T model. Similar in size to the hollow-body Thinlines, the ES-335 family had a solid center, giving the string tone a longer sustain.\n\nIn the 1950s, Gibson also produced the [[Tune-o-matic]] bridge system and its version of the [[humbucking]] pickup, the [[PAF (pickup)|PAF]] (\"Patent Applied For\"), first released in 1957 and still sought after for its sound.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn 1958, Gibson produced two new designs: the eccentrically shaped [[Gibson Explorer|Explorer]] and [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]]. These \"modernistic\" guitars did not sell initially. It was only in the late 1960s and early 70s when the two guitars were reintroduced to the market that they sold  well. The [[Gibson Firebird|Firebird]], in the early 60s, was a reprise of the modernistic idea, though less extreme.\n\n===Modernization===\nIn the late 50s, McCarty knew that Gibson was seen as a traditional company and began an effort to create more modern guitars. In 1961 the body design of the Les Paul was changed due to the demand for a double-cutaway body design.<ref>{{harvnb|Hembree|2007|p=110}}</ref> The new body design then became known as the [[Gibson SG|SG]] (for \"solid guitar\"), due to disapproval from Les Paul himself. The original Les Paul design returned to the Gibson catalog in 1968.\n\nOn December 22, 1969, Gibson parent company Chicago Musical Instruments was taken over by the South American brewing conglomerate ECL. Gibson remained under the control of CMI until 1974 when it became a subsidiary of Norlin Musical Instruments. Norlin Musical Instruments was a member of Norlin Industries which was named for ECL president '''Nor'''ton Stevens and CMI president Arnold Ber'''lin'''. This began an era characterized by corporate mismanagement and decreasing product quality.\n\n<div style=\"clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:0ex;\">\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=horizontal\n| image1=Gibson2000 (508x345).jpg |width1=159|caption1=Gibson left [[Kalamazoo]] in 1984, their previous factory became [[Heritage Guitars]]\n| image2=Gibsonshowcase.jpg |width2=81 |caption2=Gibson Showcase at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]\n| image3=Gibson Guitar Factory, Memphis.jpg\n| width3=72 |caption3=Gibson Factory at [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]\n}}</div>\nBetween 1976 and 1984, production of Gibson guitars was shifted from Kalamazoo to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

In 2014, Gibson acquired the Woox consumer electronics brand from Royal Philips. In October 2017, Gibson announced plans to relocate its Memphis operations to a smaller location and plans to sell the Memphis property. Gibson opened its Memphis facility 18 years before, which occupies just a portion of a massive 127,620 square foot complex. According to the ''[[Memphis Daily News]]'', Gibson plans to search for a new facility for its Memphis operations and will stay in the current spot for the next 18 to 24 months. The facility, which sits across from the [[FedExForum]] along South B.B. King Boulevard, is expected to list for $17 million.\n\nSince its opening, the Gibson Memphis shop has mostly focused on building hollow and semi-hollowbody guitars, such as the famed ES series. Presumably, this shuffling of assets is meant to address Gibson's well-publicized financial troubles.\n\nGibson issued a press release about the move, with former CEO Henry Juszkiewicz stating:\n:\"We are extremely excited about this next phase of growth that we believe will benefit both our employees, and the Memphis community. I remember when our property had abandoned buildings, and Beale Street was in decline. It is with great pride that I can see the development of this area with a basketball arena, hotels, and a resurgent pride in the musical heritage of the great city of Memphis. We continue to love the Memphis community and hope to be a key contributor to its future when we move nearby to a more appropriate location for our manufacturing based business, allowing the world the benefit of our great American craftsmen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014304/https://reverb.com/news/gibson-set-to-sell-memphis-guitar-factory|title=Gibson Set to Sell Memphis Guitar Factory - Reverb News|date=7 November 2017|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Bankruptcy===\nOn May 1, 2018, the company filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection.

The group is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century and fully established as a religion. For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called '''Nusayris''' ({{lang-ar|\u0646\u0635\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012byah''), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era.

There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which are also inhabited by [[Sunni]]s, [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]], and [[Ismailis]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevis]] of Turkey.\n\nAlawites identify as a separate ethnoreligious group. The [[Quran]] is only one of their holy books and texts, and their interpretation thereof has very little in common with the [[Shia]] Muslim interpretation but in accordance with the early [[Batiniyya]] and other Muslim ''[[ghulat]]'' sects. Alawite theology and rituals break from mainstream Shia Islam in several remarkable ways.

Arabic accounts of their beliefs tend to be partisan (either positively or negatively).<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:68>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.68</ref> However, since the early 2000s, [[Western world|Western]] scholarship on the Alawite religion has made significant advances.<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:67>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.67</ref> At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God. These aspects, or [[Emanationism|emanations]], appear cyclically in human form throughout history.\n\nThe establishment of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] marked a turning point in Alawi history. It gave the French the power to recruit Syrian civilians into their armed forces for an indefinite period and created exclusive areas for minorities, including an [[Alawite State]]. The Alawite State was later dismantled, but the Alawites continued to be a significant part of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. Since [[Hafez al-Assad]] took power through the 1970 [[Corrective Movement (Syria)|Corrective Movement]], the government has been dominated by a political elite led by the Alawite [[Al-Assad family]]. During the [[Islamist uprising in Syria]] in the 1970s and 1980s, the establishment came under pressure. Even greater pressure has resulted from the [[Syrian Civil War]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn older sources, Alawis are often called \"Ansaris\". According to [[Samuel Lyde]], who lived among the Alawites during the mid-19th century, this was a term they used among themselves. Other sources indicate that \"Ansari\" is simply a Western error in the transliteration of \"Nusayri\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnDP09R4s_0C&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97|title=Initiates and The People Part 2, May 1929 to June 1930 |first= R.

The term is frequently employed as [[hate speech]] by Sunni fundamentalists fighting against [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s government in the [[Syrian civil war]], who use its emphasis on Ibn Nusayr in order to insinuate that Alawi beliefs are \"man-made\" and not divinely inspired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/zahran-alloush/|title=Zahran Alloush: His Ideology and Beliefs|last=Landis|first=Joshua|date=15 December 2013|publisher=Syria Comment|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nRecent research has shown that the Alawi appellation was used by the sect's adherents since the 11th century.  The following quote from Alkan (2012) illustrates this point: <blockquote>\"In actual fact, the name 'Alaw\u012b' appears as early as in an 11th century Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b tract (\u2026). Moreover, the term  'Alaw\u012b' was already used at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 the Belgian-born Jesuit and Orientalist Henri Lammens (d. 1937) visited a certain \u1e24aydar\u012b-Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b sheikh Abdullah in a village near Antakya and mentions that the latter preferred the name 'Alaw\u012b' for his people. Lastly, it is interesting to note that in the above-mentioned petitions of 1892 and 1909 the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs called themselves the 'Arab Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfArab \u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi) 'our \u02bfAlaw\u012b Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b people' (\u1e6d\u0101\u02beifatun\u0101 al-Nu\u1e63ayriyya al-\u02bfAlawiyya) or 'signed with Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi im\u017c\u0101s\u0131yla). This early self-designation is, in my opinion, of triple importance. Firstly, it shows that the word 'Alaw\u012b' was always used by these people, as \u02bfAlaw\u012b authors emphasize; secondly, it hints at the reformation of the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs, launched by some of their sheikhs in the 19th century and their attempt to be accepted as part of Islam; and thirdly, it challenges the claims that the change of the identity and name from 'Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b' to '\u02bfAlaw\u012b' took place around 1920, in the beginning of the French mandate in Syria (1919\u20131938).\"<ref>See, Alkan, N.

According to Friedman and other scholars, the Alawi movement started as many other mystical ghulat sects with an explicit concentration on an allegorical and esoteric meaning of the Quran and other mystical practices, and not as a pure syncretic sect, though later they embraced some other practices as they believed all religions had the same ''Batin'' core.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://goaloflife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-nuc59fayrc4ab-_alawc4abs-_-an-introduction-to-the-religion-history-and-identity-of-the-leading-minority-in-syria-islamic-history-and-civilization.pdf|title=Friedman, ''The Nusayris-Alawis, An introduction to the religion, history and identity'': p.223\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Robert F. Worth]] argues that the idea that the Alawi religion as a branch of Islam is a rewriting of history made necessary by the French colonialists abandonment of the Alawi and departure from Syria. Worth describes the \"first ... authentic source for outsiders about the religion\" (written by Soleyman of Adana \u2013 a 19th-century Alawi convert to Christianity who broke his oath of secrecy on the religion) explaining that the Alawi (according to Soleyman) deified Ali, venerated Christ, Muhammad, [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], and [[Aristotle]], and held themselves apart from Muslims and Christians, whom they considered heretics.<ref name=RFWRfO2016:82>[[#RFWRfO2016|Worth, ''A Rage for Order'', 2016]]: p.82</ref>\n\nIn 1936, six Alawi notables fearing persecution of their religion, petitioned the French colonialists not to merge their Alawi enclave with the rest of Syria, insisting that \"the spirit of hatred and fanaticism embedded in the hearts of the Arab Muslims against everything that is non-Muslim has been perpetually nurtured by the Islamic religion\".<ref name=RFWRfO2016:85>[[#RFWRfO2016|Worth, ''A Rage for Order'', 2016]]: p.85</ref> According to Worth, later fatwas declaring Alawi to be part of the Shia community were by Shia clerics \"eager for Syrian Patronage\" from Syria's Alawi president [[Hafez al-Assad]] who was eager for Islamic legitimacy in the face of the hostility of Syria's Muslim majority.<ref name=RFWRfO2016:85 />\n\nYaron Friedman does not suggest that Alawi did not consider themselves Muslims but does state that,<blockquote>The modern period has witnessed tremendous changes in the definition of the \u02bfAlaw\u012bs and the attitude towards them in the Muslim world. ... In order to end their long isolation, the name of the sect was changed in the 1920s from Nus\u1ea1yriyya to \u02bfAlawiyya'. By taking this step, leaders of the sect expressed not only their link to Sh\u012b\u02bfism, but to Islam in general.<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:235>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: 235</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Peter Theo Curtis]], the Alawi religion underwent a process of \"Sunnification\" during the years under Hafez Al Assad's rule, so that Alawites became not Shia, but effectively Sunni. Public manifestation or \"even mentioning of any Alawite religious activities\" was banned, as was any Alawite religious organizations or \"any formation of a unified religious council\" or a higher Alawite religious authority. \"Sunni-style\" mosques were built in every Alawite village, and Alawi were encouraged to perform [[Hajj]].<ref name=Padnos>{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/95722/syria-damascus-bashar-basil-al-assad-sunni-alawi|title=Peter Theo Curtis's Writing on The Twisted, Terrifying Last Days of Assad\u2019s Syria|first=Peter Theo|last=Curtis|date=4 October 2011|via=The New Republic}}</ref>\n{{further|topic=Nusayriyyah Doctrine|Al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb\u012b|Ibn Nusayr|Schools of Islamic theology#'Alawism}}\n\n== Opinions on position within Islam ==\nThe Sunni [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] issued a ''fatwa'' recognizing them as part of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] in the interest of [[Arab nationalism]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Talhamy | first1 = Y. | title = The Fatwas and the Nusayri/Alawis of Syria | doi = 10.1080/00263200902940251 | journal = Middle Eastern Studies | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 175\u2013194 | year = 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bar-AsherKootstra2002\">{{cite book|author1=Me'ir Mikha'el Bar-Asher|author2=Gauke de Kootstra|author3=Arieh Kofsky|title=The Nu\u1e63ayr\u2212i-\u02bbalaw\u2212i Religion: An Enquiry into Its Theology and Liturgy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bli4DyuHRIC&pg=RA1-PA153|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-12552-0|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Athari]] Sunni scholars such as the Syrian historian [[Ibn Kathir]] have categorised Alawites as [[kuffar]] ([[infidel]]s) and [[mushrikeen]] ([[polytheist]]s), in their writings;<ref name=\"GlobSec\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17085226|title=Syria crisis: Deadly shooting at Damascus funeral|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=\"abdullah\">Abd-Allah, Umar F., ''Islamic Struggle in Syria'', Berkeley : Mizan Press, c1983, pp. 43\u201348</ref> with [[Ibn Taymiyya]] arguably being the most virulent anti-Alawite in his fatwas<ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Pipes|title=Greater Syria|date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536304-3|page=163|quote=\"the Nusayris are more infidel than Jews or Christians, even more infidel than many polytheists.

The term ''Nusayr\u012b'', previously used in theological texts, has been revived in recent studies. In [[\u00c7ukurova]], Alawites are known as ''[[Fellah]]'' and ''Arabu\u015fa\u011f\u0131'' (although the latter is considered offensive) by the Sunni population. A quasi-official name used during the 1930s by Turkish authorities was ''Eti T\u00fcrkleri'' (\"Hittite Turks\"), to conceal their [[Arabs in Turkey|Arabic]] origins. Although this term is obsolete, it is still used by some older people as a [[euphemism]].\n\nThe exact number of Alawites in Turkey is unknown; there were 700,000 in 1970,<ref>{{Cite book | title=State and rural society in medieval Islam: sultans, muqta\u02bbs, and fallahun | year=1997 | publisher=E.J. Brill | location=Leiden | isbn=90-04-10649-9 | page=162}}</ref> suggesting about 1,500,000 in 2009. As [[Muslim]]s, they are not recorded separately from Sunnis. In the [[Demographics of Turkey#1965 census|1965 census]] (the last Turkish census where informants were asked their [[First language|mother tongue]]), 700,000 people in the three provinces declared their mother tongue as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; however, Arabic-speaking Sunnis and Christians were also included in this figure. Turkish Alawites traditionally speak the same dialect of [[Levantine Arabic]] as Syrian Alawites. Arabic is preserved in rural communities and in Samanda\u011f. Younger people in the cities of \u00c7ukurova and [[\u0130skenderun]] tend to speak Turkish. The Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] and [[vocabulary]]. Knowledge of the [[Arabic alphabet]] is confined to religious leaders and men who have worked or studied in [[Arab world|Arab countries]].\n\nAlawites demonstrate considerable [[social mobility]]. Until the 1960s, they were bound to Sunni ''aghas'' (landholders) around Antakya and were poor. Alawites are prominent in the sectors of transportation and commerce and a large, professional middle class has emerged. Male [[exogamy]] has increased, particularly by those who attend universities or live in other parts of Turkey. These marriages are tolerated; however, female exogamy (as in other [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] groups) is discouraged.\n\nAlawites, like Alevis, have strong [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political beliefs. However, some people in rural areas (usually members of notable Alawite families) may support secular, conservative parties such as the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, current)|Democratic Party]]. Most Alawites feel oppressed by the policies of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]] in Turkey (''Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'').<ref>''Fellahlar'\u0131n Sosyolojisi'', Dr. Cahit Aslan, Adana, 2005</ref><ref>''Arap Alevili\u011fi: Nusayrilik'', \u00d6mer Ulu\u00e7ay, Adana, 1999</ref>\n\n=== Lebanon ===\n\nThere are an estimated 40,000<ref name=\"repost1\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Zoi Constantine |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/pressures-in-syria-affect-alawites-in-lebanon |title=Pressures in Syria affect Alawites in Lebanon \u2013 The National |work=The National|location=Abu Dhabi |accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref> Alawites in Lebanon, where they have lived since at least the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2005/Apr-30/4206-lebanese-allawites-welcome-syrias-withdrawal-as-necessary.ashx#axzz2njhPbwW1|title=Lebanese Allawites welcome Syria's withdrawal as 'necessary'|date=30 April 2005|newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> They are one of the 18 official Lebanese sects; due to the efforts of their leader, [[Ali Eid]], the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1989 gave them two reserved seats in Parliament.

These aspects, or [[Emanationism|emanations]], appear cyclically in human form throughout history.\n\nThe establishment of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] marked a turning point in Alawi history. It gave the French the power to recruit Syrian civilians into their armed forces for an indefinite period and created exclusive areas for minorities, including an [[Alawite State]]. The Alawite State was later dismantled, but the Alawites continued to be a significant part of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. Since [[Hafez al-Assad]] took power through the 1970 [[Corrective Movement (Syria)|Corrective Movement]], the government has been dominated by a political elite led by the Alawite [[Al-Assad family]]. During the [[Islamist uprising in Syria]] in the 1970s and 1980s, the establishment came under pressure. Even greater pressure has resulted from the [[Syrian Civil War]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn older sources, Alawis are often called \"Ansaris\". According to [[Samuel Lyde]], who lived among the Alawites during the mid-19th century, this was a term they used among themselves. Other sources indicate that \"Ansari\" is simply a Western error in the transliteration of \"Nusayri\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnDP09R4s_0C&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97|title=Initiates and The People Part 2, May 1929 to June 1930 |first= R.

The following quote from Alkan (2012) illustrates this point: <blockquote>\"In actual fact, the name 'Alaw\u012b' appears as early as in an 11th century Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b tract (\u2026). Moreover, the term  'Alaw\u012b' was already used at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 the Belgian-born Jesuit and Orientalist Henri Lammens (d. 1937) visited a certain \u1e24aydar\u012b-Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b sheikh Abdullah in a village near Antakya and mentions that the latter preferred the name 'Alaw\u012b' for his people. Lastly, it is interesting to note that in the above-mentioned petitions of 1892 and 1909 the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs called themselves the 'Arab Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfArab \u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi) 'our \u02bfAlaw\u012b Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b people' (\u1e6d\u0101\u02beifatun\u0101 al-Nu\u1e63ayriyya al-\u02bfAlawiyya) or 'signed with Alaw\u012b people' (\u02bfAlev\u012b \u1e6d\u0101\u02beifesi im\u017c\u0101s\u0131yla). This early self-designation is, in my opinion, of triple importance. Firstly, it shows that the word 'Alaw\u012b' was always used by these people, as \u02bfAlaw\u012b authors emphasize; secondly, it hints at the reformation of the Nu\u1e63ayr\u012bs, launched by some of their sheikhs in the 19th century and their attempt to be accepted as part of Islam; and thirdly, it challenges the claims that the change of the identity and name from 'Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b' to '\u02bfAlaw\u012b' took place around 1920, in the beginning of the French mandate in Syria (1919\u20131938).\"<ref>See, Alkan, N.

According to Friedman and other scholars, the Alawi movement started as many other mystical ghulat sects with an explicit concentration on an allegorical and esoteric meaning of the Quran and other mystical practices, and not as a pure syncretic sect, though later they embraced some other practices as they believed all religions had the same ''Batin'' core.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://goaloflife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-nuc59fayrc4ab-_alawc4abs-_-an-introduction-to-the-religion-history-and-identity-of-the-leading-minority-in-syria-islamic-history-and-civilization.pdf|title=Friedman, ''The Nusayris-Alawis, An introduction to the religion, history and identity'': p.223\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Robert F. Worth]] argues that the idea that the Alawi religion as a branch of Islam is a rewriting of history made necessary by the French colonialists abandonment of the Alawi and departure from Syria.

In [[\u00c7ukurova]], Alawites are known as ''[[Fellah]]'' and ''Arabu\u015fa\u011f\u0131'' (although the latter is considered offensive) by the Sunni population. A quasi-official name used during the 1930s by Turkish authorities was ''Eti T\u00fcrkleri'' (\"Hittite Turks\"), to conceal their [[Arabs in Turkey|Arabic]] origins. Although this term is obsolete, it is still used by some older people as a [[euphemism]].\n\nThe exact number of Alawites in Turkey is unknown; there were 700,000 in 1970,<ref>{{Cite book | title=State and rural society in medieval Islam: sultans, muqta\u02bbs, and fallahun | year=1997 | publisher=E.J.

In the [[Demographics of Turkey#1965 census|1965 census]] (the last Turkish census where informants were asked their [[First language|mother tongue]]), 700,000 people in the three provinces declared their mother tongue as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; however, Arabic-speaking Sunnis and Christians were also included in this figure. Turkish Alawites traditionally speak the same dialect of [[Levantine Arabic]] as Syrian Alawites. Arabic is preserved in rural communities and in Samanda\u011f. Younger people in the cities of \u00c7ukurova and [[\u0130skenderun]] tend to speak Turkish. The Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] and [[vocabulary]]. Knowledge of the [[Arabic alphabet]] is confined to religious leaders and men who have worked or studied in [[Arab world|Arab countries]].\n\nAlawites demonstrate considerable [[social mobility]]. Until the 1960s, they were bound to Sunni ''aghas'' (landholders) around Antakya and were poor. Alawites are prominent in the sectors of transportation and commerce and a large, professional middle class has emerged. Male [[exogamy]] has increased, particularly by those who attend universities or live in other parts of Turkey. These marriages are tolerated; however, female exogamy (as in other [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] groups) is discouraged.\n\nAlawites, like Alevis, have strong [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political beliefs. However, some people in rural areas (usually members of notable Alawite families) may support secular, conservative parties such as the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, current)|Democratic Party]].
