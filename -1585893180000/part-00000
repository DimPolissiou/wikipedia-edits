The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor.

In 2014, all episodes of the show that were originally produced and aired in standard definition before both the season 21 premiere and the show's initial conversion to HD capability simultaneously in 2010 and/or already airing in rerun syndication for almost over a decade or more (and still are) got stretched vertically downward with slightly re-edited graphics due to widescreen and HD broadcast capability and signals on more broadcast television stations (and cable) networks, ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary, Tom Bergeron's 15th and final year as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribiero's entrance as the current host in season 26 that also included an almost-brand-new set, new version of the theme song, new graphics, and new logo among other things; while the funny video clips recorded with the use of camcorders before 2009 or the years preceding the invention of today's mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad (and especially the videos that were aired on episodes in the Bob Saget, John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and the early Tom Bergeron eras of ''AFV'') continued (and still continue in the Alfonso Ribiero run of ''AFV'') to be stretched horizontally to this day.

Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of ''AFHV'' led to a spinoff called ''[[America's Funniest People]],'' hosted by Saget's ''Full House'' co-star [[Dave Coulier]] (and co-hosted by actress/producer [[Arleen Sorkin]] for the first two seasons, then model [[Tawny Kitaen]] for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people ''intentionally'' trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title='Video' host rewinds pal's format|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> During the show's first four seasons, ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' aired on Sunday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120321/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=John Carmody|title=The TV Column|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 1989|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by ''America's Funniest People'' at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC153DF932A25756C0A965958260|author=Bill Carter|title=Coming Next: New ABC Prime Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1993}}</ref> Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \"Keep those cameras safely rolling\" and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

While Fugelsang has not been seen in new recent never-before-seen footage on the road or in the studio on ''AFV'' since leaving the show in May 1999 after only two years co-hosting it together, Fuentes made a few brief cameo appearances in interview segments likely taking place at her house speaking on behalf of her and Fugelsang (and AFV; especially during their tenure) on the \"AFV: America...

The show moved to a much smaller [[soundstage]] and the set featured various video screens and monitors (resembling iMac computers) placed on shelves. A special sports version of the show called ''AFV: The Sports Edition,'' that was hosted by [[ESPN]] anchor [[Stuart Scott]], was rebroadcast every [[New Year's Day]] and aired occasionally before [[NBA playoff]] games with a post 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time tip-off until 2008. A special entitled ''America's Funniest Home Videos: Deluxe Uncensored'' (which was released only on home video and featured somewhat more risque content than that allowed on the television broadcasts) was hosted by [[Steve Carell]] and taped on the set used from the 1998\u201399 season.

Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12-14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\"/>\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Josh |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=McClellan, Steve|title=MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=October 3, 1994|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003-2015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor. The videos deemed the funniest by the screeners then go on to the show's producers and then is turned over to Di Bona and another producer for final approval.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120124/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Susan Bickelhaupt, Globe Staff|title='Funniest Home Videos' Outstrips '60 Minutes'|agency=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=February 28, 1990|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Home video material that involves staged accidents, or/and adults, children, or babies getting seriously injured or the abuse of animals, or overall does not meet ABC network [[standards and practices]] are generally not accepted and will not appear on the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title=Saget aims to clip hurtful video bits|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=April 27, 1990|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Every week, the producers choose three videos that the studio audience will vote on.

In 2014, all episodes of the show that were originally produced and aired in standard definition before both the season 21 premiere and the show's initial conversion to HD capability simultaneously in 2010 and/or already airing in rerun syndication for almost over a decade or more (and still are) got stretched vertically downward with slightly re-edited graphics due to widescreen and HD broadcast capability and signals on more broadcast television stations (and cable) networks, ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary, Tom Bergeron's 15th and final year as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribiero's entrance as the current host in season 26 that also included an almost-brand-new set, new version of the theme song, new graphics, and new logo among other things; while the funny video clips recorded with the use of camcorders before 2009 or the years preceding the invention of today's mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad (and especially the videos that were aired on episodes in the Bob Saget, John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and the early Tom Bergeron eras of ''AFV'') continued (and still continue in the Alfonso Ribiero run of ''AFV'') to be stretched horizontally to this day.

The success of ''AFHV'' led to a spinoff called ''[[America's Funniest People]],'' hosted by Saget's ''Full House'' co-star [[Dave Coulier]] (and co-hosted by actress/producer [[Arleen Sorkin]] for the first two seasons, then model [[Tawny Kitaen]] for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people ''intentionally'' trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title='Video' host rewinds pal's format|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> During the show's first four seasons, ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' aired on Sunday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120321/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=John Carmody|title=The TV Column|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 1989|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by ''America's Funniest People'' at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC153DF932A25756C0A965958260|author=Bill Carter|title=Coming Next: New ABC Prime Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1993}}</ref> Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \"Keep those cameras safely rolling\" and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12-14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\"/>\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Josh |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=McClellan, Steve|title=MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=October 3, 1994|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form.

For example, ''[[Triphyophyllum]]'' is a passive flypaper that secretes mucilage, but whose leaves do not grow or move in response to prey capture. Meanwhile, [[sundew]]s are active flypaper traps whose leaves undergo rapid [[acid growth]], which is an expansion of individual cells as opposed to [[cell division]]. The rapid acid growth allows the sundew [[tentacle]]s to bend, aiding in the retention and [[digestion]] of prey.<ref name=\"Williams 2002\">Williams, S. E. 2002.

Tokyo, Japan. pp. 77-81.</ref>\n\n===Pitfall traps===\n{{Main|Pitcher plant}}\nCharacterized by an internal chamber, pitfall traps are thought to have evolved independently at least six times.<ref name=\"Givnish2015\" /> This particular adaptation is found within the families [[Sarraceniaceae]] ''[[Darlingtonia californica|(Darlingtonia]], [[Heliamphora]], [[Sarracenia]]''),  [[Nepenthes|Nepenthaceae]] (''[[Nepenthes]]''), [[Cephalotaceae|Cephalotaceae (''Cephalotus'')]], and [[Eriocaulaceae]] (''[[Paepalanthus]]).'' Within the family [[Bromeliaceae]]'','' pitcher morphology and carnivory evolved twice ''([[Brocchinia]]'' and ''[[Catopsis]]).''<ref name=\"Givnish2015\" /> Because these families do not share a common ancestor who also had pitfall trap morphology, carnivorous pitchers are an example of [[convergent evolution]].\n\nA passive trap, pitfall traps attract prey with nectar bribes secreted by the [[peristome]] and bright flower-like [[anthocyanin]] patterning within the pitcher. The linings of most pitcher plants are covered in a loose coating of [[wax]]y flakes which are slippery for insects, causing them to fall into the pitcher. Once within the pitcher structure, digestive enzymes or mutualistic species break down the prey into an absorbable form for the plant.<ref name=\"Pavlovic\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Carnivorous pitcher plants: Insights in an old topic|last = Mithofer|first = A|date = 2011|journal = Phytochemistry |volume=72 |issue = 13|pages=1678\u20131682 |doi = 10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.11.024|pmid = 21185041|access-date = }}</ref> Water can become trapped within the pitcher, making a habitat for other flora and fauna. This type of 'water body' is called a [[Phytotelma]].\n\nThe simplest pitcher plants are probably those of ''[[Heliamphora]]'', the marsh [[pitcher plant]]. In this [[genus]], the traps are clearly derived from a simple rolled leaf whose margins have sealed together. These plants live in areas of high rainfall in South America such as [[Mount Roraima]] and consequently have a problem ensuring their pitchers do not overflow. To counteract this problem, [[natural selection]] has favoured the evolution of an overflow similar to that of a bathroom [[sink]]\u2014a small gap in the zipped-up leaf margins allows excess water to flow out of the pitcher.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n''Heliamphora'' is a member of the [[Sarraceniaceae]], a [[New World]] family in the order [[Ericales]] ([[Calluna|heathers]] and allies). ''Heliamphora'' is limited to South America, but the family contains two other genera, ''[[Sarracenia]]'' and ''[[Darlingtonia (plant)|Darlingtonia]]'', which are endemic to the [[Southeastern United States]] (with the exception of one species) and [[California]] respectively. ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]'' subsp. ''purpurea'' (the northern pitcher plant) can be found as far north as [[Canada]]. ''Sarracenia'' is the pitcher plant genus most commonly encountered in cultivation, because it is relatively hardy and easy to grow.\n\n[[File:Darlingtonia californica ne8.JPG|thumb|220px|left|''[[Darlingtonia californica]]'': note the small entrance to the trap underneath the swollen \"balloon\" and the colourless patches that confuse prey trapped inside.]]\n\nIn the genus ''Sarracenia'', the problem of pitcher overflow is solved by an [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]], which is essentially a flared leaflet that covers the opening of the rolled-leaf tube and protects it from rain. Possibly because of this improved waterproofing, ''Sarracenia'' species secrete enzymes such as [[protease]]s and [[phosphatase]]s into the digestive fluid at the bottom of the pitcher; ''Heliamphora'' relies on bacterial digestion alone. The enzymes digest the [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s in the prey, releasing [[amino acid]]s and [[phosphate]] ions, which the plant absorbs.

This balloon-like chamber is pitted with [[areola]]e, [[chlorophyll]]-free patches through which light can penetrate. Insects, mostly ants, enter the chamber via the opening underneath the balloon. Once inside, they tire themselves trying to escape from these false exits, until they eventually fall into the tube. Prey access is increased by the \"fish tails\", outgrowths of the operculum that give the plant its name.

The Albany pitcher plant ''[[Cephalotus]] follicularis'' is a small pitcher plant from [[Western Australia]], with [[moccasin]]-like pitchers. The rim of its pitcher's opening (the [[peristome]]) is particularly pronounced (both secrete [[nectar]]) and provides a thorny overhang to the opening, preventing trapped insects from climbing out.\n\nThe final carnivore with a pitfall-like trap is the [[bromeliad]] ''[[Brocchinia reducta]]''. Like most relatives of the [[pineapple]], the tightly packed, waxy leaf bases of the strap-like leaves of this species form an [[urn]].

The leaf of flypaper traps is studded with [[mucilage]]-secreting glands, which may be short (like those of the [[butterwort]]s), or long and mobile (like those of many [[sundew]]s). Flypapers have evolved independently at least five times. There is evidence that some clades of flypaper traps have evolved from morphologically more complex traps such as pitchers.<ref name=\"Ellison 2009\" />\n\nIn the genus ''[[Pinguicula]]'', the mucilage glands are quite short ([[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]), and the leaf, while shiny (giving the genus its common name of '[[butterwort]]'), does not appear carnivorous. However, this belies the fact that the leaf is an extremely effective trap of small flying insects (such as [[fungus gnat]]s), and its surface responds to prey by relatively rapid growth. This [[thigmotropism|thigmotropic]] growth may involve rolling of the leaf blade (to prevent rain from splashing the prey off the leaf surface) or dishing of the surface under the prey to form a shallow digestive pit.\n\nThe [[sundew]] genus (''[[Drosera]]'') consists of over 100 species of active flypapers whose mucilage glands are borne at the end of long [[tentacle]]s, which frequently grow fast enough in response to prey ([[thigmotropism]]) to aid the trapping process. The tentacles of ''D. burmanii'' can bend 180\u00b0 in a minute or so. Sundews are extremely cosmopolitan and are found on all the continents except the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] mainland. They are most diverse in [[Australia]], the home to the large subgroup of pygmy sundews such as ''D. pygmaea'' and to a number of tuberous sundews such as ''D. peltata'', which form tubers that [[estivation|aestivate]] during the dry summer months. These species are so dependent on insect sources of nitrogen that they generally lack the enzyme [[nitrate reductase]], which most plants require to assimilate soil-borne nitrate into organic forms.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Carnivorous Plant Time Lapse (Drosera Capensis) \"eating\" a Fruit Fly.ogv|thumb|left|''Drosera capensis'' responding to captured prey.

Its leaves are incapable of rapid movement or growth. Unrelated, but similar in habit, are the Australian rainbow plants (''[[Byblis plant|Byblis]]''). ''Drosophyllum'' is unusual in that it grows under near-[[desert]] conditions; almost all other carnivores are either [[bog]] plants or grow in moist tropical areas.\nRecent molecular data (particularly the production of [[plumbagin]]) indicate that the remaining [[flypaper]], ''[[Triphyophyllum|Triphyophyllum peltatum]]'', a member of the [[Dioncophyllaceae]], is closely related to ''Drosophyllum'' and forms part of a larger [[clade]] of carnivorous and non-carnivorous plants with the [[Droseraceae]], [[Nepenthaceae]], [[Ancistrocladaceae]] and [[Plumbaginaceae]]. This plant is usually encountered as a [[liana]], but in its juvenile phase, the plant is carnivorous.

Further stimulation of the lobe's internal surfaces by the struggling insects causes the lobes to close even tighter ([[thigmotropism]]), sealing the lobes [[Hermetic seal|hermetically]] and forming a [[stomach]] in which digestion occurs over a period of one to two weeks. Leaves can be reused three or four times before they become unresponsive to stimulation, depending on the growing conditions.\n\n===Bladder traps===\n[[File:Uk pond bladderwort2.jpg|thumb|left|The tip of one stolon of ''[[Utricularia vulgaris]]'', showing stolon, branching leaf-shoots, and transparent bladder traps]]\n\nBladder traps are exclusive to the genus ''[[Utricularia]]'', or [[bladderwort]]s. The bladders ([[vesicula]]e) pump [[ion]]s out of their interiors. Water follows by [[osmosis]], generating a partial [[vacuum]] inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as ''[[Daphnia]]'' touch these hairs and deform the door by [[lever]] action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of ''[[Utricularia]]'' (such as ''U. sandersonii'') are [[terrestrial plant|terrestrial]], growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered in a slightly different manner. Bladderworts lack [[root]]s, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting [[turion (botany)|turion]] during the winter months, and ''U. macrorhiza'' appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Lobster-pot traps===\n[[File:Genlisea violacea giant.jpg|thumb|''[[Genlisea violacea]]'' traps and leaves]]\nA lobster-pot trap is a chamber that is easy to enter, and whose exit is either difficult to find or obstructed by inward-pointing bristles. Lobster pots are the trapping mechanism in ''[[Genlisea]]'', the corkscrew plants. These plants appear to specialise in aquatic [[protozoa]]. A ''Y''-shaped modified leaf allows prey to enter but not exit. Inward-pointing hairs force the prey to move in a particular direction. Prey entering the spiral entrance that coils around the upper two arms of the ''Y'' are forced to move inexorably towards a stomach in the lower arm of the ''Y'', where they are digested. Prey movement is also thought to be encouraged by water movement through the trap, produced in a similar way to the vacuum in bladder traps, and probably evolutionarily related to it.\n\nOutside of ''Genlisea'', features reminiscent of lobster-pot traps can be seen in ''[[Sarracenia psittacina]]'', ''[[Darlingtonia californica]]'', and, some horticulturalists argue, ''[[Nepenthes aristolochioides]]''.\n\n===Combination traps===\nThe trapping mechanism of the sundew ''[[Drosera glanduligera]]'' combines features of both flypaper and snap traps; it has been termed a ''catapult-flypaper trap''.<ref name=\"glanduligera\">{{cite journal | title=Catapulting tentacles in a sticky carnivorous plant | author=Poppinga, S., Hartmeyer, S.R.H., Seidel, R., Masselter, T., Hartmeyer, I. & Speck, T. | journal=PLoS ONE |date=September 2012 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045735 | pmid=23049849 | pmc=3458893 | volume=7 | issue=9 | pages=e45735| bibcode=2012PLoSO...745735P }}</ref> ''[[Nepenthes jamban|Nepenthes jamban]]'' is a combination of pitfall and flypaper traps because it has a sticky pitcher fluid.\n\n===Borderline carnivores===\n{{Main|Protocarnivorous plant}}\nTo be defined as carnivorous, a plant must first exhibit an adaptation of some trait specifically for the attraction, capture, or digestion of prey.

However, plants that may opportunistically utilize nutrients from dead animals without specifically seeking and capturing fauna are excluded from the carnivorous definition. The second requirement also differentiates carnivory from defensive plant characteristics that may kill or incapacitate insects without the advantage of nutrient absorption. Due to the observation that many currently classified carnivores lack digestive enzymes for breaking down nutrients and instead rely upon mutualistic and symbiotic relationships with bacteria, ants, or insect, this adaptation has been added to the carnivorous definition.<ref name=\"Albert 1992\" /><ref name=\"Brocchinia\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Carnivory in the bromeliad Brocchinia reducta with a cost/benefit model for the general restriction of carnivorous plants to sunny, moist, nutrient poor habitats|last = Givnish, T., Burkhardt, E.

Very few [[fossil]]s have been found, and then usually only as [[seed]] or [[pollen]]. Carnivorous plants are generally herbs, and their traps are produced by [[primary growth]]. They generally do not form readily fossilisable structures such as thick bark or wood.\n\nStill, much can be deduced from the structure of current traps and their ecological interactions.  It is widely believed that carnivory evolved as a method to increase nutrients in extremely nutrient poor conditions, leading to a cost-benefit model for botanical carnivory. Cost-benefit models are given under the assumption that there is a set amount of energy potentially available for an organism, which leads to trade-offs when energy is allocated to certain functions to maximize competitive ability and fitness. For carnivory, the trait could only evolve if the increase in nutrients from prey capture exceeded the cost of investment in carnivorous adaptations.<ref name=\"Brocchinia\" />\n\nMost carnivorous plants live in habitats with high light, waterlogged soils, and extremely low soil nitrogen and phosphorus, producing the ecological impetus to derive nitrogen from an alternate source. High light environments allowed for the trade off between photosynthetic leaves and prey capturing traps that are photosynthetically inefficient. To compensate for photosynthetically inefficient material, the nutrients obtained through carnivory would need to increase photosynthesis by investing in more leaf mass, i.e. growing. This means when there is a shortage of nutrients and enough light and water, prey capture and digestion has the greatest impact on photosynthetic gains, favoring the evolution of plant adaptations which allowed for more effective and efficient carnivory.<ref name=\"Pavlovic\" /><ref name=\"givnish1984\" /> Due to the large amount of energy and resources allocated to carnivorous adaptations. i.e. the production of lures, digestive enzymes, modified leaf structures, and the decreased rate of photosynthesis over total leaf area, some authors argue that carnivory is an evolutionary last resort when nitrogen and phosphorus are limited in an ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e985cf88e0c56a79caa413e15d12e2c31497176|title = The cost of carnivory for Darlingtonia californica (Sarraceliaceae): Evidence from relationships among leaf traits|author1=Ellison, A.

Insects land on the leaf, become mired by the [[surface tension]] of the water, and [[suffocation|suffocate]]. Bacteria jumpstart [[Decomposition|decay]], releasing from the [[Dead body|corpse]] nutrients that the plant can absorb through its leaves. This [[foliar feeding]] can be observed in most non-carnivorous plants. Plants that were better at retaining insects or water therefore had a selective advantage. Rainwater can be retained by cupping the leaf, and pitfall traps may have evolved simply by selection pressure for the production of more deeply cupped leaves, followed by \"zipping up\" of the margins and subsequent loss of most of the hairs. Alternatively, insects can be retained by making the leaf stickier by the production of [[mucilage]], leading to flypaper traps.\n\nThe lobster-pot traps of ''Genlisea'' are difficult to interpret. They may have developed from bifurcated pitchers that later specialized on ground-dwelling prey; or, perhaps, the prey-guiding protrusions of bladder traps became more substantial than the net-like funnel found in most aquatic bladderworts. Whatever their origin, the helical shape of the lobster pot is an adaptation that displays as much trapping surface as possible in all directions when buried in [[moss]].\n\n[[File:CatopsisBerteroniana AtSierraDeLema4836.jpg|thumb|upright|The traps of ''[[Catopsis berteroniana]]'' are unlikely to have descended from a hairy leaf or sepal.]]\n\nThe traps of the bladderworts may have derived from pitchers that specialized in aquatic prey when flooded, like ''Sarracenia psittacina'' does today. Escaping prey in terrestrial pitchers have to climb or fly out of a trap, and both of these can be prevented by wax, gravity and narrow tubes. However, a flooded trap can be swum out of, so in ''Utricularia'', a one-way lid may have developed to form the door of a proto-bladder. Later, this may have become active by the evolution of a partial vacuum inside the bladder, tripped by prey brushing against trigger hairs on the door of the bladder.\n\nThe active glue traps use [[rapid plant movement]]s to trap their prey. Rapid plant movement can result from actual growth, or from rapid changes in cell [[turgor]], which allow cells to expand or contract by quickly altering their water content. Slow-moving flypapers like ''Pinguicula'' exploit growth, while the Venus flytrap uses such rapid turgor changes which make glue unnecessary.

The tamarisks possess specialised salt-excreting glands on their leaves, as do several of the Plumbaginaceae (such as the [[sea lavender]], ''Limonium''), which may have been co-opted for the excretion of other chemicals, such as proteases and mucilage. Some of the Plumbaginaceae (''e.g.'' ''Ceratostigma'') also have stalked, vascularised glands that secrete mucilage on their [[calyx (botany)|calyces]] and aid in seed dispersal and possibly in protecting the flowers from crawling parasitic insects. The balsams (such as ''[[Impatiens]]''), which are closely related to the [[Sarraceniaceae]] and ''[[Roridula]]'', similarly possess stalked glands.\n\nThe only traps that are unlikely to have descended from a hairy leaf or sepal are the carnivorous bromeliads (''Brocchinia'' and ''Catopsis'').

They are almost entirely restricted to [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] such as [[bog]]s, where soil nutrients are extremely limiting, but where [[sun]]light and water are readily available. Only under such extreme conditions is carnivory favored to an extent that makes the adaptations advantageous.\n\nThe [[archetype|archetypal]] carnivore, the [[Venus flytrap]], grows in soils with almost immeasurable [[nitrate]] and [[calcium]] levels. Plants need nitrogen for protein synthesis, calcium for [[cell wall]] stiffening, phosphate for [[nucleic acid]] synthesis, and iron and [[magnesium]] for [[chlorophyll]] synthesis. The soil is often [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]], which favours the production of toxic ions such as [[ammonium]], and its [[pH]] is an acidic 4 to 5. Ammonium can be used as a source of nitrogen by plants, but its high toxicity means that concentrations high enough to fertilise are also high enough to cause damage.\n\n[[File:Drosophyllum lusitanicum b.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Drosophyllum lusitanicum]]'' is one of the few carnivorous plants to grow in dry soil]]\n\nHowever, the habitat is warm, sunny, constantly moist, and the plant experiences relatively little competition from low growing ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss.

Animal prey makes up for differing deficiencies in soil nutrients.\n\nPlants use their leaves to intercept sunlight. The energy is used to reduce carbon dioxide from the air with [[electron]]s from water to make sugars (and other [[biomass]]) and a waste product, [[oxygen]], in the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Leaves also [[Cellular respiration|respire]], in a similar way to animals, by burning their biomass to generate chemical energy. This energy is temporarily stored in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] ([[adenosine]] triphosphate), which acts as an energy currency for metabolism in all living things. As a waste product, respiration produces [[carbon dioxide]].\n\nFor a plant to grow, it must photosynthesise more than it respires. Otherwise, it will eventually exhaust its biomass and die. The potential for plant growth is [[net photosynthesis]], the total gross gain of biomass by photosynthesis, minus the biomass lost by respiration. Understanding carnivory requires a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of these factors.<ref name=\"givnish1984\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Givnish TJ, Burkhardt EL, Happel RE, Weintraub JD | title=Carnivory in the bromeliad ''Brocchinia reducta'', with a cost-benefit model for the general restriction of carnivorous plants to sunny, moist, nutrient-poor habitats | journal=[[American Naturalist]] | volume=124| issue=4 | year=1984 | pages=479\u2013497 | doi=10.1086/284289 | jstor=00030147 }} (Requires JSTOR subscription)</ref>\n\nIn carnivorous plants, the leaf is not just used to photosynthesise, but also as a trap. Changing the leaf shape to make it a better trap generally makes it less [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficient at photosynthesis]].

Hence, a carnivorous plant will have both decreased photosynthesis and increased respiration, making the potential for growth small and the cost of carnivory high.\n\nBeing carnivorous allows the plant to grow better when the soil contains little nitrate or phosphate. In particular, an increased supply of nitrogen and phosphorus makes photosynthesis more efficient, because photosynthesis depends on the plant being able to synthesise very large amounts of the nitrogen-rich [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] ([[ribulose]]-1,5-''bis''-phosphate [[carboxylase]]/[[oxygenase]]), the most abundant protein on Earth.\n\nIt is intuitively clear that the Venus flytrap is more carnivorous than ''Triphyophyllum peltatum''. The former is a full-time moving snap-trap; the latter is a part-time, non-moving flypaper. The energy \"wasted\" by the plant in building and fuelling its trap is a suitable measure of the carnivory of the trap.\n\n[[File:Carnivorous plant model 1.png|thumb|400px|Modelling carnivory in plants: gross photosynthesis, respiration and net photosynthesis as a function of the plant's investment in carnivorous adaptations. Non-zero optimum carnivory occurs in brightly lit habitats with very limiting soil nutrients.]]\nUsing this measure of investment in carnivory, a model can be proposed.<ref name=\"givnish1984\" /> Above is a graph of carbon dioxide uptake (potential for growth) against trap respiration (investment in carnivory) for a leaf in a sunny habitat containing no soil nutrients at all. Respiration is a straight line sloping down under the horizontal axis (respiration produces carbon dioxide). Gross photosynthesis is a curved line above the horizontal axis: as investment increases, so too does the photosynthesis of the trap, as the leaf receives a better supply of nitrogen and phosphorus. Eventually another factor (such as light intensity or [[carbon dioxide]] concentration) will become more limiting to photosynthesis than nitrogen or phosphorus supply. As a result, increasing the investment will not make the plant grow better. The net uptake of carbon dioxide, and therefore, the plant's potential for growth, must be positive for the plant to survive. There is a broad span of investment where this is the case, and there is also a non-zero [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimum]]. Plants investing more or less than this optimum will take up less carbon dioxide than an optimal plant, and hence growing less well. These plants will be at a selective disadvantage. At zero investment the growth is zero, because a non-carnivorous plant cannot survive in a habitat with absolutely no soil-borne nutrients. Such habitats do not exist, so for example, ''[[Sphagnum]]'' absorbs the tiny amounts of nitrates and phosphates in rain very efficiently and also forms symbioses with diazotrophic [[cyanobacterium|cyanobacteria]].\n\n[[File:Carnivorous plant model 2.png|thumb|400px|Modelling carnivory in plants: gross photosynthesis, respiration and net photosynthesis as a function of the plant's investment in carnivorous adaptations. An optimum carnivory of zero occurs in poorly lit habitats with abundant soil nutrients.]]\n\nIn a habitat with abundant soil nutrients but little light (as shown above), the gross photosynthesis curve will be lower and flatter, because light will be more limiting than nutrients. A plant can grow at zero investment in carnivory; this is also the ''optimum'' investment for a plant, as any investment in traps reduces net photosynthesis (growth) to less than the net photosynthesis of a plant that obtains its nutrients from soil alone.\n\nCarnivorous plants exist between these two extremes: the less limiting light and water are, and the more limiting soil nutrients are, the higher the optimum investment in carnivory, and hence the more obvious the adaptations will be to the casual observer.\n\nThe most obvious evidence for this model is that carnivorous plants tend to grow in habitats where water and light are abundant and where competition is relatively low: the typical bog. Those that do not tend to be even more fastidious in some other way. ''Drosophyllum lusitanicum'' grows where there is little water, but it is even more extreme in its requirement for bright light and low disturbance than most other carnivores. ''Pinguicula valisneriifolia'' grows in soils with high levels of calcium but requires strong illumination and lower [[competition]] than many butterworts.<ref name=\"zamora1988\">{{Cite journal| doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1630:FROACP]2.0.CO;2 |vauthors=Zamora R, Gomez JM, Hodar JA | title=Fitness responses of a carnivorous plant in contrasting ecological scenarios | journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume=79| issue=5 | year=1988 | pages=1630\u20131644| issn=0012-9658 }}</ref>\n\nIn general, carnivorous plants are poor competitors, because they invest too heavily in structures that have no selective advantage in nutrient-rich habitats.

''Sarracenia'' spp. produce flat, non-carnivorous leaves ([[phyllode]]s) in winter. Light levels are lower than in summer, so light is more limiting than nutrients, and carnivory does not pay. The lack of insects in winter exacerbates the problem. Damage to growing pitcher leaves prevent them from forming proper pitchers, and again, the plant produces a phyllode instead.\n\n[[File:TriphyophyllumPeltatumTopview.jpg|250px|thumb|Part-time carnivory in ''[[Triphyophyllum peltatum]]'' may be due to an unusually high need for potassium at a certain point in the life cycle, just before flowering.]]\n[[File:Palau pitcher plant.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Nepenthes mirabilis]]'' in a road cut in [[Palau]].

Venus flytraps live in a very specialised habitat, whereas less carnivorous plants (''Byblis'', ''Pinguicula'') are found in less unusual habitats (i.e., those typical for non-carnivores). ''Byblis'' and ''Drosophyllum'' both come from relatively arid regions and are both passive flypapers, arguably the lowest maintenance form of trap. Venus flytraps filter their prey using the teeth around the trap's edge, so as not to waste energy on hard-to-digest prey. In evolution, laziness pays, because energy can be used for reproduction, and short-term benefits in reproduction will outweigh long-term benefits in anything else.\n\nCarnivory rarely pays, so even carnivorous plants avoid it when there is too little light or an easier source of nutrients, and they use as few carnivorous features as are required at a given time or for a given prey item. There are very few habitats stressful enough to make investing biomass and energy in trigger hairs and enzymes worthwhile. Many plants occasionally benefit from animal protein rotting on their leaves, but carnivory that is obvious enough for the casual observer to notice is rare.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nBromeliads seem very well preadapted to carnivory, but only one or two species can be classified as truly carnivorous. By their very shape, bromeliads will benefit from increased prey-derived nutrient input. In this sense, bromeliads are probably carnivorous, but their habitats are too dark for more extreme, recognisable carnivory to evolve. Most bromeliads are [[epiphyte]]s, and most epiphytes grow in partial shade on tree branches. ''Brocchinia reducta'', on the other hand, is a ground dweller.\n\nMany carnivorous plants are not strongly competitive and rely on circumstances to suppress dominating vegetation. Accordingly, some of them rely on [[fire ecology]] for their continued survival.\n\nFor the most part carnivorous plant populations are not dominant enough to be dramatically significant, ecologically speaking, but there is an impressive variety of organisms that interact with various carnivorous plants in sundry relationships of [[kleptoparasitism]], [[commensalism]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. For example, small insectivores such as [[tree frog]]s often exploit the supply of prey to be found in pitcher plants, and the frog ''[[Microhyla nepenthicola]]'' actually specialises in such habitats. Certain [[crab spider]]s such as ''[[Misumenops nepenthicola]]'' live largely on the prey of ''Nepenthes'', and other, less specialised, spiders may build webs where they trap insects attracted by the smell or appearance of the traps; some [[scavenger]]s, [[detritivore]]s, and also organisms that harvest or exploit those in turn, such as the mosquito ''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'' are largely or totally dependent on particular carnivorous plants. Plants such as ''[[Roridula]]'' species combine with specialised bugs (''[[Pameridea roridulae]]'') in benefiting from insects trapped on their leaves.\n\nAssociations with species of pitcher plants are so many and varied that the study of [[Nepenthes infauna|''Nepenthes'' infauna]] is something of a discipline in its own right. ''[[Camponotus schmitzi]]'', the diving ant, has an intimate degree of mutualism with the pitcher plant ''[[Nepenthes bicalcarata]]''; it not only retrieves prey and detritus from beneath the surface of the liquid in the pitchers, but repels herbivores, and cleans the pitcher [[peristome]], maintaining its slippery nature. The ants have been reported to attack struggling prey, hindering their escape, so there might be an element of [[myrmecotrophy]] to the relationship. Numerous species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in the liquid, where their larvae play various roles, depending on species; some eat microbes and detritus, as is common among mosquito larvae, whereas some species of ''[[Toxorhynchites]]'' also breed in pitchers, and their larvae are predators of other species of mosquito larvae. Apart from the crab spiders on pitchers, an actual small, red crab ''[[Geosesarma malayanum]]'' will enter the fluid, robbing and scavenging, though reputedly it does so at some risk of being captured and digested itself.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n''[[Nepenthes rajah]]'' has a remarkable mutualism with two unrelated small mammals, the [[mountain treeshrew]] (''Tupaia montana'') and the [[summit rat]] (''Rattus baluensis'').

[[Venus flytraps]] are still the most commonly grown, usually available at garden centers and hardware stores, sometimes offered alongside other easy to grow varieties. Nurseries that specialize in growing carnivorous plants exclusively also exist, more uncommon or demanding varieties of carnivorous plants can be obtained from specialist nurseries. [[California Carnivores]] is a notable example of such a nursery in the US that specializes in the cultivation of carnivorous plants. It is owned and operated by horticulturalist [[Peter D'Amato]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.californiacarnivores.com/|title=California Carnivores - carnivorous plant nursery|website=www.californiacarnivores.com}}</ref> [[Rob Cantley]]'s [[Borneo Exotics]] in [[Sri Lanka]] is a large nursery that sells worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borneoexotics.com/|title=Borneo Exotics (Pvt) Ltd. this is home|website=www.borneoexotics.com}}</ref>\n\nAlthough different species of carnivorous plants have different cultivation requirements in terms of sunlight, humidity, soil moisture, etc., there are commonalities. Most carnivorous plants require rainwater, or water that has been [[distill]]ed, deionised by [[reverse osmosis]], or acidified to around pH 6.5 using [[sulfuric acid]]. Common tap or drinking water contains minerals (particularly [[calcium]] salts) that will quickly build up and kill the plant. This is because most carnivorous plants have evolved in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and are consequently extreme [[calcifuge]]s. They are therefore very sensitive to excessive soil-borne nutrients. Since most of these plants are found in [[bogs]], almost all are very intolerant of drying. There are exceptions:\ntuberous sundews require a dry (summer) [[estivation|dormancy]] period, and ''Drosophyllum'' requires much drier conditions than most.\n\nOutdoor-grown carnivorous plants generally catch more than enough insects to keep themselves properly fed. Insects may be fed to the plants by hand to supplement their diet; however, carnivorous plants are generally unable to digest large non-insect food items; bits of hamburger, for example, will simply rot, and this may cause the trap, or even the whole plant, to die.\n\nA carnivorous plant that catches no insects at all will rarely die, although its growth may be impaired. In general, these plants are best left to their own devices: after underwatering with tap-water, the most common cause of Venus flytrap death is prodding the traps to watch them close and feeding them inappropriate items.\n\nMost carnivorous plants require bright light, and most will look better under such conditions, as this encourages them to synthesise red and purple [[anthocyanin]] pigments. ''Nepenthes'' and ''Pinguicula'' will do better out of full sun, but most other species are happy in direct sunlight.\n\nCarnivores mostly live in bogs, and those that do not are generally tropical. Hence, most require high humidity. On a small scale, this can be achieved by placing the plant in a wide saucer containing pebbles that are kept permanently wet. Small ''Nepenthes'' species grow well in large [[terrarium|terraria]].\n\nMany carnivores are native to cold temperate regions and can be grown outside in a bog garden year-round. Most ''Sarracenia'' can tolerate temperatures well below freezing, despite most species being native to the southeastern United States. Species of ''Drosera'' and ''Pinguicula'' also tolerate subfreezing temperatures. ''Nepenthes'' species, which are tropical, require temperatures from 20 to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to thrive.\n\n[[File:2005-12-18 N rajah 034.jpg|thumb|upright|Cultivated ''[[Nepenthes rajah]]'' and a few other species.]]\n\nCarnivorous plants require appropriate nutrient-poor soil. Most appreciate a 3:1 mixture of ''[[Sphagnum]]'' peat to sharp horticultural sand ([[coir]] is an acceptable, and more ecofriendly substitute for peat). ''Nepenthes'' will grow in orchid compost or in pure ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss.\n\nCarnivorous plants are themselves susceptible to infestation by parasites such as [[aphids]] or [[mealybug]]s. Although small infestations can be removed by hand, larger infestations necessitate use of an [[insecticide]].\n\n[[Isopropyl alcohol]] (rubbing alcohol) is effective as a topical insecticide, particularly on [[scale insect]]s. [[Diazinon]] is an excellent systemic insecticide that is tolerated by most carnivorous plants. [[Malathion]] and [[Acephate]] ([[Orthene]]) have also been reported as tolerable by carnivorous plants.\n\nAlthough insects can be a problem, by far the biggest killer of carnivorous plants (besides human maltreatment) is [[Botrytis cinerea|grey mold]] (''Botrytis cinerea''). This thrives under warm, humid conditions and can be a real problem in winter. To some extent, temperate carnivorous plants can be protected from this pathogen by ensuring that they are kept cool and well ventilated in winter and that any dead leaves are removed promptly. If this fails, a [[fungicide]] is in order.\n\nThe easiest carnivorous plants for beginners are those from the cool temperate zone. These plants will do well under cool greenhouse conditions (minimum 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter, maximum 25&nbsp;\u00b0C in summer) if kept in wide trays of acidified or rain water during summer and kept moist during winter:\n* ''[[Drosera capensis]]'', the Cape sundew: attractive strap-leaved sundew, pink flowers, very tolerant of maltreatment.\n* ''[[Drosera binata]]'', the fork-leaved sundew: large, ''Y''-shaped leaves.\n* ''[[Sarracenia flava]]'', the yellow trumpet pitcher: yellow, attractively veined leaves, yellow flowers in spring.\n* ''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', the common butterwort: purple flowers in spring, hibernates as a bud ([[hibernaculum (botany)|hibernaculum]]) in winter. Fully hardy.\n* ''[[Pinguicula moranensis]]'', the Mexican butterwort: pink flowers, non-carnivorous leaves in winter.\n\nVenus flytraps will do well under these conditions but are actually rather difficult to grow: even if treated well, they will often succumb to grey mold in winter unless well ventilated. Some of the lowland ''Nepenthes'' are very easy to grow as long as they are provided with relatively constant, hot and humid conditions.\n\n==Medicinal uses==\nA study published in 2009 by researchers from [[Tel Aviv University]] indicates that secretions produced by carnivorous plants contain compounds that have anti-fungal properties and may lead to the development of a new class of [[anti-fungal drug]]s that will be effective against [[Mycosis|infections]] that are resistant to current anti-fungal drugs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eilenberg |first=Haviva |first2=Smadar |last2=Pnini-Cohen |first3=Yocheved |last3=Rahamim |first4=Edward |last4=Sionov |first5=Esther |last5=Segal |first6=Shmuel |last6=Carmeli |first7=Aviah |last7=Zilberstein |date= December 2009 |title=Induced production of antifungal naphthoquinones in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant ''Nepenthes khasiana''|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=61|issue=3|pages=911\u2013922|doi=10.1093/jxb/erp359 |url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/61/3/911|accessdate=2010-04-22|pmid=20018905|pmc=2814117}}</ref><ref name=I21C>{{cite web|url=https://www.israel21c.org/carnivorous-plants-may-save-people/ |title= Carnivorous plants may save people | date=April 11, 2010 |publisher=[Israel 21c Innovation News Service] |accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

Buel, 1887|198x198px]]Carnivorous plants have long been the subject of popular interest and exposition, much of it highly inaccurate. Fictional plants have been featured in a number of books, movies, television series, and video games. Typically, these fictional depictions include exaggerated characteristics, such as enormous size or possession of abilities beyond the realm of reality, and can be viewed as a kind of [[artistic license]]. Two of the most famous examples of fictional carnivorous plants in popular culture are the 1960s [[black comedy]] ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and the [[triffid]]s of [[John Wyndham (writer)|John Wyndham]]'s ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]''. Other movies, such as ''[[The Hellstrom Chronicle]]'' (1971), and television series utilize accurate depictions of carnivorous plants for cinematic purposes.\n\nThe earliest known depiction of carnivorous plants in popular culture was a case wherein a large [[man-eating tree]] was reported to have consumed a young woman in [[Madagascar]] in 1878. The ''[[South Australian Register]]'' carried the story in 1881. It was accompanied by an illustration of the tree consuming the woman, said to be a member from the \"little known but cruel tribe\" called the Mkodos. The story was attributed to a Dr. Carl Liche who supposedly witnessed the event. The account has been debunked as pure myth as it appears Dr. Liche, the Mkodos, and the tree were all fabrications.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2007-10-26|title=The Dirt: Myths about man-eating plants - something to chew on|author1=Ron Sullivan |author2=Joe Eaton |date=2007-10-27|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/27/HOIASVF6T.DTL}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Carnivorous plants}}\n{{Wikisource cat|Carnivorous plants}}\n* {{Cite book| author=Slack A | title=Insect-eating Plants and How to Grow Them | publisher=Alphabooks | location=Sherborne UK | year=1986 | isbn= 978-0-906670-42-2 }}\n* {{Cite book|vauthors=Juniper BE, Robins RJ, Joel DM | title=The Carnivorous Plants | publisher=Academic Press, San Diego | year=1989 | title-link=The Carnivorous Plants (1989 book) }}\n* {{Cite article|vauthors=Miller TS | title=Lives of the Monster Plants: The Revenge of the Vegetable in the Age of Animal Studies (2012 article) | publisher=Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts 23.3 | year=2012 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.omnisterra.com/bot/cp_home.cgi Carnivorous Plant Database] provides an up-to-date, searchable database of all the published species of carnivorous plants.\n* [http://www.sarracenia.com/faq.html Carnivorous Plant FAQ] at Sarracenia.com\n* [http://www.sarracenia.com/faq/faq1395.html List of films and TV shows that feature carnivorous plants-most of them fictional]\n* [http://www.botany.org/carnivorous_plants/ Botanical Society of America - Carnivorous Plants Online]\n* [https://wikis.nbi.ac.uk/InnerWorlds/index.php/Inner_World_of_Carnivorous_Plants#.UThnmRyePAk Inner World of Carnivorous Plants from the John Innes Centre]\n* Ellison, A.M. 2006. {{cite web|url= http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/publications/pdfs/ellison_PlantBio_2006.pdf |title=Nutrient Limitation and Stoichiometry of Carnivorous Plants. }}&nbsp;{{small|(334&nbsp;KB)}} ''Plant Biol.''

For example, ''[[Triphyophyllum]]'' is a passive flypaper that secretes mucilage, but whose leaves do not grow or move in response to prey capture. Meanwhile, [[sundew]]s are active flypaper traps whose leaves undergo rapid [[acid growth]], which is an expansion of individual cells as opposed to [[cell division]]. The rapid acid growth allows the sundew [[tentacle]]s to bend, aiding in the retention and [[digestion]] of prey.<ref name=\"Williams 2002\">Williams, S. E. 2002.

The linings of most pitcher plants are covered in a loose coating of [[wax]]y flakes which are slippery for insects, causing them to fall into the pitcher.

This type of 'water body' is called a [[Phytotelma]].\n\nThe simplest pitcher plants are probably those of ''[[Heliamphora]]'', the marsh [[pitcher plant]]. In this [[genus]], the traps are clearly derived from a simple rolled leaf whose margins have sealed together. These plants live in areas of high rainfall in South America such as [[Mount Roraima]] and consequently have a problem ensuring their pitchers do not overflow. To counteract this problem, [[natural selection]] has favoured the evolution of an overflow similar to that of a bathroom [[sink]]\u2014a small gap in the zipped-up leaf margins allows excess water to flow out of the pitcher.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n''Heliamphora'' is a member of the [[Sarraceniaceae]], a [[New World]] family in the order [[Ericales]] ([[Calluna|heathers]] and allies). ''Heliamphora'' is limited to South America, but the family contains two other genera, ''[[Sarracenia]]'' and ''[[Darlingtonia (plant)|Darlingtonia]]'', which are endemic to the [[Southeastern United States]] (with the exception of one species) and [[California]] respectively. ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]'' subsp. ''purpurea'' (the northern pitcher plant) can be found as far north as [[Canada]]. ''Sarracenia'' is the pitcher plant genus most commonly encountered in cultivation, because it is relatively hardy and easy to grow.\n\n[[File:Darlingtonia californica ne8.JPG|thumb|220px|left|''[[Darlingtonia californica]]'': note the small entrance to the trap underneath the swollen \"balloon\" and the colourless patches that confuse prey trapped inside.]]\n\nIn the genus ''Sarracenia'', the problem of pitcher overflow is solved by an [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]], which is essentially a flared leaflet that covers the opening of the rolled-leaf tube and protects it from rain. Possibly because of this improved waterproofing, ''Sarracenia'' species secrete enzymes such as [[protease]]s and [[phosphatase]]s into the digestive fluid at the bottom of the pitcher; ''Heliamphora'' relies on bacterial digestion alone. The enzymes digest the [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s in the prey, releasing [[amino acid]]s and [[phosphate]] ions, which the plant absorbs. In at least one species, ''[[Sarracenia flava]]'', the nectar bribe is laced with [[coniine]], a toxic [[alkaloid]] also found in [[Conium|hemlock]], which probably increases the efficiency of the traps by intoxicating prey.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mody N.

This balloon-like chamber is pitted with [[areola]]e, [[chlorophyll]]-free patches through which light can penetrate. Insects, mostly ants, enter the chamber via the opening underneath the balloon. Once inside, they tire themselves trying to escape from these false exits, until they eventually fall into the tube. Prey access is increased by the \"fish tails\", outgrowths of the operculum that give the plant its name. Some seedling ''Sarracenia'' species also have long, overhanging opercular outgrowths; ''Darlingtonia'' may therefore represent an example of [[neoteny]].\n\n[[File:Roraima Brocchinia reducta1.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Brocchinia reducta]]'': a carnivorous bromeliad]]\n\nThe second major group of pitcher plants are the [[monkey cup]]s or tropical pitcher plants of the genus ''[[Nepenthes]]''. In the hundred or so species of this genus, the pitcher is borne at the end of a [[tendril]], which grows as an extension to the [[midrib]] of the leaf. Most species catch insects, although the larger ones, such as ''[[Nepenthes rajah]]'', also occasionally take small [[mammal]]s and [[reptile]]s. ''[[Nepenthes bicalcarata]]'' possesses two sharp thorns that project from the base of the operculum over the entrance to the pitcher.

The Albany pitcher plant ''[[Cephalotus]] follicularis'' is a small pitcher plant from [[Western Australia]], with [[moccasin]]-like pitchers. The rim of its pitcher's opening (the [[peristome]]) is particularly pronounced (both secrete [[nectar]]) and provides a thorny overhang to the opening, preventing trapped insects from climbing out.\n\nThe final carnivore with a pitfall-like trap is the [[bromeliad]] ''[[Brocchinia reducta]]''. Like most relatives of the [[pineapple]], the tightly packed, waxy leaf bases of the strap-like leaves of this species form an [[urn]]. In most bromeliads, water collects readily in this urn and may provide [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] for [[frog]]s, [[insect]]s and, more useful for the plant, [[diazotroph]]ic (nitrogen-fixing) [[bacterium|bacteria.]] In ''Brocchinia'', the urn is a specialised insect trap, with a loose, waxy lining and a population of digestive bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n[[File:Pinguicula_conzattii_ne2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Pinguicula conzattii]]'' with prey.]]\n\n===Flypaper traps===\n[[File:Drosera capensis bend.JPG|thumb|upright|The leaf of a ''[[Drosera capensis]]'' bending in response to the trapping of an insect]]\nThe flypaper trap utilizes sticky mucilage or glue. The leaf of flypaper traps is studded with [[mucilage]]-secreting glands, which may be short (like those of the [[butterwort]]s), or long and mobile (like those of many [[sundew]]s). Flypapers have evolved independently at least five times. There is evidence that some clades of flypaper traps have evolved from morphologically more complex traps such as pitchers.<ref name=\"Ellison 2009\" />\n\nIn the genus ''[[Pinguicula]]'', the mucilage glands are quite short ([[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]), and the leaf, while shiny (giving the genus its common name of '[[butterwort]]'), does not appear carnivorous. However, this belies the fact that the leaf is an extremely effective trap of small flying insects (such as [[fungus gnat]]s), and its surface responds to prey by relatively rapid growth. This [[thigmotropism|thigmotropic]] growth may involve rolling of the leaf blade (to prevent rain from splashing the prey off the leaf surface) or dishing of the surface under the prey to form a shallow digestive pit.\n\nThe [[sundew]] genus (''[[Drosera]]'') consists of over 100 species of active flypapers whose mucilage glands are borne at the end of long [[tentacle]]s, which frequently grow fast enough in response to prey ([[thigmotropism]]) to aid the trapping process. The tentacles of ''D. burmanii'' can bend 180\u00b0 in a minute or so. Sundews are extremely cosmopolitan and are found on all the continents except the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] mainland. They are most diverse in [[Australia]], the home to the large subgroup of pygmy sundews such as ''D. pygmaea'' and to a number of tuberous sundews such as ''D. peltata'', which form tubers that [[estivation|aestivate]] during the dry summer months. These species are so dependent on insect sources of nitrogen that they generally lack the enzyme [[nitrate reductase]], which most plants require to assimilate soil-borne nitrate into organic forms.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Carnivorous Plant Time Lapse (Drosera Capensis) \"eating\" a Fruit Fly.ogv|thumb|left|''Drosera capensis'' responding to captured prey.

Its leaves are incapable of rapid movement or growth. Unrelated, but similar in habit, are the Australian rainbow plants (''[[Byblis plant|Byblis]]''). ''Drosophyllum'' is unusual in that it grows under near-[[desert]] conditions; almost all other carnivores are either [[bog]] plants or grow in moist tropical areas.\nRecent molecular data (particularly the production of [[plumbagin]]) indicate that the remaining [[flypaper]], ''[[Triphyophyllum|Triphyophyllum peltatum]]'', a member of the [[Dioncophyllaceae]], is closely related to ''Drosophyllum'' and forms part of a larger [[clade]] of carnivorous and non-carnivorous plants with the [[Droseraceae]], [[Nepenthaceae]], [[Ancistrocladaceae]] and [[Plumbaginaceae]].

The bladders ([[vesicula]]e) pump [[ion]]s out of their interiors. Water follows by [[osmosis]], generating a partial [[vacuum]] inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as ''[[Daphnia]]'' touch these hairs and deform the door by [[lever]] action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of ''[[Utricularia]]'' (such as ''U. sandersonii'') are [[terrestrial plant|terrestrial]], growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered in a slightly different manner. Bladderworts lack [[root]]s, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting [[turion (botany)|turion]] during the winter months, and ''U. macrorhiza'' appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Lobster-pot traps===\n[[File:Genlisea violacea giant.jpg|thumb|''[[Genlisea violacea]]'' traps and leaves]]\nA lobster-pot trap is a chamber that is easy to enter, and whose exit is either difficult to find or obstructed by inward-pointing bristles. Lobster pots are the trapping mechanism in ''[[Genlisea]]'', the corkscrew plants. These plants appear to specialise in aquatic [[protozoa]]. A ''Y''-shaped modified leaf allows prey to enter but not exit. Inward-pointing hairs force the prey to move in a particular direction. Prey entering the spiral entrance that coils around the upper two arms of the ''Y'' are forced to move inexorably towards a stomach in the lower arm of the ''Y'', where they are digested. Prey movement is also thought to be encouraged by water movement through the trap, produced in a similar way to the vacuum in bladder traps, and probably evolutionarily related to it.\n\nOutside of ''Genlisea'', features reminiscent of lobster-pot traps can be seen in ''[[Sarracenia psittacina]]'', ''[[Darlingtonia californica]]'', and, some horticulturalists argue, ''[[Nepenthes aristolochioides]]''.\n\n===Combination traps===\nThe trapping mechanism of the sundew ''[[Drosera glanduligera]]'' combines features of both flypaper and snap traps; it has been termed a ''catapult-flypaper trap''.<ref name=\"glanduligera\">{{cite journal | title=Catapulting tentacles in a sticky carnivorous plant | author=Poppinga, S., Hartmeyer, S.R.H., Seidel, R., Masselter, T., Hartmeyer, I. & Speck, T. | journal=PLoS ONE |date=September 2012 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045735 | pmid=23049849 | pmc=3458893 | volume=7 | issue=9 | pages=e45735| bibcode=2012PLoSO...745735P }}</ref> ''[[Nepenthes jamban|Nepenthes jamban]]'' is a combination of pitfall and flypaper traps because it has a sticky pitcher fluid.\n\n===Borderline carnivores===\n{{Main|Protocarnivorous plant}}\nTo be defined as carnivorous, a plant must first exhibit an adaptation of some trait specifically for the attraction, capture, or digestion of prey.

However, plants that may opportunistically utilize nutrients from dead animals without specifically seeking and capturing fauna are excluded from the carnivorous definition. The second requirement also differentiates carnivory from defensive plant characteristics that may kill or incapacitate insects without the advantage of nutrient absorption.

Very few [[fossil]]s have been found, and then usually only as [[seed]] or [[pollen]]. Carnivorous plants are generally herbs, and their traps are produced by [[primary growth]]. They generally do not form readily fossilisable structures such as thick bark or wood.\n\nStill, much can be deduced from the structure of current traps and their ecological interactions.  It is widely believed that carnivory evolved as a method to increase nutrients in extremely nutrient poor conditions, leading to a cost-benefit model for botanical carnivory. Cost-benefit models are given under the assumption that there is a set amount of energy potentially available for an organism, which leads to trade-offs when energy is allocated to certain functions to maximize competitive ability and fitness. For carnivory, the trait could only evolve if the increase in nutrients from prey capture exceeded the cost of investment in carnivorous adaptations.<ref name=\"Brocchinia\" />\n\nMost carnivorous plants live in habitats with high light, waterlogged soils, and extremely low soil nitrogen and phosphorus, producing the ecological impetus to derive nitrogen from an alternate source. High light environments allowed for the trade off between photosynthetic leaves and prey capturing traps that are photosynthetically inefficient. To compensate for photosynthetically inefficient material, the nutrients obtained through carnivory would need to increase photosynthesis by investing in more leaf mass, i.e. growing. This means when there is a shortage of nutrients and enough light and water, prey capture and digestion has the greatest impact on photosynthetic gains, favoring the evolution of plant adaptations which allowed for more effective and efficient carnivory.<ref name=\"Pavlovic\" /><ref name=\"givnish1984\" /> Due to the large amount of energy and resources allocated to carnivorous adaptations. i.e. the production of lures, digestive enzymes, modified leaf structures, and the decreased rate of photosynthesis over total leaf area, some authors argue that carnivory is an evolutionary last resort when nitrogen and phosphorus are limited in an ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e985cf88e0c56a79caa413e15d12e2c31497176|title = The cost of carnivory for Darlingtonia californica (Sarraceliaceae): Evidence from relationships among leaf traits|author1=Ellison, A.

Insects land on the leaf, become mired by the [[surface tension]] of the water, and [[suffocation|suffocate]]. Bacteria jumpstart [[Decomposition|decay]], releasing from the [[Dead body|corpse]] nutrients that the plant can absorb through its leaves. This [[foliar feeding]] can be observed in most non-carnivorous plants. Plants that were better at retaining insects or water therefore had a selective advantage. Rainwater can be retained by cupping the leaf, and pitfall traps may have evolved simply by selection pressure for the production of more deeply cupped leaves, followed by \"zipping up\" of the margins and subsequent loss of most of the hairs. Alternatively, insects can be retained by making the leaf stickier by the production of [[mucilage]], leading to flypaper traps.\n\nThe lobster-pot traps of ''Genlisea'' are difficult to interpret. They may have developed from bifurcated pitchers that later specialized on ground-dwelling prey; or, perhaps, the prey-guiding protrusions of bladder traps became more substantial than the net-like funnel found in most aquatic bladderworts. Whatever their origin, the helical shape of the lobster pot is an adaptation that displays as much trapping surface as possible in all directions when buried in [[moss]].\n\n[[File:CatopsisBerteroniana AtSierraDeLema4836.jpg|thumb|upright|The traps of ''[[Catopsis berteroniana]]'' are unlikely to have descended from a hairy leaf or sepal.]]\n\nThe traps of the bladderworts may have derived from pitchers that specialized in aquatic prey when flooded, like ''Sarracenia psittacina'' does today. Escaping prey in terrestrial pitchers have to climb or fly out of a trap, and both of these can be prevented by wax, gravity and narrow tubes. However, a flooded trap can be swum out of, so in ''Utricularia'', a one-way lid may have developed to form the door of a proto-bladder. Later, this may have become active by the evolution of a partial vacuum inside the bladder, tripped by prey brushing against trigger hairs on the door of the bladder.\n\nThe active glue traps use [[rapid plant movement]]s to trap their prey. Rapid plant movement can result from actual growth, or from rapid changes in cell [[turgor]], which allow cells to expand or contract by quickly altering their water content. Slow-moving flypapers like ''Pinguicula'' exploit growth, while the Venus flytrap uses such rapid turgor changes which make glue unnecessary.

The tamarisks possess specialised salt-excreting glands on their leaves, as do several of the Plumbaginaceae (such as the [[sea lavender]], ''Limonium''), which may have been co-opted for the excretion of other chemicals, such as proteases and mucilage. Some of the Plumbaginaceae (''e.g.'' ''Ceratostigma'') also have stalked, vascularised glands that secrete mucilage on their [[calyx (botany)|calyces]] and aid in seed dispersal and possibly in protecting the flowers from crawling parasitic insects. The balsams (such as ''[[Impatiens]]''), which are closely related to the [[Sarraceniaceae]] and ''[[Roridula]]'', similarly possess stalked glands.\n\nThe only traps that are unlikely to have descended from a hairy leaf or sepal are the carnivorous bromeliads (''Brocchinia'' and ''Catopsis'').

The soil is often [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]], which favours the production of toxic ions such as [[ammonium]], and its [[pH]] is an acidic 4 to 5. Ammonium can be used as a source of nitrogen by plants, but its high toxicity means that concentrations high enough to fertilise are also high enough to cause damage.\n\n[[File:Drosophyllum lusitanicum b.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Drosophyllum lusitanicum]]'' is one of the few carnivorous plants to grow in dry soil]]\n\nHowever, the habitat is warm, sunny, constantly moist, and the plant experiences relatively little competition from low growing ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss.

As a waste product, respiration produces [[carbon dioxide]].\n\nFor a plant to grow, it must photosynthesise more than it respires. Otherwise, it will eventually exhaust its biomass and die. The potential for plant growth is [[net photosynthesis]], the total gross gain of biomass by photosynthesis, minus the biomass lost by respiration. Understanding carnivory requires a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of these factors.<ref name=\"givnish1984\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Givnish TJ, Burkhardt EL, Happel RE, Weintraub JD | title=Carnivory in the bromeliad ''Brocchinia reducta'', with a cost-benefit model for the general restriction of carnivorous plants to sunny, moist, nutrient-poor habitats | journal=[[American Naturalist]] | volume=124| issue=4 | year=1984 | pages=479\u2013497 | doi=10.1086/284289 | jstor=00030147 }} (Requires JSTOR subscription)</ref>\n\nIn carnivorous plants, the leaf is not just used to photosynthesise, but also as a trap.

Hence, a carnivorous plant will have both decreased photosynthesis and increased respiration, making the potential for growth small and the cost of carnivory high.\n\nBeing carnivorous allows the plant to grow better when the soil contains little nitrate or phosphate. In particular, an increased supply of nitrogen and phosphorus makes photosynthesis more efficient, because photosynthesis depends on the plant being able to synthesise very large amounts of the nitrogen-rich [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] ([[ribulose]]-1,5-''bis''-phosphate [[carboxylase]]/[[oxygenase]]), the most abundant protein on Earth.\n\nIt is intuitively clear that the Venus flytrap is more carnivorous than ''Triphyophyllum peltatum''. The former is a full-time moving snap-trap; the latter is a part-time, non-moving flypaper. The energy \"wasted\" by the plant in building and fuelling its trap is a suitable measure of the carnivory of the trap.\n\n[[File:Carnivorous plant model 1.png|thumb|400px|Modelling carnivory in plants: gross photosynthesis, respiration and net photosynthesis as a function of the plant's investment in carnivorous adaptations. Non-zero optimum carnivory occurs in brightly lit habitats with very limiting soil nutrients.]]\nUsing this measure of investment in carnivory, a model can be proposed.<ref name=\"givnish1984\" /> Above is a graph of carbon dioxide uptake (potential for growth) against trap respiration (investment in carnivory) for a leaf in a sunny habitat containing no soil nutrients at all. Respiration is a straight line sloping down under the horizontal axis (respiration produces carbon dioxide). Gross photosynthesis is a curved line above the horizontal axis: as investment increases, so too does the photosynthesis of the trap, as the leaf receives a better supply of nitrogen and phosphorus. Eventually another factor (such as light intensity or [[carbon dioxide]] concentration) will become more limiting to photosynthesis than nitrogen or phosphorus supply. As a result, increasing the investment will not make the plant grow better. The net uptake of carbon dioxide, and therefore, the plant's potential for growth, must be positive for the plant to survive. There is a broad span of investment where this is the case, and there is also a non-zero [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimum]]. Plants investing more or less than this optimum will take up less carbon dioxide than an optimal plant, and hence growing less well. These plants will be at a selective disadvantage. At zero investment the growth is zero, because a non-carnivorous plant cannot survive in a habitat with absolutely no soil-borne nutrients. Such habitats do not exist, so for example, ''[[Sphagnum]]'' absorbs the tiny amounts of nitrates and phosphates in rain very efficiently and also forms symbioses with diazotrophic [[cyanobacterium|cyanobacteria]].\n\n[[File:Carnivorous plant model 2.png|thumb|400px|Modelling carnivory in plants: gross photosynthesis, respiration and net photosynthesis as a function of the plant's investment in carnivorous adaptations. An optimum carnivory of zero occurs in poorly lit habitats with abundant soil nutrients.]]\n\nIn a habitat with abundant soil nutrients but little light (as shown above), the gross photosynthesis curve will be lower and flatter, because light will be more limiting than nutrients. A plant can grow at zero investment in carnivory; this is also the ''optimum'' investment for a plant, as any investment in traps reduces net photosynthesis (growth) to less than the net photosynthesis of a plant that obtains its nutrients from soil alone.\n\nCarnivorous plants exist between these two extremes: the less limiting light and water are, and the more limiting soil nutrients are, the higher the optimum investment in carnivory, and hence the more obvious the adaptations will be to the casual observer.\n\nThe most obvious evidence for this model is that carnivorous plants tend to grow in habitats where water and light are abundant and where competition is relatively low: the typical bog. Those that do not tend to be even more fastidious in some other way. ''Drosophyllum lusitanicum'' grows where there is little water, but it is even more extreme in its requirement for bright light and low disturbance than most other carnivores. ''Pinguicula valisneriifolia'' grows in soils with high levels of calcium but requires strong illumination and lower [[competition]] than many butterworts.<ref name=\"zamora1988\">{{Cite journal| doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1630:FROACP]2.0.CO;2 |vauthors=Zamora R, Gomez JM, Hodar JA | title=Fitness responses of a carnivorous plant in contrasting ecological scenarios | journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume=79| issue=5 | year=1988 | pages=1630\u20131644| issn=0012-9658 }}</ref>\n\nIn general, carnivorous plants are poor competitors, because they invest too heavily in structures that have no selective advantage in nutrient-rich habitats.

''Sarracenia'' spp. produce flat, non-carnivorous leaves ([[phyllode]]s) in winter. Light levels are lower than in summer, so light is more limiting than nutrients, and carnivory does not pay. The lack of insects in winter exacerbates the problem. Damage to growing pitcher leaves prevent them from forming proper pitchers, and again, the plant produces a phyllode instead.\n\n[[File:TriphyophyllumPeltatumTopview.jpg|250px|thumb|Part-time carnivory in ''[[Triphyophyllum peltatum]]'' may be due to an unusually high need for potassium at a certain point in the life cycle, just before flowering.]]\n[[File:Palau pitcher plant.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Nepenthes mirabilis]]'' in a road cut in [[Palau]].

Venus flytraps live in a very specialised habitat, whereas less carnivorous plants (''Byblis'', ''Pinguicula'') are found in less unusual habitats (i.e., those typical for non-carnivores). ''Byblis'' and ''Drosophyllum'' both come from relatively arid regions and are both passive flypapers, arguably the lowest maintenance form of trap. Venus flytraps filter their prey using the teeth around the trap's edge, so as not to waste energy on hard-to-digest prey. In evolution, laziness pays, because energy can be used for reproduction, and short-term benefits in reproduction will outweigh long-term benefits in anything else.\n\nCarnivory rarely pays, so even carnivorous plants avoid it when there is too little light or an easier source of nutrients, and they use as few carnivorous features as are required at a given time or for a given prey item. There are very few habitats stressful enough to make investing biomass and energy in trigger hairs and enzymes worthwhile. Many plants occasionally benefit from animal protein rotting on their leaves, but carnivory that is obvious enough for the casual observer to notice is rare.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nBromeliads seem very well preadapted to carnivory, but only one or two species can be classified as truly carnivorous. By their very shape, bromeliads will benefit from increased prey-derived nutrient input. In this sense, bromeliads are probably carnivorous, but their habitats are too dark for more extreme, recognisable carnivory to evolve. Most bromeliads are [[epiphyte]]s, and most epiphytes grow in partial shade on tree branches. ''Brocchinia reducta'', on the other hand, is a ground dweller.\n\nMany carnivorous plants are not strongly competitive and rely on circumstances to suppress dominating vegetation. Accordingly, some of them rely on [[fire ecology]] for their continued survival.\n\nFor the most part carnivorous plant populations are not dominant enough to be dramatically significant, ecologically speaking, but there is an impressive variety of organisms that interact with various carnivorous plants in sundry relationships of [[kleptoparasitism]], [[commensalism]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. For example, small insectivores such as [[tree frog]]s often exploit the supply of prey to be found in pitcher plants, and the frog ''[[Microhyla nepenthicola]]'' actually specialises in such habitats. Certain [[crab spider]]s such as ''[[Misumenops nepenthicola]]'' live largely on the prey of ''Nepenthes'', and other, less specialised, spiders may build webs where they trap insects attracted by the smell or appearance of the traps; some [[scavenger]]s, [[detritivore]]s, and also organisms that harvest or exploit those in turn, such as the mosquito ''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'' are largely or totally dependent on particular carnivorous plants. Plants such as ''[[Roridula]]'' species combine with specialised bugs (''[[Pameridea roridulae]]'') in benefiting from insects trapped on their leaves.\n\nAssociations with species of pitcher plants are so many and varied that the study of [[Nepenthes infauna|''Nepenthes'' infauna]] is something of a discipline in its own right. ''[[Camponotus schmitzi]]'', the diving ant, has an intimate degree of mutualism with the pitcher plant ''[[Nepenthes bicalcarata]]''; it not only retrieves prey and detritus from beneath the surface of the liquid in the pitchers, but repels herbivores, and cleans the pitcher [[peristome]], maintaining its slippery nature. The ants have been reported to attack struggling prey, hindering their escape, so there might be an element of [[myrmecotrophy]] to the relationship. Numerous species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in the liquid, where their larvae play various roles, depending on species; some eat microbes and detritus, as is common among mosquito larvae, whereas some species of ''[[Toxorhynchites]]'' also breed in pitchers, and their larvae are predators of other species of mosquito larvae. Apart from the crab spiders on pitchers, an actual small, red crab ''[[Geosesarma malayanum]]'' will enter the fluid, robbing and scavenging, though reputedly it does so at some risk of being captured and digested itself.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n''[[Nepenthes rajah]]'' has a remarkable mutualism with two unrelated small mammals, the [[mountain treeshrew]] (''Tupaia montana'') and the [[summit rat]] (''Rattus baluensis'').

In the [[Cronquist system]], the Droseraceae and Nepenthaceae were placed in the order Nepenthales, based on the radial symmetry of their flowers and their possession of insect traps. The Sarraceniaceae was placed either in the Nepenthales, or in its own order, the Sarraceniales. The Byblidaceae, Cephalotaceae, and Roridulaceae were placed in the Saxifragales; and the Lentibulariaceae in the Scrophulariales (now subsumed into the Lamiales<ref name=\"Muller2004\">{{Cite journal | vauthors=Muller K, Borsch T, Legendre L, Porembski S, Theisen I, Barthlott W | title=Evolution of carnivory in Lentibulariaceae and the Lamiales | journal=[[Plant Biology (Stuttgart)]] | volume=6 | year=2004 | pages=477\u2013490 | doi=10.1055/s-2004-817909 | pmid=15248131 | issue=4 }}</ref>).\n\nIn more modern classification, such as that of the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]], the families have been retained, but they have been redistributed amongst several disparate orders. It is also recommended that ''Drosophyllum'' be considered in a monotypic family outside the rest of the Droseraceae, probably more closely allied to the Dioncophyllaceae.

[[Venus flytraps]] are still the most commonly grown, usually available at garden centers and hardware stores, sometimes offered alongside other easy to grow varieties. Nurseries that specialize in growing carnivorous plants exclusively also exist, more uncommon or demanding varieties of carnivorous plants can be obtained from specialist nurseries. [[California Carnivores]] is a notable example of such a nursery in the US that specializes in the cultivation of carnivorous plants. It is owned and operated by horticulturalist [[Peter D'Amato]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.californiacarnivores.com/|title=California Carnivores - carnivorous plant nursery|website=www.californiacarnivores.com}}</ref> [[Rob Cantley]]'s [[Borneo Exotics]] in [[Sri Lanka]] is a large nursery that sells worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borneoexotics.com/|title=Borneo Exotics (Pvt) Ltd. this is home|website=www.borneoexotics.com}}</ref>\n\nAlthough different species of carnivorous plants have different cultivation requirements in terms of sunlight, humidity, soil moisture, etc., there are commonalities. Most carnivorous plants require rainwater, or water that has been [[distill]]ed, deionised by [[reverse osmosis]], or acidified to around pH 6.5 using [[sulfuric acid]]. Common tap or drinking water contains minerals (particularly [[calcium]] salts) that will quickly build up and kill the plant. This is because most carnivorous plants have evolved in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and are consequently extreme [[calcifuge]]s. They are therefore very sensitive to excessive soil-borne nutrients. Since most of these plants are found in [[bogs]], almost all are very intolerant of drying. There are exceptions:\ntuberous sundews require a dry (summer) [[estivation|dormancy]] period, and ''Drosophyllum'' requires much drier conditions than most.\n\nOutdoor-grown carnivorous plants generally catch more than enough insects to keep themselves properly fed. Insects may be fed to the plants by hand to supplement their diet; however, carnivorous plants are generally unable to digest large non-insect food items; bits of hamburger, for example, will simply rot, and this may cause the trap, or even the whole plant, to die.\n\nA carnivorous plant that catches no insects at all will rarely die, although its growth may be impaired. In general, these plants are best left to their own devices: after underwatering with tap-water, the most common cause of Venus flytrap death is prodding the traps to watch them close and feeding them inappropriate items.\n\nMost carnivorous plants require bright light, and most will look better under such conditions, as this encourages them to synthesise red and purple [[anthocyanin]] pigments. ''Nepenthes'' and ''Pinguicula'' will do better out of full sun, but most other species are happy in direct sunlight.\n\nCarnivores mostly live in bogs, and those that do not are generally tropical. Hence, most require high humidity. On a small scale, this can be achieved by placing the plant in a wide saucer containing pebbles that are kept permanently wet. Small ''Nepenthes'' species grow well in large [[terrarium|terraria]].\n\nMany carnivores are native to cold temperate regions and can be grown outside in a bog garden year-round. Most ''Sarracenia'' can tolerate temperatures well below freezing, despite most species being native to the southeastern United States. Species of ''Drosera'' and ''Pinguicula'' also tolerate subfreezing temperatures. ''Nepenthes'' species, which are tropical, require temperatures from 20 to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to thrive.\n\n[[File:2005-12-18 N rajah 034.jpg|thumb|upright|Cultivated ''[[Nepenthes rajah]]'' and a few other species.]]\n\nCarnivorous plants require appropriate nutrient-poor soil. Most appreciate a 3:1 mixture of ''[[Sphagnum]]'' peat to sharp horticultural sand ([[coir]] is an acceptable, and more ecofriendly substitute for peat). ''Nepenthes'' will grow in orchid compost or in pure ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss.\n\nCarnivorous plants are themselves susceptible to infestation by parasites such as [[aphids]] or [[mealybug]]s. Although small infestations can be removed by hand, larger infestations necessitate use of an [[insecticide]].\n\n[[Isopropyl alcohol]] (rubbing alcohol) is effective as a topical insecticide, particularly on [[scale insect]]s. [[Diazinon]] is an excellent systemic insecticide that is tolerated by most carnivorous plants. [[Malathion]] and [[Acephate]] ([[Orthene]]) have also been reported as tolerable by carnivorous plants.\n\nAlthough insects can be a problem, by far the biggest killer of carnivorous plants (besides human maltreatment) is [[Botrytis cinerea|grey mold]] (''Botrytis cinerea''). This thrives under warm, humid conditions and can be a real problem in winter. To some extent, temperate carnivorous plants can be protected from this pathogen by ensuring that they are kept cool and well ventilated in winter and that any dead leaves are removed promptly. If this fails, a [[fungicide]] is in order.\n\nThe easiest carnivorous plants for beginners are those from the cool temperate zone. These plants will do well under cool greenhouse conditions (minimum 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter, maximum 25&nbsp;\u00b0C in summer) if kept in wide trays of acidified or rain water during summer and kept moist during winter:\n* ''[[Drosera capensis]]'', the Cape sundew: attractive strap-leaved sundew, pink flowers, very tolerant of maltreatment.\n* ''[[Drosera binata]]'', the fork-leaved sundew: large, ''Y''-shaped leaves.\n* ''[[Sarracenia flava]]'', the yellow trumpet pitcher: yellow, attractively veined leaves, yellow flowers in spring.\n* ''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', the common butterwort: purple flowers in spring, hibernates as a bud ([[hibernaculum (botany)|hibernaculum]]) in winter. Fully hardy.\n* ''[[Pinguicula moranensis]]'', the Mexican butterwort: pink flowers, non-carnivorous leaves in winter.\n\nVenus flytraps will do well under these conditions but are actually rather difficult to grow: even if treated well, they will often succumb to grey mold in winter unless well ventilated. Some of the lowland ''Nepenthes'' are very easy to grow as long as they are provided with relatively constant, hot and humid conditions.\n\n==Medicinal uses==\nA study published in 2009 by researchers from [[Tel Aviv University]] indicates that secretions produced by carnivorous plants contain compounds that have anti-fungal properties and may lead to the development of a new class of [[anti-fungal drug]]s that will be effective against [[Mycosis|infections]] that are resistant to current anti-fungal drugs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eilenberg |first=Haviva |first2=Smadar |last2=Pnini-Cohen |first3=Yocheved |last3=Rahamim |first4=Edward |last4=Sionov |first5=Esther |last5=Segal |first6=Shmuel |last6=Carmeli |first7=Aviah |last7=Zilberstein |date= December 2009 |title=Induced production of antifungal naphthoquinones in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant ''Nepenthes khasiana''|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=61|issue=3|pages=911\u2013922|doi=10.1093/jxb/erp359 |url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/61/3/911|accessdate=2010-04-22|pmid=20018905|pmc=2814117}}</ref><ref name=I21C>{{cite web|url=https://www.israel21c.org/carnivorous-plants-may-save-people/ |title= Carnivorous plants may save people | date=April 11, 2010 |publisher=[Israel 21c Innovation News Service] |accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

Buel, 1887|198x198px]]Carnivorous plants have long been the subject of popular interest and exposition, much of it highly inaccurate. Fictional plants have been featured in a number of books, movies, television series, and video games. Typically, these fictional depictions include exaggerated characteristics, such as enormous size or possession of abilities beyond the realm of reality, and can be viewed as a kind of [[artistic license]]. Two of the most famous examples of fictional carnivorous plants in popular culture are the 1960s [[black comedy]] ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and the [[triffid]]s of [[John Wyndham (writer)|John Wyndham]]'s ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]''. Other movies, such as ''[[The Hellstrom Chronicle]]'' (1971), and television series utilize accurate depictions of carnivorous plants for cinematic purposes.\n\nThe earliest known depiction of carnivorous plants in popular culture was a case wherein a large [[man-eating tree]] was reported to have consumed a young woman in [[Madagascar]] in 1878. The ''[[South Australian Register]]'' carried the story in 1881. It was accompanied by an illustration of the tree consuming the woman, said to be a member from the \"little known but cruel tribe\" called the Mkodos. The story was attributed to a Dr. Carl Liche who supposedly witnessed the event.
