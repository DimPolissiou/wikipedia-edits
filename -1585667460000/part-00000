It originally opened in July 2001. The park and the 536 acres it resides on is now owned by the City of Gilroy. Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park (a 501(c)(3) corporation) operates the park, which is managed by Cedar Fair.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Circus Tree at Gilroy Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|One of the famous Circus Trees at Gilroy Gardens<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitcalifornia.com/now/hidden-gems-circus-trees-gilroy-gardens|title=Hidden Gems: Circus Trees of Gilroy Gardens|date=2018-03-30|website=California Now|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>]]\n\nThe park was founded by Michael and Claudia Bonfante after selling their [[Raley's Supermarkets|Nob Hill Foods]] supermarket chain to build the park. The park was constructed gradually over a period of 25 years. Before it became an amusement park open to the public, it was known as Tree Haven, and was a commercial [[plant nursery]], as well as a recreational facility for employees of Nob Hill Foods. The park opened to the public in June 2001 as Bonfante Gardens. The name was changed to Gilroy Gardens in February 2007.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/02-26-2007/0004534697&EDATE Bonfante Gardens to Be Renamed Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park] (Feb. 26. 2007), prnewswire.com</ref>  The park features 19 rides, 27 attractions and six gardens.

It closed early for its first two seasons and the park's management debated whether to open the park at all for the third season.

It originally opened in July 2001. The park and the 536 acres it resides on is now owned by the City of Gilroy. Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park (a 501(c)(3) corporation) operates the park, which is managed by Cedar Fair.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Circus Tree at Gilroy Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|One of the famous Circus Trees at Gilroy Gardens<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitcalifornia.com/now/hidden-gems-circus-trees-gilroy-gardens|title=Hidden Gems: Circus Trees of Gilroy Gardens|date=2018-03-30|website=California Now|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>]]\n\nThe park was founded by Michael and Claudia Bonfante after selling their [[Raley's Supermarkets|Nob Hill Foods]] supermarket chain to build the park. The park was constructed gradually over a period of 25 years. Before it became an amusement park open to the public, it was known as Tree Haven, and was a commercial [[plant nursery]], as well as a recreational facility for employees of Nob Hill Foods. The park opened to the public in June 2001 as Bonfante Gardens. The name was changed to Gilroy Gardens in February 2007.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/02-26-2007/0004534697&EDATE Bonfante Gardens to Be Renamed Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park] (Feb. 26. 2007), prnewswire.com</ref>  The park features 19 rides, 27 attractions and six gardens. The most well known garden features 24 Circus Trees that were grown and shaped with multiple trunks, basket-weave patterns, and hearts by the late [[Axel Erlandson]].<ref>[http://www.iaapa.org/news/newsroom/news-articles/landscaping---february-2015 \"Landscaping \u2013 February 2015\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226201350/http://www.iaapa.org/news/newsroom/news-articles/landscaping---february-2015 |date=December 26, 2015 }} (Feb 2015), iaapa.org</ref>\n\nStarting in 2004, the park began its annual holiday celebration, Gilroy Gardens Holiday Lights.\n\nThe park struggled with financial difficulty and low attendance during the first two years of operation. It closed early for its first two seasons and the park's management debated whether to open the park at all for the third season.

The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks.

During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name). At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] \u2013 a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents.

The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at [[WrestleMania VIII]].<ref name=legacy /> He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by [[Harvey Wippleman]] throughout 1992 and 1993, such as [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] and [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Giant Gonz\u00e1lez]].

In this then-new form, he took on a Gothic, brash and [[Rebellion|rebelling]] persona (perhaps to better fit in with the then-budding, more adult-oriented Attitude Era). In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family.

The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary. In September 1999, on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against [[Triple H]].

After signing for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1989, he enjoyed a brief stint as a mid-card performer named \"Mean Mark\" Callous, before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990.\n\nIn the WWF, Calaway was rebranded as \"The Undertaker\" and gained significant mainstream popularity as a [[Horror film|horror]]-themed, [[macabre]] entity who employed [[Fear mongering|scare tactics]] and held links to the [[supernatural]]. The Undertaker became one of the most prominent figures of the [[Attitude Era]], featuring in various pivotal storylines and matches as WWF sustained a boom period in business in the late 1990s. His character transitioned into a biker in the early 2000s, before returning to a refined version of his previous gimmick in 2004. The Undertaker is known for [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Streak]], a series of 21 straight victories at WWE's flagship annual event, [[WrestleMania]].\n\nCalaway has held 17 [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]].

The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks.

At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] \u2013 a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents.

The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]], defeating [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]] in a singles match.<ref name=PWInsiderTakervs.Hakushi>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=22474&p=1|title=PWInsider.com \u2014 Undertaker in Japan|accessdate=March 19, 2013|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lcw1_michinoku-pro-undertaker-vs-hakushi_sport#.UUipFBzry5c|title=Michinoku Pro: Undertaker vs. Hakushi|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Undertaker standing 1997.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Undertaker in September 1997]]\nConcurrent to the deep, dark secret storyline directed by Bearer, Undertaker began a new rivalry at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] when [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Shawn Michaels]] accidentally hit The Undertaker with a steel chair shot meant for Bret Hart, costing Undertaker the WWF Championship.<ref name=pwi98 /> After a double count-out draw during [[Ground Zero: In Your House]], Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell match]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]]. During this match, The Undertaker's storyline half-brother Kane finally made his debut under the control of Paul Bearer, ripping off the door to the cell and giving The Undertaker a ''Tombstone Piledriver'', Undertaker's trademark finisher, allowing Michaels to pin him.<ref name=pwi98 /> As the storyline progressed through Bearer, Kane challenged The Undertaker, but Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half-brother. The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary. In September 1999, on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against [[Triple H]].

Nouri operated primarily as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], but could also be deployed as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].\n\nA youth product of [[Eredivisie]] club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], he played two years of senior football with [[Jong Ajax|its reserve team]] and the first team. He also represented the Netherlands at various youth levels.\n\nIn July 2017, at age 20, during a pre-season friendly match, Nouri collapsed and suffered a [[cardiac arrhythmia]] attack, which left him with severe and permanent brain damage and unable to continue as a footballer.\n\n==Early life==\nNouri was born in [[Amsterdam]], and is of Moroccan descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2194100-laatste-interview-appie-nouri-vanavond-op-tv.html|title=Laatste interview 'Appie' Nouri vanavond op tv|publisher=}}</ref> He made his name as a footballer largely in his youth, attracting attention from multiple publications as a future star. He was named as one of the best 40 youth players by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2014, before he made his professional debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/14/next-generation-2014-40-of-the-best-young-talents-in-world-football|title=Next Generation 2014: 40 of the best young talents in world football|first1=Guardian|last1=sport|first2=Garry|last2=Blight|first3=Garry|last3=Blight|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nNouri was a youth exponent from the academy at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], and made his professional debut for the reserve side, [[Jong Ajax]], on 13 March 2015, in an [[Eerste Divisie]] game against [[VVV Venlo]], replacing [[Danny Bakker (footballer, born 25 January 1995)|Danny Bakker]] after 78 minutes in a 1\u20130 loss.<ref name=\"soccerway2\">{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/03/13/netherlands/eerste-divisie/vvv-venlo/jong-ajax/1691669/|title=VVV Venlo vs. Jong Ajax - 13 March 2015 - Soccerway|publisher=soccerway.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2016, Nouri made his official first-team debut in a [[KNVB Cup]] match against [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]], and scored a goal. His exploits throughout the season for Jong Ajax saw him being gifted the Player of the Season award for the [[2016\u201317 Eerste Divisie|2016\u201317 season]], as well as promotion to the first team for the 2017\u201318 season.<ref name=Award>{{Twitter|864515876544008196|AFC Ajax}}</ref>\n\n===Collapse===\nOn 8 July 2017, Nouri collapsed during a friendly match against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], due to [[cardiac arrhythmia]].

Although it has an official North Carolina address, the park is located along the North Carolina-South Carolina state line, with a portion of the park also located in [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]]. The park opened on March 31, 1973, at a cost of $70 million. This was the result of a four-year planning period spearheaded by Charlotte businessman Earl Patterson Hall, who was inspired to build the park by a 1956 trip to [[Disneyland]] and a dream of bringing the two states closer together. Owned and operated by [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]], Carowinds also features a 27-acre (81,000 m<sup>2</sup>) [[water park]], [[Carolina Harbor]], which is included with park admission. The park has a Halloween event called SCarowinds and a winter event called WinterFest.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carowindsoldlogo1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original Carowinds logo, used from 1973 to 1992.]]\n[[File:Carowinds logo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carowinds logo used from 2001 to 2006]]\n[[File:Carowinds Logo.svg|thumb|Current Carowinds logo]]\n\nThe Carowinds theme park was originally envisioned as a component of a large resort which would include hotels, a shopping center, a golf course, and an [[National Football League|NFL]] stadium. However, attendance at Carowinds was curtailed by the [[1973 oil crisis]], and plans for the proposed resort were put on hold. Hall and the other stockholders of the Carowinds Corporation continued to operate the theme park through 1974, though sagging attendance and mounting debt forced the company to sell to [[Taft Broadcasting]] in early 1975. Ownership had transferred from Family Leisure Centers&nbsp;\u2013 a joint venture between Taft and Top Value Enterprises)&nbsp;\u2013 to [[Kings Entertainment Company]], which in turn was acquired by Paramount. The park was purchased by [[Paramount Pictures#1989-94 Paramount Communications|Paramount Communications]] in 1993 and joined the [[Paramount Parks]] family. The park was renamed Paramount's Carowinds in 1993 and later became an asset of [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] following its acquisition of Paramount in 1994.\n\nThe name \"Carowinds\" was obtained from the park's original theme of the history and culture of the [[Carolinas]], and is a [[portmanteau]] of \"Carolina\" and \"winds\", in reference to the winds that blow across the two states. Carowinds operates seasonally from late March through December, after the park's [[Halloween]] event, \"SCarowinds\", and the park's Christmas event, \"WinterFest.\"\n\n===Sale to Cedar Fair===\nOn January 27, 2006, the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' reported that [[CBS Corporation]] (which split from [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] at the end of 2005) would be selling Paramount's Carowinds and other parks in its Paramount Parks division.\n\nOn June 30, 2006, [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]] acquired Paramount Parks, including Carowinds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/press_releases/index.cfm?current_root=15&mode=story&story_id=77 |title=Press Releases :: Cedar Fair Entertainment Company |publisher=Cedarfair.com |accessdate=2011-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728185503/http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/press_releases/index.cfm?current_root=15&mode=story&story_id=77 |archivedate=2006-07-28 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Cedar Fair continued to use the Paramount's Carowinds name through the remainder of the 2006 season, it began to phase out the Paramount name in press releases, the park website, and on signage within the park. In January 2007, a new logo featuring the Cedar Fair icon but lacking the \"Paramount\" name, was revealed on the park website. The new logo featured the trademark Cedar Fair flags, flying on the letter \"I\" on the Carowinds name. The other four Paramount-branded parks that Cedar Fair acquired all received similar changes. The \"Paramount\" name was dropped from all of the parks after the 2006 season.\n\n===Cedar Fair era===\n[[File:Carowinds entrance sign and state flags.jpeg|thumb|right|Entrance to Carowinds]]\nOn August 26, 2013, Cedar Fair announced a $50-million investment plan to expand Carowinds over three years starting in 2014.<ref name=\"Carowinds plans $50 million expansion\">{{cite news|last=Frazier|first=Eric|title=Carowinds plans $50 million expansion|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/08/26/4265581/carowinds-plans-50-million-expansion.html#.UjoQZ8u9KK0|accessdate=September 18, 2013|newspaper=[[Charlotte Observer]]|date=August 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827040507/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/08/26/4265581/carowinds-plans-50-million-expansion.html#.UjoQZ8u9KK0|archive-date=August 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The expansion includes a $30-million roller coaster, a $2.5-million water slide, a $7-million food complex, and $4 million to improve the park's ticket booths and front areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/09/18/4323933/new-carowinds-ride-to-be-70-feet.html#.UkkTHBDxT92 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330055224/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/09/18/4323933/new-carowinds-ride-to-be-70-feet.html |archivedate=March 30, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn August 21, 2014 Carowinds announced the addition of [[Fury 325]] for the 2015 season.

Blue Ridge Junction was constructed in the area formerly occupied by Whitewater Falls, Sand Dune Lagoon and [[Thunder Road (roller coaster)|Thunder Road]]'s former station. Also included in the investment is the 130-room SpringHill Suites by Marriott, Carowinds' first on-site hotel, and Blue Ridge Country Kitchen, a new dining experience.\n\nIn 2019, Carowinds announced Boogie Board Racer, the longest mat racing slide in the Southeast would open in Carolina Harbor in 2020.<ref>https://www.carowinds.com/play/rides/boogie-board-racer</ref> The retirement of the Rip Roarin' Rapids ride was also announced, along with the closure of the Dinosaurs Alive! attraction.\n\n==Themed areas and attractions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!

Although it has an official North Carolina address, the park is located along the North Carolina-South Carolina state line, with a portion of the park also located in [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]]. The park opened on March 31, 1973, at a cost of $70 million. This was the result of a four-year planning period spearheaded by Charlotte businessman Earl Patterson Hall, who was inspired to build the park by a 1956 trip to [[Disneyland]] and a dream of bringing the two states closer together. Owned and operated by [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]], Carowinds also features a 27-acre (81,000 m<sup>2</sup>) [[water park]], [[Carolina Harbor]], which is included with park admission. The park has a Halloween event called SCarowinds and a winter event called WinterFest.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carowindsoldlogo1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original Carowinds logo, used from 1973 to 1992.]]\n[[File:Carowinds logo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carowinds logo used from 2001 to 2006]]\n[[File:Carowinds Logo.svg|thumb|Current Carowinds logo]]\n\nThe Carowinds theme park was originally envisioned as a component of a large resort which would include hotels, a shopping center, a golf course, and an [[National Football League|NFL]] stadium. However, attendance at Carowinds was curtailed by the [[1973 oil crisis]], and plans for the proposed resort were put on hold. Hall and the other stockholders of the Carowinds Corporation continued to operate the theme park through 1974, though sagging attendance and mounting debt forced the company to sell to [[Taft Broadcasting]] in early 1975. Ownership had transferred from Family Leisure Centers&nbsp;\u2013 a joint venture between Taft and Top Value Enterprises)&nbsp;\u2013 to [[Kings Entertainment Company]], which in turn was acquired by Paramount. The park was purchased by [[Paramount Pictures#1989-94 Paramount Communications|Paramount Communications]] in 1993 and joined the [[Paramount Parks]] family. The park was renamed Paramount's Carowinds in 1993 and later became an asset of [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] following its acquisition of Paramount in 1994.\n\nThe name \"Carowinds\" was obtained from the park's original theme of the history and culture of the [[Carolinas]], and is a [[portmanteau]] of \"Carolina\" and \"winds\", in reference to the winds that blow across the two states. Carowinds operates seasonally from late March through December, after the park's [[Halloween]] event, \"SCarowinds\", and the park's Christmas event, \"WinterFest.\"\n\n===Sale to Cedar Fair===\nOn January 27, 2006, the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' reported that [[CBS Corporation]] (which split from [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] at the end of 2005) would be selling Paramount's Carowinds and other parks in its Paramount Parks division.\n\nOn June 30, 2006, [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]] acquired Paramount Parks, including Carowinds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/press_releases/index.cfm?current_root=15&mode=story&story_id=77 |title=Press Releases :: Cedar Fair Entertainment Company |publisher=Cedarfair.com |accessdate=2011-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728185503/http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/press_releases/index.cfm?current_root=15&mode=story&story_id=77 |archivedate=2006-07-28 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Cedar Fair continued to use the Paramount's Carowinds name through the remainder of the 2006 season, it began to phase out the Paramount name in press releases, the park website, and on signage within the park. In January 2007, a new logo featuring the Cedar Fair icon but lacking the \"Paramount\" name, was revealed on the park website. The new logo featured the trademark Cedar Fair flags, flying on the letter \"I\" on the Carowinds name. The other four Paramount-branded parks that Cedar Fair acquired all received similar changes. The \"Paramount\" name was dropped from all of the parks after the 2006 season.\n\n===Cedar Fair era===\n[[File:Carowinds entrance sign and state flags.jpeg|thumb|right|Entrance to Carowinds]]\nOn August 26, 2013, Cedar Fair announced a $50-million investment plan to expand Carowinds over three years starting in 2014.<ref name=\"Carowinds plans $50 million expansion\">{{cite news|last=Frazier|first=Eric|title=Carowinds plans $50 million expansion|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/08/26/4265581/carowinds-plans-50-million-expansion.html#.UjoQZ8u9KK0|accessdate=September 18, 2013|newspaper=[[Charlotte Observer]]|date=August 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827040507/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/08/26/4265581/carowinds-plans-50-million-expansion.html#.UjoQZ8u9KK0|archive-date=August 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The expansion includes a $30-million roller coaster, a $2.5-million water slide, a $7-million food complex, and $4 million to improve the park's ticket booths and front areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/09/18/4323933/new-carowinds-ride-to-be-70-feet.html#.UkkTHBDxT92 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330055224/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/09/18/4323933/new-carowinds-ride-to-be-70-feet.html |archivedate=March 30, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn August 21, 2014 Carowinds announced the addition of [[Fury 325]] for the 2015 season.
