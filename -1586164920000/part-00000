First published in Calcutta in 1821 then revised and expanded in two volumes for publication in London in 1823.</ref> This appears to be the [[R\u0101\u00fcla vela of Ro\u1e0da]], a unique poetic work in the earliest forms of Hindi.

K. Lele was a tablet with a series of verses in [[Prakrit]] praising the [[Kurma|K\u016brma]] or Tortoise incarnation of the god [[Vishnu|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u]]. The ''K\u016brma\u015bataka'' is attributed to king [[Bhoja]] but the palaeography of the record itself suggests that this copy was engraved in the twelfth or thirteenth century. The text was published by Richard Pischel in 1905-06, with a new version and translation appearing in 2003 by V. M. Kularni.<ref>R. Pischel, ''Epigraphia Indica'' 8 (1905-06); V. M.

Lele is part of a drama called ''Vijaya\u015br\u012bn\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101'' composed by Madana. The preceptor of king [[Arjunavarman]], Madana bore the title 'B\u0101lasarasvat\u012b'.<ref>S. K.

These records prompted K. K. Lele to describe the building as the Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 or Hall of Bhoja because king Bhoja was the author of a number of works on poetics and grammar, among them the ''Sarasvat\u012bka\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101bhara\u1e47a'' or 'Necklace of Sarasvat\u012b'.<ref>R.

The Central India State Gazetteer Series, vol. 5 (Bombay, 1908): part A, pp. 494-500.</ref> That the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 is due to Lele is shown by the writing of William Kincaid, in his \"Rambles among Ruins in Central India,\" published in the ''Indian Antiquary,'' in 1888. This makes no mention of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101, noting only the ''Akl ka kua'' or \"Well of Wisdom\" in front of the tomb of Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn. Kincaid was a cynical observer but in any case the absence of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 in his text indicates was \"no living tradition about the Bhoj\u0101l\u0101 in the middle decades of the nineteenth century\" among those with whom he interacted.<ref name=willis136>{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dh\u0101r, Bhoja and Sarasvat\u012b: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=1 | year=2012 | pages=136\u2013138 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}</ref>\n\n==Sarasvat\u012b==\n[[File:Goddess Ambika from Dhar.JPG|thumb|Goddess Ambik\u0101 from Dh\u0101r, whose inscription mentions V\u0101gdev\u012b.

Lele is part of a drama called ''Vijaya\u015br\u012bn\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101'' composed by Madana. The preceptor of king [[Arjunavarman]], Madana bore the title 'B\u0101lasarasvat\u012b'.<ref>S. K.

These records prompted K. K. Lele to describe the building as the Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 or Hall of Bhoja because king Bhoja was the author of a number of works on poetics and grammar, among them the ''Sarasvat\u012bka\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101bhara\u1e47a'' or 'Necklace of Sarasvat\u012b'.<ref>R.

The Central India State Gazetteer Series, vol. 5 (Bombay, 1908): part A, pp. 494-500.</ref> That the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 is due to Lele is shown by the writing of William Kincaid, in his \"Rambles among Ruins in Central India,\" published in the ''Indian Antiquary,'' in 1888. This makes no mention of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101, noting only the ''Akl ka kua'' or \"Well of Wisdom\" in front of the tomb of Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn. Kincaid was a cynical observer but in any case the absence of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 in his text indicates was \"no living tradition about the Bhoj\u0101l\u0101 in the middle decades of the nineteenth century\" among those with whom he interacted.<ref name=willis136>{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dh\u0101r, Bhoja and Sarasvat\u012b: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=1 | year=2012 | pages=136\u2013138 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}</ref>\n\n==Sarasvat\u012b==\n[[File:Goddess Ambika from Dhar.JPG|thumb|Goddess Ambik\u0101 from Dh\u0101r, whose inscription mentions V\u0101gdev\u012b.

The nearest airport is at [[Bagdogra]] and the nearest major railway station is [[New Jalpaiguri railway station|New Jalpaiguri]], which is about {{convert|45|km}} from the town. The economy is based primarily on education and tourism.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name is unclear; stories suggest it comes from the [[Lepcha language]] word for \"small orchid\", ''kurson-rip'' because of the little white orchids (''[[Coelogyne cristata]]'') dotting the valleys, or perhaps the term for a stick made out of a local [[Cane (grass)|cane]].{{harv|O'Malley|1999|p=216}}\n\n== History ==\nThe original inhabitants were the [[Lepcha people]], who named their home \"Kurseong\", because every spring it was alive and bright with Kurson-Rip orchids.kurseong is also known as the land of white orchids. In the remote past, Kurseong was a part of the Kingdom of [[Sikkim]], even before the British came to India. However, in around 1780 the [[Nepal]]ese conquered and annexed Kurseong and its surrounding areas. Then came the [[Anglo-Nepalese War|Gurkha War]], which the Nepalese lost. The 1817 [[Treaty of Titalia]] restored Kurseong to Sikkim.<ref>Kurseong Municipality, [http://kurseongmunicipality.org/history.php \"History\"] [of Kurseong].  Retrieved 2 February 2013</ref>\n\nWith its mountains providing a cool and dry environment in the summer, Kurseong was a favourite of the [[British Raj|British]]. Nevertheless, they found travelling there from the plains of Bengal difficult, even on warm sunny days because of the mountains. Although a road was built from Kurseong to Darjeeling from [[Titalia]] in the 1770s and 1780s, its irregular maintenance soon made the new route, the ''Military Road'', almost useless. The next route, Hill Cart Road (now Tenzing Norgay Road), opened in 1861 and fared better.\n\nNevertheless, in 1835 the British decided that Darjeeling would make an excellent [[sanitorium]] and summer residence for their military and civilian officers along with their families. Negotiations with the [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim, [[Tshudpud Namgyal]], provided them a strip of hill territory in Kurseong for an annual fee. As one of the hill stations on the road to Darjeeling, Kurseong began to develop.\n\nKurseong is home to one of the oldest municipalities in the state of West Bengal. Established as an independent Municipality in 1879, it did not become a Sub-Division until 1890, when the District of Darjeeling was formed. Kurseong and the District were added to the [[Rajshahi Division]] (now West Central [[Bangladesh]]) by the [[British Raj]] for the [[Bengal Presidency]]. In 1908, they were transferred to the Bhagalpur Division in the same Presidency.\n\nBefore Independence from the British, there were 12 ward commissioners. Four of them were appointed by the [[British Raj]] and it also appointed its own man, the Sub-Divisional Officer (S.D.O.), as their chairman. In 1939, when Bengal became a province of British India, Kurseong was allowed to elect its own member to be the chairman, but the Raj continued to send ward commissioners until India gained independence. Nevertheless, between 1939 and 1942, Kurseong grew rapidly. As of today Kurseong has 20 commissioners.{{when|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{OSM Location map\n| width=370| height=320| zoom=10\n| coord={{coord|26|54|0|N|88|17|0|E}}|

The specialty of this temple is that there are two idols of The Lord and both are of Lord Jagannath (Krishna).  In other temples of Lord Jagannath there are three idols - Lord Krishna, Lord Balram and Devi Subhadra (Sister of Lord Krishna and Lord Balram).  But in Jagdish Mandir - Kurseong both the idols are of The Lord.\n* St. Pauls Church on Hill Cart Road, near St. Joseph's School.\n* Buddhist Gompa (monastery) in Monteviot.\n* Kunsang Choiling Monastery at Upper Naya Busty.\n* Juma Mosque in Hat Bazaar.\n* Grotto and Catholic church in St. Mary's Hill.\n* Sath Kaniya Devi Mandir at Uzari Busty Ward No 19 P B Road\n\n===Natural sites===\n* Eagle's Craig.\n* Rock garden .  the tip of the beautiful valley, where we can see the natural gift of nature and landscape.\n* Deer Park - now known as Dowhill Park, on the Dowhill Road. \n* The Kholas (Water Falls - Springs) like Whistle Khola (named by the British, as there is a bend and the toy train whistles when passing through it).

The nearest airport is at [[Bagdogra]] and the nearest major railway station is [[New Jalpaiguri railway station|New Jalpaiguri]], which is about {{convert|45|km}} from the town. The economy is based primarily on education and tourism.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name is unclear; stories suggest it comes from the [[Lepcha language]] word for \"small orchid\", ''kurson-rip'' because of the little white orchids (''[[Coelogyne cristata]]'') dotting the valleys, or perhaps the term for a stick made out of a local [[Cane (grass)|cane]].{{harv|O'Malley|1999|p=216}}\n\n== History ==\nThe original inhabitants were the [[Lepcha people]], who named their home \"Kurseong\", because every spring it was alive and bright with Kurson-Rip orchids. In the remote past, Kurseong was a part of the Kingdom of [[Sikkim]], even before the British came to India. However, in around 1780 the [[Nepal]]ese conquered and annexed Kurseong and its surrounding areas. Then came the [[Anglo-Nepalese War|Gurkha War]], which the Nepalese lost. The 1817 [[Treaty of Titalia]] restored Kurseong to Sikkim.<ref>Kurseong Municipality, [http://kurseongmunicipality.org/history.php \"History\"] [of Kurseong].  Retrieved 2 February 2013</ref>\n\nWith its mountains providing a cool and dry environment in the summer, Kurseong was a favourite of the [[British Raj|British]]. Nevertheless, they found travelling there from the plains of Bengal difficult, even on warm sunny days because of the mountains. Although a road was built from Kurseong to Darjeeling from [[Titalia]] in the 1770s and 1780s, its irregular maintenance soon made the new route, the ''Military Road'', almost useless. The next route, Hill Cart Road (now Tenzing Norgay Road), opened in 1861 and fared better.\n\nNevertheless, in 1835 the British decided that Darjeeling would make an excellent [[sanitorium]] and summer residence for their military and civilian officers along with their families. Negotiations with the [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim, [[Tshudpud Namgyal]], provided them a strip of hill territory in Kurseong for an annual fee. As one of the hill stations on the road to Darjeeling, Kurseong began to develop.\n\nKurseong is home to one of the oldest municipalities in the state of West Bengal. Established as an independent Municipality in 1879, it did not become a Sub-Division until 1890, when the District of Darjeeling was formed. Kurseong and the District were added to the [[Rajshahi Division]] (now West Central [[Bangladesh]]) by the [[British Raj]] for the [[Bengal Presidency]]. In 1908, they were transferred to the Bhagalpur Division in the same Presidency.\n\nBefore Independence from the British, there were 12 ward commissioners. Four of them were appointed by the [[British Raj]] and it also appointed its own man, the Sub-Divisional Officer (S.D.O.), as their chairman. In 1939, when Bengal became a province of British India, Kurseong was allowed to elect its own member to be the chairman, but the Raj continued to send ward commissioners until India gained independence. Nevertheless, between 1939 and 1942, Kurseong grew rapidly. As of today Kurseong has 20 commissioners.{{when|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{OSM Location map\n| width=370| height=320| zoom=10\n| coord={{coord|26|54|0|N|88|17|0|E}}|

The specialty of this temple is that there are two idols of The Lord and both are of Lord Jagannath (Krishna).  In other temples of Lord Jagannath there are three idols - Lord Krishna, Lord Balram and Devi Subhadra (Sister of Lord Krishna and Lord Balram).  But in Jagdish Mandir - Kurseong both the idols are of The Lord.\n* St. Pauls Church on Hill Cart Road, near St. Joseph's School.\n* Buddhist Gompa (monastery) in Monteviot.\n* Kunsang Choiling Monastery at Upper Naya Busty.\n* Juma Mosque in Hat Bazaar.\n* Grotto and Catholic church in St. Mary's Hill.\n* Sath Kaniya Devi Mandir at Uzari Busty Ward No 19 P B Road\n\n===Natural sites===\n* Eagle's Craig.\n* Rock garden .  the tip of the beautiful valley, where we can see the natural gift of nature and landscape.\n* Deer Park - now known as Dowhill Park, on the Dowhill Road. \n* The Kholas (Water Falls - Springs) like Whistle Khola (named by the British, as there is a bend and the toy train whistles when passing through it).

Since 2007, the GJMM has been campaigning for the creation of a separate state for the [[Indian Gorkha]]s, the original goal of the GNLF. Because of the no-confidence vote, Mr. Agarwal was forced to resign and the Municipal Committee was suspended.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130216145717/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=554722 \"GNLF loses control over Kursong civic board\"], ''OutlookIndia.com'', 18 March 2008.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

Nevertheless, although Finland was considered neutral, the [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948]] significantly limited the freedom of operation in Finnish foreign policy. It required Finland to defend the Soviet Union from attacks through its territory, which in practice prevented Finland from joining [[NATO]] and effectively gave the Soviet Union a veto in Finnish foreign policy.
