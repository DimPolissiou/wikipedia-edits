For infections to occur, the virus has to hijack host factors and evade the host immune response for safe replication. Viral replication frequently requires complex interactions between the virus and host factors that may result in deleterious effects in the host, which confers the virus its pathogenicity. \n\n===Important steps of a virus life cycle that shape pathogenesis:===\n{{see also|Viral life cycle}}\n[[File:Typical sites of virus entry into the body.png|thumb|300px|right|Typical sites of virus entry into the body: The first steps of viral infection is determined by the site at which the virus implants into the body.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues. Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry. Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"patho\" />\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\":0\" /> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\":0\" />, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Molecular Virology (Sixth Edition) |last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication.

Viruses often induce direct cytopathic effects to disrupt cellular functions. This could be through releasing toxic proteins or enzymes to degrade host metabolic precursors, or inhibiting the synthesis of important host factors, proteins, DNA and/or RNA. Namely, viral proteins of herpes simplex virus can degrade host DNA and inhibit host cell DNA replication and mRNA transcription. Poliovirus can inactivate proteins involved in host mRNA translation without affecting poliovirus mRNA translation.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\">{{Cite book|title=Fenner's Veterinary Virology|last=MacLachlan|first=James|last2=Dubovi|first2=Edward|date=2011|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9780123751584|edition=4th}}</ref> In some cases, expression of viral fusion proteins on the surface of the host cells can cause host cell fusion to form multinucleated cells.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites. \n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry. Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"patho\" />\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\":0\" /> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\":0\" />, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Molecular Virology (Sixth Edition) |last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication. An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n[[File:Damage caused by viruses to host cells.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Diagram representing the various ways viral infections can induce damage and disease to host cells|Mechanisms by which viruses cause damage and disease to host cells]]\n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\n\nOnce inside host cells, viruses can destroy cells through a variety of mechanisms. Viruses often induce direct cytopathic effects to disrupt cellular functions. This could be through releasing toxic proteins or enzymes to degrade host metabolic precursors, or inhibiting the synthesis of important host factors, proteins, DNA and/or RNA. Namely, viral proteins of herpes simplex virus can degrade host DNA and inhibit host cell DNA replication and mRNA transcription. Poliovirus can inactivate proteins involved in host mRNA translation without affecting poliovirus mRNA translation.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\">{{Cite book|title=Fenner's Veterinary Virology|last=MacLachlan|first=James|last2=Dubovi|first2=Edward|date=2011|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9780123751584|edition=4th}}</ref> In some cases, expression of viral fusion proteins on the surface of the host cells can cause host cell fusion to form multinucleated cells.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" />\n\n===Damage caused by host immune system===\nSometimes, instead of cell death or cellular dysfunction caused by the virus, the host immune response can mediate disease and excessive [[inflammation]]. The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites. \n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

Apathy towards the Christian virtues increased, and by the 11th century some parts of Ireland had even returned to [[paganism]].\n\nGradually, as the onslaughts of the Danes became less frequent, there was a revival of learning which prepared the way for the religious reforms of the twelfth century.<ref name=Lawlor/>\n\n==History==\nIt was the second of four great reforming Irish [[synod]]s, the other three were at [[Synod of Cashel|Cashel]] (1101 and 1172), and [[Synod of Kells-Mellifont|Kells-Mellifont]] (1152). Rathbreasail is near [[Mountrath]], [[County Laois]], a suitably central place for such an important meeting, however the location of the Synod is not certain and sites in counties Armagh, Laois, Tipperary and Cork have been suggested as possible locations.  \u00d3 Murchada (1999) argues in favour of a location near the townland of Clonbrassil about 4 miles south-west of Templemore, Co. Tipperary in the present-day parish of Drom & Inch.<ref>\u00d3 Murchada (1999) \"Where was R\u00e1ith Breasail?\" in Tipperary Historical Journal</ref>\n\nIt was convened by the [[papal legate]], [[Bishop Gillebert|Gille]], [[Bishop of Limerick]].<ref>Fleming J., \"Gille of Limerick, architect of a medieval church\" Four Courts Press, Dublin 2001.</ref> Gille is not mentioned in the Irish Annals, possibly because Limerick was then a [[Norse-Gaels|Hiberno-Norse]] city. Its purpose was the Romanizing of the Irish Church, and, in particular, the establishment of diocesan episcopacy.<ref name=Lawlor>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25761/25761-h/25761-h.htm#Page_161 Lawlor, H.J., ''St. Bernard of Clairvaux's Life of St. Malachy of Armagh'', The Macmillan Company, London, 1920]</ref>\n\nThe synod was attended by no fewer than fifty bishops, three hundred priests and three thousand laymen, including King [[Muirchertach Ua Briain|Murtough O'Brien]]. There were no representatives of the provinces of Connaught and Leinster, in which the Reform movement had not yet established itself.<ref name=Lawlor/> The Synod's deliberations were prompted by the [[Gregorian Reform]] and guided by the relatively new powers of the Papacy as defined in ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' (1075\u201387) and ''[[Libertas ecclesiae]]'' (1079).\n\nThe Council established two provinces: Armagh and Cashel. Each province consisted of twelve territorial dioceses. The boundaries of the dioceses were only vaguely defined, however. The synod also made the [[Episcopal see|See]] of Waterford a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archbishop of Cashel]] having previously been a Danish city subject to [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]].\n\n== Dioceses established ==\n\nThe following 24 dioceses were established by the synod:\n* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Armagh]]\n* [[Archdiocese of Cashel|Cashel]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise|Ardagh]]: East [[Connacht]]\n* [[Ardstraw]]: territory of the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] (excluding [[Inishowen]])\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Clogher|Clogher]]: Approximating to Kingdom of [[U\u00ed Chremthainn]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Clonard|Clonard]]: West Meath \u2020\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Clonfert|Clonfert]]: Territory of the [[U\u00ed Maine]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor|Connor]]: Territory of the [[D\u00e1l nAraidi]]\n* [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]] was named as one of the five dioceses for Connacht, but no names of bishops have been recorded.\n* [[Diocese of Cork|Cork]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor|Down]]: Territory of the [[D\u00e1l Fiatach]]\n* [[Diocese of Duleek|Duleek]]: East Meath - At the [[Synod of Uisneach]], convened by the abbot of [[Clonmacnoise]] later in 1111, the See of Duleek was suppressed. West Meath assigned to a new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise|Diocese of Clonmacnoise]] and East Meath to Clonard. It appears, however, that a number of Bishops of Duleek were appointed before 1160.\n* [[Diocese of Elphin|Elphin]]: East [[Connacht]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly|Emly]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns|Ferns]] or Loch Garman (Wexford Haven)\n* [[Diocese of Glendalough|Glendalough]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin|Kildare]]\n* [[Diocese of Ossory|Kilkenny]] (subsequently renamed [[Diocese of Ossory|Ossory]]): [[Territory of Osraige]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Killala|Killala]]: Territory of the [[U\u00ed Fiachrach Muaidhe]]\n* [[Diocese of Killaloe|Killaloe]]: Territory of [[U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidhne]]\n* [[Diocese of Leighlin|Leighlin]]: One of five dioceses for Leinster\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limerick|Limerick]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe|Raphoe]]: [[T\u00edr Conaill]] and [[Inis Eogain]]\n* [[Diocese of Ardfert and Aghadoe|Ratass]]: Territories of the [[Ciarraighe]], [[Corco Duibne]] and [[E\u00f3ganacht Locha L\u00e9in]] (moved to Ardfert by 1117)\n* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Tuam]]: One of five dioceses in Connacht\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore|Diocese of Waterford]]: already in existence, but had been subject to the [[Archdiocese of Canterbury]] prior to 1111\n\nThe [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Dublin]] acknowledged the jurisdiction of Canterbury until 1096, but was not included in the list of dioceses at the synod. It was not incorporated into the system of Irish dioceses until the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gregorian Reform]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Peter Galloway, ''The Cathedrals of Ireland'', Belfast 1992\n* Geoffrey Keating.
