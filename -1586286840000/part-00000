In his book ''Peace, War, and Politics'', Anderson claimed that Mafia member Johnny Roselli gave him extensive details of the plot. Anderson said that although he was never able to independently confirm Roselli's entire story, many of Roselli's details checked out. Anderson said that Oswald may have played a role in the assassination, but that more than one gunman was involved. Johnny Roselli, as previously noted, had worked with the CIA on assassination attempts against Castro.\n\nThe [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] program ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' presented additional claims of organized crime involvement.<ref>\"The Men Who Killed Kennedy: The Definitive Account of American History's Most Controversial Mystery\".  History Channel, 1988, 1991, 1995. This information appears in part 2, \"The Forces of Darkness\" under the sections titled, \"The Contract\" and \"Foreign Assassins\".</ref> Christian David was a [[Corsican Mafia]] member interviewed in prison. He said that he was offered the assassination contract on President Kennedy, but that he did not accept it. However, he said that he knew the men who did accept the contract. According to David, there were three shooters. He provided the name of one \u2014 [[Lucien Sarti]]. David said that since the other two shooters were still alive, it would break a code of conduct for him to identify them. When asked what the shooters were wearing, David noted their ''modus operandi'' was to dress in costumes such as official uniforms. Much of Christian David's testimony was confirmed by former Corsican member Michelle Nicole, who was part of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] witness protection program.\n\nThe book ''Ultimate Sacrifice'', by [[Lamar Waldron]] and [[Thom Hartmann]], attempted to synthesize these theories with new evidence. The authors argued that government officials felt obliged to help the assassins cover up the truth because the assassination conspiracy had direct ties to American government plots to assassinate Castro. Outraged at Robert Kennedy's attack on organized crime, mob leaders had President Kennedy killed to remove Robert from power. A government investigation of the plot was thwarted, the authors allege, because it would have revealed embarrassing evidence of American government involvement with organized crime in plots to kill Castro.<ref>''Ultimate Sacrifice: John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the Murder of JFK'' (2005), by Lamar Waldron, with Thom Hartmann; Carroll & Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1441-7}}.</ref>\n\n=== Lyndon B.

In 1968, Kennedy's personal secretary [[Evelyn Lincoln]] wrote in her book, \"''Kennedy and Johnson''\" that President Kennedy had told her that Lyndon B. Johnson would be replaced as Vice President of the United States. That conversation took place on November 19, 1963, just three days before the assassination of President Kennedy and was recorded that evening in her diary and reads as follows:\n\n{{quote|As Mr. Kennedy sat in the rocker in my office, his head resting on its back he placed his left leg across his right knee. He rocked slightly as he talked. In a slow pensive voice he said to me, 'You know if I am re-elected in sixty-four, I am going to spend more and more time toward making government service an honorable career. I would like to tailor the executive and legislative branches of government so that they can keep up with the tremendous strides and progress being made in other fields.' 'I am going to advocate changing some of the outmoded rules and regulations in the Congress, such as the seniority rule. To do this I will need as a running mate in sixty-four a man who believes as I do.' Mrs. Lincoln went on to write \"I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary.

Clark]]. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper's nest likely belonged to Johnson's associate [[Malcolm \"Mac\" Wallace]], and that Mac Wallace was, therefore, on the sixth floor of the Depository at the time of the shooting. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates, including [[Clint Murchison, Sr.|Clint Murchison]] and [[H. L. Hunt]]. McClellan states that the assassination of Kennedy allowed the oil depletion allowance to be kept at 27.5 percent. It remained unchanged during the Johnson presidency. According to McClellan, this resulted in a saving of over $100 million to the [[Petroleum in the United States|American oil industry]]. McClellan's book subsequently became the subject of an episode of Nigel Turner's ongoing documentary television series, ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''. The episode, \"The Guilty Men\", drew angry condemnation from the Johnson family, Johnson's former aides, and former Presidents [[Gerald Ford]] (who was a member of the [[Warren Commission]]<ref>Ford, Gerald R.

The day of the assassination, Bush flew to [[Tyler, Texas]], to make an appearance ahead of his upcoming [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1964]], and spoke to the FBI about a local who had threatened Kennedy.  The previous day, Bush had been in Dallas to speak at an oil industry meeting.

His conclusions were: (1) that Oswald killed Kennedy due to extreme feelings of inadequacy versus his wife's professed admiration for JFK, and (2) that the KGB never sought intelligence information from Oswald during his time in the USSR as they did not trust his motivations. {{ISBN|1-55972-210-X}}.\n* [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery]]'' (1995) concludes that Oswald was guilty, but holds that the evidence may point to a second gunman on the grassy knoll, who, purely by coincidence, was attempting to kill JFK at the same time as Oswald. \"If there was indeed another shot, it was not necessarily fired by a conspirator of Oswald's.

Oswald's role was to shoot John Connally. Bruce Roberts, author of the Gemstone File papers, claimed that the JFK assassination scenario was modeled after a supposed attempted assassination of President F.D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt was riding in an open car with Mayor [[Anton Cermak]] of Chicago. Cermak was shot and killed by [[Giuseppe Zangara]].

After Ruby was jailed for killing Oswald, Campisi regularly visited him.

In his book ''Peace, War, and Politics'', Anderson claimed that Mafia member Johnny Roselli gave him extensive details of the plot. Anderson said that although he was never able to independently confirm Roselli's entire story, many of Roselli's details checked out. Anderson said that Oswald may have played a role in the assassination, but that more than one gunman was involved. Johnny Roselli, as previously noted, had worked with the CIA on assassination attempts against Castro.\n\nThe [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] program ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' presented additional claims of organized crime involvement.<ref>\"The Men Who Killed Kennedy: The Definitive Account of American History's Most Controversial Mystery\".  History Channel, 1988, 1991, 1995.

According to David, there were three shooters. He provided the name of one \u2014 [[Lucien Sarti]]. David said that since the other two shooters were still alive, it would break a code of conduct for him to identify them.

The authors argued that government officials felt obliged to help the assassins cover up the truth because the assassination conspiracy had direct ties to American government plots to assassinate Castro. Outraged at Robert Kennedy's attack on organized crime, mob leaders had President Kennedy killed to remove Robert from power. A government investigation of the plot was thwarted, the authors allege, because it would have revealed embarrassing evidence of American government involvement with organized crime in plots to kill Castro.<ref>''Ultimate Sacrifice: John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the Murder of JFK'' (2005), by Lamar Waldron, with Thom Hartmann; Carroll & Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1441-7}}.</ref>\n\n=== Lyndon B.

In 1968, Kennedy's personal secretary [[Evelyn Lincoln]] wrote in her book, \"''Kennedy and Johnson''\" that President Kennedy had told her that Lyndon B. Johnson would be replaced as Vice President of the United States. That conversation took place on November 19, 1963, just three days before the assassination of President Kennedy and was recorded that evening in her diary and reads as follows:\n\n{{quote|As Mr. Kennedy sat in the rocker in my office, his head resting on its back he placed his left leg across his right knee.

I would like to tailor the executive and legislative branches of government so that they can keep up with the tremendous strides and progress being made in other fields.' 'I am going to advocate changing some of the outmoded rules and regulations in the Congress, such as the seniority rule. To do this I will need as a running mate in sixty-four a man who believes as I do.' Mrs. Lincoln went on to write \"I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary.

Killed J.F.K.'', Hannover House 2003. {{ISBN|0-9637846-2-5}}</ref> McClellan claims that Johnson, motivated by the fear of being dropped from the Kennedy ticket in 1964 and the need to cover up various scandals, masterminded Kennedy's assassination with the help of his friend, [[Austin]] attorney [[Edward A. Clark]]. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper's nest likely belonged to Johnson's associate [[Malcolm \"Mac\" Wallace]], and that Mac Wallace was, therefore, on the sixth floor of the Depository at the time of the shooting. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates, including [[Clint Murchison, Sr.|Clint Murchison]] and [[H. L. Hunt]]. McClellan states that the assassination of Kennedy allowed the oil depletion allowance to be kept at 27.5 percent. It remained unchanged during the Johnson presidency.

Within the Secret Service during those chaotic months, \"rumors were flying\" about Cuban dissidents and right-wing southerners who were stalking Kennedy for a chance to kill him, Bolden wrote. The security threat in Chicago in early November 1963 involved former Marine Thomas Arthur Vallee, who was arrested after police found an M-1 rifle, handgun, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his vehicle. A high-powered rifle was confiscated from another suspected conspirator in Chicago shortly before Kennedy's trip there was canceled, Bolden said.

The theory alleges that after the first two shots were fired the motorcade sped up while Hickey was attempting to respond to Oswald's shots and he lost his balance and accidentally pulled the trigger of his [[AR-15]] and shot JFK. Hickey's testimony says otherwise: \"''At the end of the last report'' (shot) I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, ''and turned to the rear.''\" (italics added).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jfkassassination.net/russ/m_j_russ/Sa-hicke.htm |title=George Hickey's Warren Commission testimony |publisher=Jfkassassination.net |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref> George Hickey sued Menninger in April 1995 for what he had written in ''Mortal Error''.

His conclusions were: (1) that Oswald killed Kennedy due to extreme feelings of inadequacy versus his wife's professed admiration for JFK, and (2) that the KGB never sought intelligence information from Oswald during his time in the USSR as they did not trust his motivations. {{ISBN|1-55972-210-X}}.\n* [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery]]'' (1995) concludes that Oswald was guilty, but holds that the evidence may point to a second gunman on the grassy knoll, who, purely by coincidence, was attempting to kill JFK at the same time as Oswald. \"If there was indeed another shot, it was not necessarily fired by a conspirator of Oswald's.

Oswald's role was to shoot John Connally. Bruce Roberts, author of the Gemstone File papers, claimed that the JFK assassination scenario was modeled after a supposed attempted assassination of President F.D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt was riding in an open car with Mayor [[Anton Cermak]] of Chicago. Cermak was shot and killed by [[Giuseppe Zangara]]. In Dallas, JFK was the real target, and Connally was a secondary target. The JFK assassination is only a small part of the Gemstone File's account. {{ISBN|1-4120-6137-7}}.\n* Joseph P.

Starting at odds of 2/11, Buveur d'Air raced in second before overtaking The New One at the last and \"cruised\" away to win by two and a quarter lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/28/kempton/2017-12-26/690227|title=Christmas Hurdle result |date=26 December 2017|website=Racing Post}}</ref>\n\nAs in 2017, Buveur d'Air prepared for the Cheltenham Festival with a run in the Contenders Hurdle and started at 1/16 against two opponents. He led from the start, went clear after the second last hurdle and was eased down on the run-in only to be challenged by the [[Swinton Handicap Hurdle]] winner John Constable, leaving Geraghty needing to drive the favourite out to win by one and three quarter lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/54/sandown/2018-02-03/692139|title=Contenders Hurdle result |date=3 February 2018|website=Racing Post}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 March 2017 Buveur d'Air attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Champion Hurdle and was made the 4/6 favourite. His ten opponents included [[Faugheen]], Melon ([[WKD Hurdle]]), Elgin ([[Kingwell Hurdle]]), Wicklow Brave, [[Yorkhill (horse)|Yorkhill]] ([[Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle]]) and John Constable. The favourite raced in third as his stablemate Charlie Parcs set the pace from Faugheen and moved up to take the lead at the second last. He was immediately joined by Melon and the pair engaged in a sustained struggle up the straight before Buveur d'Air gained the advantage in the final strides and prevailed by a neck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/11/cheltenham/2018-03-13/688252|title=Champion Hurdle result |date=13 March 2018|website=Racing Post}}</ref> Geraghty commented \"There was nowhere to hide.

On the run-in however, he was strongly challenged by his stablemate Verdana Blue and beaten a short head into second place.\n\nOn 2 February Buveur d'Air attempted to win the Contenders Hurdle for the third time and went off at odds of 1/5 against four opponents. He led for most of the way before accelerating away from his rivals on the run in and winning by two lengths from Vision des Flos, having been eased down by Geraghty in the final strides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/54/sandown/2019-02-02/720412|title=Contenders Hurdle result |date=2 February 2019|website=Racing Post}}</ref> At the Cheltenham Festival, Buveur d'Air attempted to emulate [[Hatton's Grace]], [[Sir Ken (horse)|Sir Ken]], [[Persian War (horse)|Persian War]], [[See You Then]] and [[Istabraq]] by winning the Champion Hurdle for the third time. Starting at odds of 11/4 he was tracking the leaders when he fell for the first time in his racing career at the third hurdle.

Seven more were built for the mining industry.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\">South African Railways Index and Diagrams Electric and Diesel Locomotives, 610mm and 1065mm Gauges, Ref LXD 14/1/100/20, 28 January 1975, as amended</ref><ref name=\"Middleton\">{{Middleton-SA Loco Guide|pages=51, 59, 63}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacturer==\nAs a result of the gradual withdrawal of steam locomotives from service, many of which had been employed as shunting engines, and in addition to the [[South African Class 36-000|Classes {{nowrap|36-000}}]] and [[South African Class 36-200|{{nowrap|36-200}}]] diesel-electric locomotives, a growing need arose for a modern electric shunting locomotive for the South African Railways (SAR), especially for use in yards in the large 3 kV DC electrified centres where the [[South African Class ES|Class ES]] and [[South African Class 1E|Class 1ES]] locomotives were also due to be withdrawn.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\">{{Paxton-Bourne|page=131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plate BBC 8E (E8032).JPG|thumb|left|[[Builder's plate]]]]\nThe Class 8E electric shunting locomo&shy;tive was designed for the SAR by a consortium consisting of [[Brown Boveri]] of Switzerland and [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]] of Germany. It was built by [[Union Carriage & Wagon]] (UCW) in Nigel, [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], who also fabricated the mechanical components.<ref name=\"Middleton\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=UCW - Electric locomotives|url=http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |publisher=The UCW Partnership|accessdate=30 September 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023401/http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nOne hundred locomotives were delivered by UCW to the SAR between 1983 and 1985, numbered in the range from E8001 to E8100. Another seven units were built by UCW for the mining industry. UCW did not allocate builder's numbers to the locomotives it built for the SAR, but used the SAR unit numbers for their record keeping. The locomotives which were built by UCW for industry, on the other hand, were allocated works numbers.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\"/><ref name=\"Middleton\"/>\n\n==Orientation and features==\n[[File:Class 8E E8008 no. 1 end a.JPG|thumb|left|No. 1 end]]\n[[File:Class 8E E8008 no. 2 end b.JPG|thumb|left|No. 2 end]]\nThe centre cab Class 8E has large grilles on the sides of both hoods on one side and a grille on the side of only the left hand side hood when viewed from the other side. The no. 1 end will be at the viewer's left when observing the locomotive from the side with grilles on both hoods.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\"/>\n\nThe pictures alongside of no. E8008 with both hood covers removed, illustrate the different equipment installed inside the two ends of the locomotive.\n\nThe locomotive has solid state electrical control circuitry with a thyristor-controlled chopper supply&shy;ing the four traction motors. Since the conventional accelerating resistors could be omitted which are used on mainline electric locomotives, considerable energy saving was accomplished on heavy shunting duties.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/>\n\nThe bogies are based on those of the [[South African Class 6E|Class 6E]], but with a rubber secondary suspension system which provides maximum adhesive force to the locomotive when starting from rest. The locomotive was designed to be operated by a crew of one and has two driving stations in the cab.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/>\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Class 8E E8066 IDR.JPG|thumb|left|x100px]]\nThe Class 8E was initially placed in service on the Witwatersrand, but a large number of them were later allocated to Durban and to other locations in Natal. Some are also employed at Beaconsfield in Kimberley, at [[Postmasburg]] in the Northern Cape and at Nelspruit in Mpumalanga. Apart from a short period in the early 1980s when one served as the station pilot in Cape Town, working between the mainline platforms at Cape Town station and the passenger carriage yard at Culemborg, the Class 8E is unknown in the Western Cape.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/> \n\nThey are powerful shunters and popular with their drivers, even though problems are sometimes experienced with start-up or failures while working at coastal centres such as at Umbilo in Durban. This is attributed to the damp climate which causes start-up contacter failures. Beginning in 2007, they were gradually equipped with air conditioning units for added crew comfort, similar to those installed in the [[South African Class 18E, Series 1|Class 18E]]. The air conditioning unit is mounted on the running board to the right of the cab on the right hand side of the locomotive.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\"/>\n\n==Industrial use==\nAt the same time that the Class 8E locomotives were being built for the SAR, another seven were built for the mining industry.\n* Three were built for Driefontein Consolidated Gold Mine (Dries) near Carletonville, numbered in the range from 5 to 7 and with builder's works numbers in the range from 449145 to 449147. Of these, Dries no. 5 was withdrawn and scrapped after an accident, with the remains dumped at the mine.\n* Four were built for the Impala Platinum mine (Implats) at Phokeng near Rustenburg, numbered 11, 12, 14 and 15, with builder's works numbers 449143, 449144, 449148 and 449149. In addition to these, seven SAR Class 8E locomotives, numbers E8005, E8006, E8019, E8026, E8042, E8050 and E8060, were later sold to Implats.<ref name=\"Middleton\"/>\n\n==Liveries==\nAll the Class 8E locomotives were delivered in the SAR red oxide livery with signal red buffer beams and cowcatchers, yellow whiskers and with the number plates on the cab sides mounted on three-stripe yellow wings. In the 1990s some of them were repainted in the Spoornet maroon livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the buffer beams and cowcatchers. In the late 1990s many were repainted in the Spoornet blue livery with either solid or outline numbers on the long hood sides.<ref name=\"Soul of a Railway 7-9\">[https://sites.google.com/site/soulorailway/home/system-7-1/south-eastwards-as-far-as-volksrust-2nd-section-wattles-to-union-junction-by-les-pivnic Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 9.

Seven more were built for the mining industry.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\">South African Railways Index and Diagrams Electric and Diesel Locomotives, 610mm and 1065mm Gauges, Ref LXD 14/1/100/20, 28 January 1975, as amended</ref><ref name=\"Middleton\">{{Middleton-SA Loco Guide|pages=51, 59, 63}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacturer==\nAs a result of the gradual withdrawal of steam locomotives from service, many of which had been employed as shunting engines, and in addition to the [[South African Class 36-000|Classes {{nowrap|36-000}}]] and [[South African Class 36-200|{{nowrap|36-200}}]] diesel-electric locomotives, a growing need arose for a modern electric shunting locomotive for the South African Railways (SAR), especially for use in yards in the large 3 kV DC electrified centres where the [[South African Class ES|Class ES]] and [[South African Class 1E|Class 1ES]] locomotives were also due to be withdrawn.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\">{{Paxton-Bourne|page=131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plate BBC 8E (E8032).JPG|thumb|left|[[Builder's plate]]]]\nThe Class 8E electric shunting locomo&shy;tive was designed for the SAR by a consortium consisting of [[Brown Boveri]] of Switzerland and [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]] of Germany. It was built by [[Union Carriage & Wagon]] (UCW) in Nigel, [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], who also fabricated the mechanical components.<ref name=\"Middleton\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=UCW - Electric locomotives|url=http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |publisher=The UCW Partnership|accessdate=30 September 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023401/http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nOne hundred locomotives were delivered by UCW to the SAR between 1983 and 1985, numbered in the range from E8001 to E8100. Another seven units were built by UCW for the mining industry. UCW did not allocate builder\u2019s numbers to the locomotives it built for the SAR, but used the SAR unit numbers for their record keeping. The locomotives which were built by UCW for industry, on the other hand, were allocated works numbers.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\"/><ref name=\"Middleton\"/>\n\n==Orientation and features==\n[[File:Class 8E E8008 no. 1 end a.JPG|thumb|left|No. 1 end]]\n[[File:Class 8E E8008 no. 2 end b.JPG|thumb|left|No. 2 end]]\nThe centre cab Class 8E has large grilles on the sides of both hoods on one side and a grille on the side of only the left hand side hood when viewed from the other side. The no. 1 end will be at the viewer's left when observing the locomotive from the side with grilles on both hoods.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\"/>\n\nThe pictures alongside of no. E8008 with both hood covers removed, illustrate the different equipment installed inside the two ends of the locomotive.\n\nThe locomotive has solid state electrical control circuitry with a thyristor-controlled chopper supply&shy;ing the four traction motors. Since the conventional accelerating resistors could be omitted which are used on mainline electric locomotives, considerable energy saving was accomplished on heavy shunting duties.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/>\n\nThe bogies are based on those of the [[South African Class 6E|Class 6E]], but with a rubber secondary suspension system which provides maximum adhesive force to the locomotive when starting from rest. The locomotive was designed to be operated by a crew of one and has two driving stations in the cab.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/>\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Class 8E E8066 IDR.JPG|thumb|left|x100px]]\nThe Class 8E was initially placed in service on the Witwatersrand, but a large number of them were later allocated to Durban and to other locations in Natal. Some are also employed at Beaconsfield in Kimberley, at [[Postmasburg]] in the Northern Cape and at Nelspruit in Mpumalanga. Apart from a short period in the early 1980s when one served as the station pilot in Cape Town, working between the mainline platforms at Cape Town station and the passenger carriage yard at Culemborg, the Class 8E is unknown in the Western Cape.<ref name=\"Paxton-Bourne\"/> \n\nThey are powerful shunters and popular with their drivers, even though problems are sometimes experienced with start-up or failures while working at coastal centres such as at Umbilo in Durban. This is attributed to the damp climate which causes start-up contacter failures. Beginning in 2007, they were gradually equipped with air conditioning units for added crew comfort, similar to those installed in the [[South African Class 18E, Series 1|Class 18E]]. The air conditioning unit is mounted on the running board to the right of the cab on the right hand side of the locomotive.<ref name=\"E&D diagram-book\"/>\n\n==Industrial use==\nAt the same time that the Class 8E locomotives were being built for the SAR, another seven were built for the mining industry.\n* Three were built for Driefontein Consolidated Gold Mine (Dries) near Carletonville, numbered in the range from 5 to 7 and with builder\u2019s works numbers in the range from 449145 to 449147. Of these, Dries no. 5 was withdrawn and scrapped after an accident, with the remains dumped at the mine.\n* Four were built for the Impala Platinum mine (Implats) at Phokeng near Rustenburg, numbered 11, 12, 14 and 15, with builder\u2019s works numbers 449143, 449144, 449148 and 449149. In addition to these, seven SAR Class 8E locomotives, numbers E8005, E8006, E8019, E8026, E8042, E8050 and E8060, were later sold to Implats.<ref name=\"Middleton\"/>\n\n==Liveries==\nAll the Class 8E locomotives were delivered in the SAR red oxide livery with signal red buffer beams and cowcatchers, yellow whiskers and with the number plates on the cab sides mounted on three-stripe yellow wings. In the 1990s some of them were repainted in the Spoornet maroon livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the buffer beams and cowcatchers. In the late 1990s many were repainted in the Spoornet blue livery with either solid or outline numbers on the long hood sides.<ref name=\"Soul of a Railway 7-9\">[https://sites.google.com/site/soulorailway/home/system-7-1/south-eastwards-as-far-as-volksrust-2nd-section-wattles-to-union-junction-by-les-pivnic Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 9.

It is also known for being the home stadium for the 6A Powerhouse Central Catholic Vikings football.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Highmark Stadium Main Stand.jpg\nFile:Highmark Stadium View from Club Level.jpg\nFile:HighmarkStadium2.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==Stadium layout==\n\nThere are 4 gates in Highmark Stadium: the Trib Total Media Gate, the North Gate, the South Gate, and the (#)1 Cochran Gate\n\n==Expansion==\nAlthough the original [[seating capacity]] was 3,400 plus 15 suites for 12 people and approximately 400 [[Standing-room only]] places, the stadium is expandable vertically on three sides in excess of 18,000 fans, the average attendance of [[Major League Soccer]], making the stadium capable of housing the Riverhounds as they seek to join MLS within a decade.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kovacevic: A Perfect Pitch to Lure MLS|first=Dejan|last=Kovacevic|url=http://triblive.com/sports/dejankovacevic/dejancolumns/3040000-74/kutney-soccer-league-mls-sports-pittsburgh-riverhounds-stadium-field-franchise#axzz2DjcKbEk8|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|date=November 29, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}</ref> Less than a week after the first league Riverhounds match at the stadium, club officials described three phases of expansion that could be made to the stadium.<ref name=\"USL Pro Spotlight: Week 4\">{{cite web |title=USL Pro Spotlight: Week 4|first=Pedro|last=Gomes|url=http://www.mlsreserves.com/2013/04/usl-pro-spotlight-week-4.html|publisher=MLS Reserves|date=April 18, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n'''Phase 1'''\nPhase 1 includes making the supporters section a permanent grandstand and adding more seating to that area of the stadium which could add about another 2,000 seats. That would bring total capacity to about 6,000.\n\n'''Phase 2'''\nPhase 2 involves wrapping the grandstands and creating seating in the corners of stadium and creating more seating near the East End. This phase could add about another 1,000 and would be based upon demand.\n\n'''Phase 3'''\nPhase 3 would be the phase in which the greatest increase in seating occurs.  It includes building a second tier of seating over the current grandstand. This would require extensive planning and coordination with the city because it would require building over the roadway. This phase could bring the total [[seating capacity]] to slightly over 10,000 and would, like phase 2, be based upon demand.\n\n===2018 Expansion===\nIn an effort to meet [[United States Soccer Federation|USSF]] Division II requirements, Highmark Stadium began an expansion effort to add 1,000 seats; meeting the minimum required capacity of 5,000.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Highmark Stadium to add 1,000 seats to meet U.S. Soccer requirements |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/soccer/2017/10/19/highmark-stadium-expansion-pittsburgh-riverhounds-attendance-usl/stories/201710180226|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|author=Omari Sankofa II|date=October 19, 2017|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> The project is anticipated to be completed ahead of the [[2019 Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC season|2019 season]].\n\n==Home opener==\nAlthough several warm-up matches and other non-soccer events were held at the stadium previously, the first official Riverhounds match took place on April 13, 2013, against the [[Harrisburg City Islanders]].<ref name=\"City Islanders Rally Past Riverhounds\"/><ref name=\"Harrisburg City Islanders at Pittsburgh Riverhounds 2:1\">{{cite web|title=Harrisburg City Islanders at Pittsburgh Riverhounds 2:1|url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/scripts/runisa.dll?M2:gp::72013+Elements/Display+E+47107+Stats/+3684678|publisher=USL Pro|date=April 14, 2013|accessdate=April 14, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616075016/http://www.uslsoccer.com/scripts/runisa.dll?M2:gp::72013+Elements/Display+E+47107+Stats/+3684678|archive-date=June 16, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin-left:15px; text-align:center; background:#fff;\" \n|- style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"\n|-\n!

However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to \"primitive\" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of \"savage\" people and Westerners.<ref name=stringer />\n\nTylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as \"spiritualism\" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]], that was then prevalent across Western nations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term \"animism\" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3\u20134}} The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67\u2013S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that there had once been \"one universal form of primitive religion\" (whether labelled \"animism\", \"totemism\", or \"shamanism\") has been dismissed as \"unsophisticated\" and \"erroneous\" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that \"it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants\".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}\n\n==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====\nTylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of \"primitive society\" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on \"primitive society\" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The \"19th-century armchair anthropologists\" argued \"primitive society\" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of \"developed\" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented \"survivals\" of the original animism of early humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = The term [\"animism\"] clearly began as an expression of a nest of insulting approaches to indigenous peoples and the earliest putatively religious humans.

Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.<ref name=\"Kuper 2005 85\" /> Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists \"have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]].\"<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\">{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.<ref>Ingold, Tim.

He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}}\n\nIn 2000, Guthrie suggested that the \"most widespread\" concept of animism was that it was the \"attribution of spirits to natural phenomena\nsuch as stones and trees\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}}\n\n=== The new animism ===\n\nMany anthropologists ceased using the term \"animism\", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups \u2013 namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers \u2013 who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as \"animists\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the \"old animist\" definition had been problematic, the term \"animism\" was nevertheless \"of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world.\"{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}}\n\n[[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the \"new animism\".]]\nThe \"new animism\" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]] which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to \"act as a person\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}}\n\nHallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist [[Nurit Bird-David]], who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}}\n\nMore recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to \"animate\" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our \"professional subcultures,\" which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are \"approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hornborg|first=Alf|title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world|journal=Ethnos|year=2006|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22\u20134|doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}}</ref> These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\" />\n\nNurit Bird-David argues that \"Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts.

That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the \"individual\"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships (\"dividuals\"), some of which are with \"superpersons\" (i.e. non-humans).\n\n[[File:Autel animiste.

This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning \"the scientific project\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=107}}\n\nTim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: \"Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually&nbsp; ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingold|first=Tim|title=The Perception of the Environment: Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=42}}</ref> Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this [[Cartesian dualism]], and that the animist self identifies with the world, \"feeling at once ''within'' and ''apart'' from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=24}}</ref> The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=27}}</ref> [[Shamanism]], in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.\n\nCultural ecologist and philosopher [[David Abram]] articulates an intensely ethical and ecological understanding of animism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''The Spell of the Sensuous'' and ''Becoming Animal,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct perceptual experience, holding rather that perceived things actively \"solicit our attention\" or \"call our focus,\" coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, he suggests, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology in which matter is alive through and through. Such a relational ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.<ref>Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}</ref>  In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. For instance, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, we \"see what they say\"\u2014the letters, that is, seem to speak to us\u2014much as spiders, trees, gushing rivers and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. For Abram, reading can usefully be understood as an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of animistic participation in which we once engaged. \"To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/303 303]}}</ref>\n\nThe religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief \"that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore \"concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}\nGraham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's \"I-thou\" as opposed to \"I-it\".

Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.<ref name = Eli72>Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3\u20137.</ref>\n\nAbram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies \u2014 the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence, the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of her/his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/3 3\u201329]}}</ref>\n\n=== Distinction from pantheism ===\nAnimism is not the same as [[pantheism]], although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.<ref>Paul A.

The assembled participants called out ''kitpu'' (\"eagle\"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nSome animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer ''[[karakia]]'' invocations to [[sweet potatoes]] as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in [[Aotearoa]] together in the same canoes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a [[wand]]; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of [[libation]]s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nVarious animistic cultures also comprehend stones as persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=106\u2013107}} Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the [[Bell Rocks]] and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nThe importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=109}}\n\n=== Spirits ===\n\nAnimism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal [[spirit]] entities.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=122}}\n\n== Other usages ==\n\n=== Science and animism ===\nIn the early 20th century, [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] defended a form of Animism in his book ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism'' (1911).\n\nThe physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]] has argued for \"quantum animism\" in which mind permeates the world at every level.\n\n{{quote|The quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of \"quantum animism\" likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems.

The animist experience, and, indeed, the wolf's or raven's experience, thus become licensed as equally valid world-views to the modern western scientific one\u2014indeed, they are more valid, since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably crops up when \"objective existence\" is separated from \"subjective experience.\"\n\n=== Socio-political impact ===\n\nHarvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of [[modernity]], because it accords \"intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire\" to non-humans.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xviii}} Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both [[Abrahamic religion]]s and Western [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xix}}\n\n=== In art and literature ===\nAnimist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=50}} For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=55}} Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}\n\nHarvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of [[Alan Garner]], [[Leslie Silko]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Daniel Quinn]],  [[Linda Hogan]], [[David Abram]],  [[Patricia Grace]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ursula Le Guin]], [[Louise Erdrich]], and [[Marge Piercy]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xxiii}} Animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spirits-gods-and-pastel-paints-the-weird-world-of-master-animator-hayao-miyazaki-1880974.html|title=Spirits, gods and pastel paints: The weird world of master animator Hayao Miyazaki|author=Robert Epstein|date=January 31, 2010|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/musings-on-miyazaki-early-and-late-2/|title=Musings on Miyazaki|author=Dr. David A.

However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to \"primitive\" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of \"savage\" people and Westerners.<ref name=stringer />\n\nTylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as \"spiritualism\" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]], that was then prevalent across Western nations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term \"animism\" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3\u20134}} The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67\u2013S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that there had once been \"one universal form of primitive religion\" (whether labelled \"animism\", \"totemism\", or \"shamanism\") has been dismissed as \"unsophisticated\" and \"erroneous\" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that \"it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants\".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}\n\n==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====\nTylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of \"primitive society\" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on \"primitive society\" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The \"19th-century armchair anthropologists\" argued \"primitive society\" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of \"developed\" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented \"survivals\" of the original animism of early humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = The term [\"animism\"] clearly began as an expression of a nest of insulting approaches to indigenous peoples and the earliest putatively religious humans.

Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.<ref name=\"Kuper 2005 85\" /> Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists \"have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]].\"<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\">{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.<ref>Ingold, Tim.

He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}}\n\nIn 2000, Guthrie suggested that the \"most widespread\" concept of animism was that it was the \"attribution of spirits to natural phenomena\nsuch as stones and trees\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}}\n\n=== The new animism ===\n\nMany anthropologists ceased using the term \"animism\", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups \u2013 namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers \u2013 who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as \"animists\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the \"old animist\" definition had been problematic, the term \"animism\" was nevertheless \"of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world.\"{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}}\n\n[[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the \"new animism\".]]\nThe \"new animism\" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]] which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to \"act as a person\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}}\n\nHallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist [[Nurit Bird-David]], who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}}\n\nMore recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to \"animate\" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our \"professional subcultures,\" which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity.

In his books ''The Spell of the Sensuous'' and ''Becoming Animal,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct perceptual experience, holding rather that perceived things actively \"solicit our attention\" or \"call our focus,\" coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, he suggests, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology in which matter is alive through and through. Such a relational ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.<ref>Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}</ref>  In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. For instance, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, we \"see what they say\"\u2014the letters, that is, seem to speak to us\u2014much as spiders, trees, gushing rivers and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. For Abram, reading can usefully be understood as an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of animistic participation in which we once engaged. \"To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/303 303]}}</ref>\n\nThe religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief \"that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore \"concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}\nGraham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's \"I-thou\" as opposed to \"I-it\".

Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.<ref name = Eli72>Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3\u20137.</ref>\n\nAbram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies \u2014 the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence, the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of her/his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/3 3\u201329]}}</ref>\n\n=== Distinction from pantheism ===\nAnimism is not the same as [[pantheism]], although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.<ref>Paul A.

The assembled participants called out ''kitpu'' (\"eagle\"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nSome animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer ''[[karakia]]'' invocations to [[sweet potatoes]] as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in [[Aotearoa]] together in the same canoes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a [[wand]]; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of [[libation]]s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nVarious animistic cultures also comprehend stones as persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=106\u2013107}} Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the [[Bell Rocks]] and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nThe importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=109}}\n\n=== Spirits ===\n\nAnimism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal [[spirit]] entities.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=122}}\n\n== Other usages ==\n\n=== Science and animism ===\nIn the early 20th century, [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] defended a form of Animism in his book ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism'' (1911).\n\nThe physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]] has argued for \"quantum animism\" in which mind permeates the world at every level.\n\n{{quote|The quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of \"quantum animism\" likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems.

Human reason (and its rigorous extension in the natural sciences) fits an evolutionary niche just as echolocation does for bats and infrared vision does for pit vipers, and is\u2014according to western science's own dictates\u2014epistemologically on a par with rather than superior to such capabilities. The meaning or aliveness of the \"objects\" we encounter\u2014rocks, trees, rivers, other animals\u2014thus depends for its validity not on a detached cognitive judgment but purely on the quality of our experience. The animist experience, and, indeed, the wolf's or raven's experience, thus become licensed as equally valid world-views to the modern western scientific one\u2014indeed, they are more valid, since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably crops up when \"objective existence\" is separated from \"subjective experience.\"\n\n=== Socio-political impact ===\n\nHarvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of [[modernity]], because it accords \"intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire\" to non-humans.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xviii}} Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both [[Abrahamic religion]]s and Western [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xix}}\n\n=== In art and literature ===\nAnimist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=50}} For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=55}} Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}\n\nHarvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of [[Alan Garner]], [[Leslie Silko]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Daniel Quinn]],  [[Linda Hogan]], [[David Abram]],  [[Patricia Grace]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ursula Le Guin]], [[Louise Erdrich]], and [[Marge Piercy]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xxiii}} Animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spirits-gods-and-pastel-paints-the-weird-world-of-master-animator-hayao-miyazaki-1880974.html|title=Spirits, gods and pastel paints: The weird world of master animator Hayao Miyazaki|author=Robert Epstein|date=January 31, 2010|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/musings-on-miyazaki-early-and-late-2/|title=Musings on Miyazaki|author=Dr. David A.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of 2020 Tipsport Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]].<ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Tipsport Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] and the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic. The current Czech number one, [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], though invited, could not compete due to the contract obligations to [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]].<ref>https://sport.tn.nova.cz/clanek/ceske-sipky-spousti-svou-premier-league-zacina-se-uz-pristi-tyden.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Player\n|-\n|[[File:Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Adam Gawlas.jpg|100px|alt=Adam Gawlas|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Adam Gawlas]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pavel Jirkal.jpg|100px|alt=Pavel Jirkal|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Pavel Jirkal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Ond\u0159ej Kysilka.jpg|100px|alt=Ond\u0159ej Kysilka|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Ond\u0159ej Kysilka]]\n|-\n|[[File:Alexander Ma\u0161ek.jpg|100px|alt=Alexander Ma\u0161ek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Alexander Ma\u0161ek]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal Ondo.jpg|100px|alt=Michal Ondo|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal Ondo]]\n|-\n|[[File:David P\u00edsek.jpg|100px|alt=David P\u00edsek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David P\u00edsek]]\n|-\n|[[File:David Ros\u00ed.jpg|100px|alt=David Ros\u00ed|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David Ros\u00ed]]\n|-\n|[[File:V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal \u0160mejda.jpg|100px|alt=Michal \u0160mejda|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal \u0160mejda]]\n|}\n\n== League stage ==\n\n=== 7.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of 2020 Tipsport Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]].<ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Tipsport Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] and the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic. The current Czech number one, [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], though invited, could not compete due to the contract obligations to [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]].<ref>https://sport.tn.nova.cz/clanek/ceske-sipky-spousti-svou-premier-league-zacina-se-uz-pristi-tyden.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Player\n|-\n|[[File:Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Adam Gawlas.jpg|100px|alt=Adam Gawlas|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Adam Gawlas]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pavel Jirkal.jpg|100px|alt=Pavel Jirkal|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Pavel Jirkal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Ond\u0159ej Kysilka.jpg|100px|alt=Ond\u0159ej Kysilka|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Ond\u0159ej Kysilka]]\n|-\n|[[File:Alexander Ma\u0161ek.jpg|100px|alt=Alexander Ma\u0161ek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Alexander Ma\u0161ek]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal Ondo.jpg|100px|alt=Michal Ondo|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal Ondo]]\n|-\n|[[File:David P\u00edsek.jpg|100px|alt=David P\u00edsek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David P\u00edsek]]\n|-\n|[[File:David Ros\u00ed.jpg|100px|alt=David Ros\u00ed|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David Ros\u00ed]]\n|-\n|[[File:V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal \u0160mejda.jpg|100px|alt=Michal \u0160mejda|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal \u0160mejda]]\n|}\n\n== League stage ==\n\n=== 7.

[[Everest]] Chomolungma.\n\nThe Himalayas have four [[tectonic]] subdivisions:\n\n* The Indus Suture Zone, where the Indian Plate meets the Eurasian Transhimalaya or Karakoram-Lhasa Block.\n* The Central Himalayan Domain, the high backbone of the Himalayas bounded on the south by a fault zone called the MCT (Main Central Thrust) that has elevated these peaks three or four thousand meters above lower ranges to the south.\n* The \"middle hills\" below the MCT south to the Lesser Himalaya or Mahabharat Range which is bounded by another fault zone, the MBT (Main Boundary Thrust) that abruptly elevates the Mahabharats 1,000 to 2,000 meters above hills further south.\n* The Sub-himalaya also known as the Muree, Chure Hills or [[Siwaliks]], which are the southernmost foothills of the Himalayan Range and mainly composed of folded and overlapping sheets of sediment from the erosion of the Himalaya.  They are bounded on the south by the HFT (Himalayan Frontal Thrust) elevating them about 500 meters above the [[Gangetic plain]].\n\nThe Inner Terai valleys lie between the Siwalik and Mahabharat ranges or sometimes between different ranges in the Siwaliks. They hold flat plains with winding rivers that shift course from time to time, running northwest or southeast along the axis of the Siwalik ranges until they find a break and flow  into the Outer Terai and [[Gangetic plain]].  Usually there is little difference in elevation between the Inner Terai valley floors and the plains of the Outer Terai.\n\n==Climate==\n[[Image:Nepal topo en.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Nepal topography. The green/yellow zones hold the Inner Terai valleys.]]\n\nThe [[Terai]] has a humid, [[subtropic]]al climate. The mean annual rainfall at the Rampur weatherstation in Chitwan was {{convert|2214|mm|in|abbr=on}} between 1995 and 2006. More than 80% of the total annual rainfall occurs during the [[monsoon]] season from June to September.

They acquired property rights over uncultivated forest and waste land, thus accelerating the deforestation process in the Terai.<ref name=Regmi1994/>\n\n== Economy ==\nBoth Inner and Outer Terai have become Nepal's richest economic regions, with fertile farms and forests because of the area's generally flat terrain that is drained and nourished by several rivers. The Terai also has the largest commercially exploitable forests.\n\n==Environmental Issues==\nThe well-meaning malaria eradication campaign has had unexpected consequences by opening up the Terai region to human settlement.  The Inner Terai valleys are home to a rich and diverse ecosystem. Since the early 1990s, however, the forests have been increasingly destroyed because of growing demands for timber and agricultural land<ref>[http://www.forestrynepal.org/publications/reports/3778 Regional Workshop on Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Forest Management of Terai, Inner Terai and Churia in Nepal]</ref><ref>[http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/549391/549398 Forests Monitor: The Terai Forests]</ref>\nThis has led to concerns about the risk of losing many rare plant,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mountainfund.org/html_site/research/orchids_in_the_churiya_hills_and_their_survival_in_nepal.pdf |title=Orchids in the Churiya Hills and their survival in Nepal |access-date=2008-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219183024/http://www.mountainfund.org/html_site/research/orchids_in_the_churiya_hills_and_their_survival_in_nepal.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nepjol.info/index.php/ON/article/viewFile/506/506 An Overview of Floral Diversity in Wetlands of Terai Region of Nepal: M.

[[Malaria]] was prevalent in this region until the late 1950s. Since its eradication, the area became a viable destination for large-scale migration of people from the hills, who transformed the area from [[virgin forest]] and grassland to farmland.<ref name=\"Grung1988\">Gurung, H.

The [[oceanic crust]] in front of India slid under Eurasia, pushing up the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The Indian [[continental crust]] is also pushing under Tibet, but is partly compressed and thrust upward to form the Himalayan mountain range, extending for over 2400&nbsp;km and rising as high as 8848 m at Mt. [[Everest]] Chomolungma.\n\nThe Himalayas have four [[tectonic]] subdivisions:\n\n* The Indus Suture Zone, where the Indian Plate meets the Eurasian Transhimalaya or Karakoram-Lhasa Block.\n* The Central Himalayan Domain, the high backbone of the Himalayas bounded on the south by a fault zone called the MCT (Main Central Thrust) that has elevated these peaks three or four thousand meters above lower ranges to the south.\n* The \"middle hills\" below the MCT south to the Lesser Himalaya or Mahabharat Range which is bounded by another fault zone, the MBT (Main Boundary Thrust) that abruptly elevates the Mahabharats 1,000 to 2,000 meters above hills further south.\n* The Sub-himalaya also known as the Muree, Chure Hills or [[Siwaliks]], which are the southernmost foothills of the Himalayan Range and mainly composed of folded and overlapping sheets of sediment from the erosion of the Himalaya.  They are bounded on the south by the HFT (Himalayan Frontal Thrust) elevating them about 500 meters above the [[Gangetic plain]].\n\nThe Inner Terai valleys lie between the Siwalik and Mahabharat ranges or sometimes between different ranges in the Siwaliks. They hold flat plains with winding rivers that shift course from time to time, running northwest or southeast along the axis of the Siwalik ranges until they find a break and flow  into the Outer Terai and [[Gangetic plain]].  Usually there is little difference in elevation between the Inner Terai valley floors and the plains of the Outer Terai.\n\n==Climate==\n[[Image:Nepal topo en.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Nepal topography. The green/yellow zones hold the Inner Terai valleys.]]\n\nThe [[Terai]] has a humid, [[subtropic]]al climate. The mean annual rainfall at the Rampur weatherstation in Chitwan was {{convert|2214|mm|in|abbr=on}} between 1995 and 2006. More than 80% of the total annual rainfall occurs during the [[monsoon]] season from June to September. Average temperatures ranged from {{convert|8.08|C|F|abbr=on}} in January to {{convert|34.91|C|F|abbr=on}} in June.<ref>Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (2006). Climatological Records of Nepal (Several Volumes), Babarmahal, Kathmandu.</ref>\n\nIn the past, the inner and outer Terai were a formidable barrier between Nepal and potential invaders from India because marshes and forests were infested by [[Anopheles|anopheline mosquitos]] that transmitted virulent strains of [[malaria]], especially during the hot spring and rainy summer monsoon.\n\n== History ==\nUntil the mid 18th century, the Terai was divided into several smaller kingdoms, and the forests were little disturbed.<ref name=Gautam2004>Gautam, A.

Timber export continued to 1969. In 1970, the [[King Mahendra|king]] granted land to loyal ex-army personnel in the districts of [[Jhapa District|Jhapa]], [[Sunsari District|Sunsari]], [[Rupandehi District|Rupandehi]] and [[Banke District|Banke]], where seven colonies were developed for resettling about 7,000 people. They acquired property rights over uncultivated forest and waste land, thus accelerating the deforestation process in the Terai.<ref name=Regmi1994/>\n\n== Economy ==\nBoth Inner and Outer Terai have become Nepal's richest economic regions, with fertile farms and forests because of the area's generally flat terrain that is drained and nourished by several rivers. The Terai also has the largest commercially exploitable forests.\n\n==Environmental Issues==\nThe well-meaning malaria eradication campaign has had unexpected consequences by opening up the Terai region to human settlement.  The Inner Terai valleys are home to a rich and diverse ecosystem. Since the early 1990s, however, the forests have been increasingly destroyed because of growing demands for timber and agricultural land<ref>[http://www.forestrynepal.org/publications/reports/3778 Regional Workshop on Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Forest Management of Terai, Inner Terai and Churia in Nepal]</ref><ref>[http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/549391/549398 Forests Monitor: The Terai Forests]</ref>\nThis has led to concerns about the risk of losing many rare plant,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mountainfund.org/html_site/research/orchids_in_the_churiya_hills_and_their_survival_in_nepal.pdf |title=Orchids in the Churiya Hills and their survival in Nepal |access-date=2008-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219183024/http://www.mountainfund.org/html_site/research/orchids_in_the_churiya_hills_and_their_survival_in_nepal.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nepjol.info/index.php/ON/article/viewFile/506/506 An Overview of Floral Diversity in Wetlands of Terai Region of Nepal: M.

During heavy rainfall forests absorb water.  During floods, rivers overflow their banks and flood adjacent forests. Later the forests gradually release water back into the rivers.
