Although unrecognized, Ryukyuans constitute the largest [[Ethnolinguistic group|ethnolinguistic]] minority group in Japan, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa Prefecture alone. Ryukyuans inhabit the [[Amami Islands]] of Kagoshima Prefecture as well. There is also a considerable [[Ryukyuan diaspora]]. As many as 600,000 more ethnic Ryukyuans and their descendants are dispersed elsewhere in Japan and worldwide; most commonly in [[Brazil]] and, to a lesser extent, in other territories where there is also a sizable [[Japanese diaspora]]. In the majority of countries, the Ryukyuan and Japanese diaspora are not differentiated so there are no reliable [[statistics]] for the former.\n\nRecent genetic and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies indicate that the Ryukyuans are significantly related to the [[Yamato people]] (mainland Japanese) but have also a relative closer relation to the [[Ainu people]], compared with the Yamato people. This is possibly explained with partially shared ancestry of the population during the [[J\u014dmon period]] (pre 10,000 BCE \u2013 1,000 BCE) and with the population of the [[Yayoi period]] (1,000 BCE \u2013 300 CE), which were migrants from other parts of [[East Asia]] (specifically [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=Naruya|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Katsushi|last3=Omoto|first3=Keiichi|last4=Niikawa|first4=Norio|last5=Yanagi|first5=Kumiko|last6=Naritomi|first6=Kenji|last7=Kaname|first7=Tadashi|last8=Suto|first8=Yumiko|last9=Mano|first9=Shuhei|date=December 2012|title=The history of human populations in the Japanese Archipelago inferred from genome-wide SNP data with a special reference to the Ainu and the Ryukyuan populations|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=57|issue=12|pages=787\u2013795|doi=10.1038/jhg.2012.114|pmid=23135232|issn=1435-232X}}</ref>\n\nThe Ryukyuans have a specific culture with some [[matriarchal]] elements, native [[Ryukyuan religion|religion]], and [[Okinawan cuisine|cuisine]] which had fairly late (12th century) introduction of [[rice]].

It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient [[Matriarchy|matriarchal system]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nThe first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], due to previous tradition, between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the \"Land of Happy Immortals\". As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu, would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat [[Ono no Imoko]] arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of [[Yakushima|Yaku]] south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the \"Southern Islands people\", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and [[Tanu Province|Tanu]]. According to ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the [[Tanegashima|Tane-jima]], Yakushima, [[Amami Islands|Amami]], [[Tokunoshima]] and other islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} ''Nihongi'' recorded that the [[Hayato people]] in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and [[Tokara Islands|Tokara]], in 714 Shingaki and [[Kume Island|Kume]], in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753.

The tradition states that the founder of [[Tenson Dynasty]] was a descendant of goddess [[Amamikyu]], and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by [[Shunten]] (1187 \u2013 1237), lord of [[Urasoe Castle|Urasoe]]. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (''[[Aji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'') daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered [[Minamoto no Tametomo]], while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated [[Taira clan]] who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. [[Shunten Dynasty]] made two additional chieftains, [[Shunbajunki]] (1237-1248) and [[Gihon (Ryukyu)|Gihon]] (1248\u20131259). As Gihon abdicated, his [[sessei]] [[Eiso (Ryukyu)|Eiso]] (1260\u20131299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Eiso Dynasty|Eiso Dynasty]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nDuring the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku period|Gusuku period]] (c. 1187\u20131314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=28}} Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many ''[[gusuku]]'', castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, [[millet]] and the overseas trading of these goods,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}}<ref name=\"Hammer2006\"/><ref name=\"Shinoda2013\"/> as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese [[kana]] writing system in its older and simple phonetic form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami \u014cshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands.

The status of women in traditional society is higher than in China and Japan. Although the contemporary kinship system is patrilineal and [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]], until the 20th century it was often bilateral and [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], with common village endogamy.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=54\u201355}} [[Shisa]] statues can often be seen on or in front of houses\u2014this relates to the ancient Ryukyuan belief that the male spirit is the spirit of the outside and the female spirit is the spirit of the inside.

The noro's duty was to preserve the generational fire in the hearth, a communal treasure, resulting with tabu system about the fire custodian in which they had to be virgins to maintain close communication with the ancestors. The office became hereditary, usually of the noro's brother's female child. The center of worship was represented by three heartstones within or near the house.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The belief in the spiritual predominance of the sister was more prominent in Southern Ryukyus.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}\n\nThe introduction of Buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from Japan (mostly funeral rites{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}), while the 14th century trade relations resulted with [[Korean Buddhism]] influences (including some in architecture), as well Shinto practices from Japan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} Buddhism and native religion were ideological basis until 18th century, when [[Confucianism]] gradually and officially became government ideology during [[Sh\u014d On]] (1795\u20131802), much to the dismay of [[Kumemura]].{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=240}} It was mostly important to the upper class families.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}} Among the Catholic converts was not lost the former religious consciousness.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}\n\nUntil the 18th century, the Ryukyuan kings visited the [[Sefa-utaki]] (historical sacred place) caves for worship. Another traditional sacred places are springs Ukinju-Hain-ju, where was placed the first rice plantation, and small island Kudaka, where the \"five fruits and grains\" were introduced by divine people, perhaps strangers with agricultural techniques.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The foremost account, which claimed common origin between the Japanese and Ryukyuan people, was made-up by [[Sh\u014d Sh\u014dken]] in the 17th century, to end up the pilgrimage of the Ryukyu king and chief priestess to the Kudaka island.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=46}}\n\nDuring the Meiji period the government replaced Buddhism with Shintoism as the islands' state religion,{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=66}} and ordered; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate native deities into national Shinto pantheon; Shinto worship preceded native, Buddhist, or Christian ritual; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=4}} In the 1920s was ordered building of Shinto shrines and remodelling of previous with Shinto architectural symbols, paid by local tax money, which was a financial burden due to the collapse of sugar prices in 1921 which devastated Okinawa's economy.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}} In 1932 were ordered to house and support Shinto clergy from the mainland.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}}\n\nMost Ryukyuans of the younger generations are not serious adherents of the native religion anymore. Additionally, since being under Japanese control, [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]] are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs and practices.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Okinawan cuisine}}\n\nOkinawan food is rich in [[vitamin]]s and [[minerals]] and is a good balance of [[protein]], [[fat]]s, and [[carbohydrate]]s. Although [[rice]] is a [[staple food]] ([[taco rice]] mixes it with beef), [[pork]] (''[[Pig's ear (food)#Okinawan (Japanese) cuisine|mimigaa and chiragaa]]'', dishes [[Rafute]] and [[Soki]]), [[Edible seaweed|seaweed]], rich [[miso]] (fermented [[soybean]]) pastes and soups ([[Zosui|J\u016bsh\u012b]]), [[sweet potato]] and [[brown sugar]] all feature prominently in native cuisine. Most famous to tourists is the ''[[Momordica charantia]]'', ''g\u014dya'' (bitter melon), which is often mixed into a representative Okinawan [[Stir frying|stir fry]] dish known as [[Chanpuru|champur\u016b]] ([[Goya champuru]]). [[K\u014dr\u0113gusu]] is a common [[hot sauce]] [[condiment]] used in various dishes including [[noodle soup]] [[Okinawa soba]]. Some specifically consumed algae include [[Caulerpa lentillifera]]. Traditional sweets include [[chinsuko]], [[hirayachi]], [[sata andagi]], and [[muchi]]. Local beverages include juice from ''[[Citrus depressa]]'', [[turmeric tea]] (''ukoncha''), and the alcoholic beverage [[awamori]].\n\nThe weight-loss [[Okinawa diet]] derives from their cuisine and has only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.<ref name=\"Willcox2007\">{{Citation  |last=Willcox |first=B.

Although unrecognized, Ryukyuans constitute the largest [[Ethnolinguistic group|ethnolinguistic]] minority group in Japan, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa Prefecture alone. Ryukyuans inhabit the [[Amami Islands]] of Kagoshima Prefecture as well. There is also a considerable [[Ryukyuan diaspora]]. As many as 600,000 more ethnic Ryukyuans and their descendants are dispersed elsewhere in Japan and worldwide; most commonly in [[Brazil]] and, to a lesser extent, in other territories where there is also a sizable [[Japanese diaspora]]. In the majority of countries, the Ryukyuan and Japanese diaspora are not differentiated so there are no reliable [[statistics]] for the former.\n\nRecent genetic and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies indicate that the Ryukyuans are significantly related to the [[Yamato people]] (mainland Japanese) but have also a relative closer relation to the [[Ainu people]], compared with the Yamato people. This is possibly explained with partially shared ancestry of the population during the [[J\u014dmon period]] (pre 10,000 BCE \u2013 1,000 BCE) and with the population of the [[Yayoi period]] (1,000 BCE \u2013 300 CE), which were migrants from other parts of [[East Asia]] (specifically [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=Naruya|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Katsushi|last3=Omoto|first3=Keiichi|last4=Niikawa|first4=Norio|last5=Yanagi|first5=Kumiko|last6=Naritomi|first6=Kenji|last7=Kaname|first7=Tadashi|last8=Suto|first8=Yumiko|last9=Mano|first9=Shuhei|date=December 2012|title=The history of human populations in the Japanese Archipelago inferred from genome-wide SNP data with a special reference to the Ainu and the Ryukyuan populations|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=57|issue=12|pages=787\u2013795|doi=10.1038/jhg.2012.114|pmid=23135232|issn=1435-232X}}</ref>\n\nThe Ryukyuans have a specific culture with some [[matriarchal]] elements, native [[Ryukyuan religion|religion]], and [[Okinawan cuisine|cuisine]] which had fairly late (12th century) introduction of [[rice]].

According to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shan Hai Jing]]'', the Yan had relations with the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] (dwarf, short) people living southeast of Korea, who could be related to both the mainland Japanese or Ryukyuan people.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The futile search for the elixir of immortality by [[Qin Shi Huang]], the founder of [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC\u2013206 BC), in which the emperor tried to cooperate with \"happy immortals\" who dwelt on the islands, could be related to both Japan and Ryukyu Islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} There's lack of evidence that the missions by [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC \u2013 220 AD) reached the islands, however as the Japanese did reach Han's [[Luoyang|capital]], notes from 57 CE do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of \"hundred kingdoms\" in the eastern islands, a practice which was widespread and survived only among the Okinawan's women, Ainu in Hokkaido, and [[Atayal people]] in Taiwan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} [[Cao Wei]] (220\u2013265) and Han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern Japan and Okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century CE - they were of small stature, bred [[oxen]] and [[swine]], as well were ruled by women, with special influence of women sorceresses, which is related to the Ryukyuan [[Noro (priestess)|Noro]] priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century, as well the Ryukyuan swine economy culture until World War II. It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient [[Matriarchy|matriarchal system]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nThe first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], due to previous tradition, between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the \"Land of Happy Immortals\". As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu, would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat [[Ono no Imoko]] arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of [[Yakushima|Yaku]] south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the \"Southern Islands people\", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and [[Tanu Province|Tanu]]. According to ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the [[Tanegashima|Tane-jima]], Yakushima, [[Amami Islands|Amami]], [[Tokunoshima]] and other islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} ''Nihongi'' recorded that the [[Hayato people]] in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and [[Tokara Islands|Tokara]], in 714 Shingaki and [[Kume Island|Kume]], in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753. Nevertheless the mention or authority, over the centuries the Japanese influence spread slowly among the communities.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Gusuku period===\n[[Image:Nakijinjyousi2.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[gusuku]]'' fortification are on the [[Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]] UNESCO's list.]]\n\nThe lack of written record resulted with later, 17th century royal tales both under Chinese and Japanese influence, which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the \"[[divine right of kings|divine right]]\" of their royal authority, as well the then-political interests of Tokugawa ''sh\u014dguns'' from [[Minamoto clan]] who wanted to legitimize Japanese domination over Okinawa. The tradition states that the founder of [[Tenson Dynasty]] was a descendant of goddess [[Amamikyu]], and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by [[Shunten]] (1187 \u2013 1237), lord of [[Urasoe Castle|Urasoe]]. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (''[[Aji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'') daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered [[Minamoto no Tametomo]], while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated [[Taira clan]] who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. [[Shunten Dynasty]] made two additional chieftains, [[Shunbajunki]] (1237-1248) and [[Gihon (Ryukyu)|Gihon]] (1248\u20131259). As Gihon abdicated, his [[sessei]] [[Eiso (Ryukyu)|Eiso]] (1260\u20131299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Eiso Dynasty|Eiso Dynasty]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nDuring the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku period|Gusuku period]] (c. 1187\u20131314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=28}} Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many ''[[gusuku]]'', castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, [[millet]] and the overseas trading of these goods,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}}<ref name=\"Hammer2006\"/><ref name=\"Shinoda2013\"/> as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese [[kana]] writing system in its older and simple phonetic form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami \u014cshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands. To Eiso's reign period is also ascribed the introduction of [[Buddhism]] into Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Sanzan period===\n{{Main|Sanzan period|Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China}}\n[[File:Ryukyu Kingdoms of Sanzan era.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Okinawa Island]], showing the [[Sanzan period]] polities.]]\nDuring the rule of Eiso's great-grandson, [[Tamagusuku]] (1314\u20131336), Okinawa became divided into three [[polities]] and began the so-called [[Sanzan period]] (1314\u20131429). The north and largest [[Hokuzan]] polity was the poorest due to forest and mountainous terrain (in which isolation was an advantage), with primitive farming and fishing. The central [[Ch\u016bzan]] polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle [[town]]s and harbor facilities. The south [[Nanzan]] polity was the smallest, but endured because of good castle positions and sea merchants.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\nIn this period another rapid economical, social and cultural development of Ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with Japan, Korea and China. During the [[Satto]]'s reign, Ch\u016bzan made [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary relations]] with China's [[Ming dynasty]] in 1374 as the [[Hongwu Emperor]] sent envoys in 1372 to Okinawa. In the next two decades Ch\u016bzan made nine [[Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China|official missions]] to the Chinese capital, and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 (see [[Imperial Chinese missions to Ryukyu Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Despite significant Chinese economical, cultural and political influence, the polities continued to maintain strong [[autonomy]].{{sfn|Gluck|2008|p=939}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=1}} In 1392, all three polities began to send extensive [[Ryukyuan missions to Joseon|missions]] to the Korean [[Joseon]] kingdom. In 1403, Ch\u016bzan made formal relations with the Japanese [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and an [[embassy]] was sent to [[Thailand]] in 1409.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The contacts with Siam continued even in 1425, and were newly made with places like [[Palembang]] in 1428, [[Java]] in 1430, [[Malacca]] and [[Sumatra]] in 1463.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}}\n\nAs in 1371, China initiated its maritime prohibition policy ([[Haijin]]) to Japan, Ryukyu gained a lot from its position as [[intermediary]] in the trade between Japan and China. They shipped horses, [[sulphur]] and seashells to China, from China brought ceramics, copper, and iron, from southeast Asian countries bought tin, ivory, spices (pepper), wood ([[sappanwood]]), which they sold to Japan, Korea or China, as well as transporting Chinese goods to [[Hakata Bay]] from where swords, silver and gold were brought.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=28}}\n\nIn 1392, 36 Chinese families from [[Fujian]] were invited by the chieftain of Okinawa Island's central polity (Ch\u016bzan) to settle near the port of [[Naha]] and to serve as diplomats, interpreters, and government officials.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Some consider that many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&pg=PA145&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q=ryukyu%20asked%20for%20thirty%20six%20families%20fujian&f=false|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|location=|isbn=978-0-7914-2687-6|page=145|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga-5mPOr2-wC&pg=PR13&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The East Asian maritime world 1400-1800: its fabrics of power and dynamics of exchanges|author=Angela Schottenhammer|year=2007|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|location=|isbn=978-3-447-05474-4|page=xiii|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddcV_cGegX4C&pg=PA125&dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Maritime sector, institutions, and sea power of premodern China|author=Gang Deng|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|isbn=978-0-313-30712-6|page=125|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> From the same year onward Ryukyu was allowed to send official students to China i.e. [[Guozijian]].{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=41}} The tributary relationship with China later became a basis of the 19th century Sino-Japanese disputes about the claims of Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}\n\n===Ryukyu Kingdom===\n{{Main|Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan missions to Edo}}\n[[File:Naha Shuri Castle50s3s4500.jpg|thumb|right|The castle town and [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]'s capital [[Shuri Castle]].]]\n\nBetween 1416 and 1429, Ch\u016bzan chieftain [[Sh\u014d Hashi]] successfully unified the principalities into the [[Ryukyuan Kingdom]] (1429\u20131879) with the [[castle town]] [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] as royal capital, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|First Sh\u014d Dynasty]], and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade, especially tributary relations with the Ming dynasty.<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/> The period of [[Sh\u014d Shin]]'s (1477\u20131526) rule, descendant from the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Sh\u014d Dynasty|Second Sh\u014d Dynasty]], is notable for peace and relative prosperity, peak in overseas trade, as well as expansion of the kingdom's firm control to [[Kikaijima]], [[Miyako-jima]] and [[Yaeyama Islands]] (1465\u20131524),{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=115}} while during [[Sh\u014d Sei]] (1526-1555) to [[Amami \u014cshima]] (1537).{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}\n\nAfter the [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign]] (1586\u20131587) by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], his assistant [[Kamei Korenori]], who was interested in southern trade, wanted to be rewarded with the Ryukyu Islands. A paper [[Hand fan|fan]] found during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] mentioning a title \"Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu\", reveals that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands. In 1591, Kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands, but the [[Shimazu clan]] stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the Ryukyu kingdom. Hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of Korea was more important in his mind.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=151\u2013152}} As the Ming's influence weakened due to disorder in China, Japanese established posts in Southeast Asia, and the Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese) arrived, the kingdom's overseas trade began to decline.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43}}<ref name=\"MasamiIto2009\"/>\n\nIn the early 17th century during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603\u20131867), the first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma feudal domain]] of the Shimazu clan in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] incorporated some of kingdom's territory during the 1609 [[Invasion of Ryukyu]]. They nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming's prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China.

Whereas violet is a [[spectral color]] (referring to the color of different single wavelengths of light), purple is the color of various combinations of red and blue light (some of which have the same [[hue]] as violet). In the traditional painters' color wheel, violet and purple are both placed between red and blue, with purple is closer to red. \n\nViolet and purple have a long history of association with royalty and majesty. The emperors of Rome wore purple togas, as did the Byzantine emperors. During the [[Middle Ages]] violet was worn by [[bishop]]s and university professors and was often used in art as the color of the robes of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. In [[Chinese painting]], the color violet represents the \"unity transcending the duality of [[Yin and yang]]\" and \"the ultimate harmony of the [[Cosmos|universe]]\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Varichon, Anne ''Colors:What They Mean and How to Make Them'' New York:2006 Abrams Page 138</ref> In [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] violet is associated with the [[crown chakra|Crown Chakra]].<ref name=\"color-wheel-artist.com\">https://web.archive.org/web/20170508232015/http://www.color-wheel-artist.com/meanings-of-violet.html</ref> According to surveys in Europe and the United States, violet is the color people most often associate with extravagance and individualism, the unconventional, the artificial, and ambiguity.<ref name=\"Eva Heller p. 4\">Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques''. p.&nbsp;4.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''violet'' as a color name derives from the [[Middle English]] and [[Old French]] ''violete'', in turn from the Latin ''viola'', names of the [[violet (flower)|violet]] flower.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1370.<ref>Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: 1930 McGraw-Hill Page 207</ref> \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"220\" heights=\"220\">\nFile:Viole.jpg|[[Sweet violet]] flowers\nFile:Pigment Violet 29.svg|Chemical structure of [[Pigment Violet 29|pigment violet 29]].

Purple occupies the space closer to red, between crimson and violet.<ref>''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', 5th Edition, 2003.</ref> Violet is closer to blue, and usually less intense and bright than purple.\n\nFrom the point of view of optics, violet is a real color: it occupies its own place at the end of the [[visible spectrum]], and was one of the seven [[spectral color]]s of the spectrum first described by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1672.\n\nIn the [[additive color]] system, used to create colors on a computer screen or on a color television, violet is simulated by purple, by combining blue light at high intensity with a less intense red light on a black screen. The range of purples is created by combining blue and red light of any intensities; the [[Chromaticity|chromaticities]] formed this way line along the \"[[line of purples]]\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nImage:Color icon violet v2.svg|The [[shades of violet]].\nFile:Color icon purple v2.svg|The [[shades of purple]].\nFile:Boutet 1708 color circles.jpg|In the traditional Boutet [[Color wheel|color circle]] (1708), violet is shown between blue and purple.\n</gallery>\n\n==In history and art==\n\n===Prehistory and antiquity===\nViolet is one of the oldest colors used by man. Traces of very dark violet, made by grinding the mineral [[manganese]], mixed with water or animal fat and then brushed on the cave wall or applied with the fingers, are found in the [[prehistoric cave art]] in [[Pech Merle]], in France, dating back about twenty-five thousand years. It has also been found in the [[cave of Altamira]] and [[Lascaux]].<ref>Phillip Ball (2001), ''Bright earth- Art and the Invention of Colour'', p.&nbsp;84</ref> It was sometimes used as an alternative to black charcoal. Sticks of manganese, used for drawing, have been found at sites occupied by [[Neanderthal]] man in France and Israel. From the grinding tools at various sites, it appears it may also have been used to color the body and to decorate animal skins.\n\nMore recently, the earliest dates on cave paintings have been pushed back farther than 35,000 years. Hand paintings on rock walls in Australia may be even older, dating back as far as 50,000 years.\n\nBerries of the genus [[rubus]], such as [[Blackberry|blackberries]], were a common source of dyes in antiquity. The ancient Egyptians made a kind of violet dye by combining the juice of the [[mulberry]] with crushed green grapes. The Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder]] reported that the [[Gauls]] used a violet dye made from [[bilberry]] to color the clothing of slaves. These dyes made a satisfactory purple, but it faded quickly in sunlight and when washed.<ref>Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p.&nbsp;146\u2013148</ref>\n\n===The Middle Ages and the Renaissance===\nViolet and purple retained their status as the color of emperors and princes of the church throughout the long rule of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nWhile violet was worn less frequently by Medieval and Renaissance kings and princes, it was worn by the professors of many of Europe's new universities. Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square violet caps and violet robes, or black robes with violet trim.\n\nViolet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance. Angels and the Virgin Mary were often portrayed wearing violet robes. The 15th-century Florentine painter [[Cennino Cennini]] advised artists: \"If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lacca, ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other)...\"  For fresco painters, he advised a less-expensive version, made of a mixture of blue indigo and red [[hematite]].<ref>Lara Broecke, ''Cennino cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 115</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:The Wilton Diptych (Right).jpg|The [[Wilton Diptych]] (1395), painted for King [[Richard II]].\nFile:Rafael - Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o de Cristo (detalhe - anjo).jpg|A violet-clad angel from the ''[[Resurrection of Christ (Raphael)|Resurrection of Christ]]'' by Raphael (1483\u20131520).\n</gallery>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\nIn the 18th century, violet was a color worn by royalty, aristocrats and the wealthy, and by both men and women. Good-quality violet fabric was expensive, and beyond the reach of ordinary people.\n\nMany painters of the 19th century experimented with the uses of the color violet to capture the subtle effects of light. [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1798\u20131863) made use of violet in the sky and shadows of many of his works, such as his painting of a tiger.\n\nThe first [[cobalt violet]], the intensely red-violet cobalt arsenate, was highly toxic. Although it persisted in some paint lines into the twentieth-century, it was displaced by less toxic cobalt compounds such as cobalt phosphate. Cobalt violet appeared in the second half of the 19th century, broadening the palette of artists. Cobalt violet was used by [[Paul Signac]] (1863\u20131935), [[Claude Monet]] (1840\u20131926), and [[Georges Seurat]] (1859\u20131891).<ref>Isabel Roelofs (2012), ''La couleur expliqu\u00e9e aux artistes'', p.&nbsp;52\u201353.</ref> Today, cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt lithium phosphate, and cobalt phosphate are available for use by artists. Cobalt ammonium phosphate is the most reddish of the three. Cobalt phosphate is available in two varieties \u2014 a deep less saturated blueish type and a lighter and brighter somewhat more reddish type. Cobalt lithium phosphate is a saturated lighter-valued bluish violet. A color similar to cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt magnesium borate, was introduced in the later twentieth-century but was not deemed sufficiently lightfast for artistic use. Cobalt violet is the only truly lightfast violet pigment with relatively strong color saturation. All other light-stable violet pigments are dull by comparison. However, the high price of the pigment and the toxicity of cobalt has limited its use.\n\n[[Vincent van Gogh]] (1853\u20131890) was an avid student of color theory. He used violet in many of his paintings of the 1880s, including his paintings of irises and the swirling and mysterious skies of his starry night paintings, and often combined it with its [[complementary color]], yellow. In his painting of [[Bedroom in Arles|his bedroom in Arles]] (1888), he used several sets of complementary colors; violet and yellow, red and green, and orange and blue. In a letter about the painting to his brother Theo, he wrote, \"The color here...should be suggestive of sleep and repose in general....The walls are a pale violet. The floor is of red tiles. The wood of the bed and the chairs are fresh butter yellow, the sheet and the pillows light lemon green. The bedspread bright scarlet. The window green. The bed table orange. The bowl blue. The doors lilac....The painting should rest the head or the imagination.\"<ref>John Gage (2006), ''La Couleur dans l'art'', p.&nbsp;50\u201351. Citing Letter 554 from Van Gogh to Theo. (translation of excerpt by D.R. Siefkin)</ref>\n\nIn 1856, a young British chemist named [[William Henry Perkin]] was trying to make a synthetic [[quinine]]. His experiments produced instead an unexpected residue, which turned out to be the first synthetic [[aniline dye]], a deep violet color called [[mauveine]], or abbreviated simply to [[mauve]] (the dye being named after the lighter color of the mallow [mauve] flower). Used to dye clothes, it became extremely fashionable among the nobility and upper classes in Europe, particularly after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862. Prior to Perkin's discovery, mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear. Perkin developed an industrial process, built a factory, and produced the dye by the ton, so almost anyone could wear mauve. It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garfield, S.|year=2000|title=Mauve: How One Man Invented a Colour That Changed the World|publisher=Faber and Faber, London, UK|isbn=978-0-571-20197-6}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Charles de Bourbon, futur Carlos III.jpg|Charles de Bourbon, the future King [[Carlos III of Spain]] (1725).\nFile:Rokotov ekaterina.jpg|Portrait of Empress [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, by [[Fyodor Rokotov]].

It has the shortest wavelength of all the visible colors. It is the color the eye sees looking at light with a wavelength of between 380 and 450 nanometers.\n\nIn the traditional color wheel used by painters, violet and purple lie between red and blue. Violet is inclined toward blue, while purple is inclined toward red.\n\nViolet colors composed by mixing blue and red light are within the purple colors<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07238.html|title=Color Wheel|author=M. Roll|date=8 September 2012 |website=Colorado State University}}</ref> (the word \"purple\" is used in the common sense for any color between blue and red). In [[color theory]], a purple is a color along the [[line of purples]] on the [[CIE chromaticity diagram]] and excludes violet. Violet light from the [[rainbow]], which can be referred as spectral violet, has only short wavelengths.\n\nViolet objects are objects that reflect violet light. Objects reflecting spectral violet often appear dark, because human vision is relatively insensitive to those wavelengths. Monochromatic lamps emitting spectral-violet wavelengths can be roughly approximated by the color shown below as ''electric violet''.\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:RGB illumination.jpg|Violet on a TV or computer screen is made by mixing blue light with a less-intense red light. \n</gallery>\n\n===Chemistry \u2013 pigments and dyes===\nThe earliest violet pigments used by humans, found in prehistoric cave paintings, were made from the minerals [[manganese]] and [[hematite]]. Manganese is still used today by the [[Aranda people]], a group of [[indigenous Australians]], as a traditional pigment for coloring the skin during rituals. It is also used by the [[Hopi]] Indians of [[Arizona]] to color ritual objects.\n\nThe most famous violet-purple dye in the ancient world was [[Tyrian purple]], made from a type of sea snail called the [[murex]], found around the Mediterranean.\n\nIn western [[Polynesia]], residents of the islands made a violet dye similar to Tyrian purple from the [[sea urchin]]. In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the [[purpura (gastropod)|purpura]], found on the coasts of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Nicaragua]]. The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, and the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.<ref name=\"Anne Carichon 2000 p.&nbsp;133\">Anne Carichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p.&nbsp;133.</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, most artists made purple or violet on their paintings by combining red and blue pigments; usually blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with [[red ochre]], [[cinnabar]] or [[minium]]. They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder; using [[woad]] or [[indigo]] dye for the blue, and dye made from [[cochineal]] for the red.<ref name=\"Anne Carichon 2000 p.&nbsp;133\"/>\n\n[[Orcein]], or ''purple moss'', was another common violet dye. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, was made from a Mediterranean [[lichen]] called archil or dyer's moss ([[Roccella tinctoria]]), combined with an [[ammoniac]], usually urine. Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.<ref>Anne Carichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p.&nbsp;144.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes. Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. '''Cudbear''' is a [[dye]] extracted from [[orchil]] [[lichen]]s that can be used to dye [[wool]] and [[silk]], without the use of [[mordant]]. Cudbear was developed by Dr. Cuthbert Gordon of [[Scotland]]: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of [[ammonium carbonate]]. The mixture is then cooled and [[ammonia]] is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3\u20134 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.\n\n'''French purple''' was developed in France at about the same time. The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with [[calcium chloride]]; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.\n\n'''[[Cobalt violet]]''' is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as [[cobalt blue]], [[cerulean blue]] and [[cobalt green]]. It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists, along with [[manganese violet]].\n\n'''[[Mauveine]]''', also known as '''[[aniline]] [[purple]]''' and '''Perkin's [[mauve]]''', was the first synthetic [[organic chemistry|organic chemical]] dye,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=History \u2013 150 Years of mauveine|author=Hubner K|journal=Chemie in Unserer Zeit|year=2006|volume=40|issue=4|pages=274\u2013275|doi=10.1002/ciuz.200690054}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Perkin's Mauve: Ancestor of the Organic Chemical Industry|author=Anthony S.

It had originally been discovered in 1896, but were not synthetized until 1936, and not manufactured until the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to violet in color, and have the molecular formula C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

In [[Chinese painting]], the color violet represents the \"unity transcending the duality of [[Yin and yang]]\" and \"the ultimate harmony of the [[Cosmos|universe]]\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Varichon, Anne ''Colors:What They Mean and How to Make Them'' New York:2006 Abrams Page 138</ref> In [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] violet is associated with the [[crown chakra|Crown Chakra]].<ref name=\"color-wheel-artist.com\">https://web.archive.org/web/20170508232015/http://www.color-wheel-artist.com/meanings-of-violet.html</ref> According to surveys in Europe and the United States, violet is the color people most often associate with extravagance and individualism, the unconventional, the artificial, and ambiguity.<ref name=\"Eva Heller p. 4\">Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques''. p.&nbsp;4.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''violet'' as a color name derives from the [[Middle English]] and [[Old French]] ''violete'', in turn from the Latin ''viola'', names of the [[violet (flower)|violet]] flower.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1370.<ref>Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: 1930 McGraw-Hill Page 207</ref> \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"220\" heights=\"220\">\nFile:Viole.jpg|[[Sweet violet]] flowers\nFile:Pigment Violet 29.svg|Chemical structure of [[Pigment Violet 29|pigment violet 29]].

Purple occupies the space closer to red, between crimson and violet.<ref>''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', 5th Edition, 2003.</ref> Violet is closer to blue, and usually less intense and bright than purple.\n\nFrom the point of view of optics, violet is a real color: it occupies its own place at the end of the [[visible spectrum]], and was one of the seven [[spectral color]]s of the spectrum first described by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1672.\n\nIn the [[additive color]] system, used to create colors on a computer screen or on a color television, violet is simulated by purple, by combining blue light at high intensity with a less intense red light on a black screen. The range of purples is created by combining blue and red light of any intensities; the [[Chromaticity|chromaticities]] formed this way line along the \"[[line of purples]]\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nImage:Color icon violet v2.svg|The [[shades of violet]].\nFile:Color icon purple v2.svg|The [[shades of purple]].\nFile:Boutet 1708 color circles.jpg|In the traditional Boutet [[Color wheel|color circle]] (1708), violet is shown between blue and purple.\n</gallery>\n\n==In history and art==\n\n===Prehistory and antiquity===\nViolet is one of the oldest colors used by man. Traces of very dark violet, made by grinding the mineral [[manganese]], mixed with water or animal fat and then brushed on the cave wall or applied with the fingers, are found in the [[prehistoric cave art]] in [[Pech Merle]], in France, dating back about twenty-five thousand years. It has also been found in the [[cave of Altamira]] and [[Lascaux]].<ref>Phillip Ball (2001), ''Bright earth- Art and the Invention of Colour'', p.&nbsp;84</ref> It was sometimes used as an alternative to black charcoal. Sticks of manganese, used for drawing, have been found at sites occupied by [[Neanderthal]] man in France and Israel. From the grinding tools at various sites, it appears it may also have been used to color the body and to decorate animal skins.\n\nMore recently, the earliest dates on cave paintings have been pushed back farther than 35,000 years. Hand paintings on rock walls in Australia may be even older, dating back as far as 50,000 years.\n\nBerries of the genus [[rubus]], such as [[Blackberry|blackberries]], were a common source of dyes in antiquity. The ancient Egyptians made a kind of violet dye by combining the juice of the [[mulberry]] with crushed green grapes. The Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder]] reported that the [[Gauls]] used a violet dye made from [[bilberry]] to color the clothing of slaves. These dyes made a satisfactory purple, but it faded quickly in sunlight and when washed.<ref>Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p.&nbsp;146\u2013148</ref>\n\n===The Middle Ages and the Renaissance===\nViolet and purple retained their status as the color of emperors and princes of the church throughout the long rule of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nWhile violet was worn less frequently by Medieval and Renaissance kings and princes, it was worn by the professors of many of Europe's new universities. Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square violet caps and violet robes, or black robes with violet trim.\n\nViolet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance. Angels and the Virgin Mary were often portrayed wearing violet robes. The 15th-century Florentine painter [[Cennino Cennini]] advised artists: \"If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lacca, ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other)...\"  For fresco painters, he advised a less-expensive version, made of a mixture of blue indigo and red [[hematite]].<ref>Lara Broecke, ''Cennino cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 115</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:The Wilton Diptych (Right).jpg|The [[Wilton Diptych]] (1395), painted for King [[Richard II]].\nFile:Rafael - Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o de Cristo (detalhe - anjo).jpg|A violet-clad angel from the ''[[Resurrection of Christ (Raphael)|Resurrection of Christ]]'' by Raphael (1483\u20131520).\n</gallery>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\nIn the 18th century, violet was a color worn by royalty, aristocrats and the wealthy, and by both men and women. Good-quality violet fabric was expensive, and beyond the reach of ordinary people.\n\nMany painters of the 19th century experimented with the uses of the color violet to capture the subtle effects of light. [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1798\u20131863) made use of violet in the sky and shadows of many of his works, such as his painting of a tiger.\n\nThe first [[cobalt violet]], the intensely red-violet cobalt arsenate, was highly toxic. Although it persisted in some paint lines into the twentieth-century, it was displaced by less toxic cobalt compounds such as cobalt phosphate. Cobalt violet appeared in the second half of the 19th century, broadening the palette of artists. Cobalt violet was used by [[Paul Signac]] (1863\u20131935), [[Claude Monet]] (1840\u20131926), and [[Georges Seurat]] (1859\u20131891).<ref>Isabel Roelofs (2012), ''La couleur expliqu\u00e9e aux artistes'', p.&nbsp;52\u201353.</ref> Today, cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt lithium phosphate, and cobalt phosphate are available for use by artists. Cobalt ammonium phosphate is the most reddish of the three. Cobalt phosphate is available in two varieties \u2014 a deep less saturated blueish type and a lighter and brighter somewhat more reddish type. Cobalt lithium phosphate is a saturated lighter-valued bluish violet. A color similar to cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt magnesium borate, was introduced in the later twentieth-century but was not deemed sufficiently lightfast for artistic use. Cobalt violet is the only truly lightfast violet pigment with relatively strong color saturation. All other light-stable violet pigments are dull by comparison. However, the high price of the pigment and the toxicity of cobalt has limited its use.\n\n[[Vincent van Gogh]] (1853\u20131890) was an avid student of color theory. He used violet in many of his paintings of the 1880s, including his paintings of irises and the swirling and mysterious skies of his starry night paintings, and often combined it with its [[complementary color]], yellow. In his painting of [[Bedroom in Arles|his bedroom in Arles]] (1888), he used several sets of complementary colors; violet and yellow, red and green, and orange and blue. In a letter about the painting to his brother Theo, he wrote, \"The color here...should be suggestive of sleep and repose in general....The walls are a pale violet. The floor is of red tiles. The wood of the bed and the chairs are fresh butter yellow, the sheet and the pillows light lemon green. The bedspread bright scarlet. The window green. The bed table orange. The bowl blue. The doors lilac....The painting should rest the head or the imagination.\"<ref>John Gage (2006), ''La Couleur dans l'art'', p.&nbsp;50\u201351. Citing Letter 554 from Van Gogh to Theo. (translation of excerpt by D.R. Siefkin)</ref>\n\nIn 1856, a young British chemist named [[William Henry Perkin]] was trying to make a synthetic [[quinine]]. His experiments produced instead an unexpected residue, which turned out to be the first synthetic [[aniline dye]], a deep violet color called [[mauveine]], or abbreviated simply to [[mauve]] (the dye being named after the lighter color of the mallow [mauve] flower). Used to dye clothes, it became extremely fashionable among the nobility and upper classes in Europe, particularly after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862. Prior to Perkin's discovery, mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear. Perkin developed an industrial process, built a factory, and produced the dye by the ton, so almost anyone could wear mauve. It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garfield, S.|year=2000|title=Mauve: How One Man Invented a Colour That Changed the World|publisher=Faber and Faber, London, UK|isbn=978-0-571-20197-6}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Charles de Bourbon, futur Carlos III.jpg|Charles de Bourbon, the future King [[Carlos III of Spain]] (1725).\nFile:Rokotov ekaterina.jpg|Portrait of Empress [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, by [[Fyodor Rokotov]].

It has the shortest wavelength of all the visible colors. It is the color the eye sees looking at light with a wavelength of between 380 and 450 nanometers.\n\nIn the traditional color wheel used by painters, violet and purple lie between red and blue. Violet is inclined toward blue, while purple is inclined toward red.\n\nViolet colors composed by mixing blue and red light are within the purple colors<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07238.html|title=Color Wheel|author=M. Roll|date=8 September 2012 |website=Colorado State University}}</ref> (the word \"purple\" is used in the common sense for any color between blue and red). In [[color theory]], a purple is a color along the [[line of purples]] on the [[CIE chromaticity diagram]] and excludes violet. Violet light from the [[rainbow]], which can be referred as spectral violet, has only short wavelengths.\n\nViolet objects are objects that reflect violet light. Objects reflecting spectral violet often appear dark, because human vision is relatively insensitive to those wavelengths. Monochromatic lamps emitting spectral-violet wavelengths can be roughly approximated by the color shown below as ''electric violet''.\n\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:RGB illumination.jpg|Violet on a TV or computer screen is made by mixing blue light with a less-intense red light. \n</gallery>\n\n===Chemistry \u2013 pigments and dyes===\nThe earliest violet pigments used by humans, found in prehistoric cave paintings, were made from the minerals [[manganese]] and [[hematite]]. Manganese is still used today by the [[Aranda people]], a group of [[indigenous Australians]], as a traditional pigment for coloring the skin during rituals. It is also used by the [[Hopi]] Indians of [[Arizona]] to color ritual objects.\n\nThe most famous violet-purple dye in the ancient world was [[Tyrian purple]], made from a type of sea snail called the [[murex]], found around the Mediterranean.\n\nIn western [[Polynesia]], residents of the islands made a violet dye similar to Tyrian purple from the [[sea urchin]]. In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the [[purpura (gastropod)|purpura]], found on the coasts of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Nicaragua]]. The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, and the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.<ref name=\"Anne Carichon 2000 p.&nbsp;133\">Anne Carichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p.&nbsp;133.</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, most artists made purple or violet on their paintings by combining red and blue pigments; usually blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with [[red ochre]], [[cinnabar]] or [[minium]]. They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder; using [[woad]] or [[indigo]] dye for the blue, and dye made from [[cochineal]] for the red.<ref name=\"Anne Carichon 2000 p.&nbsp;133\"/>\n\n[[Orcein]], or ''purple moss'', was another common violet dye. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, was made from a Mediterranean [[lichen]] called archil or dyer's moss ([[Roccella tinctoria]]), combined with an [[ammoniac]], usually urine. Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.<ref>Anne Carichon (2000), ''Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples''. p.&nbsp;144.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes. Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. '''Cudbear''' is a [[dye]] extracted from [[orchil]] [[lichen]]s that can be used to dye [[wool]] and [[silk]], without the use of [[mordant]]. Cudbear was developed by Dr. Cuthbert Gordon of [[Scotland]]: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of [[ammonium carbonate]]. The mixture is then cooled and [[ammonia]] is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3\u20134 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.\n\n'''French purple''' was developed in France at about the same time. The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with [[calcium chloride]]; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.\n\n'''[[Cobalt violet]]''' is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as [[cobalt blue]], [[cerulean blue]] and [[cobalt green]]. It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists, along with [[manganese violet]].\n\n'''[[Mauveine]]''', also known as '''[[aniline]] [[purple]]''' and '''Perkin's [[mauve]]''', was the first synthetic [[organic chemistry|organic chemical]] dye,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=History \u2013 150 Years of mauveine|author=Hubner K|journal=Chemie in Unserer Zeit|year=2006|volume=40|issue=4|pages=274\u2013275|doi=10.1002/ciuz.200690054}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Perkin's Mauve: Ancestor of the Organic Chemical Industry|author=Anthony S.

It had originally been discovered in 1896, but were not synthetized until 1936, and not manufactured until the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to violet in color, and have the molecular formula C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

At the same time, some settlers were quite aware they were usurping the Aborigines place in Australia. In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right \u2013 the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"\nMany events illustrate violence and resistance as Aborigines sought to protect their lands from invasion and as settlers and pastoralists attempted to establish their presence. In May 1804, at Risdon Cove, Van Diemen's Land, perhaps 60 Aborigines were killed when they approached the town.\n\nA sparsely-populated continental nation with a predominantly European population, [[History of Australia|Australia]] has long feared being overwhelmed by the heavily populated Asian countries to its north. The standard policy after 1900 was \"[[White Australia]]\" which encouraged immigration from Britain, was suspicious of immigrants from Germany and elsewhere in Europe, and which was quite hostile to immigrants from Asia or the Pacific islands.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Jensen |first = Richard | title = Comparative nativism: the United States, Canada and Australia, 1880s\u20131910s | journal = Canadian Issues | pages = 45\u201355 | publisher = [[Association for Canadian Studies]] | date = Spring 2009 | url = https://acs-aec.ca/en/publications/canadian-issues/borders-boundaries/buy-now/ | ref = harv }}</ref>  After World War II, most Australians agreed that the country must \"populate or perish\".

V. Evatt]] was a defender of the [[White Australia Policy]]. There was a strong view in Australia that any softening of the White Australia stance might result in cheaper labour being imported from overseas. Another prevailing sentiment was that multiculturalism resulted in instability. Evatt, opposing resolutions which could have led to more Asian immigration to Australia, told the Chinese delegation at San Francisco: \n<blockquote>You have always insisted on the right to determine the composition of your own people. Australia wants that right now. What you are attempting to do now, Japan attempted after the last war [the First World War] and was prevented by Australia. Had we opened New Guinea and Australia to Japanese immigration then the Pacific War by now might have ended disastrously and we might have had another shambles like that experienced in Malaya.<ref>https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/dr-evatt-goes-to-san-francisco/</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother (ALP) [[Leader of the Labor Party]] from 1960\u20131967 [[Arthur Calwell]] supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.<ref>Calwell, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', 117</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was the high-profile historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \"cluster of tribes\". In his 1984 book ''[[All for Australia]]'', Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to \"emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians\" and also for tending to be \"anti-British\", even though \"people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.\"\n\nAccording to Blainey, such a policy, with its \"emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,\" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\" and warned that \"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\"<ref>Blainey, G. (1984). ''All For Australia'', North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes ({{ISBN|0-454-00828-7}})</ref>\n\nIn one of his numerous criticisms of [[multiculturalism]], Blainey wrote:\n\n<blockquote>For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.</blockquote>\n\nBlainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\".\n\nIn the 1996 election [[Pauline Hanson]] was elected to the federal seat of [[Division of Oxley|Oxley]]. In her controversial maiden speech to the House of Representatives, she expressed her belief that Australia \"was in danger of being swamped by Asians\".

Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]], cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the [[Bracero Program]] that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.\n\nOn a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1969, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]] and U.S. Senator [[Walter Mondale]].{{citation needed|date = May 2017}} In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HAd4W9OdLX0C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=UFW+report+undocumented#PPA197,M1|title=Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants and the Politics of Ethnicity|first=David Gregory|last=Guti\u00e9rrez|year=1995|pages=97\u201398|publisher=University of California Press|location=San Diego|isbn=9780520916869}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2003/03/05.html|title=Why Journalists Support Illegal Immigration|publisher=Accuracy in the Media|first1=Reed|last1=Irvine|first2=Cliff|last2=Kincaid|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ewnEO2GvkFIC&pg=PA89&dq=ufw+undocumented#PPA90,M1|title=Strawberry Fields: Politics, Class, and Work in California Agriculture|first=Miriam J.|last=Wells|pages=89\u201390|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=9780801482793}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PnUgAAAAMAAJ&dq=ufw+undocumented&q=crack+down#search|title=Beyond the Border: Mexico & the U.S. Today|first1=Peter|last1=Baird|first2=Ed|last2=McCaughan|page=169|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|isbn=9780916024376|year=1979}}</ref><ref>Farmworker Collective Bargaining, 1979: Hearings Before the Committee on Labor Human Resources Hearings held in Salinas, Calif., April 26, 27, and Washington, D.C., May 24, 1979</ref>\n\nIn 1973, the United Farm Workers set up a \"wet line\" along the [[United States-Mexico border]] to prevent Mexican immigrants from entering the United States illegally and potentially undermining the UFW's unionization efforts.<ref>[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=217_0_3_0 \"PBS Airs Ch\u00e1vez Documentary\"], University of California at Davis \u2013 Rural Migration News.</ref> During one such event, in which Chavez was not involved, some [[UFW]] members, under the guidance of Chavez's cousin Manuel, physically attacked the strikebreakers after peaceful attempts to persuade them not to cross the border failed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=raNFo6Tvmt0C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=cesar+chavez+undocumented|title=Cesar Chavez: A Brief Biography with Documents|first=Richard W.|last=Etulain|page=18|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=9780312294274}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-12-29/columns/ask-a-mexican/|title=The year in Mexican-bashing|first=Gustavo|last=Arellano|newspaper=OC Weekly|accessdate=June 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609052417/http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-12-29/columns/ask-a-mexican/|archive-date=9 June 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/op-ed/navarrette/20050330-9999-lz1e30navar.html|title=The Arizona Minutemen and C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez|newspaper=San Diego Union Tribune|first=Ruben|last=Navarrette Jr.|date=March 30, 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805204302/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/op-ed/navarrette/20050330-9999-lz1e30navar.html|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Bernie Sanders]] opposes guest worker programs<ref name=\"Jamieson 2013\">{{cite web |last=Jamieson |first=Dave |date=19 June 2013 |title=Senator Sounds Alarm On Teen Unemployment |website=The Huffington Post |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/bernie-sanders-immigration-reform_n_3467243.html |accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> and he is also skeptical of skilled immigrant ([[H-1B]]) visas, saying,:\"Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies.

In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right \u2013 the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"\nMany events illustrate violence and resistance as Aborigines sought to protect their lands from invasion and as settlers and pastoralists attempted to establish their presence. In May 1804, at Risdon Cove, Van Diemen's Land, perhaps 60 Aborigines were killed when they approached the town.\n\nA sparsely-populated continental nation with a predominantly European population, [[History of Australia|Australia]] has long feared being overwhelmed by the heavily populated Asian countries to its north. The standard policy after 1900 was \"[[White Australia]]\" which encouraged immigration from Britain, was suspicious of immigrants from Germany and elsewhere in Europe, and which was quite hostile to immigrants from Asia or the Pacific islands.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Jensen |first = Richard | title = Comparative nativism: the United States, Canada and Australia, 1880s\u20131910s | journal = Canadian Issues | pages = 45\u201355 | publisher = [[Association for Canadian Studies]] | date = Spring 2009 | url = https://acs-aec.ca/en/publications/canadian-issues/borders-boundaries/buy-now/ | ref = harv }}</ref>  After World War II, most Australians agreed that the country must \"populate or perish\". Immigration brought people from traditional sources such as the [[British Isles]] along with, for the first time, large numbers of Southern and Central Europeans.

V. Evatt]] was a defender of the [[White Australia Policy]]. There was a strong view in Australia that any softening of the White Australia stance might result in cheaper labour being imported from overseas. Another prevailing sentiment was that multiculturalism resulted in instability. Evatt, opposing resolutions which could have led to more Asian immigration to Australia, told the Chinese delegation at San Francisco: \n<blockquote>You have always insisted on the right to determine the composition of your own people. Australia wants that right now. What you are attempting to do now, Japan attempted after the last war [the First World War] and was prevented by Australia. Had we opened New Guinea and Australia to Japanese immigration then the Pacific War by now might have ended disastrously and we might have had another shambles like that experienced in Malaya.<ref>https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/dr-evatt-goes-to-san-francisco/</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother (ALP) [[Leader of the Labor Party]] from 1960\u20131967 [[Arthur Calwell]] supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.<ref>Calwell, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', 117</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was the high-profile historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \"cluster of tribes\". In his 1984 book ''[[All for Australia]]'', Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to \"emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians\" and also for tending to be \"anti-British\", even though \"people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.\"\n\nAccording to Blainey, such a policy, with its \"emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,\" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\" and warned that \"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\"<ref>Blainey, G. (1984). ''All For Australia'', North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes ({{ISBN|0-454-00828-7}})</ref>\n\nIn one of his numerous criticisms of [[multiculturalism]], Blainey wrote:\n\n<blockquote>For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.</blockquote>\n\nBlainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\".\n\nIn the 1996 election [[Pauline Hanson]] was elected to the federal seat of [[Division of Oxley|Oxley]]. In her controversial maiden speech to the House of Representatives, she expressed her belief that Australia \"was in danger of being swamped by Asians\". Hanson went on to form the [[One Nation Party]], which initially won nearly one quarter of the vote in [[Queensland]] state elections before entering a period of decline due to internal disputes.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Goot |first = Murray | title = Pauline Hanson's One Nation: extreme right, centre party or extreme left? | journal = Labour History | volume = 89 |issue = 89 | pages = 101\u2013119 | publisher = Australian Society for the Study of Labour History (ASSLH) | doi = 10.2307/27516078 | jstor = 27516078 | date = November 2005 | ref = harv }}</ref> The name \"One Nation\" was meant to signify national unity, in contrast to what Hanson claimed to see as an increasing division in Australian society caused by government policies favouring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Ben-Moshe |first = Danny | title = One Nation and the Australian far right | journal = [[Patterns of Prejudice]] | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 24\u201340 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/003132201128811205 | date = July 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nSome Australians reacted angrily to One Nation, as Hanson was subjected to water balloons filled with urine at public speeches, ridiculed in the media, and received so many death threats she filmed a \"good-bye video\" in the case of her assassination.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Scalmer |first = Sean | title = From contestation to autonomy: the staging and framing of anti-Hanson contention | journal = [[Australian Journal of Politics and History]] | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 209\u2013224 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-8497.00228 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> She was imprisoned by the government on political corruption charges, which were dropped after her imprisonment.

However, nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its [[European Americans|Euro-American]] members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], and seeing that they were strictly enforced.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Lane |first = A.T. | title = American trade unions, mass immigration and the literacy test: 1900\u20131917 | journal = [[Labor History (journal)|Labor History]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201325 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00236568408584739 | date = January 1984 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nMink (1986) concludes that the link between the AFL and the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.<ref>{{cite book | last = Mink | first = Gwendolyn | title = Old labor and new immigrants in American political development: union, party, and state, 1875\u20131920 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 1986 | isbn = 9780801418631 | url = https://archive.org/details/oldlabornewimmig00mink }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Farm Workers]] was committed to restricting immigration during [[Cesar Chavez]] tenure. Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]], cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the [[Bracero Program]] that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.\n\nOn a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1969, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]] and U.S. Senator [[Walter Mondale]].{{citation needed|date = May 2017}} In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HAd4W9OdLX0C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=UFW+report+undocumented#PPA197,M1|title=Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants and the Politics of Ethnicity|first=David Gregory|last=Guti\u00e9rrez|year=1995|pages=97\u201398|publisher=University of California Press|location=San Diego|isbn=9780520916869}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2003/03/05.html|title=Why Journalists Support Illegal Immigration|publisher=Accuracy in the Media|first1=Reed|last1=Irvine|first2=Cliff|last2=Kincaid|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ewnEO2GvkFIC&pg=PA89&dq=ufw+undocumented#PPA90,M1|title=Strawberry Fields: Politics, Class, and Work in California Agriculture|first=Miriam J.|last=Wells|pages=89\u201390|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=9780801482793}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PnUgAAAAMAAJ&dq=ufw+undocumented&q=crack+down#search|title=Beyond the Border: Mexico & the U.S. Today|first1=Peter|last1=Baird|first2=Ed|last2=McCaughan|page=169|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|isbn=9780916024376|year=1979}}</ref><ref>Farmworker Collective Bargaining, 1979: Hearings Before the Committee on Labor Human Resources Hearings held in Salinas, Calif., April 26, 27, and Washington, D.C., May 24, 1979</ref>\n\nIn 1973, the United Farm Workers set up a \"wet line\" along the [[United States-Mexico border]] to prevent Mexican immigrants from entering the United States illegally and potentially undermining the UFW's unionization efforts.<ref>[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=217_0_3_0 \"PBS Airs Ch\u00e1vez Documentary\"], University of California at Davis \u2013 Rural Migration News.</ref> During one such event, in which Chavez was not involved, some [[UFW]] members, under the guidance of Chavez's cousin Manuel, physically attacked the strikebreakers after peaceful attempts to persuade them not to cross the border failed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=raNFo6Tvmt0C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=cesar+chavez+undocumented|title=Cesar Chavez: A Brief Biography with Documents|first=Richard W.|last=Etulain|page=18|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=9780312294274}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-12-29/columns/ask-a-mexican/|title=The year in Mexican-bashing|first=Gustavo|last=Arellano|newspaper=OC Weekly|accessdate=June 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609052417/http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-12-29/columns/ask-a-mexican/|archive-date=9 June 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/op-ed/navarrette/20050330-9999-lz1e30navar.html|title=The Arizona Minutemen and C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez|newspaper=San Diego Union Tribune|first=Ruben|last=Navarrette Jr.|date=March 30, 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805204302/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/op-ed/navarrette/20050330-9999-lz1e30navar.html|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Bernie Sanders]] opposes guest worker programs<ref name=\"Jamieson 2013\">{{cite web |last=Jamieson |first=Dave |date=19 June 2013 |title=Senator Sounds Alarm On Teen Unemployment |website=The Huffington Post |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/bernie-sanders-immigration-reform_n_3467243.html |accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> and he is also skeptical of skilled immigrant ([[H-1B]]) visas, saying,:\"Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies.

Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo.

According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''.

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]].

In [[2008 Allsvenskan|2008]], Hammarby finished ninth, but [[2009 Allsvenskan|2009]] was a disastrous year where the team finished last in the league and was relegated to the second tier known as [[Superettan]].\n\n===2010\u20132014: Superettan===\nThe [[2010 Superettan]] was a letdown for supporters who had hoped to make the visit to Sweden's second tier short, as the team finished 8th. In the [[2010 Svenska Cupen]], Hammarby fared better, winning against multiple Allsvenskan opponents, until the finals where the team lost 0\u20131 to [[Helsingborgs IF]]. In the [[2011 Superettan]] season, the club finished in a tie for 11th, its worst overall ranking in 64 years. The club was almost relocated to the third tier, until a game-winning kick in the season's final match against \u00c4ngelholm. After the season of 2011, Hammarby dismantled their development team [[Hammarby Talang FF|HTFF]], which was established in 2003. In [[2012 Superettan]], the club finished fourth, and in [[2013 Superettan]] the club finished fifth. In 2014, in the last round of the season, Hammarby were promoted to the first tier, [[Allsvenskan]], by finishing first in [[Superettan]].\n\n===2015\u2013: Top-flight comeback===\nThe 2015 season started off well, with Hammarby managing an impressive 1\u20132 away win against local rivals [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] in the [[2014\u201315 Svenska Cupen|2015 Swedish Cup]], which also was the first Stockholm derby involving Hammarby since 2009. This was followed up with a 2\u20130 win in the season opener against [[BK H\u00e4cken]], and in the fourth round Hammarby defeated their other local rivals [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rdens IF]] with 2\u20131. The summer was, however, tougher for the club, with Hammarby playing 10 consecutive league games without winning, before managing to defeat [[Falkenbergs FF]] at home with 3\u20130. Eventually, Hammarby finished at 11th place in their first Allsvenskan season since 2009.\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 seasons showed only a slight improvement for Hammarby, with the team ending in the ninth position in both years in the league. Hammarby fared better in the local derbys. In 2016 Hammarby defeated the local rival [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rden]] in all three fixtures. In 2017 the first encounter ended with a draw and the second with a Hammarby victory. The second local rival, [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], managed to defeat Hammarby by 3\u20130 in the first encounter in the league and a draw (0\u20130) in the second. Hammarby however beat AIK in the Swedish cup, earlier in the year. In 2017 the Hammarby - AIK encounters ended with one Hammarby win and one draw. Both Djurg\u00e5rden and AIK, however, fared much better overall than Hammarby in the league.\n\nThe club fared much better in 2018 under the reign of new manager [[Stefan Billborn]], finishing 4th in the league. In 2019, Hammarby started the league play in a mediocre fashion, but made a strong finish to the season (with eight straight wins during between match day 22 and 30) and ultimately finished 3rd in Allsvenskan. This meant that the club qualified for the [[2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League]], their first continental competition in over ten years.<ref name=\"season\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/aktuellt/nyheter/atta-raka-rackte-inte-stora-silvret-till-bajen/|title=\u00c5tta raka r\u00e4ckte inte \u2013 lilla silvret till Bajen|date=2 November 2019|publisher=Hammarby Fotboll|accessdate=4 November 2019|language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n==Colours, badge and kit==\n===Colours and badge===\nWhen Hammarby Roddf\u00f6rening (Hammarby RF) was founded in 1889, the club's crest consisted of a white flag with three green horizontal lines.

With star players [[Kenneth Ohlsson]] and [[Ronnie Hellstr\u00f6m]], and with a crowd that tried out supporter songs for the first time, the club went through the autumn half undefeated and finished in fifth place, its best showing in Allsvenskan. The club would stay in Allsvenskan through the rest of the 1970s, attracting large crowds, despite not returning above fifth place. Also in 1978, the club changed from black/yellow to green/white colours.\n\nIn the [[1982 Allsvenskan|1982 season]], Swedish football introduced a playoff system for the top 8 teams in Allsvenskan to decide a champion. The playoffs consisted of [[Two-legged tie|two matches]] in which the aggregate score would determine who would advance. The club had placed second overall that season and had not lost a home game. After defeating [[\u00d6rgryte IS|\u00d6rgryte]] in the quarter-finals, and coming back from a 1\u20133 deficit to beat [[IF Elfsborg|Elfsborg]] 4\u20133 in the semi-finals, Hammarby was in the final against [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]].

In the [[Svenska Cupen]] tournament, Hammarby reached the finals but lost against IFK. However, since IFK qualified for the UEFA Cup that year, Hammarby qualified for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], its first major international competition, where the club lost to Finland's [[FC Haka]] in the second round.

In [[2006 Allsvenskan]], Hammarby placed third overall and advanced to the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], where they won their third round match, which advanced the team to the second qualifying and first rounds of the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup]].\n\nIn [[2007 Allsvenskan|2007]], Bajen finished on the sixth place, and didn't qualify for any European cups. In [[2008 Allsvenskan|2008]], Hammarby finished ninth, but [[2009 Allsvenskan|2009]] was a disastrous year where the team finished last in the league and was relegated to the second tier known as [[Superettan]].\n\n===2010\u20132014: Superettan===\nThe [[2010 Superettan]] was a letdown for supporters who had hoped to make the visit to Sweden's second tier short, as the team finished 8th. In the [[2010 Svenska Cupen]], Hammarby fared better, winning against multiple Allsvenskan opponents, until the finals where the team lost 0\u20131 to [[Helsingborgs IF]]. In the [[2011 Superettan]] season, the club finished in a tie for 11th, its worst overall ranking in 64 years. The club was almost relocated to the third tier, until a game-winning kick in the season's final match against \u00c4ngelholm. After the season of 2011, Hammarby dismantled their development team [[Hammarby Talang FF|HTFF]], which was established in 2003. In [[2012 Superettan]], the club finished fourth, and in [[2013 Superettan]] the club finished fifth. In 2014, in the last round of the season, Hammarby were promoted to the first tier, [[Allsvenskan]], by finishing first in [[Superettan]].\n\n===2015\u2013: Top-flight comeback===\nThe 2015 season started off well, with Hammarby managing an impressive 1\u20132 away win against local rivals [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] in the [[2014\u201315 Svenska Cupen|2015 Swedish Cup]], which also was the first Stockholm derby involving Hammarby since 2009. This was followed up with a 2\u20130 win in the season opener against [[BK H\u00e4cken]], and in the fourth round Hammarby defeated their other local rivals [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rdens IF]] with 2\u20131. The summer was, however, tougher for the club, with Hammarby playing 10 consecutive league games without winning, before managing to defeat [[Falkenbergs FF]] at home with 3\u20130. Eventually, Hammarby finished at 11th place in their first Allsvenskan season since 2009.\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 seasons showed only a slight improvement for Hammarby, with the team ending in the ninth position in both years in the league. Hammarby fared better in the local derbys. In 2016 Hammarby defeated the local rival [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rden]] in all three fixtures. In 2017 the first encounter ended with a draw and the second with a Hammarby victory. The second local rival, [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], managed to defeat Hammarby by 3\u20130 in the first encounter in the league and a draw (0\u20130) in the second. Hammarby however beat AIK in the Swedish cup, earlier in the year. In 2017 the Hammarby - AIK encounters ended with one Hammarby win and one draw. Both Djurg\u00e5rden and AIK, however, fared much better overall than Hammarby in the league.\n\nThe club fared much better in 2018 under the reign of new manager [[Stefan Billborn]], finishing 4th in the league. In 2019, Hammarby started the league play in a mediocre fashion, but made a strong finish to the season (with eight straight wins during between match day 22 and 30) and ultimately finished 3rd in Allsvenskan. This meant that the club qualified for the [[2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League]], their first continental competition in over ten years.<ref name=\"season\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/aktuellt/nyheter/atta-raka-rackte-inte-stora-silvret-till-bajen/|title=\u00c5tta raka r\u00e4ckte inte \u2013 lilla silvret till Bajen|date=2 November 2019|publisher=Hammarby Fotboll|accessdate=4 November 2019|language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n==Colours, badge and kit==\n===Colours and badge===\nWhen Hammarby Roddf\u00f6rening (Hammarby RF) was founded in 1889, the club's crest consisted of a white flag with three green horizontal lines. It drew inspiration from two other competing rowing clubs in Stockholm that used two blue and two red lines respectively on a white flag, but chose the colour green since it represented hope.

Between 1982 and 1990 a [[Allsvenskan play-offs|play-off]] in cup format was held at the end of the league season to decide the champions. After the play-off format in 1991 and 1992 the title was decided by the winner of [[M\u00e4sterskapsserien]], an additional league after the end of Allsvenskan. Since the 1993 season the title has once again been awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/historik/ | title=Svenska m\u00e4stare 1896\u20131925, 1931\u2013 |work=svenskfotboll.se|accessdate=25 November 2009|language=Swedish}}</ref>|name=Swedish champions|group=upper-alpha}}\n** '''Winners (1):''' 2001\n\n====League====\n* '''[[Allsvenskan]]:'''\n** '''Winners (1):''' 2001\n** Runners-up (2): 1982, 2003\n* '''[[Superettan]]:'''\n** '''Winners (1):''' 2014\n* '''[[Division 1 Norra]]:'''\n** '''Winners (3):''' 1989, 1993, 1997\n** Runners-up (1): 1996\n* '''[[Division 1 \u00d6stra]]:'''\n** '''Winners (1):''' 1991\n\n====Cups====\n* '''[[Svenska Cupen]]:'''\n** Runners-up (3): 1977, 1983, 2010\n* '''[[Svenska M\u00e4sterskapet]]:'''\n** Runners-up (1): 1922\n\n===European===\n* '''[[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]:'''\n** '''Winners (1):''' 2007<ref>[http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/intertotocup/index.html uefa.com&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Intertoto Cup].

{"title_page": "Normal-form game", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Matrix game|Chris Engle's game|Storytelling game#Alternate form role-playing games|the publisher|Matrix Games}}\nIn [[game theory]], '''normal form''' is a description of a ''game''. Unlike [[extensive-form game|extensive form]], normal-form representations are not graphical ''per se'', but rather represent the game by way of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. While this approach can be of greater use in identifying [[strictly dominated strategies]] and [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]], some information is lost as compared to extensive-form representations. The normal-form representation of a game includes all perceptible and conceivable [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]], and their corresponding payoffs, for each player.\n\nIn static games of [[complete information|complete]], [[perfect information]], a normal-form representation of a game is a specification of players' strategy spaces and payoff functions. A strategy space for a player is the set of all strategies available to that player, whereas a strategy is a complete plan of action for every stage of the game, regardless of whether that stage actually arises in play. A payoff function for a player is a mapping from the cross-product of players' strategy spaces to that player's set of payoffs (normally the set of real numbers, where the number represents a [[cardinal utility|cardinal]] or [[ordinal utility]]\u2014often cardinal in the normal-form representation) of a player, i.e. the payoff function of a player takes as its input a strategy profile (that is a specification of strategies for every player) and yields a representation of payoff as its output.\n\n== An example ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin-left:1em;\"\n|+ A normal-form game\n! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|<br />Player 1}}|{{color|#900|Player 2}}}}\n! scope=\"col\" | {{color|#900|Left}}\n! scope=\"col\" | {{color|#900|Right}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | {{color|#009|Top}}\n| {{color|#009|4}}, {{color|#900|3}}\n| {{color|#009|\u22121}}, {{color|#900|\u22121}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | {{color|#009|Bottom}}\n| {{color|#009|0}}, {{color|#900|0}}\n| {{color|#009|3}}, {{color|#900|4}}\n|}\n\nThe matrix provided is a normal-form representation of a game in which players move simultaneously (or at least do not observe the other player's move before making their own) and receive the payoffs as specified for the combinations of actions played. For example, if player 1 plays top and player 2 plays left, player 1 receives 4 and player 2 receives 3. In each cell, the first number represents the payoff to the row player (in this case player 1), and the second number represents the payoff to the column player (in this case player 2).\n\n=== Other representations ===\n[[File:2x2chart110602.pdf|thumb|A partial topology of two-player, two-strategy games, including such games as [[Prisoner's dilemma]], [[Stag hunt]], and [[Chicken (game)|Chicken]]]]\n\nOften, [[symmetric game]]s (where the payoffs do not depend on which player chooses each action) are represented with only one payoff. This is the payoff for the row player. For example, the payoff matrices on the right and left below represent the same game.\n\n{| style=\"margin:0 auto;text-align:center;\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ align=\"bottom\"|''Both players''\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!

''Hare''\n|-\n! ''Stag''\n| 3\n| 0\n|-\n! ''Hare''\n| 2\n| 2\n|}\n|}\n\nThe topological space of games with related payoff matrices can also be mapped, with adjacent games having the most similar matrices. This shows how incremental incentive changes can change the game.\n\n== Uses of normal form ==\n\n=== Dominated strategies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\"|''The Prisoner's Dilemma''\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!

''Defect''\n| 0, \u22125\n| \u22122, \u22122\n|}\n\nThe payoff matrix facilitates elimination of [[dominated strategy|dominated strategies]], and it is usually used to illustrate this concept. For example, in the [[prisoner's dilemma]], we can see that each prisoner can either \"cooperate\" or \"defect\". If exactly one prisoner defects, he gets off easily and the other prisoner is locked up for a long time. However, if they both defect, they will both be locked up for a shorter time. One can determine that ''Cooperate'' is strictly dominated by ''Defect''. One must compare the first numbers in each column, in this case 0 > \u22121 and \u22122 > \u22125. This shows that no matter what the column player chooses, the row player does better by choosing ''Defect''. Similarly, one compares the second payoff in each row; again 0 > \u22121 and \u22122 > \u22125. This shows that no matter what row does, column does better by choosing ''Defect''. This demonstrates the unique [[Nash equilibrium]] of this game is (''Defect'', ''Defect'').\n\n=== Sequential games in normal form ===\n[[File:SGPNEandPlainNE explainingexample.svg|300px|thumb|Both extensive and normal form illustration of a sequential game with subgame imperfect and perfect Nash equilibria marked with red and blue respectively.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\"|''A sequential game''\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!

The above matrix does not represent the game in which player 1 moves first, observed by player 2, and then player 2 moves, because it does not specify each of player 2's strategies in this case. In order to represent this [[sequential game]] we must specify all of player 2's actions, even in contingencies that can never arise in the course of the game. In this game, player 2 has actions, as before, ''Left'' and ''Right''. Unlike before he has four strategies, contingent on player 1's actions. The strategies are:\n# ''Left if player 1 plays Top and Left otherwise''\n# ''Left if player 1 plays Top and Right otherwise''\n# ''Right if player 1 plays Top and Left otherwise''\n# ''Right if player 1 plays Top and Right otherwise''\nOn the right is the normal-form representation of this game.\n\n== General formulation ==\n\nIn order for a game to be in normal form, we are provided with the following data:\n\n* There is a finite set ''P'' of players, which we label {1, 2, ..., ''m''}\n* Each player ''k'' in ''P'' has a finite number of [[pure strategy|pure strategies]]\n\n::<math> S_k = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n_k\\}. </math>\n\nA '''{{vanchor|pure strategy profile}}''' is an association of strategies to players, that is an ''m''-[[tuple]]\n\n:<math> \\vec{s} = (s_1, s_2, \\ldots,s_m) </math>\n\nsuch that\n\n:<math> s_1 \\in S_1, s_2 \\in S_2, \\ldots, s_m \\in S_m </math>\n\nA '''{{vanchor|payoff function}}''' is a function\n\n:<math> F_i: S_1 \\times S_2 \\times \\ldots \\times S_m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}. </math>\n\nwhose intended interpretation is the award given to a single player at the outcome of the game.
