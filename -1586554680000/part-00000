It became part of the [[Eclipse Award]]s program in 1971.\n\nThe award originated in 1936 when both ''Turf & Sports Digest'' (TSD) the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' (DRF) began naming an annual champion. Starting in 1950, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) began naming its own champion. The following list provides the name of the horses chosen by these organizations. The only disagreement came in 1968, when Turf & Sports Digest named [[Forward Pass (horse)|Forward Pass]] as champion whereas the other two organizations voted for [[Stage Door Johnny]].\n\nChampions from 1887 through 1935 were selected retrospectively by a panel of experts as published by ''[[The Blood-Horse magazine]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/eclipsewinners/pdf/History_Charts.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904120526/http://www.bloodhorse.com/eclipsewinners/pdf/History_Charts.pdf |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |url-status=bot: unknown |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere were Co-Champions chosen retrospectively for 1876, 1882, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1893, 1894, 1904, 1906, 1917, 1923, and 1932.\n\nThe ''Daily Racing Form'', the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, and the National Turf Writers Association all joined forces in 1971 to create the Eclipse Award.\n\nAs of 2018, Bob Baffert won the award 9 times as a trainer.

This can be traced back to the 9th century, when the Islamic [[Caliphate]] began fragmenting in the [[Middle East]], where Muslim rulers in rival states began enslaving non-Muslim nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] from the Central Asian steppes, and raising many of them to become loyal military slaves called [[Mamluk]]s. Soon, [[Turkic migration|Turks were migrating]] to [[Muslim lands]] and becoming [[Islamicization|Islamicized]]. Many of the Turkic Mamluk slaves eventually rose up to become rulers, and conquered large parts of the [[Muslim world]], establishing Mamluk Sultanates from [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]] to [[Ghaznavids|Afghanistan]], before turning their attention to the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"asher\">{{citation|last1=Asher|first1=C.

Alauddin Khalji replaced the private markets with four centralized government-run markets, appointed a \"market controller\", and implemented strict price controls{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=379-380}} on all kinds of goods, \"from caps to socks; from combs to needles; from vegetables, soups, sweetmeats to [[chapati]]s\" (according to [[Ziauddin Barani]] (c. 1357){{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=105}}).

A major military contribution of the Delhi Sultanate was their successful campaigns in repelling the [[Mongol Empire]]'s [[Mongol invasions of India|invasions of India]], which could have been devastating for the Indian subcontinent, like the [[Mongol invasions]] of [[Mongol invasion of China|China]], [[Mongol invasion of Persia|Persia]] and [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Europe]]. The Delhi Sultanate's Mamluk army were skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare used by the Mongols, making them successful in repelling the [[Mongol invasions]], as was the case for the [[Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt]].

For example, a [[Sanskrit]] inscription notes that Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] repaired a Siva temple in [[Bidar]] after his [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] conquest. There was often a pattern of Delhi sultans plundering or damaging temples during conquest, and then patronizing or repairing temples after conquest. This pattern came to an end with the [[Mughal Empire]], where [[Akbar the Great]]'s chief minister [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]] criticized the excesses of earlier sultans such as [[Mahmud of Ghazni]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn many cases, the demolished remains, rocks and broken statue pieces of temples destroyed by Delhi sultans were reused to build mosques and other buildings. For example, the Qutb complex in Delhi was built from stones of 27 demolished Hindu and Jain temples by some accounts.<ref>Welch, Anthony (1993), Architectural patronage and the past: The Tughluq sultans of India, Muqarnas, Vol. 10, 311-322</ref> Similarly, the Muslim mosque in Khanapur, Maharashtra was built from the looted parts and demolished remains of Hindu temples.<ref name=\"awhc\" /> [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] destroyed Buddhist and Hindu libraries and their manuscripts at [[Nalanda]] and [[Odantapuri]] Universities in 1193 AD at the beginning of the Delhi Sultanate.<ref name=regbook/><ref>Gul and Khan (2008), [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/182 Growth and Development of Oriental Libraries in India], Library Philosophy and Practice, University of Nebrasaka-Lincoln</ref>\n\nThe first historical record of a campaign of destruction of temples and defacement of faces or heads of Hindu idols lasted from 1193 to 1194 in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh under the command of Ghuri.

The exteriors of both were very often topped by large [[dome]]s, and made extensive use of [[arch]]es.  Both of these features were hardly used in [[Hindu temple architecture]] and other indigenous Indian styles.  Both types of building essentially consist of a single large space under a high dome, and completely avoid the figurative sculpture so important to [[Hindu temple architecture]].<ref>Harle, 421, 425; Yale, 165; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nThe important [[Qutb Complex]] in Delhi was begun under [[Muhammad of Ghor]], by 1199, and continued under Qutb al-Din Aibak and later sultans.  The [[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque]], now a ruin, was the first structure.  Like other early Islamic buildings it re-used elements such as columns from destroyed Hindu and [[Jain]] temples, including one on the same site whose platform was reused.  The style was Iranian, but the arches were still [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] in the traditional Indian way.<ref>Yale, 164-165; Harle, 423-424; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nBeside it is the extremely tall [[Qutb Minar]], a [[minaret]] or victory tower, whose original four stages reach 73 meters (with a final stage added later). Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick [[Minaret of Jam]] in Afghanistan, of c.1190, a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.<ref>Also two huge minarets at [[Ghazni]].</ref>  The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns; in Delhi the shaft is [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] with \"superb [[stalactite]] bracketing under the balconies\" at the top of each stage.<ref>Yale, 164; Harle, 424 (quoted); Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>  In general [[minaret]]s were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.<ref>Harle, 429</ref>\n\nThe Tomb of [[Iltutmish]] was added by 1236; its dome, the [[squinch]]es again corbelled, is now missing, and the intricate carving has been described as having an \"angular harshness\", from carvers working in an unfamiliar tradition.<ref>Yale, 164 (quoted); Harle, 425</ref>  Other elements were added to the complex over the next two centuries.\n\nAnother very early mosque, begun in the 1190s, is the [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]] in [[Ajmer]], [[Rajasthan]], built for the same Delhi rulers, again with corbelled arches and domes.  Here Hindu temple columns (and possibly some new ones) are piled up in threes to achieve extra height.  Both mosques had large detached screens with pointed corbelled arches added in front of them, probably under Iltutmish a couple of decades later.  In these the central arch is taller, in imitation of an [[iwan]]. At Ajmer the smaller screen arches are tentatively cusped, for the first time in India.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 149-150; Harle, 425</ref>\n[[File:Tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and side tomb (3319047170).jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325), Delhi]]\n\nBy around 1300 true domes and arches with [[voussoir]]s were being built; the ruined [[Tomb of Balban]] (d. 1287) in Delhi may be the earliest survival.<ref>Harle, 425</ref>  The [[Alai Darwaza]] gatehouse at the Qutb complex, from 1311, still shows a cautious approach to the new technology, with very thick walls and a shallow dome, only visible from a certain distance or height.  Bold contrasting colours of masonry, with red [[sandstone]] and white [[marble]], introduce what was to become a common feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, substituting for the polychrome tiles used in Persia and Central Asia. The pointed arches come together slightly at their base, giving a mild [[horseshoe arch]] effect, and their internal edges are not cusped but lined with conventionalized \"spearhead\" projections, possibly representing [[lotus flower|lotus]] buds. [[Jali]], stone [[openwork]] screens, are introduced here; they already had been long used in temples.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151</ref>\n\n====Tughlaq architecture====\nThe [[tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam]] (built 1320 to 1324) in [[Multan]], Pakistan is a large octagonal brick-built [[mausoleum]] with polychrome glazed decoration that remains much closer to the styles of Iran and Afghanistan.  Timber is also used internally.  This was the earliest major monument of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320\u20131413), built during the unsustainable expansion of its massive territory. It was built for a [[Sufi saint]] rather than a sultan, and most of the many [[Tughlaq tombs]] are much less exuberant.  The tomb of the founder of the dynasty, [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325) is more austere, but impressive; like a Hindu temple, it is topped with a small [[amalaka]] and a round [[finial]] like a [[kalasha]]. Unlike the buildings mentioned previously, it completely lacks carved texts, and sits in a compound with high walls and battlements.  Both these tombs have external walls sloping slightly inwards, by 25\u00b0 in the Delhi tomb, like many fortifications including the ruined [[Tughlaqabad Fort]] opposite the tomb, intended as the new capital.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151-156; Harle, 425-426</ref>\n\nThe Tughlaqs had a corps of government architects and builders, and in this and other roles employed many Hindus.  They left many buildings, and a standardized dynastic style.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151</ref> The third sultan, [[Firuz Shah Tughluq|Firuz Shah]] (r. 1351-88) is said to have designed buildings himself, and was the longest ruler and greatest builder of the dynasty. His [[Firoz Shah Palace Complex]] (started 1354) at [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Haryana]] is a ruin, but parts are in fair condition.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 154; Harle, 425</ref>  Some buildings from his reign take forms that had been rare or unknown in Islamic buildings.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 154-156</ref>  He was buried in the large [[Hauz Khas Complex]] in Delhi, with many other buildings from his period and the later Sultanate, including several small domed [[pavilion]]s supported only by columns.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 154-156; Harle, 425</ref>\n\nBy this time Islamic architecture in India had adopted some features of earlier Indian architecture, such as the use of a high [[plinth]],<ref>Blair & Bloom, 149</ref> and often [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] around its edges, as well as columns and brackets and [[hypostyle]] halls.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 156</ref>  After the death of Firoz the Tughlaqs declined, and the following Delhi dynasties were weak. Most of the monumental buildings constructed were tombs, although the impressive [[Lodi Gardens|Lodi Gardens in Delhi]] (adorned with fountains, ''[[charbagh]]'' gardens, ponds, tombs and mosques) were constructed by the late Lodi dynasty. The architecture of other regional Muslim states was often more impressive.<ref>Harle, 426; Blair & Bloom, 156</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra (literally \"shed of 2\u00bd days\").jpg|Screen of the [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]] mosque, [[Ajmer]], c. 1229; [[Corbel arch]]es, some cusped.\nFile:Tomb of Altamash.jpg|Mausoleum of [[Iltutmish]], Delhi, by 1236, with [[corbel arch]]es\nFile:Balban Khan's Tomb 029.jpg|Possibly the first \"true\" arches in India; [[Tomb of Balban]] (d. 1287) in Delhi\nFile:The tomb of Ferozshah ii ag61.jpg|Pavilions in the [[Hauz Khas Complex]], Delhi\nFile:The Tomb of Sikander Lodi, seen from the Sheesh Gumbad.JPG|Tomb of Sikander Lodi in the [[Lodi Gardens]], Delhi\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Mongol invasions of India]] \n* [[Delhi Sultanate literature]]\n* [[Iconoclasm]]\n* [[Ibrahim Lodhi's Tomb]]\n* [[Persianate|Persianate states]]\n* [[Tomb of Bahlul Lodi]]\n* [[Turkish slaves in the Delhi Sultanate]]\n* [[Islam in South Asia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{ref begin}}\n*Blair, Sheila, and Bloom, Jonathan M., ''The Art and Architecture of Islam, 1250-1800'', 1995, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, {{ISBN|0300064659}}\n* {{cite book|last=Elliot|first=H.

This can be traced back to the 9th century, when the Islamic [[Caliphate]] began fragmenting in the [[Middle East]], where Muslim rulers in rival states began enslaving non-Muslim nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] from the Central Asian steppes, and raising many of them to become loyal military slaves called [[Mamluk]]s. Soon, [[Turkic migration|Turks were migrating]] to [[Muslim lands]] and becoming [[Islamicization|Islamicized]]. Many of the Turkic Mamluk slaves eventually rose up to become rulers, and conquered large parts of the [[Muslim world]], establishing Mamluk Sultanates from [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]] to [[Ghaznavids|Afghanistan]], before turning their attention to the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"asher\">{{citation|last1=Asher|first1=C.

Alauddin Khalji replaced the private markets with four centralized government-run markets, appointed a \"market controller\", and implemented strict price controls{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=379-380}} on all kinds of goods, \"from caps to socks; from combs to needles; from vegetables, soups, sweetmeats to [[chapati]]s\" (according to [[Ziauddin Barani]] (c. 1357){{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=105}}).

A major military contribution of the Delhi Sultanate was their successful campaigns in repelling the [[Mongol Empire]]'s [[Mongol invasions of India|invasions of India]], which could have been devastating for the Indian subcontinent, like the [[Mongol invasions]] of [[Mongol invasion of China|China]], [[Mongol invasion of Persia|Persia]] and [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Europe]]. The Delhi Sultanate's Mamluk army were skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare used by the Mongols, making them successful in repelling the [[Mongol invasions]], as was the case for the [[Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt]].

For example, a [[Sanskrit]] inscription notes that Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] repaired a Siva temple in [[Bidar]] after his [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] conquest. There was often a pattern of Delhi sultans plundering or damaging temples during conquest, and then patronizing or repairing temples after conquest. This pattern came to an end with the [[Mughal Empire]], where [[Akbar the Great]]'s chief minister [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]] criticized the excesses of earlier sultans such as [[Mahmud of Ghazni]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn many cases, the demolished remains, rocks and broken statue pieces of temples destroyed by Delhi sultans were reused to build mosques and other buildings. For example, the Qutb complex in Delhi was built from stones of 27 demolished Hindu and Jain temples by some accounts.<ref>Welch, Anthony (1993), Architectural patronage and the past: The Tughluq sultans of India, Muqarnas, Vol. 10, 311-322</ref> Similarly, the Muslim mosque in Khanapur, Maharashtra was built from the looted parts and demolished remains of Hindu temples.<ref name=\"awhc\" /> [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] destroyed Buddhist and Hindu libraries and their manuscripts at [[Nalanda]] and [[Odantapuri]] Universities in 1193 AD at the beginning of the Delhi Sultanate.<ref name=regbook/><ref>Gul and Khan (2008), [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/182 Growth and Development of Oriental Libraries in India], Library Philosophy and Practice, University of Nebrasaka-Lincoln</ref>\n\nThe first historical record of a campaign of destruction of temples and defacement of faces or heads of Hindu idols lasted from 1193 to 1194 in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh under the command of Ghuri.

The exteriors of both were very often topped by large [[dome]]s, and made extensive use of [[arch]]es.  Both of these features were hardly used in [[Hindu temple architecture]] and other indigenous Indian styles.  Both types of building essentially consist of a single large space under a high dome, and completely avoid the figurative sculpture so important to [[Hindu temple architecture]].<ref>Harle, 421, 425; Yale, 165; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nThe important [[Qutb Complex]] in Delhi was begun under [[Muhammad of Ghor]], by 1199, and continued under Qutb al-Din Aibak and later sultans.  The [[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque]], now a ruin, was the first structure.  Like other early Islamic buildings it re-used elements such as columns from destroyed Hindu and [[Jain]] temples, including one on the same site whose platform was reused.  The style was Iranian, but the arches were still [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] in the traditional Indian way.<ref>Yale, 164-165; Harle, 423-424; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nBeside it is the extremely tall [[Qutb Minar]], a [[minaret]] or victory tower, whose original four stages reach 73 meters (with a final stage added later). Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick [[Minaret of Jam]] in Afghanistan, of c.1190, a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.<ref>Also two huge minarets at [[Ghazni]].</ref>  The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns; in Delhi the shaft is [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] with \"superb [[stalactite]] bracketing under the balconies\" at the top of each stage.<ref>Yale, 164; Harle, 424 (quoted); Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>  In general [[minaret]]s were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.<ref>Harle, 429</ref>\n\nThe Tomb of [[Iltutmish]] was added by 1236; its dome, the [[squinch]]es again corbelled, is now missing, and the intricate carving has been described as having an \"angular harshness\", from carvers working in an unfamiliar tradition.<ref>Yale, 164 (quoted); Harle, 425</ref>  Other elements were added to the complex over the next two centuries.\n\nAnother very early mosque, begun in the 1190s, is the [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]] in [[Ajmer]], [[Rajasthan]], built for the same Delhi rulers, again with corbelled arches and domes.  Here Hindu temple columns (and possibly some new ones) are piled up in threes to achieve extra height.  Both mosques had large detached screens with pointed corbelled arches added in front of them, probably under Iltutmish a couple of decades later.  In these the central arch is taller, in imitation of an [[iwan]]. At Ajmer the smaller screen arches are tentatively cusped, for the first time in India.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 149-150; Harle, 425</ref>\n[[File:Tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and side tomb (3319047170).jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325), Delhi]]\n\nBy around 1300 true domes and arches with [[voussoir]]s were being built; the ruined [[Tomb of Balban]] (d. 1287) in Delhi may be the earliest survival.<ref>Harle, 425</ref>  The [[Alai Darwaza]] gatehouse at the Qutb complex, from 1311, still shows a cautious approach to the new technology, with very thick walls and a shallow dome, only visible from a certain distance or height.  Bold contrasting colours of masonry, with red [[sandstone]] and white [[marble]], introduce what was to become a common feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, substituting for the polychrome tiles used in Persia and Central Asia. The pointed arches come together slightly at their base, giving a mild [[horseshoe arch]] effect, and their internal edges are not cusped but lined with conventionalized \"spearhead\" projections, possibly representing [[lotus flower|lotus]] buds. [[Jali]], stone [[openwork]] screens, are introduced here; they already had been long used in temples.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151</ref>\n\n====Tughlaq architecture====\nThe [[tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam]] (built 1320 to 1324) in [[Multan]], Pakistan is a large octagonal brick-built [[mausoleum]] with polychrome glazed decoration that remains much closer to the styles of Iran and Afghanistan.  Timber is also used internally.  This was the earliest major monument of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320\u20131413), built during the unsustainable expansion of its massive territory. It was built for a [[Sufi saint]] rather than a sultan, and most of the many [[Tughlaq tombs]] are much less exuberant.  The tomb of the founder of the dynasty, [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325) is more austere, but impressive; like a Hindu temple, it is topped with a small [[amalaka]] and a round [[finial]] like a [[kalasha]]. Unlike the buildings mentioned previously, it completely lacks carved texts, and sits in a compound with high walls and battlements.  Both these tombs have external walls sloping slightly inwards, by 25\u00b0 in the Delhi tomb, like many fortifications including the ruined [[Tughlaqabad Fort]] opposite the tomb, intended as the new capital.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151-156; Harle, 425-426</ref>\n\nThe Tughlaqs had a corps of government architects and builders, and in this and other roles employed many Hindus.  They left many buildings, and a standardized dynastic style.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151</ref> The third sultan, [[Firuz Shah Tughluq|Firuz Shah]] (r. 1351-88) is said to have designed buildings himself, and was the longest ruler and greatest builder of the dynasty. His [[Firoz Shah Palace Complex]] (started 1354) at [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Haryana]] is a ruin, but parts are in fair condition.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 154; Harle, 425</ref>  Some buildings from his reign take forms that had been rare or unknown in Islamic buildings.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 154-156</ref>  He was buried in the large [[Hauz Khas Complex]] in Delhi, with many other buildings from his period and the later Sultanate, including several small domed [[pavilion]]s supported only by columns.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 154-156; Harle, 425</ref>\n\nBy this time Islamic architecture in India had adopted some features of earlier Indian architecture, such as the use of a high [[plinth]],<ref>Blair & Bloom, 149</ref> and often [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] around its edges, as well as columns and brackets and [[hypostyle]] halls.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 156</ref>  After the death of Firoz the Tughlaqs declined, and the following Delhi dynasties were weak. Most of the monumental buildings constructed were tombs, although the impressive [[Lodi Gardens|Lodi Gardens in Delhi]] (adorned with fountains, ''[[charbagh]]'' gardens, ponds, tombs and mosques) were constructed by the late Lodi dynasty. The architecture of other regional Muslim states was often more impressive.<ref>Harle, 426; Blair & Bloom, 156</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra (literally \"shed of 2\u00bd days\").jpg|Screen of the [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]] mosque, [[Ajmer]], c. 1229; [[Corbel arch]]es, some cusped.\nFile:Tomb of Altamash.jpg|Mausoleum of [[Iltutmish]], Delhi, by 1236, with [[corbel arch]]es\nFile:Balban Khan's Tomb 029.jpg|Possibly the first \"true\" arches in India; [[Tomb of Balban]] (d. 1287) in Delhi\nFile:The tomb of Ferozshah ii ag61.jpg|Pavilions in the [[Hauz Khas Complex]], Delhi\nFile:The Tomb of Sikander Lodi, seen from the Sheesh Gumbad.JPG|Tomb of Sikander Lodi in the [[Lodi Gardens]], Delhi\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Mongol invasions of India]] \n* [[Delhi Sultanate literature]]\n* [[Iconoclasm]]\n* [[Ibrahim Lodhi's Tomb]]\n* [[Persianate|Persianate states]]\n* [[Tomb of Bahlul Lodi]]\n* [[Turkish slaves in the Delhi Sultanate]]\n* [[Islam in South Asia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{ref begin}}\n*Blair, Sheila, and Bloom, Jonathan M., ''The Art and Architecture of Islam, 1250-1800'', 1995, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, {{ISBN|0300064659}}\n* {{cite book|last=Elliot|first=H.
