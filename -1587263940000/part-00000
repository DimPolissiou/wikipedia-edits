(2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 577 - 591.</ref> \n\nGretton made more watches than clocks, as did many of his contemporaries. Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 541</ref> He continued to make at least clocks until the mid-1720s, when it is believed he retired from clockmaking. However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers\u2019 Company]] until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 419, 443 - 447.</ref> Gretton produced [https://www.lexico.com/definition/timepiece timepieces], [[mwod:clock watch|clock watches]], alarm watches, several forms of repeating watches (i.e., which contained [[Repeater (horology)|repeaters]]), and [[polychrome]] decorated watches with [https://anordain.com/blogs/news/this-is-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enamel-dials-part-1 enamel dials] and [[porcelain]] boxes. Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.\n\nGretton clocks were always of the highest quality, comparable to those of London's best makers. His early [[Grandfather clock|longcase clocks]] were housed in walnut cases. Later, the cases had [[parquetry]] decoration, followed by floral [[marquetry]], arabesque and then seaweed marquetry, [[ebony]]-veneered cases, and [[lacquer]]-decorated cases. He returned to walnut for his late longcase clocks.\n\nMost of Gretton\u2019s longcase movements had countwheel-[[Striking clock|striking]] control, although some had rack striking and quarter striking. Many early clocks had bolt-and-shutter [[maintaining power]].\n\nGretton's spring clocks were usually in an ebony-veneered or ebonized case with little or no decoration, other than the carrying handle. Gretton was, however, an early user of gilt basket-top cases. Most clocks originally stood on ebonized pad feet. Some peak-period spring clocks could be housed in a marquetry or [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] case.\n\nAlmost all spring clocks employed rack striking. Gretton was an early adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed by at least one other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 279 - 281.</ref> \n\nGretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known. Most Gretton spring clocks after about 1685 have a pull quarter repeat mechanism; several complex forms of this have been documented.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 270 - 278.</ref>\n\n== The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers ==\nGretton was very active in the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]]. He became a steward in 1684 and a warden in 1688, and he was elected Master of the Company in 1700.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 30 September 1700, MS2710/3.</ref>  Gretton continued his commitment to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company until his late years, when ill health likely prevented his direct participation. The Clockmakers\u2019 Company Court appointed Gretton to represent the Company as a proprietor with the [[Bank of England]] in 1714, and he held this position for several years.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 5 April 1714, MS2701/3.</ref>\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nCharles Gretton became very successful in business and had the means to acquire wealth and a number of urban and rural properties. He had a keen interest in philanthropy, particularly relating to education. In 1701, he donated \u00a350 to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company to fund apprenticeships for orphaned sons of clockmakers.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 1 September 1701, MS2710/3.</ref> In 1704, the first boy started his apprenticeship with the help of this fund. The last recorded recipient was in 1842. At least 77 boys were able to enter the clockmaking trade through this programme.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers records of Gretton's Gift, The Register of Apprentices of The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of the City of London from its Incorporation in 1631 to its Tercentenary in 1931, London: private printing for the Company 1931, Atkins, Charles Edward.

It is believed that this school for ten boys continued until 1823, more than 90 years after Gretton\u2019s death.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age. P. 63.</ref> This charity was financed by the rent on Gretton\u2019s workshop, The Ship, on Fleet Street, which was willed to his son Thomas.\n\n\u2018Gretton\u2019s Gift,\u2019 another donation to Claypole set out in his will, continued into the early 20th century.<ref>Lincolnshire Archives, Lincoln, Misc DON 1153.</ref> Gretton was a donating governor at [https://www.londonlives.org/static/Bridewell.jsp Bridewell Hospital] and [[Christ's Hospital|Christ\u2019s Hospital]]; both engaged in education and training, and both still exist as schools.\n\n== Civic Life ==\nGretton\u2019s civic appointments included being a Warden at the church of [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]]. He also was a Common Councilman for the Ward of [[Farringdon Without]], representing the [[parish]] of St Dunstan-in-the-West for many years.\n\nHe served as a tax commissioner, and at times as an adjuster, for [[Ludgate]] and for both precincts of the parish of [[St Martin, Ludgate]].\n\n== Marriages ==\nCharles Gretton and Mary (n\u00e9e Phillips) married in 1678. They had ten children, only three of whom survived into adulthood. Mary Gretton died in December 1698, as did two of the children.\n\nTheir son Phillips attended [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul\u2019s School]], London, and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], attaining his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree at the latter.<ref>The Admission Registers of St Paul's School from 1748 to 1876, edited by Robert Gardiner. London, George Gardiner, 1884. P. 61.</ref> Phillips became the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] in [[Springfield, Essex]], where he stayed for the rest of his life. Phillips was married in the newly completed [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul\u2019s Cathedral]], London, in March 1712/13.\n\nDaughter Ann married John Houghton, a glover. Charles Gretton lived the very last years of his life with Ann at the Houghton home in [[Milk Street, London|Milk Street]], London. Ann was buried in Springfield in January 1752/53, where her nephew, Phillips' son, had become the rector.\n\nLittle is known about Thomas, the youngest son. He married Elizabeth Turner, a widow. The Ship was willed to Thomas, but \u00a310 of the yearly rent funded the charities in Claypole. Thomas was also buried in Springfield.\n\nCharles Gretton married Lucy Uffman in 1700, but she must have died, because Gretton was married again in 1711, this time to Dorothea Wilson. Gretton became a widower for the third time in 1727.\n\n== Death ==\nCharles Gretton died on 25 June 1731 and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 5 July 1731. He had reserved \u00a3100 for his funeral costs and was buried \u2018in very decent manner,\u2019 according to a newspaper at the time.<ref>Daily Advertiser, 5 July 1731.</ref> Besides his beautiful clocks and watches, Charles left considerable wealth, including at least nine properties.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Additional resources ==\nEssex Archives: Springfield Parish Records.\n\nLincolnshire Archives: Claypole Parish Records (births and deaths, deeds): Charles Gretton\u2019s parents\u2019 wills and inventories, deeds, educational history.\n\nLondon Metropolitan Archives (deeds, marriage records, tax records): St Dunstan-in-the-West vestry minutes.\n\nLoomes, Brian.

He took at least eight apprentices, including his nephew Charles Kemp (who became the master to Tom Tompion\u2019s nephew), John Farewell, and Joseph Antram, the latter of whom became a clockmaker to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. The best known of Gretton\u2019s apprentices was [[Henry Sully]], who after completing his apprenticeship stayed with Gretton as a [[journeyman]] for four years rather than the more customary two years.

They have a dark colour. The larvae hatch after about 15 days. The larvae are brownish and the first instar is three to four millimeters long.\nThe larvae feed on decaying vegetable matter, but also on delicate roots and can cause damage in crops like cabbage. At night, they can affect the above ground parts of the plants and eat the leaves. The larval development takes around four months and includes four moults. The larva is several centimeters long and pupates in the soil. The second generation spends the winter in the ground until late spring or early summer.\nThe adult animals can take only liquid food like nectar due to its soft mouthparts.\nThe entire life cycle of ''T. oleracea'' is up to eight months.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212554/http://nlbif.eti.uva.nl/ccw/ Catalogue of the crane flies of the world]\n\n{{Commonscat}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.biolib.cz/en/taxon/id118859/ BioLib]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q651615}}\n\n[[Category:Tipulidae]]\n[[Category:Diptera of Europe]]\n[[Category:Diptera of Asia]]\n[[Category:Diptera of North America]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of fly}}\n{{Taxobox\n| image = Crane fly (Tipula oleracea) Oxfordshire.jpg\n| image_caption = \n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Arthropod]]a\n| classis = [[Insect]]a\n| ordo = [[Fly|Diptera]]\n| familia = [[Tipulidae]]\n| genus = ''[[Tipula]]''\n| subgenus = ''[[Tipula (subgenus)|Tipula]]''\n| species = '''''T. oleracea'''''\n| binomial = ''Tipula oleracea''\n| binomial_authority = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]\n| synonyms = *''Tipula pratensis'' <small>[[Charles De Geer|De Geer]], 1776</small>\n*''Tipula submendosa'' <small>Tjeder, 1941</small>\n}}\n[[File:Crane fly (tipula oleracea) head.jpg|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Tipula.oleracea.wing.detail.jpg|thumb|left|wing detail]]\n[[File:Tipulidae sp.

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n==Prominent people==\n\n* James Bryce\n* [[Anthony Butt]]\n* [[Cecil Devine]]\n* [[Tony Herlihy]]\n* [[Free Holmes | Freeman Holmes]]\n* [[Maurice Holmes (harness racer) | Maurice Holmes]]\n* [[Charlie Hunter (trainer) | Charlie Hunter]]\n* [[John Langdon (driver) | John Langdon]]\n* Maurice McKendry \n* [[Roy McKenzie]]\n* Ricky May\n* Reon Murtha - long-standing race caller\n* [[Denis Nyhan]]\n* [[Mark Purdon]]\n* Roy Purdon\n* Natalie Rasmussen \n* [[Steven Reid (harness racer)| Steven Reid]]\n* Jack Smolenski\n* [[Doody Townley]]\n* [[Peter Wolfenden]]\n\n==Prominent New Zealand horses==\n\n* [[Auckland Reactor]]\n* [[Caduceus (horse) |Caduceus]]\n* [[Captain Sandy]]\n* [[Cardigan Bay]]\n* [[Chokin]]\n* [[Christian Cullen (horse) |Christian Cullen]]\n* Courage Under Fire\n* [[Delightful Lady]]\n* [[Easton Light]]\n* [[Elsu]]\n* [[False Step]]\n* [[Flashing Red]]\n* [[Harold Logan]]\n* [[Highland Fling (horse) | Highland Fling]]\n* [[Il Vicolo]]\n* [[Im Themightyquinn]]\n* [[Indianapolis (horse)| Indianapolis]]\n* [[Johnny Globe ]]\n* Lazarus\n* [[Lord Module]]\n* [[Lordship (horse) | Lordship]]\n* [[Lyell Creek]]\n* [[Monkey King (horse) | Monkey King]]\n* Noodlum\n* [[Ordeal (horse) | Ordeal]]\n* [[Our Sir Vancelot]]\n* [[Robalan ]]\n* Robin Dundee\n* Royden Glen\n* [[Smoken Up]]\n* [[Take A Moment]]\n* [[Terror to Love]]\n* [[Young Quinn]]\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington.

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used. Races are at distances between 1600m and 3200m. \n\nAnother large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader.\n\nNew Zealand races may have a field of up to 16 horses, although as numbers of horses have reduced some races will have less than 10 starters.  This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap.\n\nThere is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. \n\nNew Zealand horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]]. False Step's performances showed he was one of the greatest pacers in the world. He beat the acknowledged American champion, [[Adios Butler]], in a 1\u00bd mile race. He was sold in America for 115,000 dollars, the fifth highest price paid for a pacer in the United States. \n\nArania also entered the series with False Step. She did not do well, but after being leased won several races and proved she was able to race with the best in America, and in fact created a record of 1 min 57 sec for 1 mile in the Lexington Red Mile.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en New Zealand Horses in America]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] was to travel to America with reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]], who paid 100,000 dollars for the horse. Cardigan Bay was already an established racehorse in New Zealand, having won the 1963 [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and other top races in Australia and New Zealand. He went on to win over a million dollars in the United States, the first harness horse ever to do so.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Harness racing]]\n*[[Harness racing in Australia]]\n*[[Horse racing]]\n*[[Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting]]\n*[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Harness racing in New Zealand}}\n*[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/racing-trotting/1 ''Racing, Trotting'', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Harness racing in}}\n{{Sport in New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Harness racing in New Zealand|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|equestrian sport}}\n'''Harness racing in New Zealand''' is more often called '''trotting''' in the \"old school\"  rather than the more fashionable name of \"harness racing\".<ref>[http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 Trotting in New Zealand with reinsman C C Devine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018073231/http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 |date=2008-10-18 }}</ref> The sport is long standing with events being held as early as 1864.

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n==Prominent people==\n\n* James Bryce\n* [[Anthony Butt]]\n* [[Cecil Devine]]\n* [[Tony Herlihy]]\n* [[Free Holmes | Freeman Holmes]]\n* [[Maurice Holmes (harness racer) | Maurice Holmes]]\n* [[Charlie Hunter (trainer) | Charlie Hunter]]\n* [[John Langdon (driver) | John Langdon]]\n* Maurice McKendry \n* [[Roy McKenzie]]\n* Ricky May\n* Reon Murtha - long-standing race caller\n* [[Denis Nyhan]]\n* [[Mark Purdon]]\n* Roy Purdon\n* Natalie Rasmussen \n* [[Steven Reid (harness racer)| Steven Reid]]\n* Jack Smolenski\n* [[Doody Townley]]\n* [[Peter Wolfenden]]\n\n==Prominent New Zealand horses==\n\n* [[Auckland Reactor]]\n* [[Caduceus (horse) |Caduceus]]\n* [[Captain Sandy]]\n* [[Cardigan Bay]]\n* [[Chokin]]\n* [[Christian Cullen (horse) |Christian Cullen]]\n* Courage Under Fire\n* [[Delightful Lady]]\n* [[Easton Light]]\n* [[Elsu]]\n* [[False Step]]\n* [[Flashing Red]]\n* [[Harold Logan]]\n* [[Highland Fling (horse) | Highland Fling]]\n* [[Il Vicolo]]\n* [[Im Themightyquinn]]\n* [[Indianapolis (horse)| Indianapolis]]\n* [[Johnny Globe ]]\n* Lazarus\n* [[Lord Module]]\n* [[Lordship (horse) | Lordship]]\n* [[Lyell Creek]]\n* [[Monkey King (horse) | Monkey King]]\n* Noodlum\n* [[Ordeal (horse) | Ordeal]]\n* [[Our Sir Vancelot]]\n* [[Robalan ]]\n* Robin Dundee\n* Royden Glenn\n* [[Smoken Up]]\n* [[Take A Moment]]\n* [[Terror to Love]]\n* [[Young Quinn]]\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington.

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used. Races are at distances between 1600m and 3200m. \n\nAnother large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader.\n\nNew Zealand races may have a field of up to 16 horses, although as numbers of horses have reduced some races will have less than 10 starters.  This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap.\n\nThere is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. \n\nNew Zealand horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]]. False Step's performances showed he was one of the greatest pacers in the world. He beat the acknowledged American champion, [[Adios Butler]], in a 1\u00bd mile race. He was sold in America for 115,000 dollars, the fifth highest price paid for a pacer in the United States. \n\nArania also entered the series with False Step. She did not do well, but after being leased won several races and proved she was able to race with the best in America, and in fact created a record of 1 min 57 sec for 1 mile in the Lexington Red Mile.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en New Zealand Horses in America]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] was to travel to America with reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]], who paid 100,000 dollars for the horse. Cardigan Bay was already an established racehorse in New Zealand, having won the 1963 [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and other top races in Australia and New Zealand. He went on to win over a million dollars in the United States, the first harness horse ever to do so.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Harness racing]]\n*[[Harness racing in Australia]]\n*[[Horse racing]]\n*[[Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting]]\n*[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Harness racing in New Zealand}}\n*[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/racing-trotting/1 ''Racing, Trotting'', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Harness racing in}}\n{{Sport in New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Harness racing in New Zealand|*]]\n", "name_user": "ToddyOC", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProminent New Zealand horses", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harness_racing_in_New_Zealand"}

Campbell purchased the land stretching between [[Cicero Avenue]] and Central Avenue from [[95th Street (Chicago)|95th Street]] to 103rd Street. It is unclear what Campbell's intentions with the area were, but by 1840, he had lost a court battle with the Illinois State Bank and his land was sold in a public auction. John Simpson, a prominent figure in early Oak Lawn history, bought the northern half of the property in 1842. By 1859, the recently incorporated government of [[Worth Township, Cook County, Illinois|Worth Township]] paid for the construction of Black Oak Grove Road, an early name for 95th Street. Black Oak Grove is also the earliest known name of the area that would become Oak Lawn. It was later shortened to Black Oak or Black Oaks, but in 1882, the [[post office]], train depot and surrounding community became known simply as Oak Lawn. Over the next two decades, the area grew in population as more homes were built and local business sprang into being.<ref name=\"Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth\">[http://www.lib.oak-lawn.il.us/documents/ol100.pdf], Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth. The Centennial Commission. 1982</ref>\n\n===Birth of Oak Lawn===\nIn 1909, Oak Lawn was [[municipal corporation|incorporated as a village]]. The following years, there were major improvements to local infrastructure and government services, such as the introduction of the [[Magistrate|police magistrate]] and [[Marshal#State and local marshals|village marshal]], along with the building of a [[village hall]] and jailhouse.<ref name=\"Village Adopts New Name, Government.

The population had grown to 2,045 by 1930, and civic improvements were steadily made over the next decade.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.lib.oak-lawn.il.us/documents/ol100.pdf], Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth.

Roosevelt]] created the [[Works Progress Administration]] as part of the [[New Deal]], which supported a variety of public works, including libraries. With the help of a WPA grant, the new library opened its doors in 1936.<ref name=\"The Oak Lawn Public Library.

Bill]], Oak Lawn experienced a major population boom. Beginning in 1949, Oak Lawn Round-Up Days became an annual event and helped to promote the village. It started with 25,000 people, and the Western-themed celebration brought in over 100,000 attendees in 1952. In this year, [[Jack Brickhouse]] was master of ceremonies, and the parade was televised on [[WGN-TV]]. By 1957, Round-Up Days had become too large, and the next year a final scaled-down version was held.<ref name=\"Oak Lawn Round-Up 1949-1958.

Gordon Welles.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, a village managerial government began, and a new library and fire station were constructed. By 1960, there were nearly 20,000 residents in Oak Lawn.\n\nOn April 21, 1967, a tornado touched down in Oak Lawn that is recorded as one of the worst to strike an urban area. Roughly 900 buildings were damaged or destroyed, and over 30 people were killed.\n\nThe town was rebuilt in the coming years, and witnessed further population growth, peaking at 63,500 between 1973 and 1976.<ref name=\"Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth\"/> However, there was a decrease in residents in the 1980s, and an aging population led to the closure of several schools during this time. In response, the village began a process of redevelopment to counteract the decrease. This redevelopment has focused primarily on businesses and structures in the core area of Oak Lawn, around [[95th Street (Chicago)|95th Street]] between [[Cicero Avenue]] and Central Avenue.\n\n===1967 tornado===\n{{main|1967 Oak Lawn tornado outbreak}}\nOn April 21, 1967, an F4 tornado touched down at 105th Street and Kean Avenue in [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]], {{convert|5|mi|0}} west of Oak Lawn. There were no deaths in Palos Hills, although a number of homes were destroyed and two transmission towers collapsed. After rising from the ground, the tornado touched down again at the Starlite Drive-In Theater at 6400 West 95th Street. With winds estimated to be over {{convert|200|mph}}, the tornado tore through Oak Lawn, tossing cars and buses in the air. After cutting Oak Lawn Community High School in half, it moved past St. Gerald's to 91st Street and Cicero Avenue, heavily damaging the Airway Trailer Park and the Oak Lawn Roller Rink before rising from ground level. It touched down again in nearby [[Hometown, Illinois|Hometown]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], and Chicago before dissipating over [[Lake Michigan]].

Eventually, several square blocks were leveled, making room for several multistory, high-end condominium complexes with retail space on the main floors. Part of the project was the expansion of the [[Metra]] [[Oak Lawn station|commuter train station]] that houses a retail/office center and a new  children's museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmoaklawn.org/|title=Children's Museum in Oak Lawn|website=Children's Museum in Oak Lawn}}</ref> This complex also includes a multistory parking garage.

Campbell purchased the land stretching between [[Cicero Avenue]] and Central Avenue from [[95th Street (Chicago)|95th Street]] to 103rd Street. It is unclear what Campbell's intentions with the area were, but by 1840, he had lost a court battle with the Illinois State Bank and his land was sold in a public auction. John Simpson, a prominent figure in early Oak Lawn history, bought the northern half of the property in 1842. By 1859, the recently incorporated government of [[Worth Township, Cook County, Illinois|Worth Township]] paid for the construction of Black Oak Grove Road, an early name for 95th Street. Black Oak Grove is also the earliest known name of the area that would become Oak Lawn. It was later shortened to Black Oak or Black Oaks, but in 1882, the [[post office]], train depot and surrounding community became known simply as Oak Lawn. Over the next two decades, the area grew in population as more homes were built and local business sprang into being.<ref name=\"Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth\">[http://www.lib.oak-lawn.il.us/documents/ol100.pdf], Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth. The Centennial Commission. 1982</ref>\n\n===Birth of Oak Lawn===\nIn 1909, Oak Lawn was [[municipal corporation|incorporated as a village]]. The following years, there were major improvements to local infrastructure and government services, such as the introduction of the [[Magistrate|police magistrate]] and [[Marshal#State and local marshals|village marshal]], along with the building of a [[village hall]] and jailhouse.<ref name=\"Village Adopts New Name, Government.

The population had grown to 2,045 by 1930, and civic improvements were steadily made over the next decade.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.lib.oak-lawn.il.us/documents/ol100.pdf], Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth. The Centennial Commission. 1982.</ref> In 1934, a collection of one hundred books was the beginning of the Oak Lawn Public Library. By 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] created the [[Works Progress Administration]] as part of the [[New Deal]], which supported a variety of public works, including libraries. With the help of a WPA grant, the new library opened its doors in 1936.<ref name=\"The Oak Lawn Public Library.

Verlyn Biere, edited by Grant Subs.</ref>\n\n===Oak Lawn comes of age===\nAfter [[World War II]], with veterans returning home and taking advantage of the [[G.I. Bill]], Oak Lawn experienced a major population boom. Beginning in 1949, Oak Lawn Round-Up Days became an annual event and helped to promote the village. It started with 25,000 people, and the Western-themed celebration brought in over 100,000 attendees in 1952. In this year, [[Jack Brickhouse]] was master of ceremonies, and the parade was televised on [[WGN-TV]]. By 1957, Round-Up Days had become too large, and the next year a final scaled-down version was held.<ref name=\"Oak Lawn Round-Up 1949-1958.

Gordon Welles.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, a village managerial government began, and a new library and fire station were constructed. By 1960, there were nearly 20,000 residents in Oak Lawn.\n\nOn April 21, 1967, a tornado touched down in Oak Lawn that is recorded as one of the worst to strike an urban area. Roughly 900 buildings were damaged or destroyed, and over 30 people were killed.\n\nThe town was rebuilt in the coming years, and witnessed further population growth, peaking at 63,500 between 1973 and 1976.<ref name=\"Oak Lawn: A Century of Growth\"/> However, there was a decrease in residents in the 1980s, and an aging population led to the closure of several schools during this time. In response, the village began a process of redevelopment to counteract the decrease. This redevelopment has focused primarily on businesses and structures in the core area of Oak Lawn, around [[95th Street (Chicago)|95th Street]] between [[Cicero Avenue]] and Central Avenue.\n\n===1967 tornado===\n{{main|1967 Oak Lawn tornado outbreak}}\nOn April 21, 1967, an F4 tornado touched down at 105th Street and Kean Avenue in [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]], {{convert|5|mi|0}} west of Oak Lawn. There were no deaths in Palos Hills, although a number of homes were destroyed and two transmission towers collapsed. After rising from the ground, the tornado touched down again at the Starlite Drive-In Theater at 6400 West 95th Street. With winds estimated to be over {{convert|200|mph}}, the tornado tore through Oak Lawn, tossing cars and buses in the air. After cutting Oak Lawn Community High School in half, it moved past St. Gerald's to 91st Street and Cicero Avenue, heavily damaging the Airway Trailer Park and the Oak Lawn Roller Rink before rising from ground level. It touched down again in nearby [[Hometown, Illinois|Hometown]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], and Chicago before dissipating over [[Lake Michigan]]. In just 16 minutes, the storm left a {{convert|16|mi|adj=on}} path of destruction and over 30 people dead.<ref name=\"The 1967 Oak Lawn Tornado.

Eventually, several square blocks were leveled, making room for several multistory, high-end condominium complexes with retail space on the main floors. Part of the project was the expansion of the [[Metra]] [[Oak Lawn station|commuter train station]] that houses a retail/office center and a new  children's museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmoaklawn.org/|title=Children's Museum in Oak Lawn|website=Children's Museum in Oak Lawn}}</ref> This complex also includes a multistory parking garage.

Since the 1850s, they have been the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. This [[two-party system]] is based on laws, party rules and custom. Various small minor parties come and go and occasionally win major offices at the state level. Local offices, however, are often nonpartisan.\n\n==Overview==\nThe need to win popular support in a [[Republicanism in the United States|republic]] led to the American invention of voter-based political parties in the 1790s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roy Franklin Nichols|title=The invention of the American political parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34g0AAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party.<ref>Robert J.

''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983),</ref> The first two-party system consisted of the [[Federalist Party]], who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] or the [[Anti-Administration party]] (Anti-Federalists), who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789.<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Political Parties: Federalists and Anti-Federalists|work=Boundless Political Science|publisher=Boundless.com|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2016|url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/}}</ref>\n\nThe modern two-party system consists of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Several [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office.<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Third-Party Movements in the United States'' (1962)</ref> The largest third party since the 1980s has been the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].\n\nBesides the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]], [[Green Party of the United States|Green]], and Libertarian parties, there are [[List of political parties in the United States|many other political parties]] that receive only minimal support and only appear on the ballot in one or a few states.\n\nSome political candidates, and many voters, choose not to identify with a particular political party. In some states, [[Independent voter#In the United States|independents]] are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election of their choice. Although the term \"independent\" often is used as a synonym for \"moderate,\" \"centrist,\" or \"swing voter,\" to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to [[Vox Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths|title=9 media myths about independent voters, debunked|last=Klar|first=Samara|date=2016-01-22|website=Vox|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==History and early political parties==\n[[File:PartyVotes-Presidents.png|thumb|right|400px|Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.]]\n[[File:Political Parties Derivation in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.]]\nThe [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]] is silent on the subject of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S. Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815 (Oxford History of the United States)''</ref>\n\n===First Party System: 1792\u20131824===\n{{Main|First Party System}}\nThe First Party System of the United States featured the [[Federalist Party]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] (also called \"Jeffersonian Republican\"). The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n===Second Party System: 1828\u20131854===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the [[Bank War]] and the [[Spoils system]] of federal patronage.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=3123555|title=Politics and Society: Toward a Jacksonian Synthesis|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|volume=10|issue=2|pages=135\u2013161|last1=Feller|first1=Daniel|year=1990|doi=10.2307/3123555}}</ref> The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. In addition, the fading of old economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party together.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center\"\n|+ [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|Presidential election victories]] by party system<ref>Using the definitions of: First Party System: 1796\u20131824, Second Party System: 1828\u20131852, Third Party System: 1856\u20131892, Fourth Party System: 1896\u20131928, Fifth Party System: 1932\u20131964, Sixth Party System: 1968\u2013present</ref>\n|-\n!Party System\n!Party A\n!Party B\n|-\n!First\n|{{party shading/Democratic-Republican}}|7\n|{{party shading/Federalist}}|1\n|-\n!Second\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|5\n|{{party shading/Whig}}|2\n|-\n!Third\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|3\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|7\n|-\n!Fourth\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|2\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|7\n|-\n!Fifth\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|7\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|2\n|-\n!Sixth\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|5\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|7\n|}\n\n===Third Party System: 1854\u20131890s===\n{{Main|Third Party System}}\nThe Third Party System stretched from 1854 to the mid-1890s, and was characterized by the emergence of the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which adopted many of the economic policies of the Whigs, such as national banks, railroads, high tariffs, homesteads and aid to land grant colleges. The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedman|Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul.

This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (business)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[Child labour|child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states. Historians have long debated why no [[Labor Party of the United States|Labor Party]] emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.<ref>Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?'' (Princeton University Press, 2007)</ref>\n\n===Fifth and Sixth Party Systems since 1933===\n{{Main|Fifth Party System|Sixth Party System}}\nThe Fifth Party System emerged with the [[New Deal coalition]] beginning in 1933.<ref>Richard Jensen, \"The Last Party System: Decay of Consensus, 1932\u20131980,\" in Paul Kleppner et al., ''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems (Greenwood, 1981), pp. 205\u201306.</ref> The Republicans began losing support after the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], giving rise to Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the activist [[New Deal]]. They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Jacob Javits]], and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]]. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after 1964.<ref>Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>\n\nExperts debate whether this era ended (and a [[Sixth Party System]] subsequently emerged) in the mid-1960s when the New Deal coalition died, the early 1980s when the [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Reagan coalition]] were formed, the early 1990s when [[Third Way]] emerged among Democrats, the mid-1990s during the [[Republican Revolution]], or if the Fifth system continues in some form to the present.\n\nSince the 1930s, the Democrats positioned themselves more towards [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] while [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] increasingly dominated the GOP.<ref>[[Matthew Levendusky]], ''The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans'' (U Chicago Press, 2009)</ref> However, new voter coalitions emerged during the latter half of the 20th century, with conservatives and the Republicans becoming dominant in the South, rural areas, and suburbs; while liberals and the Democrats increasingly started to rely on a coalition of African-Americans, Hispanics and white urban progressives.\n\n===Minor parties and independents===\n{{See also|Independent politician#United States}}\nAlthough American politics have been dominated by the two-party system, several other political parties have also emerged throughout the country's history. The oldest third party was the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], which was formed in upstate New York in 1828. The party's creators feared the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], believing they were a powerful secret society that was attempting to rule the country in defiance of republican principles.<ref>Morris, Richard B.

From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers. African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.

During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise.

Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[Flyover country|flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states.  One significant base of support for the Republican Party is [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]], who have wielded significant power in the party since the early 1970s. Despite having so called \"Chistians\" as supporters, ironically, Republicans are mostly known to be war-mongers, who have no issues with profiting from the deaths of the young men and women of America who are soldiers for their nation. Since the mid-20th century, \n\nRepublicans at the time of Eisenhower are very different from New a.k.a. Neo-Republicans of the twenty-first century. The policies of Barack Obama were found to be to the right of Richard \"tricky Dick\" Nixon because of how far the spectrum has shifted to the right. What used to be considered centrist thinking in Eisenhower's time is now to the left of Democrats today. Twenty-first century Neo-Republicans generally currently oppose [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] (a.k.a. \"Blue Dog\" Democrats, or wolves in sheep's clothing) have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. In fact, the entire political spectrum has shifted to the right since the mid-twentieth century. \"Neo-Republicans\" oppose [[trade union]]s, make it difficult for women seeking an abortion to have easy access to getting one at family planning clinics ans other legal offices and have thrown up legislation which limits where and when a woman may access these services,  thereby lengthening the time the baby stays within the womb and ultimately bringing more unplanned and unwanted children into our already over populated world and doing (God only knows what) damage to our society as a whole.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] is the 18th and the current Republican to be elected to the office of [[President of the United States]]. [[Donald Trump]] is also an excellent example of how far to the right the United States political structure has moved since the death of President Kennedy in 1963. [[Donald Trump]] is supported by people in the U.S.A. so far to the right that they support fascism. Also many Americans were fooled into voing for him because he was a television personality for many years on the show \"The Apprentice.\" This can only explain [[Donald Trump]]'s election to some degree. The fact is, that, once again, [[Donald Trump]] was elected not by the people of the United States, but by the United States Electoral College, a system which is outdated and a majority of U.S. citizens feel should be abolished. Had the U.S. Electoral College system not been in place, neither [[Donald Trump]] nor George W. Bush would have been made  [[President of the United States]]. Moreover, if the United States had a federally mandated [[Ranked voting#Instant-runoff%20voting|Instant-runoff voting]]/[[Ranked voting|ranked preferential]] [[Electoral system|voting method]] which gives a voter had a week to cast their ballot, and every voter was given election day off as a national holiday, then elections in the U.S.A. would be a whole lot more fair and just. However, it's clear that as of Spring 2020, and in the midst of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] neither the New Democrats nor the Neo-Republicans desire either of these things to happen this to happen because it would make them both lose power. Since the [[2010 United States elections|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives until the 2018 midterms where they lost it to the Democratic Party. Additionally, since the 2014 elections, the Republican Party has controlled the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president|title=2016 Election News, Candidates & Polls|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, the Republican party had roughly 55 million registered members, making it the second largest party in the United States.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, both the Republican and Democrat parties in the United States operate in the interest of big corporations who fund their re-election campaigns and respond to the citizens of the U.S.A. acting more like rival dominating gang members (with their blue and red rags to identify them) than as elected representatives supposedly serving the will of the people. With only a two party system the citizens of the United States are constantly being forced to decide between the lesser of two evils at all times, in every election. Having a federally mandated [[Ranked voting#Instant-runoff%20voting|Instant-runoff voting]]/[[Ranked voting|ranked preferential]] [[Electoral system|voting method]] in place would solve this problem very efficiently. \n\n==Minor parties==\nThe United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of support for their Presidential candidates in the 2016 election), are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties.\n{{Main|List of political parties in the United States}}\n\n===Libertarian Party===\n{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}\nThe Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130133301/http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml |date=2006-01-30 }}, LP.org</ref> It is the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third party]] in the United States, claiming well over 500,000 registered voters across all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/27/new-registration-data-for-the-united-states/|title=New Voter Registration Nation Totals|first=Richard|last=Winger|date=27 July 2017|work=ballot-access.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> As of 2019, they have about 176 elected officials, including 1 state legislator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/elected-officials/|title=Elected Officials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, [[Gary Johnson]].

It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party's official name was changed to the \"Constitution Party\" in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.\n\nThe Constitution Party is strongly pro-life (i.e. opposed to [[abortion]]), and supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and restrictions on immigration. It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n==Issues==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right political spectrum#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] position rather than a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Critchlow, Donald T.

This [[two-party system]] is based on laws, party rules and custom. Various small minor parties come and go and occasionally win major offices at the state level. Local offices, however, are often nonpartisan.\n\n==Overview==\nThe need to win popular support in a [[Republicanism in the United States|republic]] led to the American invention of voter-based political parties in the 1790s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roy Franklin Nichols|title=The invention of the American political parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34g0AAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party.<ref>Robert J.

''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983),</ref> The first two-party system consisted of the [[Federalist Party]], who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] or the [[Anti-Administration party]] (Anti-Federalists), who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789.<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Political Parties: Federalists and Anti-Federalists|work=Boundless Political Science|publisher=Boundless.com|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2016|url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/}}</ref>\n\nThe modern two-party system consists of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Several [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office.<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Third-Party Movements in the United States'' (1962)</ref> The largest third party since the 1980s has been the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].\n\nBesides the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]], [[Green Party of the United States|Green]], and Libertarian parties, there are [[List of political parties in the United States|many other political parties]] that receive only minimal support and only appear on the ballot in one or a few states.\n\nSome political candidates, and many voters, choose not to identify with a particular political party. In some states, [[Independent voter#In the United States|independents]] are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election of their choice. Although the term \"independent\" often is used as a synonym for \"moderate,\" \"centrist,\" or \"swing voter,\" to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to [[Vox Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths|title=9 media myths about independent voters, debunked|last=Klar|first=Samara|date=2016-01-22|website=Vox|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==History and early political parties==\n[[File:PartyVotes-Presidents.png|thumb|right|400px|Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.]]\n[[File:Political Parties Derivation in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.]]\nThe [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]] is silent on the subject of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S.

The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n===Second Party System: 1828\u20131854===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the [[Bank War]] and the [[Spoils system]] of federal patronage.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=3123555|title=Politics and Society: Toward a Jacksonian Synthesis|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|volume=10|issue=2|pages=135\u2013161|last1=Feller|first1=Daniel|year=1990|doi=10.2307/3123555}}</ref> The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedman|Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul.

This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (business)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[Child labour|child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states. Historians have long debated why no [[Labor Party of the United States|Labor Party]] emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.<ref>Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?''

They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Jacob Javits]], and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]].

These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] to some extent [[Divided government in the United States|since at least 1856]].

From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers. African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.  Obama was the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and from the [[2006 United States elections|2006 midterm elections]] until the [[2014 United States elections|2014 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party was also the [[Two-party system|majority party]] in the [[United States Senate]].\n\nA 2011 ''[[USA Today]]'' review of state voter rolls indicates that the number of registered Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register voters by party). During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise.  But in 2011 Democrats numbers shrank 800,000, and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-22/voters-political-parties/52171688/1|title=Voters leaving Republican, Democratic parties in droves|author=Wolf, Richard|first=|date=December 22, 2011|work=USA Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> In 2018, the Democratic party was the largest in the United States with roughly 60 Million registered members.\n\n===Republican Party===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States)|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nThe Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States of America. Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[Flyover country|flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states.  One significant base of support for the Republican Party is [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]], who have wielded significant power in the party since the early 1970s.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] is the 18th and the current Republican to be elected to the office of [[President of the United States]]. Since the [[2010 United States elections|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives until the 2018 midterms where they lost it to the Democratic Party.  Additionally, since the 2014 elections, the Republican Party has controlled the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president|title=2016 Election News, Candidates & Polls|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, the Republican party had roughly 55 million registered members, making it the second largest party in the United States.\n\n==Minor parties==\nThe United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of support for their Presidential candidates in the 2016 election), are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties.\n{{Main|List of political parties in the United States}}\n\n===Libertarian Party===\n{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}\nThe Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130133301/http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml |date=2006-01-30 }}, LP.org</ref> It is the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third party]] in the United States, claiming well over 500,000 registered voters across all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/27/new-registration-data-for-the-united-states/|title=New Voter Registration Nation Totals|first=Richard|last=Winger|date=27 July 2017|work=ballot-access.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> As of 2019, they have about 176 elected officials, including 1 state legislator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/elected-officials/|title=Elected Officials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, [[Gary Johnson]].

In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Johnson ran again, receiving over four million votes, or 3.3% of the popular vote.\n\nThe Libertarian Party's core mission is to reduce the size, influence, and expenditures of all levels of government. To this effect, the party supports minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[Government of the United States|federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]], [[drug liberalization]], [[separation of church and state]], [[Free migration|open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries, and a more representative republic.<ref name=LPOption>{{cite web|title=The Libertarian Option|url=http://www.lp.org/introduction/the-libertarian-option|website=The Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian National Committee, Inc.|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> As of 2016, it is the third largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n===Green Party===\n{{Main|Green Party of the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], the Green Party has been active as a [[third party (United States)|third party]] since the 1980s.

Currently, the primary national Green Party organization in the U.S. is the Green Party of the United States, which has eclipsed the earlier [[Greens/Green Party USA]].\n\nThe Green Party in the United States has won elected office mostly at the [[local government|local]] level; most winners of public office in the United States who are considered Greens have won [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]]-ballot elections (that is, elections in which the candidates' party affiliations were not printed on the [[ballot]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.feinstein.org/greenparty/electeds.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123231119/http://www.feinstein.org/greenparty/electeds.html|url-status=dead|title=Green elected officials|archivedate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> In 2005, the Party had 305,000 registered members in the District of Columbia and 20 states that allow party registration.<ref>\"[http://web.greens.org/stats/ Green Party Ballot Status and Voter Registration Totals (United States)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526183505/http://web.greens.org/stats/ |date=2008-05-26 }}\".

As of 2016, it is the fourth largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n===Constitution Party===\n{{Main|Constitution Party (United States)}}\n{{refimprove-section|date=February 2020}}\nThe Constitution Party is a small national conservative political party in the United States. It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party's official name was changed to the \"Constitution Party\" in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.\n\nThe Constitution Party is strongly pro-life (i.e. opposed to [[abortion]]), and supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and restrictions on immigration. It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n==Issues==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right political spectrum#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] position rather than a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Critchlow, Donald T.
