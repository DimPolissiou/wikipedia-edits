In Catholic countries of Europe, it has been celebrated on March 19 ([[Saint Joseph's Day]]) since the [[Middle Ages]]. This celebration was brought by the Spanish and Portuguese to [[Latin America]], where March 19 is often still used for it, though many countries in Europe and the Americas have adopted the U.S. date, which is the third Sunday of June. It is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in the months of March, April and June according to the home nation's customs. It complements similar celebrations honoring family members, such as [[Mother's Day]], [[Siblings Day]] and [[Grandparents Day|Grandparents' Day]].\n\nIn its modern form it was founded by [[Sonora Smart Dodd]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Does%20Fatherhood%20Make%20You%20Happy.htm |title=TIME.com Print Page: TIME Magazine - Does Fatherhood Make You Happy? |publisher=Wjh.harvard.edu |date=2006-06-11 |access-date=2012-06-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212034844/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Does%20Fatherhood%20Make%20You%20Happy.htm |archive-date=2011-12-12 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353138303431 |title=Father's Day |publisher=Melrosemirror.media.mit.edu |access-date=2012-06-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806231338/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353138303431 |archive-date=2011-08-06 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokaneknoxpc.org/documents/SonoraSmartDodd_Biography.pdf|title=Sonora Louise Smart Dodd|last=|first=|date=February 19, 2010|website=|publisher=Spokane Regional Convention & Visitor Bureau|access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nA customary day for the celebration of fatherhood in [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] is known to date back to at least 1508. It is usually celebrated  on [[March 19]], as the feast day of Saint Joseph, who is referred to as the fatherly ''Nutritor Domini'' (\"Nourisher of the Lord\") in Catholicism and \"the putative father of [[Jesus]]\" in southern European tradition. This celebration was brought to the [[Americas]] by the [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. The [[Catholic Church]] actively supported the custom of a celebration of fatherhood on St. Joseph's Day from either the last years of the [[14th century]] or from the early [[15th century]],<ref name=natgeo>{{cite magazine |last=Emily |first=Jan |title=For Father's Day, 15 Images of Awesome Dads |date= June 20, 2015 | url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150621-pictures-fathers-around-the-world/ | magazine = National Geographic}}</ref> apparently on the initiative of the [[Franciscans]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Peter |first=Kirwin |title=Happy Father's Day From This Father To All Fathers |url=https://thecasa.org/2016/06/happy-fathers-day-father-fathers-2/ | publisher = Franciscan Renewal Center }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], the celebration of fatherhood is also observed on St Joseph's Day, but the Copts observe this celebration on July 20. This Coptic celebration may date back to the fifth century.<ref name=natgeo/>\n\n===In the United States===\n\n====Beginnings====\nFather's Day was not celebrated in the US, outside Catholic traditions, until the 20th century. As a civic celebration in the US, it was inaugurated in the early 20th century to complement [[Mother's Day]] by celebrating fathers and male [[parenting]].\n\n[[File:USMC-120617-M-3042W-938.jpg|thumb|During the Father's Day luncheon held at the Pacific Views Event Center, [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]]]]\nAfter [[Anna Jarvis]]' successful promotion of Mother's Day in [[Grafton, West Virginia]], the first observance of a day honoring fathers was held on July 5, 1908, in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]], in the Williams Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church South, now known as Central [[United Methodist]] Church.<ref name=\"myers 185\">Myers, 1972, p. 185</ref> Grace Golden Clayton was mourning the loss of her father, when in December 1907, the [[Monongah Mining Disaster]] in nearby [[Monongah, West Virginia|Monongah]] killed 361 men, 250 of them fathers, leaving around a thousand fatherless children.

In December 1907, a terrible mine explosion in nearby Monongah claimed the lives of more than 360 men. Most of them had families, and the tragedy left 1,000 children fatherless. Clayton was distraught by the thought of all those children growing up without a father's guidance, and she wanted to do something to honor the importance of fatherhood. She asked her pastor to set aside a special day to commemorate fathers. She chose the Sunday closest to the birthday of her late father, also a Methodist preacher.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the pronunciation of the number eight is ''b\u0101'', and the pronunciation is very similar to the character \"\u7238\" \"b\u00e0\", which means \"Pa\" or \"dad\". The eighth day of the eighth month (b\u0101-b\u0101) is a pun for dad (\u7238\u7238 or \"b\u00e0ba\").  The Taiwanese, therefore, sometimes refer to August 8 as \"B\u0101b\u0101 Holiday\" as a pun for \"Dad's Holiday\" (\u7238\u7238\u7bc0) or the more formal \"Father's Day\" (\u7236\u89aa\u7bc0).\n\n====Thailand====\nIn [[Thailand]], the birthday of the king, is set as Father's Day.<ref name=smiles /> December 5 is the birthday of the late king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] (Rama IX). Traditionally, Thais celebrate by giving their father or grandfather a [[Canna (plant)|canna]] flower (\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32 Dok Buddha Raksa), which is considered a masculine flower; however, this is not as commonly practiced today. Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show respect for the late king, because yellow is the [[color of the day]] for Monday, the day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the [[Sanam Luang]], a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening, when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.\n\nIt first gained nationwide popularity in the 1980s as part of a campaign by Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] to promote Thailand's royal family.<ref name=smiles /> [[Mother's Day]] is celebrated on the birthday of Queen [[Sirikit]],<ref name=smiles>{{Cite book|title= The King Never Smiles: a biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej |author=Paul M.

Consumer goods companies have all sorts of special offers for fathers: electronics, suits, and men's healthcare products.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Holidays}}\n* [[Mother's Day]]\n* [[National Grandparents Day]]\n* [[List of films set around Father's Day]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book |title = Celebrations: The Complete Book of American Holidays |last = Myers |first = Robert J. |author2 = the editors of Hallmark Cards |publisher = Doubleday & Company |year = 1972 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/celebrationscomp00myer/page/184 184\u2013187] |isbn = 0-385-07677-0 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/celebrationscomp00myer/page/184 }}\n* {{Cite book| title = Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays | last = Schmidt | first = Leigh Eric | publisher=Princeton University Press | year = 1997 | pages = 275\u2013292 | isbn = 0-691-01721-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=maF8mTPsJqsC }}\n* {{Cite book| title = The Modernization of Fatherhood: A Social and Political History | last = Larossa | first = Ralph | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-226-46904-2 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/modernizationoff00laro/page/90 90], 170\u2013192 | url = https://archive.org/details/modernizationoff00laro | url-access = registration | quote = Ann Jarvis OR Anna Jarvis mother's day. }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Father's Day}}\n* {{Himanshu|Society/Holidays/Father's_Day|international mens day}}\n* [https://internationalmensday2019.blogspot.com/2019/11/international-mens-day.html], from [[George W.

In Catholic countries of Europe, it has been celebrated on March 19 ([[Saint Joseph's Day]]) since the [[Middle Ages]]. This celebration was brought by the Spanish and Portuguese to [[Latin America]], where March 19 is often still used for it, though many countries in Europe and the Americas have adopted the U.S. date, which is the third Sunday of June. It is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in the months of March, April and June according to the home nation's customs. It complements similar celebrations honoring family members, such as [[Mother's Day]], [[Siblings Day]] and [[Grandparents Day|Grandparents' Day]].\n\nIn its modern form it was founded by [[Sonora Smart Dodd]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Does%20Fatherhood%20Make%20You%20Happy.htm |title=TIME.com Print Page: TIME Magazine - Does Fatherhood Make You Happy? |publisher=Wjh.harvard.edu |date=2006-06-11 |access-date=2012-06-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212034844/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Does%20Fatherhood%20Make%20You%20Happy.htm |archive-date=2011-12-12 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353138303431 |title=Father's Day |publisher=Melrosemirror.media.mit.edu |access-date=2012-06-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806231338/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353138303431 |archive-date=2011-08-06 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokaneknoxpc.org/documents/SonoraSmartDodd_Biography.pdf|title=Sonora Louise Smart Dodd|last=|first=|date=February 19, 2010|website=|publisher=Spokane Regional Convention & Visitor Bureau|access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nA customary day for the celebration of fatherhood in [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] is known to date back to at least 1508.

This celebration was brought to the [[Americas]] by the [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].

Clayton was distraught by the thought of all those children growing up without a father's guidance, and she wanted to do something to honor the importance of fatherhood.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the pronunciation of the number eight is ''b\u0101'', and the pronunciation is very similar to the character \"\u7238\" \"b\u00e0\", which means \"Pa\" or \"dad\". The eighth day of the eighth month (b\u0101-b\u0101) is a pun for dad (\u7238\u7238 or \"b\u00e0ba\").  The Taiwanese, therefore, sometimes refer to August 8 as \"B\u0101b\u0101 Holiday\" as a pun for \"Dad's Holiday\" (\u7238\u7238\u7bc0) or the more formal \"Father's Day\" (\u7236\u89aa\u7bc0).\n\n====Thailand====\nIn [[Thailand]], the birthday of the king, is set as Father's Day.<ref name=smiles /> December 5 is the birthday of the late king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] (Rama IX). Traditionally, Thais celebrate by giving their father or grandfather a [[Canna (plant)|canna]] flower (\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32 Dok Buddha Raksa), which is considered a masculine flower; however, this is not as commonly practiced today. Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show respect for the late king, because yellow is the [[color of the day]] for Monday, the day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the [[Sanam Luang]], a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening, when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.\n\nIt first gained nationwide popularity in the 1980s as part of a campaign by Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] to promote Thailand's royal family.<ref name=smiles /> [[Mother's Day]] is celebrated on the birthday of Queen [[Sirikit]],<ref name=smiles>{{Cite book|title= The King Never Smiles: a biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej |author=Paul M.

In 1952, the holiday was officially decreed. A national father's day committee was set up to give a prize for fathers that deserved it most (originally, candidates were nominated by the social services of each town hall's/mayor's office); This complements \"la F\u00eate des M\u00e8res\" (Mother's day) which was made official in France in 1928 and added to the calendar in Vichy in 1941.\n\n====Germany====\n[[Image:Hiking tour on father's day.JPG|thumb|Hiking tour on father's day with smaller wagons.]]\n\nIn Germany, Father's Day (''Vatertag'') is celebrated differently from other parts of the world.<ref name=\"urge\">{{Cite news| title = German Minister Urges Fathers Not to Get Drunk on Father's Day! | author=Agence France-Presse | url = http://www.medindia.net/news/German-Minister-Urges-Fathers-Not-to-Get-Drunk-on-Fathers-Day-36153-1.htm}}</ref> It is always celebrated on [[Ascension Day]] (the Thursday forty days after Easter), which is a federal holiday.

Traditionally, as on Mother's Day, families gather together and have lunch, usually at the grandparents' house. In recent years, families also started having lunch out, and as on Mother's Day, it is one of the busiest days for restaurants. At school, children handcraft their present for their fathers. Consumer goods companies have all sorts of special offers for fathers: electronics, suits, and men's healthcare products.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Holidays}}\n* [[Mother's Day]]\n* [[National Grandparents Day]]\n* [[List of films set around Father's Day]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book |title = Celebrations: The Complete Book of American Holidays |last = Myers |first = Robert J. |author2 = the editors of Hallmark Cards |publisher = Doubleday & Company |year = 1972 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/celebrationscomp00myer/page/184 184\u2013187] |isbn = 0-385-07677-0 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/celebrationscomp00myer/page/184 }}\n* {{Cite book| title = Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays | last = Schmidt | first = Leigh Eric | publisher=Princeton University Press | year = 1997 | pages = 275\u2013292 | isbn = 0-691-01721-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=maF8mTPsJqsC }}\n* {{Cite book| title = The Modernization of Fatherhood: A Social and Political History | last = Larossa | first = Ralph | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-226-46904-2 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/modernizationoff00laro/page/90 90], 170\u2013192 | url = https://archive.org/details/modernizationoff00laro | url-access = registration | quote = Ann Jarvis OR Anna Jarvis mother's day. }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Father's Day}}\n* {{Himanshu|Society/Holidays/Father's_Day|international mens day}}\n* [https://internationalmensday2019.blogspot.com/2019/11/international-mens-day.html], from [[George W.

The club has won one [[Stanley Cup]] championship in their history, in [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals|2003\u201304]]. The team is often referred to as the '''Bolts''', and the nickname was used on the former [[third jersey]]s. The Lightning plays home games in [[Amalie Arena]] in Tampa.\n\nThe owner of the Lightning is [[Jeffrey Vinik]], while [[Julien BriseBois]] serves as general manager. The team is currently coached by [[Jon Cooper (ice hockey)|Jon Cooper]], who has led the team since 2013.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Early years (1992\u20131998)===\nIn the late 1980s, the NHL announced it would expand. Two rival groups from the [[Tampa Bay Area]] decided to bid for a franchise: a St. Petersburg-based group fronted by future [[Hartford Whalers]]/[[Carolina Hurricanes]] owners [[Peter Karmanos Jr.|Peter Karmanos]] and [[Jim Rutherford]], and a Tampa-based group fronted by two [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]]\u2014[[Phil Esposito]] and his brother [[Tony Esposito|Tony]]. One of the Esposito group's key backers, the [[Pritzker family]], backed out a few months before the bid, to be replaced by a consortium of Japanese businesses headed by Kokusai Green, a golf course and resort operator. On paper, it looked like the Karmanos/Rutherford group had the more stable bid; however, it wanted to pay only $29&nbsp;million before starting play, while the Espositos were one of the few groups willing to pay the league's $50&nbsp;million expansion fee up front.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Power Plays: An Inside Look at the Big Business of the National Hockey League|last=Stein|first=Gil|year=1997|pages=86\u201392}}</ref> The Esposito group would win the expansion franchise on December 6, 1990,<ref>{{cite web |title=A franchise is born 25 years ago |url=https://www.nhl.com/lightning/news/a-franchise-is-born-25-years-ago/c-791248 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=May 27, 2019 |date=December 6, 2015}}</ref> and name the team the Lightning, after Tampa Bay's status as the \"Lightning Capital of North America.\"\n[[File:Philip Esposito, February 2012.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Phil Esposito]] fronted an ownership group that was later awarded an NHL franchise in 1992.]]\nAfter being awarded the franchise, Phil Esposito installed himself as president and general manager, while Tony became chief scout. [[Terry Crisp]], who played for the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] when they won two [[Stanley Cup]]s in the mid-1970s and coached the [[Calgary Flames]] to a Stanley Cup in [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1989]], was tapped as the first head coach. Phil Esposito also hired former teammates from the [[Boston Bruins]] of the 1970s, including former linemate [[Wayne Cashman]] as an assistant coach and former Bruin trainer John \"Frosty\" Forristal as the team's trainer. The inaugural team photo has him flanked by Cashman and player [[Ken Hodge, Jr.]], son of his other Bruins' linemate.\n\nThe Lightning turned heads in the pre-season when [[Manon Rh\u00e9aume|Manon Rheaume]] became the first woman to play in an NHL game, which also made her the first woman to play in any of the major professional North American sports leagues. She played for the Lightning against the [[St. Louis Blues]], and stopped seven of nine shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=642005|title=Part 1: Manon Rh\u00e9aume shatters hockey's gender barrier|publisher=National Hockey League}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whockey.com/profile/canada/rheaume.html|title=Manon Rheaume}}</ref>\n\nThe Lightning played their first regular season game on October 7, 1992 in Tampa's tiny 11,000-seat [[Expo Hall]] at the Florida State Fairgrounds. They shocked the visiting [[Chicago Blackhawks]] 7\u20133 with four goals by little-known [[Chris Kontos]]. The team shot to the top of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Campbell Conference]]'s [[Norris Division]] within a month, behind Kontos' initial torrid scoring pace and a breakout season by forward [[Brian Bradley (ice hockey, born 1965)|Brian Bradley]]. However, it buckled under the strain of some of the longest road trips in the NHL\u2014their nearest division rival, the Blues, were over 1,000 miles away\u2014and finished in last place with a record of 23\u201354\u20137 for 53 points. This was, at the time, one of the best-ever showings by an NHL expansion team. Bradley's 42 goals gave Tampa Bay fans optimism for the next season; it would be a team record until the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nThe following season saw the Lightning shift to the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]]'s [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]], as well as move into the [[Tropicana Field|Florida Suncoast Dome]] (a building originally designed for baseball) in St. Petersburg, which was reconfigured for hockey and renamed the \"ThunderDome.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Tim |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/325053951/?terms=ThunderDome|title=Lightning's spark? It was on the bench|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=October 10, 1993|page=6C|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref> The team acquired [[goaltender]] [[Daren Puppa]], [[winger (ice hockey)|left wing]] goal scorer [[Petr Kl\u00edma|Petr Klima]], and veteran forward [[Denis Savard]]. While Puppa's play resulted in a significant improvement in goals allowed (from 332 to 251), Savard was long past his prime and Klima's scoring was offset by his defensive lapses. The Lightning finished last in the Atlantic Division in 1993\u201394 with a record of 30\u201343\u201311 for 71 points. Another disappointing season followed in the lockout-shortened [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1994\u201395 season]] with a record of 17\u201328\u20133 for 37 points.\n\n====On-ice and off-ice struggles====\nIn their fourth season, [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396]], behind Bradley's team-leading 79 points, second-year forward [[Alexander Selivanov]]'s 31 goals, and [[Roman Hamrl\u00edk|Roman Hamrlik]]'s All-Star year on defense, the Lightning finally qualified for the playoffs, posting a 38\u201332\u201312 record for 88 points, ahead of the defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[New Jersey Devils]] for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference by a single win. Due to his stellar play in net, Puppa was named a finalist for the [[Vezina Trophy]] (losing out to [[Jim Carey (ice hockey)|Jim Carey]] of the [[Washington Capitals]]). Playing the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], a team seen as a Stanley Cup contender, in the first round, the Lightning split the opening two games in Philadelphia before taking Game 3 in overtime before a ThunderDome crowd of 28,183. This was the largest crowd for an NHL game, a record that stood until the [[2003 Heritage Classic]] in Edmonton. An injury to Puppa in that game, however, would see the Lightning lose the next three games and the series.\n[[File:Amalie Arena.jpg|thumb|The Lightning moved to their present home, the Ice Palace (now [[Amalie Arena]]) during the 1996 off-season.]]\n\nThe Lightning moved into a new arena in downtown Tampa, the Ice Palace (later the St. Pete Times Forum, Tampa Bay Times Forum and now [[Amalie Arena]]) for the [[1996\u201397 NHL season|1996\u201397 season]]. They had acquired goal-scorer [[Dino Ciccarelli]] from the [[Detroit Red Wings]] during the 1996 off-season, and he did not disappoint, scoring 35 goals while [[Chris Gratton]] notched another 30 goals. The team appeared destined for another playoff appearance, but suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but four games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|2000]]. Bradley also lost time to a series of concussions that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. [[Centre (ice hockey)|Center]] [[John Cullen]] developed [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and missed the last 12 games of the 1996\u201397 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. They would not tally as much as 60 points again for five years.\n\nMost of the Lightning's early stars were gone by the [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399 season]] due to free agency and a series of ill-advised trades. Crisp was fired 11 games into the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] and replaced by [[Jacques Demers]]. Though Demers had presided over the resurgence of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1980s and helmed a Stanley Cup run with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 1993, he was unable to change the team's fortunes and the Lightning ended up losing 55 games.\n\nBy most accounts, the Lightning's plunge to the bottom of the NHL was due to inattentive ownership by Kokusai Green. Rumors abounded as early as the team's second season that the Lightning were on the brink of bankruptcy and that the team was part of a [[money laundering]] scheme for the [[yakuza]] (Japanese crime families).<ref name=\"HC\">{{Cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |authorlink= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref> Its scouting operation consisted of Tony Esposito and several satellite dishes.

Even though the Ice Palace was built for hockey and the Lightning were the only major tenant, ''Forbes'' called the team's deal with the arena a lemon since it would not result in much revenue for 30 years. It was also behind on paying state sales taxes and federal payroll taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/Lightning/lh.1203.finances.html|title=Lightning Highlights}}</ref>\n\nFinally, in 1998, Kokusai Green found a buyer. Although [[Bill Davidson (businessman)|William Davidson]], owner of the [[Detroit Pistons]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), was thought to be the frontrunner, the buyer turned out to be insurance tycoon and motivational speaker [[Arthur L.

The team was $102&nbsp;million in debt at the time the sale closed.<ref name=\"Fischler\"/> Williams knew very little about hockey, but was very visible and outspoken, and immediately pumped an additional $6&nbsp;million into the team's payroll. He also cleared most of the debt from the Kokusai Green era. After taking control, Williams publicly assured the Espositos that their jobs were safe, only to fire them two games into the 1998\u201399 season. He then gave Demers complete control of hockey operations as both coach and general manager. The Lightning drafted [[Vincent Lecavalier]] in 1998, a player who would be a cornerstone of the team for years to come.\n\nWilliams was widely seen as being in over his head and was an easy target for ridicule from his fellow NHL owners, who called him \"[[The Beverly Hillbillies|Jed Clampett]]\" behind his back due to his thick [[Southern American English|Southern]] accent and [[fundamentalist Christian]] views. Early in the 1998\u201399 season, the Lightning lost ten games in a row, all but ending any chance of making the playoffs. They ended up losing 54 games that year, more than the expansion [[Nashville Predators]].\n\n===Vincent Lecavalier and Martin St. Louis era (1998\u20132013)===\n====Return to respectability====\nBy the spring of 1999, Williams had seen enough. He had not attended a game in some time because \"this team broke my heart\". He lost $20&nbsp;million in the 1998\u201399 season alone, as much money in one year as he had estimated he could have reasonably lost in five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcshockey.com/issues/115/tam.asp|title=LCS Hockey : Team Reports : Tampa Bay Lightning}}</ref> Williams sold the team for $115&nbsp;million\u2014$2&nbsp;million less than he had paid for the team a year earlier\u2014to Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson, who had almost bought the team a year earlier.<ref name=blunder>[http://www.sptimes.com/News/120600/Columns/Blunderful_.shtml Blunderful], St. Petersburg Times</ref> Along with the sale, the Lightning acquired a new top minor league affiliate; Davidson also owned the [[Detroit Vipers]] of the now-defunct [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]].\n\nDavidson remained in Detroit, but appointed Tom Wilson as team president to handle day-to-day management of the team. Wilson immediately fired Demers, who despite his best efforts (and fatherly attitude toward Lecavalier) was unable to overcome the damage from the Kokusai Green ownership. Wilson persuaded [[Ottawa Senators]] general manager (and former Vipers GM) [[Rick Dudley]] to take over as the Lightning's new general manager; Dudley, in turn, brought Vipers coach [[Steve Ludzik]] in as the team's new head coach. Wilson, Dudley and Ludzik had helped make the Vipers one of the premier minor league hockey franchises, having won a [[Turner Cup]] in only their third season in Detroit (the team had originally been based in [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles|Salt Lake City]]).\n\nHowever, as had been the case with Demers, the damage from the last few seasons under Kokusai Green was too much for Ludzik to overcome. Even with a wholesale transfer of talent from Detroit to Tampa (a move that eventually doomed the Vipers, which folded along with the IHL in 2001), the Lightning lost 54 games in [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]] and 52 in [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]], becoming the first team in NHL history to post four straight 50-loss seasons. The lone bright spots in those years were the blossoming of Lecavalier and [[Brad Richards]] into NHL stars. Ludzik was replaced in early 2001 by career NHL assistant [[John Tortorella]]. The March 5 trade deadline offered another glimmer of hope when the team acquired hold-out goaltender [[Nikolai Khabibulin]] from the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] for three players and a draft pick.\n\nThe [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], Tortorella's first full year behind the bench, saw some improvement. [[Martin St. Louis]] was having a breakout season when he broke his leg in game number 47 and was lost for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/01/24/stlouis020124.html | publisher=CBC News | title=Lightning winger St. Louis out with broken leg | date=January 24, 2002}}</ref> Khabibulin recorded a shut out at the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] but was not named its [[most valuable player|MVP]], by all accounts due to the game's voting protocol.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/2002/all_star/news/2002/02/02/khabibulin_allstar_st/ | publisher=CNN | title=Vote deadline may have cost Khabibulin the MVP award}}</ref> By mid-February, the Lightning were well out of playoff contention and were sinking under a rash of injuries. Dudley, who had guaranteed a playoff berth before the season, was fired and replaced by his assistant, [[Jay Feaster]]. Still the Lightning showed some signs of life, earning more than 60 points for the first time since 1997. Tortorella stripped Lecavalier of the captaincy due to contract negotiations that had made the young center miss the start of the season.\n\n====Two dream seasons and the Stanley Cup====\nWith a young core of players led by Vincent Lecavalier, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis and [[Fredrik Modin]], the Lightning were thought to be very close to respectability. However, they arrived somewhat earlier than expected in [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303]]. The young team was led by the goaltending of Nikolai Khabibulin and the scoring efforts of Lecavalier, St. Louis, Modin, Richards and [[Ruslan Fedotenko]], and also boasted a new captain, former prolific scorer [[Dave Andreychuk]]. Throughout the season, the Lightning battled the [[Washington Capitals]] for first place in the Southeast Division. They finished with a record of 36\u201325\u201316 for 93 points, breaking the 90-point barrier for the first time in team history. They won the division by just one point, giving them home-ice advantage in their first round match-up with the Capitals. At season's end, coach Tortorella was recognized for his efforts by being named a finalist for the [[Jack Adams Award]], losing out to [[Jacques Lemaire]] of the [[Minnesota Wild]].\n\nIn the first round of the [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], the Lightning quickly fell two games behind in the series but followed the two losses with four consecutive wins which advanced them to the Conference Semi-finals for the first time in team history. In the semi-finals, the Lightning won only one game, losing the series to the [[New Jersey Devils]], who went on to win the Stanley Cup.\n[[File:Lightning Championship Mural.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A mural of the Tampa Bay Lightning after winning the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals|2004 Stanley Cup]] in downtown Tampa.]]\nThe Lightning's dramatic improvement continued through the [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 regular season]], finishing with a record of 46\u201322\u20138\u20136 for 106 points, second-best in the NHL after the Western Conference's Detroit Red Wings\u2014the first 100-point season in franchise history. The Lightning went through the season with only 20-man-games lost to injury. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lightning ousted the [[Alexei Yashin]]-led [[New York Islanders]] in five games, with solid play from goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin, who posted three shutouts in Games 1, 3 and 4.\n\nIn the second round, the Lightning faced the [[Montreal Canadiens]], captained by [[Saku Koivu]]; Lecavalier, Richards, and Khabibulin led the team to a four-game sweep of Montreal. Next, they faced [[Keith Primeau]] and the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the Conference Finals. After a tightly-fought seven-game series in which neither team was able to win consecutive games, Fredrik Modin notched the winning goal of the seventh and deciding game, earning the Eastern Conference championship for the Lightning and their first-ever berth in the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals.\n\nTheir opponent in the final round was the [[Calgary Flames]], captained by [[Jarome Iginla]]. The final round also went the full seven games, with the deciding game played in the St. Pete Times Forum on June 7, 2004. This time, Ruslan Fedotenko was the Game 7 hero, scoring both Lightning goals in a 2\u20131 victory. Brad Richards, who had 26 points in the post-season, won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the most valuable player of the playoffs; the Lightning had won all 31 contests in which he had scored a goal since the opening of the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raising the Cup presents: Game 7 2004 Stanley Cup Final|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/raising-the-cup-presents-game-7-2004-stanley-cup-final/c-569846|website=NHL.com|date=August 16, 2011|access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref> Tortorella won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year. Only three years after their last of four consecutive seasons of 50 or more losses, and in only their 12th year of existence, the Lightning became the southernmost team ever to win the Stanley Cup. Martin St. Louis led the team and the NHL with 94 points (his 38 goals were fourth-most after the 41 of tied trio Jarome Iginla, [[Rick Nash]] and [[Ilya Kovalchuk]]), and won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's most valuable player. St. Louis also won the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] for the NHL's most outstanding player as voted by the [[National Hockey League Players' Association|NHL Players' Association]], and tied the [[Vancouver Canucks]]' [[Marek Mal\u00edk|Marek Malik]] for the [[NHL Plus/Minus Award]]. A season of superlatives was capped with one final accolade, as ''[[The Sporting News]]'' named GM Jay Feaster as the league's executive of the year for 2003\u201304.\n\nThe Lightning had to wait a year to defend their title due to the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]], but in [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], they barely made the playoffs with a record of 43\u201333\u20136 for 93 points in a conference where six teams notched 100 or more points. They lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games in the first round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 playoffs]].\n\n====Disappointments and rebuilding====\n[[File:Vincent Lecavalier 2007.jpg|thumb|During the [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307 season]], [[Vincent Lecavalier]] broke the then franchise record for most points, and goals in a single season.]]\nDuring the off-season, the Lightning traded Fredrik Modin and [[Fredrik Norrena]] to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in exchange for goaltender [[Marc Denis]] in an effort to replace the departing [[John Grahame]], who had signed with the Carolina Hurricanes. However, free agent [[Johan Holmqvist]] would eventually receive the majority of playing time and most of the club's wins. The first half of [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307]] was inconsistent for the Lightning, maintaining an 18\u201319\u20132 record throughout the first few months. January and February were far better months for the team, going 9\u20134\u20130 in January and 9\u20132\u20132 in February, driving them back into the playoff race. Fourteen games in March were split even, and on March 16, 2007, Vincent Lecavalier broke the franchise record for most points in a season, with 95 (finishing with 108). The record was previously held by Martin St. Louis, who had set the record in the 2003\u201304 Stanley Cup-winning year. Lecavalier also broke the franchise's goal scoring record, finishing with a league-leading 52 goals.\n\nThe Lightning were busy during the final weeks before the NHL's trade deadline, acquiring wingers [[Kyle Wanvig]], [[Stephen Baby]] and defenseman [[Shane O'Brien (ice hockey)|Shane O'Brien]]. Former first round pick [[Nikita Alexeev]] was traded on deadline day to the Chicago Blackhawks. Other mid-season additions to the team included [[Filip Kuba]], [[Luke Richardson]] and [[Doug Janik]]. Veteran [[Andr\u00e9 Roy|Andre Roy]], who had won the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004, was claimed off waivers from the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n\nThroughout March, the Lightning had been competing with the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] for first place in the Southeast Division. With a chance to overtake the Thrashers one final time and once again become division champions for the third time in team history, on April 6, 2007, in the final week of the regular season, the Lighting suffered a loss to the [[Florida Panthers]], the night before the season finale in Atlanta. That same night, the Thrashers defeated the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and subsequently clinched the division. For the Lightning, this meant having to settle for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a final record of 44\u201333\u20135 (93 points). However, the Lightning were eliminated from playoff competition on April 22 after a 3\u20132 home loss to the New Jersey Devils in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals.\n[[File:V\u00e1clav Prospal 2007.jpg|thumb|[[V\u00e1clav Prospal|Vaclav Prospal]] with the Lightning in 2007. Prior to the 2007 NHL trade deadline, the Lightning traded Prospal to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in exchange for [[Alexandre R. Picard|Alexandre Picard]] and a conditional draft pick.]]\nFollowing their playoff exit, on August 7, 2007, Absolute Hockey Enterprises, a group led by [[Doug MacLean]], announced it had signed a purchase agreement for the team and the [[leasehold]] on the St. Pete Times Forum. MacLean is the former president and general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets and former head coach for both the Blue Jackets and the Florida Panthers. The group announced it planned to keep the team in Tampa, but the deal collapsed during the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe Lightning struggled to maintain success during the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 campaign]]. Although the \"Big 3\" of Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards, along with [[V\u00e1clav Prospal|Vaclav Prospal]], had performed up to expectations, they had little consistent play from supporting players.\n\nAt the start of the All-Star Break on January 25, 2008, the Lightning had a 20\u201325\u20135 record, and with 45 points, were in last place in both the Southeast Division and the Eastern Conference. Only the [[Los Angeles Kings]] had a lower point total at this time of the season, with 40 points.\n\nOn February 13, 2008, it was announced that Palace Sports & Entertainment had agreed to sell the Lightning to OK Hockey LLC, a group headed by [[Oren Koules]], a producer of the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' horror movies, and [[Len Barrie]], a former NHL player and real estate developer.\n\nThe Lightning were active during the trade deadline, similar to the previous season. More notable trades included Vaclav Prospal's trade to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for prospect [[Alexandre R. Picard|Alexandre Picard]] and a conditional draft pick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354834&page=NewsPage&service=page|title=Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 News: Lightning Acquire Conditional Draft Pick, AHL All-Star Defenseman From Philadelphia \u2013 25 February 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227195047/http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354834&page=NewsPage&service=page|archivedate=December 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Brad Richards and goaltender Johan Holmqvist were traded to the [[Dallas Stars]] in exchange for goaltender [[Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982)|Mike Smith]] and forwards [[Jussi Jokinen]] and [[Jeff Halpern]], as well as a fourth-round draft pick in [[2009 NHL Entry Draft|2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354950&page=NewsPage&service=page|title=Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 News: Lightning Acquire Goaltender Mike Smith, Center Jeff Halpern, Left Wing Jussi Jokinen & fourth-Round Pick From Dallas \u2013 26 February 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227210136/http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354950&page=NewsPage&service=page|archivedate=December 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Jan Hlav\u00e1\u010d|Jan Hlavac]], a regular contributor, was also traded, moving to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a seventh-round pick in [[2008 NHL Entry Draft|2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=355022&page=NewsPage&service=page|title=Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 News: Lightning Acquire Seventh-Round Pick In 2008 From Nashville In Exchange For Jan Hlavac \u2013 26 February 2008}}</ref> Defenseman [[Dan Boyle (ice hockey)|Dan Boyle]] was re-signed to a six-year contract extension reportedly worth $40&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/news/story?id=3264930|title=Lightning re-sign D Boyle to six-year extension|date=February 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the trade deadline, the Lightning fared no better than they had throughout the entire season. After the February 26 trade deadline, the Lightning won only five games. Finishing with a 31\u201342\u20139 record, with 71 points, they had the highest chance of winning the top overall pick in the [[2008 NHL Entry Draft]] through the draft lottery, which they eventually won on April 7. They would use their first overall pick to select [[Steven Stamkos]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL)'s [[Sarnia Sting]].\n\nThe Lightning were the worst team on the road in the NHL, winning only 11 games. Another showing of the team's poor play was the difference from the previous season's success in the overtime/shootout periods. In the 2006\u201307 season, the Lightning had one of the best extra period records, winning 15 games in either overtime or the shootout. However, in the 2007\u201308 season, they won only three games, losing nine.\n\nVincent Lecavalier suffered a dislocated shoulder as the result of an open-ice hit from [[Matt Cooke]] of the Washington Capitals in the game before the season finale in Atlanta. Lecavalier, who planned on having arthroscopic wrist surgery after the season's ending, would undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder as well. Cooke was fined $2,500 by the NHL for the hit, as Lecavalier did not have possession of the puck at the time. Perhaps the lone bright spot in the season was Lecavalier's winning both the [[King Clancy Memorial Trophy]] and the [[NHL Foundation Player Award]] for work through his foundation, including a $3&nbsp;million pledge to [[All Children's Hospital]] in St. Petersburg, Florida, for what would become the Vincent Lecavalier Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at All Children's Hospital.\n\nHead coach John Tortorella was fired by the Lightning following their worst season since Tortorella was hired. At the time working as an NHL analyst for [[ESPN]], [[Barry Melrose]] stated on June 4 during an episode of ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'' that he missed coaching and would entertain any NHL coaching offers. He stated, \"I miss not having a dog in the fight.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=PRESS |first1=ASSOCIATED |title=Lightning hire Barry Melrose as coach |url=https://www.heraldtribune.com/article/LK/20080624/News/605222060/SH/ |website=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |accessdate=23 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> On June 23, ESPN reported Melrose had been chosen to be the head coach of the Lightning, beginning in 2008\u201309.

However, the Lightning did not get off to a great start as hoped, and Melrose was eventually fired by the Lightning with a 5\u20137\u20134 record. [[Rick Tocchet]], who had been hired as assistant coach during the previous off-season, was promoted to interim head coach.\n\nOn March 4, veterans [[Mark Recchi]] and [[Olaf K\u00f6lzig|Olaf Kolzig]] were traded by the Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], respectively.

Unable to make a final push for the playoffs, they were officially eliminated from contention within the first week of April.

With the sixth pick of the [[2010 NHL Entry Draft]], the Lightning selected forward [[Brett Connolly]] despite a history of injuries while playing for the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL)'s [[Prince George Cougars]]. When asked about Connolly's injuries being a factor in the decision to draft him, Yzerman boldly declared, \"I think it was a factor that he was available with the 6th pick.

However, the Lightning went on to win the next three games, including a 1\u20130 Game 7 win on the road, taking their first playoff series since winning the Stanley Cup in 2004. In the Conference Semi-finals, the Lightning swept the top-seeded Washington Capitals.\n\nTampa Bay went up against the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 4 of the series, the Lightning trailed 3\u20130 at the end of the first period. When Dwayne Roloson was pulled for Mike Smith, the Bruins failed to score again, and the Lightning tied the game in the second period by scoring three goals in 3:58, going on to win the game 5\u20133 and tying the series at two games apiece. The series went the full seven games, though the Lightning were eliminated by a single goal, as the game was lost (0\u20131).\n\nThe Lightning finished the [[2011\u201312 Tampa Bay Lightning season|2011\u201312 season]] with a 38\u201336\u20138 record. With only 84 points, they fell short of reaching the playoffs, ending the season third in the Southeast Division and tenth in the Eastern Conference.\n\nIndividually, Steven Stamkos scored a franchise-record 60 goals. He won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy for the second time in his career, the first time in which he was the unanimous victor. Stamkos was also second in the NHL in points with 97, and was a finalist for both the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and the [[Ted Lindsay Award]].\n\nAs with the [[1994\u201395 NHL lockout]], the [[2012\u201313 NHL lockout]] resulted in a 48-game season.\n\nNearing the end of a dismal 18\u201326\u20134 season for 40 points, in which the Lightning ended fourth in the Southeast and 14th in the East, GM Steve Yzerman looked to their highly-successful [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Syracuse Crunch]].

This move would make Lecavalier an unrestricted free agent beginning July 5, free to sign with any team except the Lightning. The team stated the move was made not because of Lecavalier's play on the ice, but simply because of how his contract affected the team's salary cap, which would have been over $7&nbsp;million per year until its expiration after the 2019\u201320 season.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Tampa Bay Lightning|date=June 27, 2013|accessdate=June 27, 2013|title=Lightning To Use Compliance Buyout on Vincent Lecavalier|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=675430}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Tampa Bay Lightning|date=June 27, 2013|accessdate=June 27, 2013|title=Analysis of Lecavalier Compliance Buyout|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=675431}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Tampa Bay Times|author=Damian Cristodero|date=June 27, 2013|accessdate=June 27, 2013|title=Lightning plans Lecavalier buyout|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/hockey/lightning/lightning-starts-lecavalier-buyout-process/2128824}}</ref>\n\n===Steven Stamkos era (2013\u2013present)===\n====Return to the playoffs====\nAfter acquiring goaltender [[Ben Bishop]] from the Ottawa Senators in a trade the previous season, the Lightning started the 2013 season with an above average performance.

Tampa Bay eliminated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round of the playoffs before facing Montreal in the second round. The Lightning won the first three games of the series and had a chance to sweep the Canadiens, however Montreal responded with wins in Games 4 and 5 to extend the series to a sixth game. Tampa Bay won the sixth game of the series to eliminate the Canadiens and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2011, facing the New York Rangers.\n\n[[File:Tampa Bay Lightning Game 6 Watch Party (18219067034) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A viewing party outside [[Amalie Arena]] for Game 6 of the [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals]].]]\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Lightning and the Rangers split the first two games of the series in New York, with the Lightning winning Game 2 of the series thanks to a [[Tyler Johnson (ice hockey)|Tyler Johnson]] hat-trick.

During Game 5 in New York, goaltender Ben Bishop recorded his second shutout of the playoffs in a 2\u20130 victory, but the Rangers responded in Game 6 by scoring seven goals to tie the series at three games apiece. In Game 7, Bishop recorded his third shutout of the playoffs in another 2\u20130 victory against the Rangers to lead the Lightning to [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals since 2004]].

The 2015\u201316 season was filled with controversy for the Lightning, starting off with the contractual questions regarding team captain Steven Stamkos and with the former third overall pick [[Jonathan Drouin]] publicly requesting a trade and being suspended from the organization. The Lightning picked up their play at the beginning of the year 2016 and set the franchise record to nine consecutive wins on March 5, 2016, when [[Alex Killorn]] scored with 42.5 seconds remaining in overtime to propel the Lightning to a 4\u20133 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes at Amalie Arena. On March 26, 2016, the Lightning announced cornerstone defenseman [[Anton Str\u00e5lman|Anton Stralman]] had suffered a fractured leg in their game against the New York Islanders at home. Tampa's fortunes would get even worse when Stamkos shockingly was out of the lineup for the team's game on April 2 against the New Jersey Devils in Tampa. Lightning GM [[Steve Yzerman]] announced after the game that the captain would miss one-to-three months due to a blood clot in his arm. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the team had no other option but to bring Drouin back to the team. The Lightning ended up finishing second in the Atlantic Division and would once again face the third-seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the [[2016 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]].\n\n[[File:Nikita Kucherov 140103.png|thumb|upright|[[Nikita Kucherov]] emerged as the Lightning's leading point-scorer during the [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2015\u201316 season]].]]\nThe Lightning ended up defeating the Red Wings in five games after winning 1\u20130 at Amalie Arena. Next up, the Islanders (who had recently defeated the Panthers to win their first playoff series since the 1992\u201393 season) would face the Lightning. In Game 1, the Islanders defeated the Bolts 5\u20133. The Lightning would eventually answer back by winning four consecutive games in the series to defeat the Isles in five games, in large part due to back-to-back road overtime victories with goals scored by [[Brian Boyle]] and [[Jason Garrison]]. The Lightning were set to play against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 1 at [[Consol Energy Center]], star goaltender Ben Bishop would be added to the list of devastating injuries for the team as he left on a stretcher and did not return for the remainder of the series. Stralman would eventually return in Game 2. A back-and-forth series would eventually lead to a Game 7 showdown in [[Pittsburgh]]. Lightning captain Steven Stamkos surprisingly took warmups and was in the Lightning lineup after a long absence from blood clot surgery. However, it was not enough, as the Lightning would fall 2\u20131 against the Penguins, who went on to defeat the [[San Jose Sharks]] and win the Stanley Cup.\n\nWith the Lightning under the spotlight in the 2016 off-season, Drouin rescinded his trade request. Steve Yzerman would then announce on June 29 the team re-signed Stamkos to an eight-year, cap-friendly deal. He would then sign star defenseman Victor Hedman to an eight-year contract on July 1, along with a seven-year deal for Alex Killorn and a three-year deal for former first round pick, goaltender [[Andrei Vasilevskiy]].\n\nThe Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs in the 2016\u201317 season. Finishing with 94 points, they were beaten to the second wildcard by the Toronto Maple Leafs, with 95 points. The 2016\u201317 season for the Lightning was a host of injuries, mainly their captain, Steven Stamkos. Stamkos went down in the 17th game, against the Detroit Red Wings. It was revealed he suffered from a torn left meniscus, which put him out for the rest of the season. During the season, they traded goaltender Ben Bishop to the Los Angeles Kings, center Brian Boyle to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and forward [[Valtteri Filppula]] to the Philadelphia Flyers. However, there were positive signs as winger Nikita Kucherov emerged with 40 goals and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy stepped up after Bishop left. The Lightning also showcased their young talent with rookie [[Brayden Point]] and promising AHL call-ups [[Yanni Gourde]] and [[Jake Dotchin]]. The Lightning bounced back with this talent in the last third of the season, but it was not enough as they missed the playoffs by one point.\n[[File:Victor Hedman - Tampa Bay Lightning.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Victor Hedman]] won the [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] in [[2017\u201318 NHL season|2017\u201318]]]]\nIn the off-season, the Lightning made a deal with the Montreal Canadiens to send Jonathan Drouin to their franchise in exchange for defensive prospect [[Mikhail Sergachev]] and a second-round pick in the [[2018 NHL Entry Draft]].

This style was also used on the blue alternate in 1998\u201399, replacing an \"electrified\" number font used from 1996\u201398. In 2001\u201302, the old fonts were replaced with traditional block letters and numbers, which have been used ever since. They also darkened their shades of blue that season from a royal blue to a speed (Indy) blue.\n\nAs with all NHL teams for the 2007\u201308 season, the Lightning debuted in new Reebok \"Rbk Edge\" jerseys. Also, like several other NHL teams, the Lightning updated their team logo.\n\nThe Lightning unveiled their new logo on August 25, 2007. The logo was similar to the inaugural one, but with a more modern look. The new logo also kept the same theme as the previous one, but with the words \"Tampa Bay\" across the top now appearing with tall capital initials, and the word \"Lightning\" no longer appearing on the bottom of the logo.\n\n[[File:Tampa Bay Lightning.svg|thumb|150px|In 2007 the Lightning adopted a new primary logo, which was used until 2011.]] \nThe Edge jerseys use the same template adopted by the [[Ottawa Senators]] and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. Unlike those teams, the Lightning's elbow panels remain the base color of the jersey, and an additional blue panel is added near the cuff of the sleeve. The Edge uniforms retain the underarm gusset \"victory stripes\" of their predecessors.\n\nThe Lightning then debuted a new \"alternate\" or \"third\" jersey in the 2008\u201309 season. The jersey features a dominant \"electric blue\" color, with black and silver accents at the end of the sleeves. The logo is removed, and in its place emblazoned across the front of the jersey descending to the lower left of the jersey is the word \"BOLTS\" (utilizing a layout similar to that of the Ottawa Senators' third jersey). The numbers are featured on the back and sleeves only, using white lettering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=394050|title=Lightning Unveil Third Jerseys vs. Devils|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227211443/http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=394050|archivedate=December 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt was reported on January 23, 2011, that the Lightning had filed paperwork with the NHL to change their logo and colors, beginning with the 2011\u201312 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/lightning/content/tampa-bay-lightnings-new-uniforms-sound-if-they-will-include-simple-classic-design |title=Tampa Bay Lightning's new uniforms sound as if they will include a simple, classic design |author=Damian Cristodero |date=January 23, 2011 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> The new logo, as well as the new home and away jerseys, were unveiled by the team at a press conference at the St. Pete Times Forum on January 31, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lightning.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=551150 |title=Lightning Unveil New Logo, Jersey Systems Along with Vision and Brand Aspiration |date=January 31, 2011 |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref> The Lightning began to integrate the new logo onto center ice, and even distributed free T-shirts with the simplified logo on February 4, 2011, while still using the old Lightning logo and uniforms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/lightning/content/couple-tampa-bay-lightning-records-could-fall-tonight-times-forum-against-capitals |title=A couple of Tampa Bay Lightning records could fall tonight at Times Forum against the Capitals |date=February 4, 2011 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe current uniforms are made in a traditional hockey sweater design. Initially, the colors that were to be used were simply blue and white, but by popular demand, black was later added as a trim color on the numbers. The victory stripes were also eliminated. Despite the introduction of the new uniforms, the previous third jersey was retained, with the new simplified logo replacing the old logo in the shoulders prior to the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the Lightning announced that a new black third sweater will replace the existing \"BOLTS\" sweaters. The new sweaters were unveiled on September 27, 2014. It retained the \"BOLTS\" wordmark, while adding white accents in a similar manner as the [[Los Angeles Kings]]' sweaters. The secondary roundel logo also replaced the primary logo on the sleeves, while the metro name was enscripted on the collar.\n\nThe Lightning made some minor tweaks to their current uniform set following the NHL's move to [[Adidas]] as its uniform provider in the 2017\u201318 season. The most notable change is the removal of the \"TAMPA BAY\" wordmark on the white away sweaters.\n\nA third sweater was not used during all of 2017\u201318 and much of the 2018\u201319 season. On February 7, 2019, the Lightning unveiled a new black uniform, lacking any blue and white elements and featuring sublimated black and grey patterns on the sleeves, socks and back numbers.\n\n===In-game personalities===\nFormer [[United States Air Force]] Technical Sergeant Sonya Bryson-Kirksey sings the American national anthem at home games and she is accompanied by organist Krystof Srebrakowski.\n\n===ThunderBug===\nThe Lightning mascot is a [[firefly|lightning bug]] named ThunderBug.

They compete in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] of the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]]. The club has won one [[Stanley Cup]] championship in their history, in [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals|2003\u201304]]. The team is often referred to as the '''Bolts''', and the nickname was used on the former [[third jersey]]s. The Lightning plays home games in [[Amalie Arena]] in Tampa.\n\nThe owner of the Lightning is [[Jeffrey Vinik]], while [[Julien BriseBois]] serves as general manager. The team is currently coached by [[Jon Cooper (ice hockey)|Jon Cooper]], who has led the team since 2013.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Early years (1992\u20131998)===\nIn the late 1980s, the NHL announced it would expand. Two rival groups from the [[Tampa Bay Area]] decided to bid for a franchise: a St. Petersburg-based group fronted by future [[Hartford Whalers]]/[[Carolina Hurricanes]] owners [[Peter Karmanos Jr.|Peter Karmanos]] and [[Jim Rutherford]], and a Tampa-based group fronted by two [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]]\u2014[[Phil Esposito]] and his brother [[Tony Esposito|Tony]]. One of the Esposito group's key backers, the [[Pritzker family]], backed out a few months before the bid, to be replaced by a consortium of Japanese businesses headed by Kokusai Green, a golf course and resort operator. On paper, it looked like the Karmanos/Rutherford group had the more stable bid; however, it wanted to pay only $29&nbsp;million before starting play, while the Espositos were one of the few groups willing to pay the league's $50&nbsp;million expansion fee up front.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Power Plays: An Inside Look at the Big Business of the National Hockey League|last=Stein|first=Gil|year=1997|pages=86\u201392}}</ref> The Esposito group would win the expansion franchise on December 6, 1990,<ref>{{cite web |title=A franchise is born 25 years ago |url=https://www.nhl.com/lightning/news/a-franchise-is-born-25-years-ago/c-791248 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=May 27, 2019 |date=December 6, 2015}}</ref> and name the team the Lightning, after Tampa Bay's status as the \"Lightning Capital of North America.\"\n[[File:Philip Esposito, February 2012.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Phil Esposito]] fronted an ownership group that was later awarded an NHL franchise in 1992.]]\nAfter being awarded the franchise, Phil Esposito installed himself as president and general manager, while Tony became chief scout. [[Terry Crisp]], who played for the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] when they won two [[Stanley Cup]]s in the mid-1970s and coached the [[Calgary Flames]] to a Stanley Cup in [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1989]], was tapped as the first head coach. Phil Esposito also hired former teammates from the [[Boston Bruins]] of the 1970s, including former linemate [[Wayne Cashman]] as an assistant coach and former Bruin trainer John \"Frosty\" Forristal as the team's trainer. The inaugural team photo has him flanked by Cashman and player [[Ken Hodge, Jr.]], son of his other Bruins' linemate.\n\nThe Lightning turned heads in the pre-season when [[Manon Rh\u00e9aume|Manon Rheaume]] became the first woman to play in an NHL game, which also made her the first woman to play in any of the major professional North American sports leagues. She played for the Lightning against the [[St. Louis Blues]], and stopped seven of nine shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=642005|title=Part 1: Manon Rh\u00e9aume shatters hockey's gender barrier|publisher=National Hockey League}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whockey.com/profile/canada/rheaume.html|title=Manon Rheaume}}</ref>\n\nThe Lightning played their first regular season game on October 7, 1992 in Tampa's tiny 11,000-seat [[Expo Hall]] at the Florida State Fairgrounds. They shocked the visiting [[Chicago Blackhawks]] 7\u20133 with four goals by little-known [[Chris Kontos]]. The team shot to the top of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Campbell Conference]]'s [[Norris Division]] within a month, behind Kontos' initial torrid scoring pace and a breakout season by forward [[Brian Bradley (ice hockey, born 1965)|Brian Bradley]]. However, it buckled under the strain of some of the longest road trips in the NHL\u2014their nearest division rival, the Blues, were over 1,000 miles away\u2014and finished in last place with a record of 23\u201354\u20137 for 53 points. This was, at the time, one of the best-ever showings by an NHL expansion team. Bradley's 42 goals gave Tampa Bay fans optimism for the next season; it would be a team record until the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nThe following season saw the Lightning shift to the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]]'s [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]], as well as move into the [[Tropicana Field|Florida Suncoast Dome]] (a building originally designed for baseball) in St. Petersburg, which was reconfigured for hockey and renamed the \"ThunderDome.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Tim |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/325053951/?terms=ThunderDome|title=Lightning's spark? It was on the bench|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=October 10, 1993|page=6C|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref> The team acquired [[goaltender]] [[Daren Puppa]], [[winger (ice hockey)|left wing]] goal scorer [[Petr Kl\u00edma|Petr Klima]], and veteran forward [[Denis Savard]]. While Puppa's play resulted in a significant improvement in goals allowed (from 332 to 251), Savard was long past his prime and Klima's scoring was offset by his defensive lapses. The Lightning finished last in the Atlantic Division in 1993\u201394 with a record of 30\u201343\u201311 for 71 points. Another disappointing season followed in the lockout-shortened [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1994\u201395 season]] with a record of 17\u201328\u20133 for 37 points.\n\n====On-ice and off-ice struggles====\nIn their fourth season, [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396]], behind Bradley's team-leading 79 points, second-year forward [[Alexander Selivanov]]'s 31 goals, and [[Roman Hamrl\u00edk|Roman Hamrlik]]'s All-Star year on defense, the Lightning finally qualified for the playoffs, posting a 38\u201332\u201312 record for 88 points, ahead of the defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[New Jersey Devils]] for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference by a single win. Due to his stellar play in net, Puppa was named a finalist for the [[Vezina Trophy]] (losing out to [[Jim Carey (ice hockey)|Jim Carey]] of the [[Washington Capitals]]). Playing the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], a team seen as a Stanley Cup contender, in the first round, the Lightning split the opening two games in Philadelphia before taking Game 3 in overtime before a ThunderDome crowd of 28,183. This was the largest crowd for an NHL game, a record that stood until the [[2003 Heritage Classic]] in Edmonton. An injury to Puppa in that game, however, would see the Lightning lose the next three games and the series.\n[[File:Amalie Arena.jpg|thumb|The Lightning moved to their present home, the Ice Palace (now [[Amalie Arena]]) during the 1996 off-season.]]\n\nThe Lightning moved into a new arena in downtown Tampa, the Ice Palace (later the St. Pete Times Forum, Tampa Bay Times Forum and now [[Amalie Arena]]) for the [[1996\u201397 NHL season|1996\u201397 season]]. They had acquired goal-scorer [[Dino Ciccarelli]] from the [[Detroit Red Wings]] during the 1996 off-season, and he did not disappoint, scoring 35 goals while [[Chris Gratton]] notched another 30 goals. The team appeared destined for another playoff appearance, but suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but four games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|2000]]. Bradley also lost time to a series of concussions that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. [[Centre (ice hockey)|Center]] [[John Cullen]] developed [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and missed the last 12 games of the 1996\u201397 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. They would not tally as much as 60 points again for five years.\n\nMost of the Lightning's early stars were gone by the [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399 season]] due to free agency and a series of ill-advised trades. Crisp was fired 11 games into the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] and replaced by [[Jacques Demers]]. Though Demers had presided over the resurgence of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1980s and helmed a Stanley Cup run with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 1993, he was unable to change the team's fortunes and the Lightning ended up losing 55 games.\n\nBy most accounts, the Lightning's plunge to the bottom of the NHL was due to inattentive ownership by Kokusai Green. Rumors abounded as early as the team's second season that the Lightning were on the brink of bankruptcy and that the team was part of a [[money laundering]] scheme for the [[yakuza]] (Japanese crime families).<ref name=\"HC\">{{Cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |authorlink= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref> Its scouting operation consisted of Tony Esposito and several satellite dishes. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] investigated the team in 1994 and 1995, and nearly threatened to put a [[tax lien]] on the franchise for $750,000 in back taxes.

The team's financial situation was a considerable concern to NHL officials; rumors surfaced that the NHL was seriously considering taking control of the team if Okubo failed to find a buyer by the summer of 1998.<ref name=\"Fischler\"/>\n\n''[[Forbes]]'' wrote an article in late 1997 calling the Lightning a financial nightmare, with a debt equal to 236% of its value, the highest of any major North American sports franchise. Even though the Ice Palace was built for hockey and the Lightning were the only major tenant, ''Forbes'' called the team's deal with the arena a lemon since it would not result in much revenue for 30 years. It was also behind on paying state sales taxes and federal payroll taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/Lightning/lh.1203.finances.html|title=Lightning Highlights}}</ref>\n\nFinally, in 1998, Kokusai Green found a buyer. Although [[Bill Davidson (businessman)|William Davidson]], owner of the [[Detroit Pistons]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), was thought to be the frontrunner, the buyer turned out to be insurance tycoon and motivational speaker [[Arthur L. Williams, Jr.|Art Williams]], who previously owned the [[Birmingham Barracudas]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). The team was $102&nbsp;million in debt at the time the sale closed.<ref name=\"Fischler\"/> Williams knew very little about hockey, but was very visible and outspoken, and immediately pumped an additional $6&nbsp;million into the team's payroll. He also cleared most of the debt from the Kokusai Green era. After taking control, Williams publicly assured the Espositos that their jobs were safe, only to fire them two games into the 1998\u201399 season. He then gave Demers complete control of hockey operations as both coach and general manager. The Lightning drafted [[Vincent Lecavalier]] in 1998, a player who would be a cornerstone of the team for years to come.\n\nWilliams was widely seen as being in over his head and was an easy target for ridicule from his fellow NHL owners, who called him \"[[The Beverly Hillbillies|Jed Clampett]]\" behind his back due to his thick [[Southern American English|Southern]] accent and [[fundamentalist Christian]] views. Early in the 1998\u201399 season, the Lightning lost ten games in a row, all but ending any chance of making the playoffs. They ended up losing 54 games that year, more than the expansion [[Nashville Predators]].\n\n===Vincent Lecavalier and Martin St. Louis era (1998\u20132013)===\n====Return to respectability====\nBy the spring of 1999, Williams had seen enough. He had not attended a game in some time because \"this team broke my heart\". He lost $20&nbsp;million in the 1998\u201399 season alone, as much money in one year as he had estimated he could have reasonably lost in five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcshockey.com/issues/115/tam.asp|title=LCS Hockey : Team Reports : Tampa Bay Lightning}}</ref> Williams sold the team for $115&nbsp;million\u2014$2&nbsp;million less than he had paid for the team a year earlier\u2014to Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson, who had almost bought the team a year earlier.<ref name=blunder>[http://www.sptimes.com/News/120600/Columns/Blunderful_.shtml Blunderful], St. Petersburg Times</ref> Along with the sale, the Lightning acquired a new top minor league affiliate; Davidson also owned the [[Detroit Vipers]] of the now-defunct [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]].\n\nDavidson remained in Detroit, but appointed Tom Wilson as team president to handle day-to-day management of the team. Wilson immediately fired Demers, who despite his best efforts (and fatherly attitude toward Lecavalier) was unable to overcome the damage from the Kokusai Green ownership. Wilson persuaded [[Ottawa Senators]] general manager (and former Vipers GM) [[Rick Dudley]] to take over as the Lightning's new general manager; Dudley, in turn, brought Vipers coach [[Steve Ludzik]] in as the team's new head coach. Wilson, Dudley and Ludzik had helped make the Vipers one of the premier minor league hockey franchises, having won a [[Turner Cup]] in only their third season in Detroit (the team had originally been based in [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles|Salt Lake City]]).\n\nHowever, as had been the case with Demers, the damage from the last few seasons under Kokusai Green was too much for Ludzik to overcome. Even with a wholesale transfer of talent from Detroit to Tampa (a move that eventually doomed the Vipers, which folded along with the IHL in 2001), the Lightning lost 54 games in [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]] and 52 in [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]], becoming the first team in NHL history to post four straight 50-loss seasons. The lone bright spots in those years were the blossoming of Lecavalier and [[Brad Richards]] into NHL stars. Ludzik was replaced in early 2001 by career NHL assistant [[John Tortorella]]. The March 5 trade deadline offered another glimmer of hope when the team acquired hold-out goaltender [[Nikolai Khabibulin]] from the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] for three players and a draft pick.\n\nThe [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], Tortorella's first full year behind the bench, saw some improvement. [[Martin St. Louis]] was having a breakout season when he broke his leg in game number 47 and was lost for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/01/24/stlouis020124.html | publisher=CBC News | title=Lightning winger St. Louis out with broken leg | date=January 24, 2002}}</ref> Khabibulin recorded a shut out at the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] but was not named its [[most valuable player|MVP]], by all accounts due to the game's voting protocol.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/2002/all_star/news/2002/02/02/khabibulin_allstar_st/ | publisher=CNN | title=Vote deadline may have cost Khabibulin the MVP award}}</ref> By mid-February, the Lightning were well out of playoff contention and were sinking under a rash of injuries. Dudley, who had guaranteed a playoff berth before the season, was fired and replaced by his assistant, [[Jay Feaster]]. Still the Lightning showed some signs of life, earning more than 60 points for the first time since 1997. Tortorella stripped Lecavalier of the captaincy due to contract negotiations that had made the young center miss the start of the season.\n\n====Two dream seasons and the Stanley Cup====\nWith a young core of players led by Vincent Lecavalier, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis and [[Fredrik Modin]], the Lightning were thought to be very close to respectability. However, they arrived somewhat earlier than expected in [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303]]. The young team was led by the goaltending of Nikolai Khabibulin and the scoring efforts of Lecavalier, St. Louis, Modin, Richards and [[Ruslan Fedotenko]], and also boasted a new captain, former prolific scorer [[Dave Andreychuk]]. Throughout the season, the Lightning battled the [[Washington Capitals]] for first place in the Southeast Division. They finished with a record of 36\u201325\u201316 for 93 points, breaking the 90-point barrier for the first time in team history. They won the division by just one point, giving them home-ice advantage in their first round match-up with the Capitals. At season's end, coach Tortorella was recognized for his efforts by being named a finalist for the [[Jack Adams Award]], losing out to [[Jacques Lemaire]] of the [[Minnesota Wild]].\n\nIn the first round of the [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], the Lightning quickly fell two games behind in the series but followed the two losses with four consecutive wins which advanced them to the Conference Semi-finals for the first time in team history. In the semi-finals, the Lightning won only one game, losing the series to the [[New Jersey Devils]], who went on to win the Stanley Cup.\n[[File:Lightning Championship Mural.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A mural of the Tampa Bay Lightning after winning the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals|2004 Stanley Cup]] in downtown Tampa.]]\nThe Lightning's dramatic improvement continued through the [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 regular season]], finishing with a record of 46\u201322\u20138\u20136 for 106 points, second-best in the NHL after the Western Conference's Detroit Red Wings\u2014the first 100-point season in franchise history. The Lightning went through the season with only 20-man-games lost to injury. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lightning ousted the [[Alexei Yashin]]-led [[New York Islanders]] in five games, with solid play from goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin, who posted three shutouts in Games 1, 3 and 4.\n\nIn the second round, the Lightning faced the [[Montreal Canadiens]], captained by [[Saku Koivu]]; Lecavalier, Richards, and Khabibulin led the team to a four-game sweep of Montreal. Next, they faced [[Keith Primeau]] and the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the Conference Finals. After a tightly-fought seven-game series in which neither team was able to win consecutive games, Fredrik Modin notched the winning goal of the seventh and deciding game, earning the Eastern Conference championship for the Lightning and their first-ever berth in the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals.\n\nTheir opponent in the final round was the [[Calgary Flames]], captained by [[Jarome Iginla]]. The final round also went the full seven games, with the deciding game played in the St. Pete Times Forum on June 7, 2004. This time, Ruslan Fedotenko was the Game 7 hero, scoring both Lightning goals in a 2\u20131 victory. Brad Richards, who had 26 points in the post-season, won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the most valuable player of the playoffs; the Lightning had won all 31 contests in which he had scored a goal since the opening of the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raising the Cup presents: Game 7 2004 Stanley Cup Final|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/raising-the-cup-presents-game-7-2004-stanley-cup-final/c-569846|website=NHL.com|date=August 16, 2011|access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref> Tortorella won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year. Only three years after their last of four consecutive seasons of 50 or more losses, and in only their 12th year of existence, the Lightning became the southernmost team ever to win the Stanley Cup. Martin St. Louis led the team and the NHL with 94 points (his 38 goals were fourth-most after the 41 of tied trio Jarome Iginla, [[Rick Nash]] and [[Ilya Kovalchuk]]), and won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's most valuable player. St. Louis also won the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] for the NHL's most outstanding player as voted by the [[National Hockey League Players' Association|NHL Players' Association]], and tied the [[Vancouver Canucks]]' [[Marek Mal\u00edk|Marek Malik]] for the [[NHL Plus/Minus Award]]. A season of superlatives was capped with one final accolade, as ''[[The Sporting News]]'' named GM Jay Feaster as the league's executive of the year for 2003\u201304.\n\nThe Lightning had to wait a year to defend their title due to the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]], but in [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], they barely made the playoffs with a record of 43\u201333\u20136 for 93 points in a conference where six teams notched 100 or more points. They lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games in the first round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 playoffs]].\n\n====Disappointments and rebuilding====\n[[File:Vincent Lecavalier 2007.jpg|thumb|During the [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307 season]], [[Vincent Lecavalier]] broke the then franchise record for most points, and goals in a single season.]]\nDuring the off-season, the Lightning traded Fredrik Modin and [[Fredrik Norrena]] to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in exchange for goaltender [[Marc Denis]] in an effort to replace the departing [[John Grahame]], who had signed with the Carolina Hurricanes. However, free agent [[Johan Holmqvist]] would eventually receive the majority of playing time and most of the club's wins. The first half of [[2006\u201307 NHL season|2006\u201307]] was inconsistent for the Lightning, maintaining an 18\u201319\u20132 record throughout the first few months. January and February were far better months for the team, going 9\u20134\u20130 in January and 9\u20132\u20132 in February, driving them back into the playoff race. Fourteen games in March were split even, and on March 16, 2007, Vincent Lecavalier broke the franchise record for most points in a season, with 95 (finishing with 108). The record was previously held by Martin St. Louis, who had set the record in the 2003\u201304 Stanley Cup-winning year. Lecavalier also broke the franchise's goal scoring record, finishing with a league-leading 52 goals.\n\nThe Lightning were busy during the final weeks before the NHL's trade deadline, acquiring wingers [[Kyle Wanvig]], [[Stephen Baby]] and defenseman [[Shane O'Brien (ice hockey)|Shane O'Brien]]. Former first round pick [[Nikita Alexeev]] was traded on deadline day to the Chicago Blackhawks. Other mid-season additions to the team included [[Filip Kuba]], [[Luke Richardson]] and [[Doug Janik]]. Veteran [[Andr\u00e9 Roy|Andre Roy]], who had won the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004, was claimed off waivers from the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n\nThroughout March, the Lightning had been competing with the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] for first place in the Southeast Division. With a chance to overtake the Thrashers one final time and once again become division champions for the third time in team history, on April 6, 2007, in the final week of the regular season, the Lighting suffered a loss to the [[Florida Panthers]], the night before the season finale in Atlanta. That same night, the Thrashers defeated the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and subsequently clinched the division. For the Lightning, this meant having to settle for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a final record of 44\u201333\u20135 (93 points). However, the Lightning were eliminated from playoff competition on April 22 after a 3\u20132 home loss to the New Jersey Devils in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals.\n[[File:V\u00e1clav Prospal 2007.jpg|thumb|[[V\u00e1clav Prospal|Vaclav Prospal]] with the Lightning in 2007. Prior to the 2007 NHL trade deadline, the Lightning traded Prospal to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in exchange for [[Alexandre R. Picard|Alexandre Picard]] and a conditional draft pick.]]\nFollowing their playoff exit, on August 7, 2007, Absolute Hockey Enterprises, a group led by [[Doug MacLean]], announced it had signed a purchase agreement for the team and the [[leasehold]] on the St. Pete Times Forum. MacLean is the former president and general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets and former head coach for both the Blue Jackets and the Florida Panthers. The group announced it planned to keep the team in Tampa, but the deal collapsed during the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe Lightning struggled to maintain success during the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 campaign]]. Although the \"Big 3\" of Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards, along with [[V\u00e1clav Prospal|Vaclav Prospal]], had performed up to expectations, they had little consistent play from supporting players.\n\nAt the start of the All-Star Break on January 25, 2008, the Lightning had a 20\u201325\u20135 record, and with 45 points, were in last place in both the Southeast Division and the Eastern Conference. Only the [[Los Angeles Kings]] had a lower point total at this time of the season, with 40 points.\n\nOn February 13, 2008, it was announced that Palace Sports & Entertainment had agreed to sell the Lightning to OK Hockey LLC, a group headed by [[Oren Koules]], a producer of the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' horror movies, and [[Len Barrie]], a former NHL player and real estate developer.\n\nThe Lightning were active during the trade deadline, similar to the previous season. More notable trades included Vaclav Prospal's trade to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for prospect [[Alexandre R. Picard|Alexandre Picard]] and a conditional draft pick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354834&page=NewsPage&service=page|title=Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 News: Lightning Acquire Conditional Draft Pick, AHL All-Star Defenseman From Philadelphia \u2013 25 February 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227195047/http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354834&page=NewsPage&service=page|archivedate=December 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Brad Richards and goaltender Johan Holmqvist were traded to the [[Dallas Stars]] in exchange for goaltender [[Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982)|Mike Smith]] and forwards [[Jussi Jokinen]] and [[Jeff Halpern]], as well as a fourth-round draft pick in [[2009 NHL Entry Draft|2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354950&page=NewsPage&service=page|title=Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 News: Lightning Acquire Goaltender Mike Smith, Center Jeff Halpern, Left Wing Jussi Jokinen & fourth-Round Pick From Dallas \u2013 26 February 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227210136/http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=354950&page=NewsPage&service=page|archivedate=December 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Jan Hlav\u00e1\u010d|Jan Hlavac]], a regular contributor, was also traded, moving to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a seventh-round pick in [[2008 NHL Entry Draft|2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=355022&page=NewsPage&service=page|title=Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 News: Lightning Acquire Seventh-Round Pick In 2008 From Nashville In Exchange For Jan Hlavac \u2013 26 February 2008}}</ref> Defenseman [[Dan Boyle (ice hockey)|Dan Boyle]] was re-signed to a six-year contract extension reportedly worth $40&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/news/story?id=3264930|title=Lightning re-sign D Boyle to six-year extension|date=February 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the trade deadline, the Lightning fared no better than they had throughout the entire season. After the February 26 trade deadline, the Lightning won only five games. Finishing with a 31\u201342\u20139 record, with 71 points, they had the highest chance of winning the top overall pick in the [[2008 NHL Entry Draft]] through the draft lottery, which they eventually won on April 7. They would use their first overall pick to select [[Steven Stamkos]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL)'s [[Sarnia Sting]].\n\nThe Lightning were the worst team on the road in the NHL, winning only 11 games. Another showing of the team's poor play was the difference from the previous season's success in the overtime/shootout periods. In the 2006\u201307 season, the Lightning had one of the best extra period records, winning 15 games in either overtime or the shootout. However, in the 2007\u201308 season, they won only three games, losing nine.\n\nVincent Lecavalier suffered a dislocated shoulder as the result of an open-ice hit from [[Matt Cooke]] of the Washington Capitals in the game before the season finale in Atlanta. Lecavalier, who planned on having arthroscopic wrist surgery after the season's ending, would undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder as well. Cooke was fined $2,500 by the NHL for the hit, as Lecavalier did not have possession of the puck at the time. Perhaps the lone bright spot in the season was Lecavalier's winning both the [[King Clancy Memorial Trophy]] and the [[NHL Foundation Player Award]] for work through his foundation, including a $3&nbsp;million pledge to [[All Children's Hospital]] in St. Petersburg, Florida, for what would become the Vincent Lecavalier Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at All Children's Hospital.\n\nHead coach John Tortorella was fired by the Lightning following their worst season since Tortorella was hired. At the time working as an NHL analyst for [[ESPN]], [[Barry Melrose]] stated on June 4 during an episode of ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'' that he missed coaching and would entertain any NHL coaching offers. He stated, \"I miss not having a dog in the fight.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=PRESS |first1=ASSOCIATED |title=Lightning hire Barry Melrose as coach |url=https://www.heraldtribune.com/article/LK/20080624/News/605222060/SH/ |website=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |accessdate=23 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> On June 23, ESPN reported Melrose had been chosen to be the head coach of the Lightning, beginning in 2008\u201309.

However, the Lightning did not get off to a great start as hoped, and Melrose was eventually fired by the Lightning with a 5\u20137\u20134 record. [[Rick Tocchet]], who had been hired as assistant coach during the previous off-season, was promoted to interim head coach.\n\nOn March 4, veterans [[Mark Recchi]] and [[Olaf K\u00f6lzig|Olaf Kolzig]] were traded by the Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], respectively.

When asked about Connolly's injuries being a factor in the decision to draft him, Yzerman boldly declared, \"I think it was a factor that he was available with the 6th pick. Because if he had been healthy all year, based on everything I know, he would not have been available with the 6th pick.\" On July 1, 2010, veteran blueliner [[Andrej Mesz\u00e1ro\u0161|Andrej Meszaros]] was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for their second-round pick in [[2011 NHL Entry Draft|2011]]. Later that day, the Lightning signed star winger Martin St. Louis to a four-year, $22.5&nbsp;million contract extension to come into effect on July 1, 2011. On July 19, in another move with the Flyers organization, the Lightning traded defenseman [[Matt Walker (ice hockey)|Matt Walker]] and Tampa Bay's fourth-round pick in 2011 for high-scoring winger [[Simon Gagn\u00e9|Simon Gagne]]. Other off-season acquisitions included the signing of forwards [[Sean Bergenheim]], [[Dominic Moore]] and [[Marc-Antoine Pouliot]], along with defensemen [[Brett Clark (ice hockey)|Brett Clark]], [[Randy Jones (ice hockey)|Randy Jones]] and [[Pavel Kubina]] and goaltender [[Dan Ellis]], as well as the re-signing of restricted free agent forward [[Steve Downie]] to a two-year, $3.7&nbsp;million deal.\n\n====End of the Lecavalier/St. Louis era====\nWith starting goaltender Mike Smith injured, the Lightning called up [[C\u00e9drick Desjardins|Cedrick Desjardins]], who played with a .950 [[save percentage]] and a 1.00 [[goals against average]] (GAA) in two games. The team then acquired veteran [[Dwayne Roloson]] from the New York Islanders for further coverage in net.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/hockey/lightning/tampa-bay-lightning-gets-goalie-dwayne-roloson-from-new-york-islanders-for/1143142|title=Tampa Bay Lightning gets goalie Dwayne Roloson from New York Islanders for minor-league defenseman|last=Smith|first=Joe|date=January 2, 2011|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Lightning compiled a 46\u201325\u201311 record with 103 points in the [[2010\u201311 Tampa Bay Lightning season|2010\u201311 season]], matching a franchise record for wins in a season. After holding the first place in the Southeast Division for several months, they fell to second after a poor performance in March. However, their record was solid enough for second in the Southeast Division and fifth in the Eastern Conference, and they returned to the playoffs for the first time since the 2006\u201307 season. Scoring 31 goals and assisting on 68, Martin St. Louis finished second in the NHL in points.\n\n[[File:Vincent Lecavalier OT goal 2011-05-01.JPG|thumb|Lecavalier scores the game-winning goal in Game 2 of the [[2011 Stanley Cup playoffs|2011 Stanley Cup]] Eastern Conference semi-finals.

After losing Game 4 at home in the second overtime period, they fell behind in the series one game to three. However, the Lightning went on to win the next three games, including a 1\u20130 Game 7 win on the road, taking their first playoff series since winning the Stanley Cup in 2004. In the Conference Semi-finals, the Lightning swept the top-seeded Washington Capitals.\n\nTampa Bay went up against the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 4 of the series, the Lightning trailed 3\u20130 at the end of the first period. When Dwayne Roloson was pulled for Mike Smith, the Bruins failed to score again, and the Lightning tied the game in the second period by scoring three goals in 3:58, going on to win the game 5\u20133 and tying the series at two games apiece. The series went the full seven games, though the Lightning were eliminated by a single goal, as the game was lost (0\u20131).\n\nThe Lightning finished the [[2011\u201312 Tampa Bay Lightning season|2011\u201312 season]] with a 38\u201336\u20138 record. With only 84 points, they fell short of reaching the playoffs, ending the season third in the Southeast Division and tenth in the Eastern Conference.\n\nIndividually, Steven Stamkos scored a franchise-record 60 goals. He won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy for the second time in his career, the first time in which he was the unanimous victor. Stamkos was also second in the NHL in points with 97, and was a finalist for both the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and the [[Ted Lindsay Award]].\n\nAs with the [[1994\u201395 NHL lockout]], the [[2012\u201313 NHL lockout]] resulted in a 48-game season.\n\nNearing the end of a dismal 18\u201326\u20134 season for 40 points, in which the Lightning ended fourth in the Southeast and 14th in the East, GM Steve Yzerman looked to their highly-successful [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Syracuse Crunch]].

This move would make Lecavalier an unrestricted free agent beginning July 5, free to sign with any team except the Lightning.

Tampa Bay eliminated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round of the playoffs before facing Montreal in the second round. The Lightning won the first three games of the series and had a chance to sweep the Canadiens, however Montreal responded with wins in Games 4 and 5 to extend the series to a sixth game.

The 2015\u201316 season was filled with controversy for the Lightning, starting off with the contractual questions regarding team captain Steven Stamkos and with the former third overall pick [[Jonathan Drouin]] publicly requesting a trade and being suspended from the organization. The Lightning picked up their play at the beginning of the year 2016 and set the franchise record to nine consecutive wins on March 5, 2016, when [[Alex Killorn]] scored with 42.5 seconds remaining in overtime to propel the Lightning to a 4\u20133 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes at Amalie Arena. On March 26, 2016, the Lightning announced cornerstone defenseman [[Anton Str\u00e5lman|Anton Stralman]] had suffered a fractured leg in their game against the New York Islanders at home. Tampa's fortunes would get even worse when Stamkos shockingly was out of the lineup for the team's game on April 2 against the New Jersey Devils in Tampa. Lightning GM [[Steve Yzerman]] announced after the game that the captain would miss one-to-three months due to a blood clot in his arm. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the team had no other option but to bring Drouin back to the team. The Lightning ended up finishing second in the Atlantic Division and would once again face the third-seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the [[2016 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]].\n\n[[File:Nikita Kucherov 140103.png|thumb|upright|[[Nikita Kucherov]] emerged as the Lightning's leading point-scorer during the [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2015\u201316 season]].]]\nThe Lightning ended up defeating the Red Wings in five games after winning 1\u20130 at Amalie Arena. Next up, the Islanders (who had recently defeated the Panthers to win their first playoff series since the 1992\u201393 season) would face the Lightning. In Game 1, the Islanders defeated the Bolts 5\u20133. The Lightning would eventually answer back by winning four consecutive games in the series to defeat the Isles in five games, in large part due to back-to-back road overtime victories with goals scored by [[Brian Boyle]] and [[Jason Garrison]]. The Lightning were set to play against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 1 at [[Consol Energy Center]], star goaltender Ben Bishop would be added to the list of devastating injuries for the team as he left on a stretcher and did not return for the remainder of the series. Stralman would eventually return in Game 2. A back-and-forth series would eventually lead to a Game 7 showdown in [[Pittsburgh]]. Lightning captain Steven Stamkos surprisingly took warmups and was in the Lightning lineup after a long absence from blood clot surgery. However, it was not enough, as the Lightning would fall 2\u20131 against the Penguins, who went on to defeat the [[San Jose Sharks]] and win the Stanley Cup.\n\nWith the Lightning under the spotlight in the 2016 off-season, Drouin rescinded his trade request. Steve Yzerman would then announce on June 29 the team re-signed Stamkos to an eight-year, cap-friendly deal. He would then sign star defenseman Victor Hedman to an eight-year contract on July 1, along with a seven-year deal for Alex Killorn and a three-year deal for former first round pick, goaltender [[Andrei Vasilevskiy]].\n\nThe Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs in the 2016\u201317 season. Finishing with 94 points, they were beaten to the second wildcard by the Toronto Maple Leafs, with 95 points. The 2016\u201317 season for the Lightning was a host of injuries, mainly their captain, Steven Stamkos. Stamkos went down in the 17th game, against the Detroit Red Wings. It was revealed he suffered from a torn left meniscus, which put him out for the rest of the season. During the season, they traded goaltender Ben Bishop to the Los Angeles Kings, center Brian Boyle to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and forward [[Valtteri Filppula]] to the Philadelphia Flyers. However, there were positive signs as winger Nikita Kucherov emerged with 40 goals and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy stepped up after Bishop left. The Lightning also showcased their young talent with rookie [[Brayden Point]] and promising AHL call-ups [[Yanni Gourde]] and [[Jake Dotchin]]. The Lightning bounced back with this talent in the last third of the season, but it was not enough as they missed the playoffs by one point.\n[[File:Victor Hedman - Tampa Bay Lightning.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Victor Hedman]] won the [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] in [[2017\u201318 NHL season|2017\u201318]]]]\nIn the off-season, the Lightning made a deal with the Montreal Canadiens to send Jonathan Drouin to their franchise in exchange for defensive prospect [[Mikhail Sergachev]] and a second-round pick in the [[2018 NHL Entry Draft]].

Engblom has served as an analyst on ''NHL Live'', and also served as color analyst for [[Winnipeg Jets]] Games on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] in Canada. Prior to being an announcer, Engblom played at the [[Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey|University of Wisconsin]], and was Montreal's third pick, 22nd overall, in the [[1975 NHL Amateur Draft|1975 NHL Entry Draft]]. He won three Stanley Cups with the Canadiens (1977\u20131979).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/lightning/brian-engblom-named-lightning-color-analyst/2240863|title=Bolts name 'The Chief's' successor: Brian Engblom to take over as color analyst|first=Joe|last=Smith|work=Tampa Bay Times|date= August 11, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Team colors and mascot==\nSince 2010, the Lightning colors have been blue, black and white. Their logo has been a stylized lightning bolt. This is the origin of one nickname for the team\u2014the \"Bolts.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=Bryan |title=How Phil Esposito named the Tampa Bay Lightning |url=https://www.nhl.com/lightning/news/how-phil-esposito-named-the-tampa-bay-lightning/c-293511432 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=March 19, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319191026/https://www.nhl.com/lightning/news/how-phil-esposito-named-the-tampa-bay-lightning/c-293511432 |archivedate=March 19, 2019 |date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Logo and jerseys===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = TBL Logo-Old.svg\n | width1 = 128\n |footer= The primary (left) and alternate logos (right) used by the team from 1992 to 2007. The team was named the Lightning in reference to the Tampa Bay Area being the \"lightning capital of North America.\u201d\n | image2 = TampaBayLightningAlternate.svg\n | width2 = 110\n}}\nThe original Lightning jerseys featured simple stripes on the sleeves and tail, and contrasting shoulders\u2014black shoulders over a white jersey, and white shoulders over the black\u2014with the alternate logo (a lightning bolt over the outline of the state of Florida). The underarm gussets included a feature referred to as \"victory stripes\"\u2014a group of thin stripes, alternating in the team's colors (black-silver-blue on white, or white-blue-silver on black). For the 1996\u201397 season, the Lightning added a third jersey, primarily blue with a [[Dye-sublimation printer|sublimated]] wave and rain design on the front and back, lightning bolts down the sleeves, a silver-gray shoulder yoke, and black gussets. The third jersey was retired after the 1998\u201399 season.\n\nIn their first two seasons, the Lightning used a stylized block font for player names, with gaps in the upper loops of letters such as A, B, D, and R. The numbers were standard block numbers with [[drop shadow]]s. The fonts were vertical in 1992\u201393, and italicized in 1993\u201394. The following season, the name font changed to a block font, vertically arched, while the number font changed to a painted style resembling the letters \"Tampa Bay\" in the logo. This style was also used on the blue alternate in 1998\u201399, replacing an \"electrified\" number font used from 1996\u201398. In 2001\u201302, the old fonts were replaced with traditional block letters and numbers, which have been used ever since. They also darkened their shades of blue that season from a royal blue to a speed (Indy) blue.\n\nAs with all NHL teams for the 2007\u201308 season, the Lightning debuted in new Reebok \"Rbk Edge\" jerseys. Also, like several other NHL teams, the Lightning updated their team logo.\n\nThe Lightning unveiled their new logo on August 25, 2007. The logo was similar to the inaugural one, but with a more modern look. The new logo also kept the same theme as the previous one, but with the words \"Tampa Bay\" across the top now appearing with tall capital initials, and the word \"Lightning\" no longer appearing on the bottom of the logo.\n\n[[File:Tampa Bay Lightning.svg|thumb|150px|In 2007 the Lightning adopted a new primary logo, which was used until 2011.]] \nThe Edge jerseys use the same template adopted by the [[Ottawa Senators]] and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. Unlike those teams, the Lightning's elbow panels remain the base color of the jersey, and an additional blue panel is added near the cuff of the sleeve. The Edge uniforms retain the underarm gusset \"victory stripes\" of their predecessors.\n\nThe Lightning then debuted a new \"alternate\" or \"third\" jersey in the 2008\u201309 season. The jersey features a dominant \"electric blue\" color, with black and silver accents at the end of the sleeves. The logo is removed, and in its place emblazoned across the front of the jersey descending to the lower left of the jersey is the word \"BOLTS\" (utilizing a layout similar to that of the Ottawa Senators' third jersey). The numbers are featured on the back and sleeves only, using white lettering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=394050|title=Lightning Unveil Third Jerseys vs. Devils|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227211443/http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=394050|archivedate=December 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt was reported on January 23, 2011, that the Lightning had filed paperwork with the NHL to change their logo and colors, beginning with the 2011\u201312 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/lightning/content/tampa-bay-lightnings-new-uniforms-sound-if-they-will-include-simple-classic-design |title=Tampa Bay Lightning's new uniforms sound as if they will include a simple, classic design |author=Damian Cristodero |date=January 23, 2011 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> The new logo, as well as the new home and away jerseys, were unveiled by the team at a press conference at the St. Pete Times Forum on January 31, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lightning.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=551150 |title=Lightning Unveil New Logo, Jersey Systems Along with Vision and Brand Aspiration |date=January 31, 2011 |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref> The Lightning began to integrate the new logo onto center ice, and even distributed free T-shirts with the simplified logo on February 4, 2011, while still using the old Lightning logo and uniforms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/lightning/content/couple-tampa-bay-lightning-records-could-fall-tonight-times-forum-against-capitals |title=A couple of Tampa Bay Lightning records could fall tonight at Times Forum against the Capitals |date=February 4, 2011 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe current uniforms are made in a traditional hockey sweater design. Initially, the colors that were to be used were simply blue and white, but by popular demand, black was later added as a trim color on the numbers. The victory stripes were also eliminated. Despite the introduction of the new uniforms, the previous third jersey was retained, with the new simplified logo replacing the old logo in the shoulders prior to the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the Lightning announced that a new black third sweater will replace the existing \"BOLTS\" sweaters. The new sweaters were unveiled on September 27, 2014. It retained the \"BOLTS\" wordmark, while adding white accents in a similar manner as the [[Los Angeles Kings]]' sweaters. The secondary roundel logo also replaced the primary logo on the sleeves, while the metro name was enscripted on the collar.\n\nThe Lightning made some minor tweaks to their current uniform set following the NHL's move to [[Adidas]] as its uniform provider in the 2017\u201318 season. The most notable change is the removal of the \"TAMPA BAY\" wordmark on the white away sweaters.\n\nA third sweater was not used during all of 2017\u201318 and much of the 2018\u201319 season. On February 7, 2019, the Lightning unveiled a new black uniform, lacking any blue and white elements and featuring sublimated black and grey patterns on the sleeves, socks and back numbers.\n\n===In-game personalities===\nFormer [[United States Air Force]] Technical Sergeant Sonya Bryson-Kirksey sings the American national anthem at home games and she is accompanied by organist Krystof Srebrakowski.\n\n===ThunderBug===\nThe Lightning mascot is a [[firefly|lightning bug]] named ThunderBug.

[[Indiana]]. It is situated {{convert|9|mi}} southeast of downtown Indianapolis in north central [[Franklin Township, Marion County, Indiana|Franklin Township]]. The community is concentrated near the intersection of Southeastern Avenue and Northeastern Avenue. The town was built along the historic [[Michigan Road]].\n\n==History==\n\n===The Adams Family===\nIn 1825, Reuben Adams came from [[New Liberty, Kentucky]] to settle the land in the [[History of Indiana#Statehood|newly established State of Indiana]]. Adams cleared a plot of land, planted crop, and built a [[log cabin#Traditional log buildings in North America|log cabin]], after which he returned to Kentucky to bring his family to Indiana.  Not long after the move to his new home Reuben became sick and died in 1826, leaving his [[widow]], Mary Adams to raise eleven children in the Indiana wilderness. In 1834, Mary Adams had John H. Messinger lay out the town of New Bethel (the original name of Wanamaker) from a portion of her farmland. The [[Plat|town plat]] was recorded on March 24, 1834. The source of the name New Bethel came from the local New Bethel Baptist Church.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sulgrove |first=Berry Robinson |year=1884 |title=History of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana (Part 2)  | publisher= L.H.

For many years mail was brought by [[Mail carrier|carrier]] from Gallaudet to New Bethel. In 1889, a post office was established in Sutherland's Store in New Bethel. The office was named Wanamaker instead of New Bethel because there was already a post office in Indiana called Bethel. The post office was named after [[John Wanamaker]], who was [[United States Postmaster General]] at the time. The name Wanamaker over time became synonymous with the town of New Bethel. In 1914, after the store burned, the post office was moved across the street to a [[general store]] and an [[interurban]] ticket office. In 1920, the post office once again moved to a new building at the location were the Sutherland Store had burned. On July 1, 1943, the post office advanced to Third Class office, and on July 1, 1952, it advanced to Second Class office. On May 1, 1960, it was made a branch of the Indianapolis Post Office. A new postal facility was built in 1965 with the dedication ceremony held March 13, 1965.<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of New Bethel/Wanamaker | origyear= 1984| year= 2003| publisher= Franklin Township Historical Society | location=Indianapolis |page=iv}}</ref>\n\nFor many years, highway signs bore both the names New Bethel and Wanamaker.  The name Wanamaker came to be accepted as the predominant local name for businesses, churches, and schools in the community. In the 1960s, the town's name was officially changed to Wanamaker after multiple proposals had been rejected by the Indiana Board of Geographic Names.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=132:3:127447790277802::NO::P3_FID,P3_TITLE:440019%2CWanamaker |title=BGN Subject Folders on Geographic Names Information System |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |work=|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=1963\u20131968}}</ref>\n\n===Gallaudet Station===\nIn the 1800s, Gallaudet Station, also known simply as Gallaudet was a post office and [[train station]] on the [[Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago Railway]]. Gallaudet Station was located {{convert|1|mi}} south of Wanamaker. Because of the close proximity to the station, Wanamaker and the area south of it was sometimes referred to as Gallaudet or Gallaudet Station.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sulgrove |first=Berry Robinson |year=1884 |title=History of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana (Part 2)  | publisher= L.H. Everts & Company | page= 526}}</ref>\n\nThe Gallaudet name derives from the 350 acres of land having been originally owned by [[James Smedley Brown]], once superintendent of the [[Indiana School for the Deaf]]. Brown named the area in honor of [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], one of the founders of the first permanent school for the deaf in the United States. From October 1861 to November 1862, Brown served as the Gallaudet Station postmaster.<ref>Stringham, D. (2014). \"A Language of Action\": James Smedley Brown and the First American Dictionary of Sign Language. ''Deaf Studies Today''.</ref>\n\n===Michigan Road===\nThe main thoroughfare in Wanamaker, Southeastern Avenue, runs over the original alignment of the historic [[Michigan Road]]. Michigan Road was one of Indiana's earliest roads and the state's first \"super highway\". Built in the 1830s and 1840s, the road ran from [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]] to [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]], via Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historicmichiganroad.org/about |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2013 |title=About the Road |website=The Historic Michigan Road |publisher=The Historic Michigan Road Association (HMRA)  |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Annexation===\nSince its founding, Wanamaker had been an [[unincorporated community]] of Marion County, located outside the city limits of Indianapolis. In 1970, by an act of the [[Indiana General Assembly]], Indianapolis was consolidated with the government of Marion County, as [[Unigov]]. Wanamaker was annexed by Indianapolis. The [[ZIP code]] for the Wanamaker area is 46239, while the preferred city for the 46239 is ''Indianapolis'', though ''Wanamaker'' is still listed as an acceptable city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupResultsAction!input.action?resultMode=2&companyName=&address1=&address2=&city=&state=Select&urbanCode=&postalCode=46239&zip=|title=Look Up a ZIP Code |year=2014 |website=USPS.com |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Zink Raceway===\nThe Zink Raceway was a local attraction just north of Wanamaker off of Post Road.  The track has been closed for many years, but its remnants remain as a reminder of the days of small town racing circuits.\n\n==Public services==\nThe [[Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department]] and [[Indiana State Police]] provide law enforcement for the community. The [[Indianapolis Fire Department]] serves the Wanamaker area. The [[United States Post Office]] Wanamaker Branch provides local postal services. [[Franklin Township Community School Corporation]] schools serve the Wanamaker area.\n\n==Churches==\n*Franklin Central Christian Church\n*Maple Hill United Methodist Church\n*Nativity Catholic Church\n*[http://www.newbethelbaptistonline.org/index.html New Bethel Baptist Church]\n*Wanamaker Church of Christ\n*[http://www.southminsterindy.com/home/] Southminster Presbyterian \n*\n\n==Festivals==\n===Old Settler's Day===\nSince the late 1980s, community service organizations have been hosting Old Settler's Day, a street fair, in downtown Wanamaker. Wanamaker's main thoroughfare, Southeastern Avenue, is closed from Northeastern Avenue to McGaughey Road for the event. Vendors set up booths the length of the avenue and sell concessions and unique products. The Classic Car Show is held in conjunction with Old Settler's Day, rain or shine. Trophies are awarded to the top three in each official car class, and special awards are presented for various achievements.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/franklintwpchamber/oldsett.htm Old Settler's Days]</ref> The festivities are concluded by a large firework show at Franklin Central High School.

For many years mail was brought by [[Mail carrier|carrier]] from Gallaudet to New Bethel. In 1889, a post office was established in Sutherland's Store in New Bethel. The office was named Wanamaker instead of New Bethel because there was already a post office in Indiana called Bethel. The post office was named after [[John Wanamaker]], who was [[United States Postmaster General]] at the time. The name Wanamaker over time became synonymous with the town of New Bethel. In 1914, after the store burned, the post office was moved across the street to a [[general store]] and an [[interurban]] ticket office. In 1920, the post office once again moved to a new building at the location were the Sutherland Store had burned. On July 1, 1943, the post office advanced to Third Class office, and on July 1, 1952, it advanced to Second Class office. On May 1, 1960, it was made a branch of the Indianapolis Post Office. A new postal facility was built in 1965 with the dedication ceremony held March 13, 1965.<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of New Bethel/Wanamaker | origyear= 1984| year= 2003| publisher= Franklin Township Historical Society | location=Indianapolis |page=iv}}</ref>\n\nFor many years, highway signs bore both the names New Bethel and Wanamaker.  The name Wanamaker came to be accepted as the predominant local name for businesses, churches, and schools in the community. In the 1960s, the town's name was officially changed to Wanamaker after multiple proposals had been rejected by the Indiana Board of Geographic Names.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=132:3:127447790277802::NO::P3_FID,P3_TITLE:440019%2CWanamaker |title=BGN Subject Folders on Geographic Names Information System |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |work=|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=1963\u20131968}}</ref>\n\n===Gallaudet Station===\nIn the 1800s, Gallaudet Station, also known simply as Gallaudet was a post office and [[train station]] on the [[Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago Railway]]. Gallaudet Station was located {{convert|1|mi}} south of Wanamaker. Because of the close proximity to the station, Wanamaker and the area south of it was sometimes referred to as Gallaudet or Gallaudet Station.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sulgrove |first=Berry Robinson |year=1884 |title=History of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana (Part 2)  | publisher= L.H. Everts & Company | page= 526}}</ref>\n\nThe Gallaudet name derives from the 350 acres of land having been originally owned by [[James Smedley Brown]], once superintendent of the [[Indiana School for the Deaf]]. Brown named the area in honor of [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], one of the founders of the first permanent school for the deaf in the United States. From October 1861 to November 1862, Brown served as the Gallaudet Station postmaster.<ref>Stringham, D. (2014). \"A Language of Action\": James Smedley Brown and the First American Dictionary of Sign Language. Deaf Studies Today.</ref>\n\n===Michigan Road===\nThe main thoroughfare in Wanamaker, Southeastern Avenue, runs over the original alignment of the historic [[Michigan Road]]. Michigan Road was one of Indiana's earliest roads and the state's first \"super highway\". Built in the 1830s and 1840s, the road ran from [[Madison, Indiana|Madison]] to [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]], via Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historicmichiganroad.org/about |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2013 |title=About the Road |website=The Historic Michigan Road |publisher=The Historic Michigan Road Association (HMRA)  |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Annexation===\nSince its founding, Wanamaker had been an [[unincorporated community]] of Marion County, located outside the city limits of Indianapolis. In 1970, by an act of the [[Indiana General Assembly]], Indianapolis was consolidated with the government of Marion County, as [[Unigov]]. Wanamaker was annexed by Indianapolis. The [[ZIP code]] for the Wanamaker area is 46239, while the preferred city for the 46239 is ''Indianapolis'', though ''Wanamaker'' is still listed as an acceptable city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupResultsAction!input.action?resultMode=2&companyName=&address1=&address2=&city=&state=Select&urbanCode=&postalCode=46239&zip=|title=Look Up a ZIP Code |year=2014 |website=USPS.com |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Zink Raceway===\nThe Zink Raceway was a local attraction just north of Wanamaker off of Post Road.  The track has been closed for many years, but its remnants remain as a reminder of the days of small town racing circuits.\n\n==Public services==\nThe [[Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department]] and [[Indiana State Police]] provide law enforcement for the community. The [[Indianapolis Fire Department]] serves the Wanamaker area. The [[United States Post Office]] Wanamaker Branch provides local postal services. [[Franklin Township Community School Corporation]] schools serve the Wanamaker area.\n\n==Churches==\n*Franklin Central Christian Church\n*Maple Hill United Methodist Church\n*Nativity Catholic Church\n*[http://www.newbethelbaptistonline.org/index.html New Bethel Baptist Church]\n*Wanamaker Church of Christ\n*[http://www.southminsterindy.com/home/] Southminster Presbyterian \n*\n\n==Festivals==\n===Old Settler's Day===\nSince the late 1980s, community service organizations have been hosting Old Settler's Day, a street fair, in downtown Wanamaker. Wanamaker's main thoroughfare, Southeastern Avenue, is closed from Northeastern Avenue to McGaughey Road for the event. Vendors set up booths the length of the avenue and sell concessions and unique products. The Classic Car Show is held in conjunction with Old Settler's Day, rain or shine. Trophies are awarded to the top three in each official car class, and special awards are presented for various achievements.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/franklintwpchamber/oldsett.htm Old Settler's Days]</ref> The festivities are concluded by a large firework show at Franklin Central High School. All the money for the firework show is donated via the community.\n\n==Highways==\n[[File:I-74.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|Interstate 74]]\n\n==Notable people from Wanamaker==\n*[[Otis Gibbs]], singer-songwriter\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|39|42|16|N|86|00|35|W|type:city_region:US-IN|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in Indianapolis]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Marion County, Indiana]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1834]]\n[[Category:Indianapolis metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:1834 establishments in Indiana]]\n", "name_user": "Etoile", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanamaker,_Indiana"}

|url-status=dead  }}</ref> In November 2015, the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections (Dates) Bill, which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years.<ref name = \"clash\"/> That Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016, setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021.<ref name = \"dates act\"/>\n\nThe date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the [[British monarchy|monarch]], on the proposal of the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]].<ref name=\"ScotlandAct1\"/>\n\nIf Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved, with at least two-thirds of the [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|Members]] (i.e. 86 Members) voting in favour, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the monarch by [[royal proclamation]].<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\"/>\n\nIt does not necessarily require a two-thirds majority to precipitate an extraordinary general election, because under the Scotland Act Parliament is also dissolved if it fails to nominate one of its members to be [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] within certain time limits, irrespective of whether at the beginning or in the middle of a parliamentary term.<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\"/> Therefore, if the First Minister resigned, Parliament would then have 28 days to elect a successor (s46(2)b and s46(3)a). If no new First Minister was elected then the Presiding Officer would ask for Parliament to be dissolved under s3(1)a. This process could also be triggered if the First Minister lost a [[vote of confidence]] by a [[Majority|simple majority]] (i.e. more than 50%), as s/he must then resign (Scotland Act 1998 s45(2)). To date the Parliament has never held a confidence vote on a First Minister.\n\nNo extraordinary general elections have been held to date. Any extraordinary general elections would be in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it.<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\"/> However, this would not affect the year in which the subsequent ordinary general election will be held.<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\">{{cite web

each region. There are 8 regions, each sub-divided into smaller constituencies. There are a total of 73 [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]]. Each constituency elects one MSP by the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] ([[first past the post]]) system of election.

The size difference between Westminster and Holyrood boundaries was due to diverge further upon the implementation of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], which has not been voted upon by Parliament.

\"clash\"/> That Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016, setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021.<ref name = \"dates act\"/>\n\nThe date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the [[British monarchy|monarch]], on the proposal of the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]].<ref name=\"ScotlandAct1\"/>\n\nIf Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved, with at least two-thirds of the [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|Members]] (i.e. 86 Members) voting in favour, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the monarch by [[royal proclamation]].<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\"/>\n\nIt does not necessarily require a two-thirds majority to precipitate an extraordinary general election, because under the Scotland Act Parliament is also dissolved if it fails to nominate one of its members to be [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] within certain time limits, irrespective of whether at the beginning or in the middle of a parliamentary term.<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\"/> Therefore, if the First Minister resigned, Parliament would then have 28 days to elect a successor (s46(2)b and s46(3)a). If no new First Minister was elected then the Presiding Officer would ask for Parliament to be dissolved under s3(1)a. This process could also be triggered if the First Minister lost a [[vote of confidence]] by a [[Majority|simple majority]] (i.e. more than 50%), as s/he must then resign (Scotland Act 1998 s45(2)). To date the Parliament has never held a confidence vote on a First Minister.\n\nNo extraordinary general elections have been held to date. Any extraordinary general elections would be in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it.<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\"/> However, this would not affect the year in which the subsequent ordinary general election will be held.<ref name=\"ScotlandAct3\">{{cite web
