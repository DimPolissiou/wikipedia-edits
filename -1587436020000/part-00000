Many species of [[bird]] migrate. [[Animal migration|Migration]] carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of [[food]]. It occurs mainly in the [[northern hemisphere]], where birds are funneled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] or the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nMigration of species such as [[stork]]s, [[European turtle dove|turtle doves]], and [[swallow]]s was recorded as many as 3,000 years ago by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] authors, including [[Homer]] and [[Aristotle]], and in the [[Book of Job]]. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and modern scientific studies have used techniques including [[bird ringing]] and [[Animal migration tracking#Satellite tracking|satellite tracking]] to trace migrants. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.\n\nThe [[Arctic tern]] holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between [[Arctic]] breeding grounds and the [[Antarctic]] each year. Some species of tubenoses ([[Procellariiformes]]) such as [[albatross]]es circle the earth, flying over the southern oceans, while others such as [[Manx shearwaters]] migrate {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including [[altitudinal migration]]s on mountains such as the Andes and [[Himalayas]].\n\nThe timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars, the earth's magnetic field, and mental maps.\n\n==Historical views==\nIn the Pacific, traditional landfinding techniques used by Micronesians and Polynesians suggest that bird migration was observed and interpreted for more than 3000 years. In Samoan tradition, for example, Tagaloa sent his daughter Sina to Earth in the form of a bird, Tuli, to find dry land, the word tuli referring specifically to landfinding waders, often to the Pacific golden plover.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crowe |first1=Andrew |title=Pathway of the Birds: The Voyaging Achievements of M\u0101ori and their Polynesian Ancestors |date=2018 |publisher=Bateman |location=Auckland, New Zealand |isbn=9781869539610}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2019|reason=Popular science, non-expert author}} Records of bird migration were also known in Europe from at least 3,000 years ago as indicated by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers [[Hesiod]], [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Aristotle]]. The Bible also notes migrations, as in the [[Book of Job]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Job|39:26|KJV}}</ref> where the inquiry is made: \"Is it by your insight that the hawk hovers, spreads its wings southward?\" The author of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|8:7|KJV}}</ref> wrote: \"Even the [[stork]] in the heavens know its seasons, and the [[European turtle dove|turtle dove]], the [[swift]] and the [[Crane (bird)|crane]] keep the time of their arrival.\"\n\nAristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of [[Scythia]] to marshes at the headwaters of the [[Nile]].

Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather.  Sometimes, journeys are not termed \"true migration\" because they are irregular (nomadism, invasions, irruptions) or in only one direction (dispersal, movement of young away from natal area).

The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or [[Arctic]] summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south.  Of course, in the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance migration.<ref name=\"newton\" />\n\nThe primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hummingbirds.net/migration.html | title=Migration Basics | publisher=Hummingbirds.net | accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>  Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237048440 | title=Environmental Impact Assessment of the National Large Solar Telescope Project and its Ecological Impact in Merak Area | date=February 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Ramachandra, T.V. | pages=71|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThese advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: [[Eleonora's falcon]] ''Falco eleonorae'', which breeds on [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound [[passerine]] migrants, which it feeds to its young.

However, many Holarctic [[wildfowl]] and [[Fringillidae|finch]] (Fringillidae) species winter in the [[North Temperate Zone]], in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the [[pink-footed goose]] migrates from [[Iceland]] to [[Great Britain|Britain]] and neighbouring countries, whilst the [[dark-eyed junco]] migrates from [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] and [[tundra climate|arctic climates]] to the contiguous United States<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Dark-eyed_Junco/id Dark-Eyed Junco]</ref> and the American goldfinch <!--''Spinus tristis''--> from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the [[Southern United States|American South]] northwestward to [[Western Oregon]].<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Goldfinch/id American Goldfinch]</ref> Some ducks, such as the [[garganey]] ''Anas querquedula'', move completely or partially into the tropics. The [[European pied flycatcher]] ''Ficedula hypoleuca'' also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.\n\nMigration routes and wintering grounds are both genetically and traditionally determined depending on the social system of the species. In long-lived, social species such as [[white stork]]s ''(Ciconia ciconia),'' flocks are often led by the oldest members and young storks learn the route on their first journey.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Chernetsov N. | author2 = Berthold P. | author3 = Querner U. | year = 2004 | title = Migratory orientation of first-year white storks (''Ciconia ciconia''): inherited information and social interactions | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 207 | issue = 6| pages = 937\u2013943 | doi=10.1242/jeb.00853| pmid = 14766952 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In short-lived species that migrate alone, such as the [[Eurasian blackcap]] ''Sylvia atricapilla'' or the [[yellow-billed cuckoo]] ''Coccyzus americanus'', first-year migrants follow a genetically determined route that is alterable with selective breeding.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sutherland, W.

Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers or towards suitable stopover habitat. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist of seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, a lack of stopover or feeding sites, or a lack of [[thermal column]]s (important for broad-winged birds).<ref name=\"Berthold\" /> Additionally, many migration routes are circuitous due to evolutionary history: the breeding range of [[Northern wheatear]]s ''Oenanthe oenanthe'' has expanded to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere, but the species still migrates up to 14,500&nbsp;km to reach ancestral wintering grounds in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] rather than establish new wintering grounds closer to breeding areas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bairlein F. |author2=Norris D.

Detours avoiding such barriers are observed: for example, [[Brent goose|brent geese]] ''Branta bernicla'' migrating from the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] to the [[Wadden Sea]] travel via the [[White Sea]] coast and the [[Baltic Sea]] rather than directly across the [[Arctic Ocean]] and northern [[Scandinavia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.geese.org/gsg/Gorid.htm | title=The Riddle of the White Sea | publisher=Geese.org | date=1999 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Green, Martin}}<!--journal refs at website--></ref>\n\n===In waders===\n[[File:BartailedGodwit24.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bar-tailed godwit]]]]\n\nA similar situation occurs with [[wader]]s (called ''shorebirds'' in North America).

In the period before migration, many birds display higher activity or [[Zugunruhe]] ({{lang-de|migratory restlessness}}), first described by [[Johann Friedrich Naumann]] in 1795, as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition. The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual [[endogenous]] programs in controlling bird migrations.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Stopover decision during migration: physiological conditions predict nocturnal restlessness in wild passerines |author1=Fusani, L. |author2=Cardinale, L. |author3=Carere, C. |author4=Goymann, W. | journal=Biology Letters | year=2009 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0755 | pmid=19324648 | pmc=2679912 | volume=5 | issue=3 | pages=302\u2013305}}</ref> Caged birds display a preferential flight direction that corresponds with the migratory direction they would take in nature, changing their preferential direction at roughly the same time their wild conspecifics change course.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/16/2225.full.pdf | title=MIGRATORY DIRECTIONS OF FREE-FLYING BIRDS VERSUS ORIENTATION IN REGISTRATION CAGES |author1=Nievergelt, F. |author2=Liechti, F. |author3=Bruderer, B. | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | year=1999 | volume=202 | pages=2225\u20132231 | issue=16}}</ref>\n\nIn [[polygyny|polygynous]] species with considerable [[sexual dimorphism]], males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females.

Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time.

The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. [[Satellite tracking (animal migration)|Satellite tracking]] of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Thorup, Kasper |author2=Thomas Alerstam |author3=Mikael Hake |author4=Nils Kjelle |year=2003 |title=Bird orientation: compensation for wind drift in migrating raptors is age dependent |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=270 |pages=S8\u2013S11 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0014 |pmid=12952622 |pmc=1698035 |issue=Suppl 1}}</ref>\nThe birds navigate through an innate biological sense resulting from evolution.\nMigratory birds may use two [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] tools to find their destinations: one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience. A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's [[magnetic field]], but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a [[radical pair mechanism]] whereby chemical reactions in special [[biological pigment|photo pigments]] sensitive to [[Color#Physics|short wavelengths]] are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a [[Boy Scout]] with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this \"mapping\" is done by [[magnetite]]s in the [[trigeminal system]], which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different [[latitude]]s let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wiltschko, W. |author2=U.

migration routes]]\n\n'''Bird migration''' is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south along a [[flyway]], between [[Breeding in the wild|breeding]] and [[wintering]] grounds. Many species of [[bird]] migrate. [[Animal migration|Migration]] carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of [[food]]. It occurs mainly in the [[northern hemisphere]], where birds are funneled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] or the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nMigration of species such as [[stork]]s, [[European turtle dove|turtle doves]], and [[swallow]]s was recorded as many as 3,000 years ago by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] authors, including [[Homer]] and [[Aristotle]], and in the [[Book of Job]]. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and modern scientific studies have used techniques including [[bird ringing]] and [[Animal migration tracking#Satellite tracking|satellite tracking]] to trace migrants. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.\n\nThe [[Arctic tern]] holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between [[Arctic]] breeding grounds and the [[Antarctic]] each year. Some species of tubenoses ([[Procellariiformes]]) such as [[albatross]]es circle the earth, flying over the southern oceans, while others such as [[Manx shearwaters]] migrate {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including [[altitudinal migration]]s on mountains such as the Andes and [[Himalayas]].\n\nThe timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars, the earth's magnetic field, and mental maps.\n\n==Historical views==\nIn the Pacific, traditional landfinding techniques used by Micronesians and Polynesians suggest that bird migration was observed and interpreted for more than 3000 years. In Samoan tradition, for example, Tagaloa sent his daughter Sina to Earth in the form of a bird, Tuli, to find dry land, the word tuli referring specifically to landfinding waders, often to the Pacific golden plover.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crowe |first1=Andrew |title=Pathway of the Birds: The Voyaging Achievements of M\u0101ori and their Polynesian Ancestors |date=2018 |publisher=Bateman |location=Auckland, New Zealand |isbn=9781869539610}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2019|reason=Popular science, non-expert author}} Records of bird migration were also known in Europe from at least 3,000 years ago as indicated by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers [[Hesiod]], [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Aristotle]]. The Bible also notes migrations, as in the [[Book of Job]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Job|39:26|KJV}}</ref> where the inquiry is made: \"Is it by your insight that the hawk hovers, spreads its wings southward?\" The author of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|8:7|KJV}}</ref> wrote: \"Even the [[stork]] in the heavens know its seasons, and the [[European turtle dove|turtle dove]], the [[swift]] and the [[Crane (bird)|crane]] keep the time of their arrival.\"\n\nAristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of [[Scythia]] to marshes at the headwaters of the [[Nile]].

Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather.

The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or [[Arctic]] summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south.  Of course, in the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance migration.<ref name=\"newton\" />\n\nThe primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hummingbirds.net/migration.html | title=Migration Basics | publisher=Hummingbirds.net | accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>  Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237048440 | title=Environmental Impact Assessment of the National Large Solar Telescope Project and its Ecological Impact in Merak Area | date=February 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Ramachandra, T.V. | pages=71|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThese advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: [[Eleonora's falcon]] ''Falco eleonorae'', which breeds on [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound [[passerine]] migrants, which it feeds to its young.

However, many Holarctic [[wildfowl]] and [[Fringillidae|finch]] (Fringillidae) species winter in the [[North Temperate Zone]], in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the [[pink-footed goose]] migrates from [[Iceland]] to [[Great Britain|Britain]] and neighbouring countries, whilst the [[dark-eyed junco]] migrates from [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] and [[tundra climate|arctic climates]] to the contiguous United States<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Dark-eyed_Junco/id Dark-Eyed Junco]</ref> and the American goldfinch <!--''Spinus tristis''--> from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the [[Southern United States|American South]] northwestward to [[Western Oregon]].<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Goldfinch/id American Goldfinch]</ref> Some ducks, such as the [[garganey]] ''Anas querquedula'', move completely or partially into the tropics.

Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers or towards suitable stopover habitat. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist of seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, a lack of stopover or feeding sites, or a lack of [[thermal column]]s (important for broad-winged birds).<ref name=\"Berthold\" /> Additionally, many migration routes are circuitous due to evolutionary history: the breeding range of [[Northern wheatear]]s ''Oenanthe oenanthe'' has expanded to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere, but the species still migrates up to 14,500&nbsp;km to reach ancestral wintering grounds in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] rather than establish new wintering grounds closer to breeding areas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bairlein F. |author2=Norris D.

Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time.

A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's [[magnetic field]], but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a [[radical pair mechanism]] whereby chemical reactions in special [[biological pigment|photo pigments]] sensitive to [[Color#Physics|short wavelengths]] are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a [[Boy Scout]] with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this \"mapping\" is done by [[magnetite]]s in the [[trigeminal system]], which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different [[latitude]]s let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wiltschko, W. |author2=U.

Vico Oval was renamed Pride Oval and the 2008 Northern Pride Player Awards ceremony was held at the Pride Leagues Club. Pre-Season Trials were played at Pride Oval in 2009, as well as Round 9 and Round 11 of the 2010 Season.\n\nThe Oval and Leagues Club cost around $230,000 a year to maintain, and so in December 2010 [[Cairns Regional Council]] agreed to purchase the sporting complex for $2.5m to guarantee its future as a sporting field, prevent residential development on the land and free the Northern Pride rugby league club from an oppressive debt. The Pride were given a six-month lease, and when it expired in May 2011 they decided not to renew and moved to Barlow Park. Pride Oval was leased to [[Queensland Rugby League Northern Division#Cairns District Rugby League|CDRL]] Kangaroos RLFC and became Vico Oval and Kangaroos Leagues Club once again.

In 2018, televised [[Queensland Cup|Intrust Super Cup]] matches were rescheduled and played at 1.00pm (AEST) on Saturday afternoons, but this time slot was unpopular and ratings fell. In 2019 televised [[Queensland Cup|Intrust Super Cup]] matches returned to a 2.00pm (AEST) time-slot on Sunday afternoons.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2018, the Pride had 29 matches televised by [[Nine Network|Channel 9]], with eight of these matched being home games.

Pre-Season Trials were played at Pride Oval in 2009, as well as Round 9 and Round 11 of the 2010 Season.\n\nThe Oval and Leagues Club cost around $230,000 a year to maintain, and so in December 2010 [[Cairns Regional Council]] agreed to purchase the sporting complex for $2.5m to guarantee its future as a sporting field, prevent residential development on the land and free the Northern Pride rugby league club from an oppressive debt. The Pride were given a six-month lease, and when it expired in May 2011 they decided not to renew and moved to Barlow Park. Pride Oval was leased to [[Queensland Rugby League Northern Division#Cairns District Rugby League|CDRL]] Kangaroos RLFC and became Vico Oval and Kangaroos Leagues Club once again.
