Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the country's two [[college football]] conferences: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former [[Fox Sports Latin America|Fox Sports]] commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.\n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos. The Mayas maintained dominance over the league and won the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico for the second time, 24-18.\n\nOn October 28, 2017,  Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez left the presidency of the LFA. The title of President was eliminated and the position of the Commissioner was created, which was occupied by Guillermo Ruiz Burguete<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/para-su-tercera-temporada-lfa-tendra-nueva-cara-lfa-condors-mayas-fundidores/196862|title=For its third season, LFA will have a new face}}</ref> On January 16, the newly appointed LFA commissioner, Guillermo Ruiz Burguete, resigned. The league did not announce his replacement. For operational purposes, the activities of the commissioner were absorbed by the president of the board of directors of the league, \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/renuncia-comisionado-lfa-guillermo-ruiz-burguete-lfa-burguete-comisionado/200234|title=LFA commissioner resignation}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Eagles were renamed the Mexicas. In March, the Mexicas generated controversy by refusing to play against the Dinos in Week 3, after a serious knee injury to wide receiver Mubalama Massimango that occurred in Week 1. The Mexicas claim the injury was not properly attended to by the LFA. Although the league recognized that there was an administrative problem with the medical expenses insurance policy, the Mexicas were punished for their actions. The LFA ruled the Dinos game as a forfeit by the Mexicas, and the Mexicas team was fined [[Mexican peso|Mex$]]657,820.00 (approximately [[U.S. dollar|US$]]32,000) for damages caused to the league, its TV partners, its press partners, the Dinos team, and the fans. Additional, the Mexicas would have to change their franchisee for the 2019 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/lfa-fija-su-postura-respecto-al-seguro-de-gastos-medicos-de-los-jugadores/|title=LFA fixes its position regarding the medical expenses insurance of the players}}(In Spanish)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maximoavance.com/2018/03/lfa-sanciona-mexicas-pero-evitan-rompimiento/|title=LFA sanctions Mexicas but avoid breaking}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico was held on a neutral site for the first time, at [[Estadio Azul]]. Originally a half-time show was planned, but the band canceled due to recommendation of Civil Protection force. Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico III featured the Mexicas and the Raptors, with the Mexicas winning their first title by a shutout of 17-0.\n\nIn November 2018, the LFA signed a non-binding Letter of Intent with the [[Canadian Football League]] to share resources and to allow for at least one CFL game to be played in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/11/23/cfl-lfa-sign-letter-of-intent-to-grow-football-in-canada-and-mexico|accessdate=2018-11-23|title=CFL, LFA sign letter of intent to grow football in Canada and Mexico}}(In Spanish)</ref> CFL commissioner Randy Ambroise said of the deal later that he hopes it'll raise the level of competition in the LFA and give Canadian football players another competition to compete in if they get dropped from the CFL. \"For so many, if they finish their junior career or college career and they\u2019re not on a CFL roster then there\u2019s kind of nowhere to go and their dream ends, I think that\u2019s a tragedy. This is really about growing the game of football.\" The CFL later held a draft in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/cfl-holds-combine-mexico-city-effort-grow-football-worldwide/|title=CFL holds combine in Mexico City in effort to grow football worldwide - Sportsnet.ca|website=www.sportsnet.ca|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe LFA considered expanding to 10 teams for the 2019 season, with Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and even Tamaulipas among the four possible expansion candidates.<ref>http://lfa.mx/la-lfa-tendra-diez-equipos-para-2019/#comment-70</ref> However, the league only added two additional franchises: the [[Osos Toluca]] (Bears) and the [[Artilleros Puebla]] (Artillerymen). A new commissioner was announced, Alejandro Jaimes Trujillo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/rumbo-a-la-temporada-2019/|title=Towards the 2019 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> In January 2019, the CFL held a draft for interested LFA players, with 27 of the 51 players selected.\n\nOn September 4, 2019, the LFA announced plans for expansion for the 2020 season. The newest addition was the Pioneros from the city of Queretaro. This was an existing team which previously was a part of the Mexican Football League (FAM) where they were crowned champions in their first season. The Pioneros will play their games at the La Pir\u00e1mide Stadium, which is located in the El Pueblito Sports Unit, in the municipality of Corregidora.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rotativo.com.mx/2019/09/04/deportes/pioneros-de-queretaro-se-une-a-lfa-para-temporada-2020-792277/|title=Pioneers of Quer\u00e9taro joins LFA for the 2020 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> But with only one new expansion team, the league had an unbalanced amount of teams, presenting difficulty for scheduling. The LFA decided it would only field 8 teams for the 2020 season, with the Mayas going on hiatus for a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reporteindigo.com/fan/se-va-bicampeon-mayas-lfa-crisis-inversionista/|title=Se va el Bicampe\u00f3n Mayas de la LFA}}(In Spanish)</ref> There is talk of a possible change of headquarters in the south of the republic, or its permanence in Mexico City.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $2,000,000 MXN , approximately $100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each team's record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion.

Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the country's two [[college football]] conferences: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former [[Fox Sports Latin America|Fox Sports]] commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.  \n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos. The Mayas maintained dominance over the league and won the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico for the second time, 24-18.\n\nOn October 28, 2017,  Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez left the presidency of the LFA. The title of President was eliminated and the position of the Commissioner was created, which was occupied by Guillermo Ruiz Burguete<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/para-su-tercera-temporada-lfa-tendra-nueva-cara-lfa-condors-mayas-fundidores/196862|title=For its third season, LFA will have a new face}}</ref> On January 16, the newly appointed LFA commissioner, Guillermo Ruiz Burguete, resigned. The league did not announce his replacement. For operational purposes, the activities of the commissioner were absorbed by the president of the board of directors of the league, \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/renuncia-comisionado-lfa-guillermo-ruiz-burguete-lfa-burguete-comisionado/200234|title=LFA commissioner resignation}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Eagles were renamed the Mexicas. In March, the Mexicas generated controversy by refusing to play against the Dinos in Week 3, after a serious knee injury to wide receiver Mubalama Massimango that occurred in Week 1. The Mexicas claim the injury was not properly attended to by the LFA. Although the league recognized that there was an administrative problem with the medical expenses insurance policy, the Mexicas were punished for their actions. The LFA ruled the Dinos game as a forfeit by the Mexicas, and the Mexicas team was fined [[Mexican peso|Mex$]]657,820.00 (approximately [[U.S. dollar|US$]]32,000) for damages caused to the league, its TV partners, its press partners, the Dinos team, and the fans. Additional, the Mexicas would have to change their franchisee for the 2019 season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/lfa-fija-su-postura-respecto-al-seguro-de-gastos-medicos-de-los-jugadores/|title=LFA fixes its position regarding the medical expenses insurance of the players}}(In Spanish)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maximoavance.com/2018/03/lfa-sanciona-mexicas-pero-evitan-rompimiento/|title=LFA sanctions Mexicas but avoid breaking}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico was held on a neutral site for the first time, at [[Estadio Azul]]. Originally a half-time show was planned, but the band canceled due to recommendation of Civil Protection force. Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico III featured the Mexicas and the Raptors, with the Mexicas winning their first title by a shutout of 17-0.\n\nIn November 2018, the LFA signed a non-binding Letter of Intent with the [[Canadian Football League]] to share resources and to allow for at least one CFL game to be played in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/11/23/cfl-lfa-sign-letter-of-intent-to-grow-football-in-canada-and-mexico|accessdate=2018-11-23|title=CFL, LFA sign letter of intent to grow football in Canada and Mexico}}(In Spanish)</ref> CFL commissioner Randy Ambroise said of the deal later that he hopes it'll raise the level of competition in the LFA and give Canadian football players another competition to compete in if they get dropped from the CFL. \"For so many, if they finish their junior career or college career and they\u2019re not on a CFL roster then there\u2019s kind of nowhere to go and their dream ends, I think that\u2019s a tragedy. This is really about growing the game of football.\" The CFL later held a draft in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/cfl-holds-combine-mexico-city-effort-grow-football-worldwide/|title=CFL holds combine in Mexico City in effort to grow football worldwide - Sportsnet.ca|website=www.sportsnet.ca|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe LFA considered expanding to 10 teams for the 2019 season, with Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and even Tamaulipas among the four possible expansion candidates.<ref>http://lfa.mx/la-lfa-tendra-diez-equipos-para-2019/#comment-70</ref> However, the league only added two additional franchises: the [[Osos Toluca]] (Bears) and the [[Artilleros Puebla]] (Artillerymen).

The newest addition was the Pioneros from the city of Queretaro. This was an existing team which previously was a part of the Mexican Football League (FAM) where they were crowned champions in their first season. The Pioneros will play their games at the La Pir\u00e1mide Stadium, which is located in the El Pueblito Sports Unit, in the municipality of Corregidora. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://rotativo.com.mx/2019/09/04/deportes/pioneros-de-queretaro-se-une-a-lfa-para-temporada-2020-792277/|title=Pioneers of Quer\u00e9taro joins LFA for the 2020 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> But with only one new expansion team, the league had an unbalanced amount of teams, presenting difficulty for scheduling. The LFA decided it would only field 8 teams for the 2020 season, with the Mayas going on hiatus for a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reporteindigo.com/fan/se-va-bicampeon-mayas-lfa-crisis-inversionista/|title=Se va el Bicampe\u00f3n Mayas de la LFA}}(In Spanish)</ref> There is talk of a possible change of headquarters in the south of the republic, or its permanence in Mexico City.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $ 2,000,000 MXN , approximately $ 100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each teams record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion.

The existence of Cook's proof nevertheless became known.

The character of Cook's proof differs considerably from the discussion of Rule 110 in ''A New Kind of Science''. Cook has since written a paper setting out his complete proof.{{sfnp|Cook|2004}}\n\nCook proved that Rule 110 was universal (or Turing complete) by showing it was possible to use the rule to emulate another computational model, the [[cyclic tag system]], which is known to be universal. He first isolated a number of [[Spaceship (CA)|spaceships]], self-perpetuating localized patterns, that could be constructed on an infinitely repeating pattern in a Rule 110 universe. He then devised a way for combinations of these structures to interact in a manner that could be exploited for computation.\n\n===Spaceships in Rule 110===\nThe function of the universal machine in Rule 110 requires a finite number of localized patterns to be embedded within an infinitely repeating background pattern.  The background pattern is fourteen cells wide and repeats itself exactly every seven iterations.  The pattern is '''00010011011111'''.\n\nThree localized patterns are of particular importance in the Rule 110 universal machine.  They are shown in the image below, surrounded by the repeating background pattern.  The leftmost structure shifts to the right two cells and repeats every three generations.  It comprises the sequence '''0001110111''' surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as two different evolutions of this sequence.\n\nIn the figures, time elapses from top to bottom:  the top line represents the initial state, and each following line the state at the next time.\n\n[[Image:ca110-structures2.png]]\n\nThe center structure shifts left eight cells and repeats every thirty generations.  It comprises the sequence '''1001111''' surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as twenty-nine different evolutions of this sequence.\n\nThe rightmost structure remains stationary and repeats every seven generations.  It comprises the sequence '''111''' surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as five different evolutions of this sequence.\n\nBelow is an image showing the first two structures passing through each other without interacting other than by translation (left), and interacting to form the third structure (right).\n\n[[Image:ca110-interaction2.png]]\n\nThere are numerous other spaceships in Rule 110, but they do not feature as prominently in the universality proof.\n\n===Constructing the cyclic tag system===\n\nThe cyclic tag system machinery has three main components:\n* A ''data string'' which is stationary;\n* An infinitely repeating series of finite ''production rules'' which start on the right and move leftward;\n* An infinitely repeating series of ''clock pulses'' which start on the left and move rightward.\n\nThe initial spacing between these components is of utmost importance.  In order for the cellular automaton to implement the cyclic tag system, the automaton's initial conditions must be carefully selected so that the various localized structures contained therein interact in a highly ordered way.\n\nThe ''data string'' in the cyclic tag system is represented by a series of stationary repeating structures of the type shown above.  Varying amounts of horizontal space between these structures serve to differentiate 1 symbols from 0 symbols.  These symbols represent the ''word'' on which the cyclic tag system is operating, and the first such symbol is destroyed upon consideration of every production rule.  When this leading symbol is a 1, new symbols are added to the end of the string; when it is 0, no new symbols are added.  The mechanism for achieving this is described below.\n\nEntering from the right are a series of left-moving structures of the type shown above, separated by varying amounts of horizontal space.  Large numbers of these structures are combined with different spacings to represent 0s and 1s in the cyclic tag system's production rules.  Because the tag system's production rules are known at the time of creation of the program, and infinitely repeating, the patterns of 0s and 1s at the initial condition can be represented by an infinitely repeating string.  Each production rule is separated from the next by another structure known as a ''rule separator'' (or ''block separator''), which moves towards the left at the same rate as the encoding of the production rules.\n\nWhen a left-moving rule separator encounters a stationary symbol in the cyclic tag system's data string, it causes the first symbol it encounters to be destroyed.  However, its subsequent behavior varies depending on whether the symbol encoded by the string had been a 0 or a 1.  If a 0, the rule separator changes into a new structure which blocks the incoming production rule.  This new structure is destroyed when it encounters the next rule separator.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the symbol in the string was a 1, the rule separator changes into a new structure which admits the incoming production rule.  Although the new structure is again destroyed when it encounters the next rule separator, it first allows a series of structures to pass through towards the left.  These structures are then made to append themselves to the end of the cyclic tag system's data string.  This final transformation is accomplished by means of a series of infinitely repeating, right-moving  ''clock pulses'' in the right-moving pattern shown above.  The clock pulses transform incoming left-moving 1 symbols from a production rule into stationary 1 symbols of the data string, and incoming 0 symbols from a production rule into stationary 0 symbols of the data string.\n\n===Cyclic tag system working===\n[[Image:Cts-diagram.jpg]]\n\nThe figure above is the schematic diagram of the reconstruction of a cyclic tag system in Rule 110.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Rule 30]]\n* [[Rule 90]]\n* [[Rule 184]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Matthew |title=Universality in Elementary Cellular Automata |journal=Complex Systems |volume=15 |issue= |pages=1\u201340 |year=2004 |doi= |url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/15-1-1.pdf|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |first=Matthew |last=Cook |chapter=A Concrete View of Rule 110 Computation |arxiv=0906.3248v1 |chapterurl=  |title=The Complexity of Simple Programs |journal=Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science |volume=1 |editor-first=T. |editor-last=Neary |editor2-first=D.|editor2-last=Woods |editor3-first=A.

Wolfram Research claimed that this presentation violated Cook's nondisclosure agreement with his employer, and obtained a court order excluding Cook's paper from the published conference proceedings. The existence of Cook's proof nevertheless became known. Interest in his proof stemmed not so much from its result as from its methods, specifically from the technical details of its construction <ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Martinez\n| first1 = Genaro J.\n| last2 = Seck Tuoh Mora\n| first2 = Juan\n| last3 = Chapa\n| first3 = Sergio\n| last4 = Lemaitre\n| first4 = Christian\n| date = April 2019\n| pages = 1-8\n| title = Brief notes and history computing in Mexico during 50 years\n| journal = International Journal of Parallel, Emergent and Distributed Systems\n| doi = 10.1080/17445760.2019.1608990\n| access-date = 2020-04-15\n| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332634058_Brief_notes_and_history_computing_in_Mexico_during_50_years\n}}</ref>. The character of Cook's proof differs considerably from the discussion of Rule 110 in ''A New Kind of Science''. Cook has since written a paper setting out his complete proof.{{sfnp|Cook|2004}}\n\nCook proved that Rule 110 was universal (or Turing complete) by showing it was possible to use the rule to emulate another computational model, the [[cyclic tag system]], which is known to be universal. He first isolated a number of [[Spaceship (CA)|spaceships]], self-perpetuating localized patterns, that could be constructed on an infinitely repeating pattern in a Rule 110 universe. He then devised a way for combinations of these structures to interact in a manner that could be exploited for computation.\n\n===Spaceships in Rule 110===\nThe function of the universal machine in Rule 110 requires a finite number of localized patterns to be embedded within an infinitely repeating background pattern.  The background pattern is fourteen cells wide and repeats itself exactly every seven iterations.  The pattern is '''00010011011111'''.\n\nThree localized patterns are of particular importance in the Rule 110 universal machine.  They are shown in the image below, surrounded by the repeating background pattern.  The leftmost structure shifts to the right two cells and repeats every three generations.  It comprises the sequence '''0001110111''' surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as two different evolutions of this sequence.\n\nIn the figures, time elapses from top to bottom:  the top line represents the initial state, and each following line the state at the next time.\n\n[[Image:ca110-structures2.png]]\n\nThe center structure shifts left eight cells and repeats every thirty generations.  It comprises the sequence '''1001111''' surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as twenty-nine different evolutions of this sequence.\n\nThe rightmost structure remains stationary and repeats every seven generations.  It comprises the sequence '''111''' surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as five different evolutions of this sequence.\n\nBelow is an image showing the first two structures passing through each other without interacting other than by translation (left), and interacting to form the third structure (right).\n\n[[Image:ca110-interaction2.png]]\n\nThere are numerous other spaceships in Rule 110, but they do not feature as prominently in the universality proof.\n\n===Constructing the cyclic tag system===\n\nThe cyclic tag system machinery has three main components:\n* A ''data string'' which is stationary;\n* An infinitely repeating series of finite ''production rules'' which start on the right and move leftward;\n* An infinitely repeating series of ''clock pulses'' which start on the left and move rightward.\n\nThe initial spacing between these components is of utmost importance.  In order for the cellular automaton to implement the cyclic tag system, the automaton's initial conditions must be carefully selected so that the various localized structures contained therein interact in a highly ordered way.\n\nThe ''data string'' in the cyclic tag system is represented by a series of stationary repeating structures of the type shown above.  Varying amounts of horizontal space between these structures serve to differentiate 1 symbols from 0 symbols.  These symbols represent the ''word'' on which the cyclic tag system is operating, and the first such symbol is destroyed upon consideration of every production rule.  When this leading symbol is a 1, new symbols are added to the end of the string; when it is 0, no new symbols are added.  The mechanism for achieving this is described below.\n\nEntering from the right are a series of left-moving structures of the type shown above, separated by varying amounts of horizontal space.  Large numbers of these structures are combined with different spacings to represent 0s and 1s in the cyclic tag system's production rules.  Because the tag system's production rules are known at the time of creation of the program, and infinitely repeating, the patterns of 0s and 1s at the initial condition can be represented by an infinitely repeating string.  Each production rule is separated from the next by another structure known as a ''rule separator'' (or ''block separator''), which moves towards the left at the same rate as the encoding of the production rules.\n\nWhen a left-moving rule separator encounters a stationary symbol in the cyclic tag system's data string, it causes the first symbol it encounters to be destroyed.  However, its subsequent behavior varies depending on whether the symbol encoded by the string had been a 0 or a 1.  If a 0, the rule separator changes into a new structure which blocks the incoming production rule.  This new structure is destroyed when it encounters the next rule separator.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the symbol in the string was a 1, the rule separator changes into a new structure which admits the incoming production rule.  Although the new structure is again destroyed when it encounters the next rule separator, it first allows a series of structures to pass through towards the left.  These structures are then made to append themselves to the end of the cyclic tag system's data string.  This final transformation is accomplished by means of a series of infinitely repeating, right-moving  ''clock pulses'' in the right-moving pattern shown above.  The clock pulses transform incoming left-moving 1 symbols from a production rule into stationary 1 symbols of the data string, and incoming 0 symbols from a production rule into stationary 0 symbols of the data string.\n\n===Cyclic tag system working===\n[[Image:Cts-diagram.jpg]]\n\nThe figure above is the schematic diagram of the reconstruction of a cyclic tag system in Rule 110.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Rule 30]]\n* [[Rule 90]]\n* [[Rule 184]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Matthew |title=Universality in Elementary Cellular Automata |journal=Complex Systems |volume=15 |issue= |pages=1\u201340 |year=2004 |doi= |url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/15-1-1.pdf|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |first=Matthew |last=Cook |chapter=A Concrete View of Rule 110 Computation |arxiv=0906.3248v1 |chapterurl=  |title=The Complexity of Simple Programs |journal=Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science |volume=1 |editor-first=T. |editor-last=Neary |editor2-first=D.|editor2-last=Woods |editor3-first=A.

The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad V\u00e1hom]] near [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[\u0160pania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.\n\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]\n\nAfter the disappearance of the \u010cakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\n==== Hallstatt Period ====\nThe arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sere\u010f]]) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.\n\nA special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.\n\n==== La T\u00e8ne Period ====\nFrom around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Dev\u00edn]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[P\u00fachov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].\n\n==== Roman Period ====\n[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] (178\u2013179 AD)]]\nFrom 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Sz\u0151ny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Dev\u00edn Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of D\u00fabravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.\n\nNear the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8\u20136&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.\n\n=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===\nIn the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].\n\nIn 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name=\"T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Kronol\u00f3gia\">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja ''(\"The Historical Chronology of Hungary\")''|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Krist\u00f3, p.30\u201331</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.\n\n=== Slavic states ===\nThe [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of [[Duke]] [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under [[Duke]] [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]].\n\n=== Great Moravia (830\u2013before 907) ===\n{{Main|Great Moravia}}\n[[File:Cyril a metod zilina.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|A statue of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius]] in [[\u017dilina]].

Cyril developed the [[Glagolitic alphabet|first Slavic alphabet]] and translated the Gospel into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language.

The Slovaks were not consulted. In 1919, during the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous [[German people|Germans]], Slovaks, Hungarians and  Ruthenians within the newly set borders.

Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities.

Revision of the borders was called for, as Czechs constituted only 43% of the population. Eventually this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia. The remainder of Czechoslovakia was renamed [[Czecho-Slovakia]] and promised a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy.

The dry continental air brings in the summer heat and winter frosts. In contrast, oceanic air brings rainfalls and reduces summer temperatures. In the lowlands and valleys there is often fog, especially in winter.\n\nSpring starts with 21 March and is characterised by colder weather with average daily temperature of {{convert|9|C}} in the first weeks and about {{convert|14|C}} in May and {{convert|17|C}} in June. In Slovakia, the weather and climate in the spring is very unstable.\n\nSummer starts on 22 June and is usually characterised by hot weather with daily temperatures exceeding {{convert|30|C}}. July is the warmest month with temperatures up to about {{convert|37|to|40|C}}, especially in regions of southern Slovakia\u2014in the urban area of Kom\u00e1rno, Hurbanovo or \u0160t\u00farovo. Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop\u201440 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|C}} (less in the mountains).\n\nAutumn in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|C}}, in November to {{convert|3|C}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).\n\nWinter starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it changes into the thaw and frost.

A historical center with at least one square has been preserved in many towns. Large historical centers can be found in [[Bratislava]], [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]], [[Ko\u0161ice]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica]], [[Levo\u010da]], and [[Trnava]].

Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919.

[[Sheep|Lamb]] and [[goat]] are eaten but are not widely popular.\n\nThe traditional Slovak meals are [[bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky]], [[bryndzov\u00e9 pirohy]] and other meals with potato dough and [[bryndza]]. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.\n\nA typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup (\"kapustnica\"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called \"krvavnica\", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal.\n\nWine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or ros\u00e9 (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}\nSporting activities are practised widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level. [[Ice hockey]] and [[association football|football]] have traditionally been regarded as the most popular sports in Slovakia, though [[tennis]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[whitewater slalom]], [[cycling]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] are also popular.\n\n;Ice Hockey\n[[File:Slovakia2010WinterOlympicscelebration2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovak national ice hockey team]] celebrating a victory against [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]]]\nOne of the most popular team sports in Slovakia is [[ice hockey]].

The most recent success was a silver medal at the [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8,280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Prior to 2012, the Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] participated in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |title=World of difference for KHL? |publisher=iihf.com |date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082543/http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSlovakia hosted the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal and [[2019 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] also won the gold medal. Both competitions took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Ko\u0161ice]].\n\n;Football\n[[File:Tehelne pole.jpg|thumb|right|Football stadium [[Teheln\u00e9 pole]] in Bratislava. Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia.]]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3\u20132 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k (footballer, born 1954)|J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|1997\u201398]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], and [[M\u0160K \u017dilina]] in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League|2010\u201311]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Slovakia}}\n* [[Outline of Slovakia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Julius Bartl et al., ''Slovak History: Chronology & Lexicon.''

The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad V\u00e1hom]] near [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[\u0160pania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.\n\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]\n\nAfter the disappearance of the \u010cakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\n==== Hallstatt Period ====\nThe arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sere\u010f]]) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.\n\nA special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.\n\n==== La T\u00e8ne Period ====\nFrom around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Dev\u00edn]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[P\u00fachov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].\n\n==== Roman Period ====\n[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] (178\u2013179 AD)]]\nFrom 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Sz\u0151ny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Dev\u00edn Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of D\u00fabravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.\n\nNear the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8\u20136&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.\n\n=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===\nIn the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].\n\nIn 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name=\"T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Kronol\u00f3gia\">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja ''(\"The Historical Chronology of Hungary\")''|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Krist\u00f3, p.30\u201331</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.\n\n=== Slavic states ===\nThe [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of [[Duke]] [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under [[Duke]] [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]].\n\n=== Great Moravia (830\u2013before 907) ===\n{{Main|Great Moravia}}\n[[File:Cyril a metod zilina.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|A statue of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius]] in [[\u017dilina]].

Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent wars between Catholics in the west territory and Protestants in the east, also against Turks, the frontier was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by Catholic German and Slovak troops on the Habsburg side. By 1648, Slovakia was not spared the [[Counter-Reformation]], which brought the majority of its population from Lutheranism back to [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1655, the printing press at the [[Trnava]] university produced the Jesuit Benedikt Sz\u00f6ll\u0151si's Cantus Catholici, a Catholic hymnal in the Slovak language that reaffirmed links to the earlier works of Cyril and Methodius.\n\nThe [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]], rivalry between [[Austria]] and [[Transylvania]], and the frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.<ref>\"[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation]\".

As the [[Great Turkish War|Turks withdrew]] from Hungary in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased, although [[Pressburg]] retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848, when it was transferred back to Buda.<ref>[http://www.slovakiasite.com/bratislava.php Bratislava].

The Slovaks were not consulted. In 1919, during the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous [[German people|Germans]], Slovaks, Hungarians and  Ruthenians within the newly set borders. The borders were set by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities, at least on paper.\n\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.<ref>J.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Polisencky, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline'' (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revisionist]] governments of Germany, Hungary and Poland who used the aggrieved minorities in the country as a useful vehicle. Revision of the borders was called for, as Czechs constituted only 43% of the population. Eventually this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia. The remainder of Czechoslovakia was renamed [[Czecho-Slovakia]] and promised a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. This however, failed to materialize.<ref>''Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939'' edited by Professor E. L.

Temperature extremes are between {{convert|-41|to|40.3|C}} although temperatures below {{convert|-30|C}} are rare. The weather differs from the mountainous north to the plains in the south.\n\nThe warmest region is [[Bratislava]] and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may reach {{convert|30|C}} in summer, occasionally to {{convert|39|C}} in [[Hurbanovo]]. During night, the temperatures drop to {{convert|20|C}}. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of {{convert|-5|C}} to {{convert|10|C}}. During night it may be freezing, but usually not below {{convert|-10|C}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction = vertical \n| width =\n| image1 = CulHer14Slovakia328.JPG\n| width1 = 190\n| caption1 = Summer in [[Spi\u0161sk\u00e9 Podhradie]]\n| image2 = Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica im Herbst.JPG\n| width2 = 195\n| caption2 = Winter in [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica]]; the town is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].\n}}\n\nIn Slovakia, there are four [[season]]s, each season ([[Spring (season)|spring]], summer, [[autumn]] and [[winter]]) lasts three months. The dry continental air brings in the summer heat and winter frosts. In contrast, oceanic air brings rainfalls and reduces summer temperatures. In the lowlands and valleys there is often fog, especially in winter.\n\nSpring starts with 21 March and is characterised by colder weather with average daily temperature of {{convert|9|C}} in the first weeks and about {{convert|14|C}} in May and {{convert|17|C}} in June. In Slovakia, the weather and climate in the spring is very unstable.\n\nSummer starts on 22 June and is usually characterised by hot weather with daily temperatures exceeding {{convert|30|C}}. July is the warmest month with temperatures up to about {{convert|37|to|40|C}}, especially in regions of southern Slovakia\u2014in the urban area of Kom\u00e1rno, Hurbanovo or \u0160t\u00farovo. Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop\u201440 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|C}} (less in the mountains).\n\nAutumn in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|C}}, in November to {{convert|3|C}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).\n\nWinter starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it changes into the thaw and frost. Winters are colder in the mountains, where the snow usually lasts until March or April and the night temperatures fall to {{convert|-20|C}} and colder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026021233/http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archivedate=26 October 2007 |title=Based on the \"Climate\" article from |publisher=www.slovensko.com |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Biodiversity ==\n{{see also|Endemic Plant Species in Slovakia}}\n[[File:Vysok\u00e9 Tatry, Dolina Bielej vody, cestou od Zelen\u00e9ho plesa na Jah\u0148ac\u00ed \u0161t\u00edt (32).JPG|thumb|left|''[[Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica]]'' in the [[Tatra Mountains]]]]\nSlovakia signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 19 May 1993, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124005746/http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|archivedate=24 January 2011 |title=List of Parties |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], which was received by the convention on 2 November 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721013840/https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2008 |title=National Biodiversity Strategy of Slovakia |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe biodiversity of Slovakia comprises [[animal]]s (such as annelids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), [[fungi]] ([[Ascomycota]], [[Basidiomycota]], [[Chytridiomycota]], [[Glomeromycota]] and [[Zygomycota]]), micro-organisms (including [[Mycetozoa]]), and [[plant]]s.

[[\u010cachtice Castle]] was once the home of the world's most prolific female serial killer, the 'Bloody Lady', [[Elizabeth B\u00e1thory]].\n[[File:Bardejov10Slovakia6.JPG|thumb|left|The centre of [[Bardejov]] \u2013 a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]\n\nSlovakia's position in Europe and the country's past (part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Habsburg]] monarchy and [[Czechoslovakia]]) made many cities and towns similar to the cities in the [[Czech Republic]] (such as [[Prague]]), [[Austria]] (such as [[Salzburg]]) or [[Hungary]] (such as [[Budapest]]). A historical center with at least one square has been preserved in many towns. Large historical centers can be found in [[Bratislava]], [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]], [[Ko\u0161ice]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica]], [[Levo\u010da]], and [[Trnava]]. Historical centers have been going through restoration in recent years.\n\nHistorical churches can be found in virtually every village and town in Slovakia. Most of them are built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, but there are also many examples of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]], for example [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]], Bardejov and [[Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Kapitula]]. The [[Basilica of St. James, Levo\u010da|Basilica of St. James]] in Levo\u010da with the tallest wood-carved altar in the world and the Church of the Holy Spirit in [[\u017dehra]] with medieval [[fresco]]s are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The [[St. Martin's Concathedral]] in [[Bratislava]] served as the [[coronation]] church for the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest sacral buildings in Slovakia stem from the [[Great Moravia]]n period in the 9th century.\n[[File:Jasn\u00e1 Ski Resort - gondola lift Kosodrevina - Chopok (4).jpg|thumb|Cable cars at [[Jasn\u00e1]] in the Tatra Mountains.]]\n\nVery precious structures are the complete wooden churches of northern and northern-eastern Slovakia. Most were built from the 15th century onwards by [[Catholic]]s, [[Lutheran]]s and members of [[Eastern Christianity|eastern-rite]] churches.\n\nTypical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, [[\u010drp\u00e1k]]s (wooden pitchers), [[fujara]]s (a [[folk instrument]] on the UNESCO list) and [[vala\u0161ka]]s (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from [[husk|corn husks]] and wire, notably human figures. Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organisation \u00da\u013dUV (''\u00dastredie \u013eudovej umeleckej v\u00fdroby''\u2014Centre of [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Production). ''Dielo'' shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.\n\nPrices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighbouring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower.\n\n=== Science ===\nThe [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] has been the most important scientific and research institution in the country since 1953. Slovaks have made notable scientific and technical contributions during the history. Slovakia is currently in the negotiation process of becoming a member of the [[European Space Agency]].

In 2015, Slovakia signed the European Cooperating State Agreement based on which Slovakia committed to the finance entrance programme named PECS (Plan for the European Cooperating States) which serves as preparation for full membership. Slovak research and development organizations can apply for funding of projects regarding space technologies advancement.

The education system consists of elementary school which is divided into two parts, the first grade (age 6\u201310) and the second grade (age 10\u201315) which is finished by taking nationwide testing called Monitor, from Slovak language and math. Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919. Although it's not the first university ever established on Slovak territory, it's the oldest university that is still running. Most universities in Slovakia are public funded, where anyone can apply. Every citizen has a right to free education in public schools.\n\nSlovakia has several privately funded universities, however public universities consistently score better in the ranking than their private counterparts.

The most recent success was a silver medal at the [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8,280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Prior to 2012, the Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] participated in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |title=World of difference for KHL? |publisher=iihf.com |date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082543/http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSlovakia hosted the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal and [[2019 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] also won the gold medal. Both competitions took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Ko\u0161ice]].\n\n;Football\n[[File:Tehelne pole.jpg|thumb|right|Football stadium [[Teheln\u00e9 pole]] in Bratislava. Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia.]]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3\u20132 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k (footballer, born 1954)|J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|1997\u201398]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], and [[M\u0160K \u017dilina]] in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League|2010\u201311]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Slovakia}}\n* [[Outline of Slovakia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Julius Bartl et al., ''Slovak History: Chronology & Lexicon.''

The complications of diabetes can dramatically impair quality of life and cause long-lasting disability. Overall, complications are far less common and less severe in people with well-controlled [[blood sugar]] levels.<ref>{{cite journal|display-authors=etal|vauthors=Nathan DM, Cleary PA, Backlund JY|date=December 2005|title=Intensive diabetes treatment and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=353|issue=25|pages=2643\u201353|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052187|pmc=2637991|pmid=16371630}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=April 1995|title=The effect of intensive diabetes therapy on the development and progression of neuropathy.

Other health problems compound the chronic complications of diabetes such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, and lack of regular [[exercise]].\n\n==Acute==\n===Diabetic ketoacidosis===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) is an acute and dangerous complication that is always a [[medical emergency]] and requires prompt medical attention. Low insulin levels cause the [[liver]] to turn fatty acid to ketone for fuel (i.e., [[ketosis]]); [[ketone bodies]] are intermediate substrates in that metabolic sequence. This is normal when periodic, but can become a serious problem if sustained. Elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood decrease the blood's [[pH]], leading to DKA. On presentation at hospital, the patient in DKA is typically dehydrated, and breathing rapidly and deeply. Abdominal pain is common and may be severe. The [[level of consciousness]] is typically normal until late in the process, when lethargy may progress to coma. Ketoacidosis can easily become severe enough to cause [[hypotension]], [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and death. Urine analysis will reveal significant levels of ketone bodies (which have exceeded their [[renal threshold]] blood levels to appear in the urine, often before other overt symptoms). Prompt, proper treatment usually results in full recovery, though death can result from inadequate or delayed treatment, or from complications (e.g., brain [[edema]]). Ketoacidosis is much more common in type&nbsp;1 diabetes than type&nbsp;2.\n\n===Hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state===\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}\n[[Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma]] (HNS) is an acute complication sharing many symptoms with DKA, but an entirely different origin and different treatment. A person with very high (usually considered to be above 300&nbsp;mg/dl (16&nbsp;mmol/L)) blood glucose levels, water is [[osmosis|osmotically]] drawn out of cells into the blood and the kidneys eventually begin to dump glucose into the urine. This results in loss of water and an increase in blood [[osmolarity]]. If fluid is not replaced (by mouth or intravenously), the osmotic effect of high glucose levels, combined with the loss of water, will eventually lead to [[dehydration]]. The body's cells become progressively dehydrated as water is taken from them and excreted. Electrolyte imbalances are also common and are always dangerous. As with DKA, urgent medical treatment is necessary, commonly beginning with fluid volume replacement. Lethargy may ultimately progress to a coma, though this is more common in type&nbsp;2 diabetes than type&nbsp;1.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Hypoglycemia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[Hypoglycemia]], or abnormally low blood glucose, is an acute complication of several diabetes treatments. It is rare otherwise, either in diabetic or non-diabetic patients. The patient may become agitated, sweaty, weak, and have many symptoms of [[Autonomic nervous system|sympathetic]] activation of the autonomic nervous system resulting in feelings akin to dread and immobilized panic. Consciousness can be altered or even lost in extreme cases, leading to coma, [[seizure]]s, or even brain damage and death. In patients with diabetes, this may be caused by several factors, such as too much or incorrectly timed insulin, too much or incorrectly timed exercise (exercise decreases insulin requirements) or not enough food (specifically glucose containing carbohydrates). The variety of interactions makes cause identification difficult in many instances.\n\nIt is more accurate to note that [[iatrogenic]] hypoglycemia is typically the result of the interplay of absolute (or relative) insulin excess and compromised glucose counterregulation in type&nbsp;1 and advanced type&nbsp;2 diabetes. Decrements in insulin, increments in glucagon, and, absent the latter, increments in epinephrine are the primary glucose counterregulatory factors that normally prevent or (more or less rapidly) correct hypoglycemia. In insulin-deficient diabetes (exogenous) insulin levels do not decrease as glucose levels fall, and the combination of deficient glucagon and epinephrine responses causes defective glucose counterregulation.\n\nFurthermore, reduced sympathoadrenal responses can cause hypoglycemia unawareness. The concept of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in diabetes posits that recent incidents of hypoglycemia causes both defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness. By shifting glycemic thresholds for the sympathoadrenal (including epinephrine) and the resulting neurogenic responses to lower plasma glucose concentrations, antecedent hypoglycemia leads to a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia and further impairment of glucose counterregulation. In many cases (but not all), short-term avoidance of hypoglycemia reverses hypoglycemia unawareness in affected patients, although this is easier in theory than in clinical experience.\n\nIn most cases, hypoglycemia is treated with sugary drinks or food. In severe cases, an injection of [[glucagon]] (a hormone with effects largely opposite to those of insulin) or an [[intravenous]] infusion of [[dextrose]] is used for treatment, but usually only if the person is unconscious. In any given incident, glucagon will only work once as it uses stored liver glycogen as a glucose source; in the absence of such stores, glucagon is largely ineffective. In hospitals, intravenous dextrose is often used.\n\n===Diabetic coma===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[Diabetic coma]] is a [[medical emergency]]<ref name=\"Cleveland Clinic\">{{cite web | title=Diabetes Coma | website=Cleveland Clinic | url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16628-diabetic-coma | access-date=2019-06-21 | type=tertiary source}}</ref> in which a person with [[diabetes mellitus]] is [[coma]]tose (unconscious) because of one of the acute complications of diabetes:\n# Severe diabetic hypoglycemia\n# [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of severe [[hyperglycemia]], [[dehydration]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and exhaustion\n# [[Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma]] in which extreme [[hyperglycemia]] and [[dehydration]] alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness.\n\n==Chronic==\n[[Image:Fundus photo showing scatter laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy EDA09.JPG|thumb|Image of [[Fundus (eye)|fundus]] showing scatter [[Laser scalpel|laser surgery]] for [[diabetic retinopathy]]]]\n\n===Microangiopathy===\nThe damage to small blood vessels leads to a [[microangiopathy]], which can cause one or more of the following:\n* ''[[Diabetic nephropathy]],'' damage to the kidney which can lead to [[chronic kidney disease]] which may eventually require [[renal dialysis]].

The complications of diabetes can dramatically impair quality of life and cause long-lasting disability.

Other health problems compound the chronic complications of diabetes such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, and lack of regular [[exercise]].\n\n==Acute==\n===Diabetic ketoacidosis===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) is an acute and dangerous complication that is always a [[medical emergency]] and requires prompt medical attention. Low insulin levels cause the [[liver]] to turn fatty acid to ketone for fuel (i.e., [[ketosis]]); [[ketone bodies]] are intermediate substrates in that metabolic sequence. This is normal when periodic, but can become a serious problem if sustained. Elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood decrease the blood's [[pH]], leading to DKA. On presentation at hospital, the patient in DKA is typically dehydrated, and breathing rapidly and deeply. Abdominal pain is common and may be severe. The [[level of consciousness]] is typically normal until late in the process, when lethargy may progress to coma. Ketoacidosis can easily become severe enough to cause [[hypotension]], [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and death. Urine analysis will reveal significant levels of ketone bodies (which have exceeded their [[renal threshold]] blood levels to appear in the urine, often before other overt symptoms). Prompt, proper treatment usually results in full recovery, though death can result from inadequate or delayed treatment, or from complications (e.g., brain [[edema]]). Ketoacidosis is much more common in type&nbsp;1 diabetes than type&nbsp;2.\n\n===Hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state===\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}\n[[Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma]] (HNS) is an acute complication sharing many symptoms with DKA, but an entirely different origin and different treatment. A person with very high (usually considered to be above 300&nbsp;mg/dl (16&nbsp;mmol/L)) blood glucose levels, water is [[osmosis|osmotically]] drawn out of cells into the blood and the kidneys eventually begin to dump glucose into the urine. This results in loss of water and an increase in blood [[osmolarity]]. If fluid is not replaced (by mouth or intravenously), the osmotic effect of high glucose levels, combined with the loss of water, will eventually lead to [[dehydration]]. The body's cells become progressively dehydrated as water is taken from them and excreted. Electrolyte imbalances are also common and are always dangerous. As with DKA, urgent medical treatment is necessary, commonly beginning with fluid volume replacement. Lethargy may ultimately progress to a coma, though this is more common in type&nbsp;2 diabetes than type&nbsp;1.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Hypoglycemia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[Hypoglycemia]], or abnormally low blood glucose, is an acute complication of several diabetes treatments. It is rare otherwise, either in diabetic or non-diabetic patients. The patient may become agitated, sweaty, weak, and have many symptoms of [[Autonomic nervous system|sympathetic]] activation of the autonomic nervous system resulting in feelings akin to dread and immobilized panic. Consciousness can be altered or even lost in extreme cases, leading to coma, [[seizure]]s, or even brain damage and death. In patients with diabetes, this may be caused by several factors, such as too much or incorrectly timed insulin, too much or incorrectly timed exercise (exercise decreases insulin requirements) or not enough food (specifically glucose containing carbohydrates). The variety of interactions makes cause identification difficult in many instances.\n\nIt is more accurate to note that [[iatrogenic]] hypoglycemia is typically the result of the interplay of absolute (or relative) insulin excess and compromised glucose counterregulation in type&nbsp;1 and advanced type&nbsp;2 diabetes. Decrements in insulin, increments in glucagon, and, absent the latter, increments in epinephrine are the primary glucose counterregulatory factors that normally prevent or (more or less rapidly) correct hypoglycemia. In insulin-deficient diabetes (exogenous) insulin levels do not decrease as glucose levels fall, and the combination of deficient glucagon and epinephrine responses causes defective glucose counterregulation.\n\nFurthermore, reduced sympathoadrenal responses can cause hypoglycemia unawareness. The concept of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in diabetes posits that recent incidents of hypoglycemia causes both defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness. By shifting glycemic thresholds for the sympathoadrenal (including epinephrine) and the resulting neurogenic responses to lower plasma glucose concentrations, antecedent hypoglycemia leads to a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia and further impairment of glucose counterregulation. In many cases (but not all), short-term avoidance of hypoglycemia reverses hypoglycemia unawareness in affected patients, although this is easier in theory than in clinical experience.\n\nIn most cases, hypoglycemia is treated with sugary drinks or food. In severe cases, an injection of [[glucagon]] (a hormone with effects largely opposite to those of insulin) or an [[intravenous]] infusion of [[dextrose]] is used for treatment, but usually only if the person is unconscious. In any given incident, glucagon will only work once as it uses stored liver glycogen as a glucose source; in the absence of such stores, glucagon is largely ineffective. In hospitals, intravenous dextrose is often used.\n\n===Diabetic coma===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[Diabetic coma]] is a [[medical emergency]]<ref name=\"Cleveland Clinic\">{{cite web | title=Diabetes Coma | website=Cleveland Clinic | url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16628-diabetic-coma | access-date=2019-06-21 | type=tertiary source}}</ref> in which a person with [[diabetes mellitus]] is [[coma]]tose (unconscious) because of one of the acute complications of diabetes:\n# Severe diabetic hypoglycemia\n# [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of severe [[hyperglycemia]], [[dehydration]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and exhaustion\n# [[Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma]] in which extreme [[hyperglycemia]] and [[dehydration]] alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness.\n\n==Chronic==\n[[Image:Fundus photo showing scatter laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy EDA09.JPG|thumb|Image of [[Fundus (eye)|fundus]] showing scatter [[Laser scalpel|laser surgery]] for [[diabetic retinopathy]]]]\n\n===Microangiopathy===\nThe damage to small blood vessels leads to a [[microangiopathy]], which can cause one or more of the following:\n* ''[[Diabetic nephropathy]],'' damage to the kidney which can lead to [[chronic kidney disease]] which may eventually require [[renal dialysis]].
