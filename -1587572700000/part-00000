Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] (an [[Italian Americans|Italian]]-ethnic neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir ''Rock This'', he recalls, \"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. \"I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood...\"</ref>\n\nThe comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in stand-up comedy\u2014or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry\u2014should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself feuding with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]]. Cosby has criticized Rock both explicitly\u2014for his [[Niggas vs. Black People]] routine\u2014and implicitly, for use of the word \"[[nigger]].\"<ref>Morano, Marc. CNSNews. \"Bill Cosby to Blacks,\" July 2, 2004. \"When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car\u2014those children hear that... That's all [[minstrel show]] stuff. I am tired of it.\"</ref> Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 ''Roll With The New'' show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: \"Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling [[Jerry Seinfeld]] he's a good role model. Because everyone expects [[Caucasian race|whites]] to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much.\"<ref>Rock, Chris.

In his memoir ''Rock This'', he recalls, \"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. \"I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood...\"</ref>\n\nThe comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in stand-up comedy\u2014or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry\u2014should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself feuding with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]].

The [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''silat'' is linked to [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] word ''silek''. Due to Sumatran origin of the language, the Sumatran origin of the term is likely.<ref name=\"Martial Arts of the World-Silat\"/>\n\nAlthough the word ''[[silat]]'' is widely known throughout much of [[Southeast Asia]], the term ''pencak silat'' is used mainly in Indonesia. Pencak silat was chosen in 1948 as a unifying term for the Indonesian fighting styles. It was a compound of the two most commonly used words for martial arts in Indonesia. ''Pencak'' was the term used in central and east [[Java]], while ''silat'' was used in [[Sumatra]], [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Borneo]]. In [[Minangkabau language|Minang]] usage, pencak and silat are seen as being two aspects of the same practice. Pencak is the essence of training, the outward aspect of the art which a casual observer is permitted to witness as performance. Silat is the essence of combat and self-defense, the true fighting application of the techniques which are kept secret from outsiders and not divulged to students until the guru deems them ready. While other definitions exist, all agree that silat cannot exist without pencak, and pencak without silat skills is purposeless.<ref name=\"Alexander, et.al.1979\">{{cite book |title=Pentjak Silat: The Indonesian Fighting Art |last=Alexander |first=Howard |last2=Chambers |first2=Quintin |last3=Draeger |first3=Donn F. |author-link3=Donn F. Draeger |publisher=Tokyo, Japan : Kodansha International Ltd.|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the words ''pencak'' and ''silat'' have not been proven. Some believe that pencak comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''pancha'' meaning five, or from the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term ''pencha'' or ''pungcha'' which implies parrying or deflecting, and striking or pressing.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Malay Art Of Self-defense: Silat Seni Gayong |author=Sheikh Shamsuddin |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-55643-562-2}}</ref><br /> Other terms may be used in particular dialects such as ''silek'', ''penca'', ''mancak'', ''maen po'' or ''main-po''.\n\nDutch East Indian newspapers of the colonial era recorded the terms for martial arts under [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spellings. These include ''silat'', ''pencak'' (spelled in Dutch as \"pentjak\"), ''penca'' (\"pentjah\"), ''mancak'' (\"mentjak\"), ''manca'' (\"mentjah\"), and ''pukulan'' (\"poekoelan\").<ref name=\"nieuwsdag\">Het nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb 20-02-19</ref> In 1881 a magazine calls mancak a [[Batak]] fencing game \"with long swords, daggers or wood (''mentjah'')\"<ref name=\"TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR INDISCHE TAAL-, LAND- EN VOLKENKUNDE\">, UITGEGEVEN DOOE HET BATAVIAASCH GENOOTSCHAP VAN KUNSTEN EN WETENSCHAPPEN.

At the request of the local people, he successfully killed the monarch Dewata Cengkar of [[Medang Kamulan]] in battle and took his place as ruler. This story traditionally marks the rise of Java and the dawn of its Dharmic civilisation. The tale also illustrates the influence India had on Indonesian and Southeast Asian culture in general. Aji Saka is shown to be a fighter and swordsman, while his servants are also depicted as fighting with daggers. The Indian method of knife-duelling was adapted by the [[Batak people|Batak]] and [[Bugis]]-[[Makassar people]]s. Ancient Indonesian art from this period also depicts warriors mounted on elephants wielding Chinese weapons such as the [[jian]] or straight double-edge sword, which is still used in Java.\n\nThe earliest evidence of pencak silat being taught in a structured manner comes from 6th-century<ref name=\"Wonderful\">{{cite web |title=Silek Harimau Minangkabau: the True Martial Art of West Sumatra |publisher=Wonderful Indonesia |url=http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/467/padang/article/74/silek-harimau-minangkabau-seni-bela-diri-minangkabau |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708113338/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/467/padang/article/74/silek-harimau-minangkabau-seni-bela-diri-minangkabau |archivedate=8 July 2015 }}</ref> [[Riau]] from where it spread to the Minangkabau capital in [[West Sumatra]]. The Minangkabau had a clan-based feudal government. Military officers called ''hulubalang'' acted as bodyguards to the king or ''yam tuan''. Minang warriors served without pay. The plunder was divided among them according to military merit, so fighters strove to outdo each other. They were skilled horsemen with the [[list of Indonesian horse breeds|native pony]] and also expert bladesmiths, producing arms both for their own use and for export to Aceh. Traditional Minang society was based around matrilineal custom, so pencak silat was commonly practiced by women.<ref name=\"Draeger1992\"/> As pencak silat became widespread in [[Srivijaya]], the empire was defeated by the Tamil [[Chola]]s of [[south India]] in the 13th century. The Tamil stick fighting art of [[silambam]] is still the most common Indian fighting system in Southeast Asia today.\n\nDuring the 13th century, [[Ken Arok]], a thug turned into a self made hero and ruler, took over the power from [[Kediri Kingdom]] and established the [[Rajasa Dynasty]]. This is pretty much reflected the ''jago'' (people's champion) culture of ancient Java, where a self made cunning man skillful in martial arts, could rally supports and took over the kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilnjEF_7J_MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Para+Jagoan:+Dari+Ken+Arok+sampai+Kusni+Kasdut&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWl-exn_TbAhVIWX0KHVwHC0gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Para%20Jagoan:%20Dari%20Ken%20Arok%20sampai%20Kusni%20Kasdut&f=false|title=Para Jagoan: Dari Ken Arok sampai Kusni Kasdut|last=Matanasi|first=Petrik|date=2011-07-01|publisher=Trompet Book|isbn=9786029913118|language=id}}</ref> His successor, the warrior-king [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]] conquered the [[Melayu Kingdom]], [[Maluku Islands]], [[Bali]], and other neighbouring areas. From 1280-1289, [[Kublai Khan]] sent envoys demanding that Singhasari submit to the Khan as Jambi and Melayu had already done, but Kertanegara responded defiantly by scarring the last envoy's face. Kublai Khan retaliated by sending a punitive expedition of 1000 junks to Java, but Kertanegara had already been killed by a vassal in Kediri before the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] force arrived. His son-in-law [[Raden Wijaya]] replaced Kertanegara as leader and allied himself with the arriving Mongol army. With their help Raden Wijaya was able to defeat the Kediri forces. With his silat-trained warriors, Raden Wijaya then turned on the Mongols so that they fled back to [[China]]. The village he founded became the [[Majapahit]] empire. This was the first empire to unite all of [[Indonesia]]'s major islands, and pencak silat reached its technical zenith during this period. In Majapahit, pencak silat became the specialised property of the nobility and its advanced secrets were hidden from commoners.<ref name=\"Draeger1992\"/>\n\n===Colonial era===\n[[File:baliwarriors.jpg|thumb|[[Balinese people|Balinese]] warriors armed with [[kris]] in the 1880s]]\nThe lucrative spice trade eventually brought colonists from Europe, first the Portuguese followed by the Dutch and British. The [[Dutch East India Company]] became the dominant power and established fuial rule in Indonesia. Local revolts and uprisings were common, but all were suppressed by the Dutch armed with guns and cannons. The Dutch brought in even more Chinese workers to Indonesia, which brought a greater variety of local [[kuntao]] systems. But while the Europeans could effectively overtake and hold the cities, they found it impossible to control the smaller villages and roads connecting them. Indonesians took advantage of this, fighting an underground war through guerilla tactics. Local weapons were recorded as being used against the Dutch, particularly knives and edged weapons such as the [[golok]], [[Parang (knife)|parang]], [[kris]] and [[klewang]].\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]] allied with the Dutch colonists to destroy [[Makassar|Mangkasara]] rule over the surrounding area. While this increased Bugis power in the southwest, Dutch rule deprived seafaring merchants like the Bugis of their traditional employment. As a result, these communities increasingly turned to piracy during the 17th-18th centuries. Not only was pencak silat practiced by the pirates, but new styles were created to combat them.\n\nDuring the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]] of the 18th and 19th century, the [[Cultivation System|exploitative social and economic condition]] of the colony created the culture of the ''jago'' or local people's champion regarded as thugs and bandits by the colonial administration. Parallels can be seen in the ''jawara'' of [[Priangan]], ''jagoan'' of Betawi, and ''warok'' in the [[Ponorogo]] region of East Java. The most infamous band of ''jagoan'' was the 19th century [[Si Pitung]] and Si Jampang, experts in Silat Betawi. Traditionally depicted as Robin Hood-like figures, they upheld justice for the common man by robbing from the rich who acquired power and status by collaborating with the colonists. The ''jago'' were despised by the Dutch authorities as criminals and thieves but were highly respected by the native [[pribumi]] and [[Indonesian Chinese|local Chinese]].\n\n===Modern era===\nConflict with the European rulers provided an impetus for the proliferation of new styles of pencak silat, now founded on the platform of nationalism and the desire for freedom from colonisation. The Indonesian Pencak Silat Association (IPSI) was founded in 1948 to bring all of Indonesia's pencak silat under a single administration. The world's oldest nationwide silat organisation, its basis is that all pencak silat is built on a common source, and that less functional styles must give way to the technically superior. IPSI has avoided the tendency of modern martial arts that gravitate towards sport. The resistance to sport has lessened over time, however, and sparring in particular has become less combative. While nominally an Indonesian organisation, many of the rules and regulations outlined by IPSI have become the de facto standard for [[silat]] competitions worldwide. Indo-Dutch Eurasians who first began practicing pencak silat in the 20th century<ref name=\"nieuwsdag\" /> spread the art to the west in the late 20th century.\n\nToday pencak silat is one of the extra-curricular activities taught in Indonesian schools. It is included as a combat sport in local, national and international athletic events such as the [[SEA Games]] and Indonesia's [[Pekan Olahraga Nasional|National Sports Week]]. Since 2012, the Pencak Malioboro Festival has been held annually and features demonstrations by the biggest silat schools in Indonesia. The art features prominently in the Hollywood blockbuster ''[[John Wick 3]]'', with masters [[Yayan Ruhian]] and [[Cecep Arif Rahman]] appearing against Wick in the penultimate fight.\n\n==Weapons==\n{{main|Weapons of silat}}\n[[File:Kerambit knife and sheath.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kerambit]]]]\nAs with most ancient fighting arts, pencak silat historically prioritized weapons over unarmed combat. While this is usually not the case today, all pencak silat schools include weapons to some degree of importance. While pencak silat includes a wide array of weapons, the following are considered standard in all classical styles. In addition to these, many systems include a specialty or \"secret\" weapon taught only to advanced students.\n\n* '''''Toya''''': Staff usually made of [[rattan]] but sometimes wood or metal. Typically measures 5\u20136 feet long and 1.5-2 inches in diameter.\n* '''''Tombak/Lembing''''': Spear or javelin made of bamboo, steel or wood that sometimes has horsehair attached near the blade.\n* '''''[[Parang (knife)|Parang]]''''': Machete-like chopper, ranging from 10 to 36 inches long\n*'''''[[Golok]]''''': Heavy cleaver measuring 10-20 inches long. The blade is heaviest in the centre\n* '''''Pisau''''': Any short-bladed knife\n* '''''[[Kris]]''''': Double-edged dagger made by folding different types of metal together and then washing it in acid.\n* '''''[[Kama (weapon)|Sabit]]/Celurit''''': A sickle, commonly used in farming, cultivation and harvesting of crops.\n* '''''Tongkat/Galah''''': Short stick or cudgel\n* '''''Pedang''''': Sword, most often single-edged and either straight or slightly curved. Usually measures 15-35 inches overall with a blade upward of 10 inches long\n*'''''[[Klewang]]''''': Single-edge longsword with a protruding notch near its tip\n* '''''[[tekpi|Chabang]]''''': Short-handled trident, literally meaning \"branch\"\n* '''''[[Selendang]]''''': A silk that can be used for strangling, grappling and whipping\n* '''''[[Kerambit]]''''': A small curved knife resembling a claw.\n\n==Styles and schools==\n{{further|Styles of silat}}\nOver 150 styles of [[pencak silat]] are recognised in [[Indonesia]],<ref name=\"JP1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/05/passing-a-legacy.html|title=Passing on a legacy|author=Ika Krismantari|date=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132711/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/05/passing-a-legacy.html|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=|location=Jakarta}}</ref> although the actual number of existing systems is well beyond that. Older methods are typically identified with specific ethno-cultural groups or particular regions.\n\n===Riau===\nMuch of what constitutes classical Malay culture has its origin in the [[Riau]] Archipelago, including the earliest evidence of silat. Referred to as [[silat Melayu]], the regional fighting systems of Riau have influenced nearly the entirety of [[Indonesia]]n pencak silat, and into neighbouring [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. Fighting tactics dating back to the [[Srivijaya]] empire persist in [[Palembang]] today. Wide stances with the front foot turned slightly inward are typical, developed for fighting on Riau's muddy ground, while also preventing the knee joint from being exposed to frontal kicks. Seizing techniques which grab the arm are common. The most prominent weapons in silat Melayu are the staff (''toya'') and the spear. Spear forms in Riau usually begin with the blade pointed downward. Staff technique in silat Melayu of the Palembang area is said to be the best in all of Indonesian pencak silat. The weapon is made of wood and usually measures seven feet long. Fixed hand positions with very little sliding along the staff is characteristic of silat Melayu.\n\n===Minangkabau===\n[[File:Silek Harimau.jpg|thumb|right|A demonstration of the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] style of silat.]]\n[[File:Randai Padang Panjang.jpg|thumb|right|Minangkabau ''[[randai]]'' performance, incorporating some Minang ''silek'' movements.]]\nThe [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] formed the dominant sovereignty in West Sumatra and make up the majority of Sumatran pencak silat systems. These styles may be referred to as ''silat Minangkabau'', ''silat Padang'' (lit. field silat), or ''silek'', the local pronunciation of silat. Very few systems in Indonesia have not been influenced by silek, and its techniques form the core of pencak silat throughout Sumatra. It developed as an extension of the original silat Melayu from Riau. Folklore traces this to five masters, namely Ninik Datuak Suri Dirajo from [[Padang Panjang]], Kambiang Utan (\"forest goat\") from [[Cambodia]], Harimau Campo (\"tiger of [[Champa]]\") from [[Vietnam]], Kuciang Siam (\"[[Siamese cat]]\") from [[Thailand]] and Anjiang Mualim (\"teacher dog\") from [[Gujarat]].<ref>Thesis: ''Seni Silat Melayu'' by Abd Rahman Ismail (USM 2005 matter 188)</ref><ref>Djamal, Mid. Filsafat dan Silsilah Aliran-Aliran Silat Minangkabau. Penerbit CV. Tropic - Bukittinggi.1986</ref> Stealth and ambush were the preferred Minang war tactics, and they were said to be among the best assassins in the world when dispatched singly. Silek Minangkabau is characterised by its low stances and reliance on kicks and leg tactics. The low stance is said to have developed to offset the chance of falling on slippery ground, common in the rice fields of West Sumatra. The local practice of paddling rafts with the legs strengthened fighters' lower body muscles. Hand and arm movements are fast, honed through an exercise in which the exponent stands across from a partner tossing sharpened sticks or knives. The practitioner must redirect the sticks or knives and send them back at the thrower, using their hands and a minimum of movements with the rest of the body.\n\nThere are currently around ten major styles of silek, a few of which like Silek Lintau are commonly practiced even in Malaysia. IPSI recognises Silek Harimau (tiger silek) as among the oldest pencak silat in existence. Silek Harimau, also known as ''silek kuciang'' or cat silek, epitomizes the Minang techniques in that it focuses on crouching and kicking from a low position paired with rapid hand attacks. Sitaralak imitates the power of a herd of stampeding [[elephant]]s. Developed as a counter to silek Harimau, folklore tells that its practitioners were able to fight tigers. Sandang is the counter-system to Sitaralak, which defends against powerful attacks by misdirection. Kumango is another characteristically Minang system in its kicks and footwork. Its frequent thigh-slapping and [[taiji]]-like redirection maneuvers indicate both Indian and Chinese influence. Silek Tuo is considered by some to be the oldest Minang system due to its name meaning \"old silek\", but others claim it traces to the freedom fighter Tuanku Nan Tuo after whom it was named. All the classical pencak silat weapons are used in silek but the most prominent Minang weapons are the ''pedang'' (sword), ''tumbak'' (spear), ''[[kris|karih]]'' (dagger), ''[[klewang]]'' (longsword), ''[[kama (weapon)|sabik]]'' (sickle), ''payung'' (umbrella), ''[[kerambit|kurambik]]'' (claw), and various types of knives.\n\n===Java===\n[[File:Persaudaraan Setia Hati Terate - Tendangan terbang.jpg|thumb|right|Flying kick by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] style of silat at [[Barong Temple]], [[Yogyakarta]].]]\nFrom [[Srivijaya]], pencak silat quickly spread eastward into the Javanese [[Sailendra]] and [[Medang Kingdom]]s where the fighting arts developed in three geographical regions: [[West Java]], [[Central Java]], and [[East Java]]. Today [[Java]] is home to more styles of pencak silat than any other Indonesian island, and displays the greatest diversity of techniques. Many Javanese schools such as [[Perisai Diri]] and [[Inti Ombak]] have been established internationally in Asia, Europe and America. Merpati Putih or \"white dove\" style was developed in the [[keraton]] (royal courts) of 17th century [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and was not taught publicly until 1963.<ref name=\"MPSejarah\">{{cite web|title=Sejarah Merpati Putih |publisher=PPS Betako Merpati Putih, Pewaris - Pengurus Pusat |url=http://www.ppsbetakomerpatiputih.com/index.php# |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> Today it is the standard unarmed martial art of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"TNI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.mil.id/view-19916-koarmatim-siap-tarung.html|title=KOARMATIM Siap Tarung|publisher=Tentara Nasional Indonesia|language=Indonesian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608152810/http://www.tni.mil.id/view-19916-koarmatim-siap-tarung.html|archive-date=June 8, 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It includes weapons but focuses more on empty-handed self-defense and the development of internal strength developed through [[breathing technique]]s.<ref name=\"MP\">{{cite web|title=Merpati Putih |publisher=PPS Betako Merpati Putih, Pewaris - Pengurus Pusat |url=http://www.ppsbetakomerpatiputih.com/index.php |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> Pencak silat in Java draws from traditional [[kejawen]] and Hindu-Buddhist [[Javanese beliefs]] but after Indonesia's independence, some schools have adapted themselves in the context of modern religion.<ref name=\"Patzold2011\">{{cite book| title=Self-Defense and Music in Muslim Context in West Java in Divine Inspirations: Music and Islam in Indonesia|author=Uwe Patzold |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford, UK : Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538541-0}}</ref> Among the most popular modern styles is the Muslim-directed [[Tapak Suci]]. An evasive long-range system, it requires constant movement as the practitioner rotates on their own axis every few seconds. Similarly the Setia Hati school is Christian-organised. Rooted in silek Minangkabau of the [[Padang]] area, it relies on kicks and footwork while the hands are mainly used defensively for blocking and parrying.\n\n===Sunda===\nJava's western region was the first area from which pencak silat spread out of Sumatra. The [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] pencak silat of [[West Java]] may be called ''silat Sunda'' or ''silat Bandung''. In the [[Sundanese language]] they are generically referred to as ''penca'' (dialect form of pencak), ''ameng'', ''ulin'' or ''maen po'' (from the word ''main'' meaning \"play\"). Ameng is the more respectful term, while ulin and maen po are of lower speech levels. Sunda systems are easily identified by the prefix ''ci'' (spelled \"tji\" by the Dutch). Pronounced \"chi\", it comes from the Sundanese word ''cai'' meaning river water, alluding to the fact that they were originally developed in river-basin areas. The deep, wide stance and resulting gait attests to this, owing to the practice of carefully placing the feet from a lifted position onto wet ground. Today, systems of Sunda derivation prefixed with ''ci'' are found even in the high plateaus and mountain ranges of both West and Central Java. Penca instruction was traditionally done through apprenticeship, wherein prospective students offer to work as a servant in the master's house or a labourer in the rice fields. In exchange for working during the day, the master provides the student's meals and trains during the evening. Penca is characterized by reliance on hand and arm movements for both attack and defense. Compared to other Javanese systems, Sunda styles have less frontal contact with the opponent, instead preferring to evade in a circular manner and attack from the side. In one form of training designed to practice circular evasion, victory is attained simply by touching the opponent's torso. Fasting and [[mantra]] were traditionally used to heighten the senses for this purpose. \n\nThe oldest styles of penca were based on animals and movements of farming or tending the fields. IPSI recognises ''Cimacan'' (tiger style), ''Ciular'' (snake style), and ''Pamonyet'' (monkey style) as among the oldest existing pencak silat. Cimacan is said to have been created by a Buddhist monk.  The most prominent system of West Java is ''penca Cimande'', first taught publicly by a [[Baduy people|Badui]] man named Embah Kahir in Cimande village of the [[Sukabumi]] area around 1760.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cimande |publisher=Cimande France |url=http://www.cimandefrance.com/?page_id=43 |accessdate= 8 July 2015}}</ref> Cimande among the isolationist [[Baduy people|Badui community]] is said to be much older than Embah Kahir, and is believed by many masters to be the original penca of West Java tracing back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Cimande is a close-quarters system, with the elbows held close to the body. Students begin by learning to fight from a seated position before they are taught footwork. Arms are traditionally conditioned through smashing [[coconuts]], by concentrating the force of the blow into the wrist. Cimande always assumes there is a minimum of three enemies, but advanced students may spar with up to twelve opponents. As a defensive art, Cimande has no lethal techniques. The town of [[Cianjur]] - seen as the heartland of Sunda culture - is associated with a few systems, the most prominent of them being ''Cikalong'' or bat style. Borrowing its technical base from Cimande, Cikalong was founded by Raden Jayaperbata after meditating in a cave in the Cikalong Kulon village. While Cimande may attack with either the fists or open hands, Cikalong prefers the latter. Prominent Sunda weapons include the ''toya'' (staff), ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), long-bladed ''[[parang (knife)|parang]]'' (machete) and heavy ''[[golok]]'' (cleaver). The advanced weapon is the ''piau'' or throwing knife.\n\n===Betawi===\n[[File:Pencak Silat Betawi 1.jpg|right|thumb|Silat Betawi demonstration in [[Jakarta]]]]\nAmong the [[Betawi people]] of [[Greater Jakarta]], the pencak silat tradition is rooted in the culture of the ''jagoan'' or ''jawara'', local champions seen as heroes of the common people. They went against colonial authority and were despised by the Dutch as thugs and bandits. Silat Betawi is referred to in the local dialect as ''maen pukulan'' or ''main pukulan'', literally meaning \"strike-play\". The most well-known schools are [[Cingkrik]], [[Kwitang silat|Kwitang]], and [[Beksi]]. The acrobatic monkey-inspired Cingkrik is likely the oldest, the name implying agile movement. The art is said to trace back to a monkey style of [[kuntao]] attributed to Rama Isruna after his wife observed the actions of monkeys. A student of this kuntao named Ki Maing later expanded on the system after a monkey stole his walking stick. [[Cingkrik]] is highly evasive; blows are delivered as a counter after parrying or blocking, and usually target the face, throat and groin. Attacks mimic the grabbing and tearing actions of monkeys. [[Kwitang silat|Kwitang]] also employs evasion and some open-hand strikes but its focus is on powerful punches with the fist tightly-closed at the moment of impact, mainly targeting the centreline. Force is concentrated into the knuckles of the little and ring finger. Attacks are made with a curved arm; the elbow is never fully extended so as to prevent being caught in a joint lock. [[Beksi]], meaning \"defense of four directions\", is credited to a man named Lie Cheng Hok. It is distinguishable from other Betawi systems by its close-distance combat style and lack of offensive leg action. Silat Betawi includes all the classical pencak silat weapons, but places particular emphasis on the [[parang (knife)|parang]] (machete), [[golok]] (chopper), ''toya'' (staff), and ''pisau'' (knife). Kwitang practitioners are said to be the best [[tekpi|chabang]] fighters in Indonesia.<ref>{{citenews|title =Betawi pencak silat adapts to modern times | author =Nathalie Abigail Budiman |newspaper =The Jakarta Post | location =Jakarta | date = 1 August 2015 |url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/01/betawi-pencak-silat-adapts-modern-times.html|accessdate = 10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bali===\n[[File: Bali Silat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bhakti negara (Pencak silat of Bali)]]\nFollowing the invasion by Demak, many families of the Majapahit empire fled to Bali. The descendants of the Majapahit were traditionally resistant to outside influence and as a result, the people of Bali often make a distinction between \"pure\" Balinese pencak silat and styles introduced from outside such as Perisai Diri. The native systems - known locally as pencak - are ultimately rooted in those of Java, and preserve tactics dating back to the Majapahit empire. They are less direct than other styles, characteristically favouring deception over aggression. Hand movements are used to distract, and openings are deliberately exposed to bluff the opponent into attacking. This approach requires that exponents train their flexibility and stamina. As with Balinese warriors of the past, modern pencak practitioners in Bali often wear headbands as part of their uniform.\n\nThere are about four main systems considered purely Balinese. The most prominent of these is [[Bakti Negara]], which is firmly rooted in the old [[Balinese Hinduism|local Hindu philosophy]] of [[Tri Hita Karana]].<ref name =\"BN\">{{cite web|title =Tentang Bakti Negara | publisher = Bakti Negara |url =http://baktinegara.com/about-us/#translate-en | language =Indonesian | accessdate =10 August 2015}}</ref> Another system which has gained prominence is Seruling Dewata meaning \"God's flute\". Purported to date back to ancient times, it recognizes the Indian Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]] as the first patriarch, though not its creator. Eka Sentosa Setiti (ESSTI) was the first pencak silat association officially founded in Bali. Created and practiced in the island's south, it draws heavily from southern [[Shaolinquan|Saolim kuntao]]. The primary stance is the ''ting'' posture of kuntao, also the main stance of Japanese [[aikido]]. ESSTI keeps membership low and does not permit outsiders to view sparring matches. Finally, the Tridharma style is practiced in northern Bali. It utilizes circular hand movements and straight kicks. The ESSTI and Tridharma schools often exchange students so cross-training between the styles is common. All Balinese pencak schools traditionally keep sportive contests and performance to a minimum in order to emphasise combat effectiveness.\n\n===Bugis-Makassar===\nThe [[Bugis]] (''Ugi'') and [[Makassar people]] (''Mangkasara'') are two related maritime groups from [[Sulawesi]]. The Bugis in particular were renowned navigators and shipbuilders, but also feared as corsairs and slave-traders. Both the Bugis and Makassarese were famous for piracy, though this was more common among the former than the latter. As sailors for whom the knife is a vital tool, Bugis and Makassar combatives (known locally as silat) favour blades. The primary weapon is an indigenous knife called the [[badik]]. Other weapons include the ''[[kris|sele]]'' (dagger), ''[[parang (knife)|berang]]'' (machete), ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), and the ''mandau'' (cleaver). Silat in Sulawesi is closely tied to local animism, and weapons are believed to be imbued with a spirit of their own. Hand and arm movements are designed to be adaptable for use with a knife or with the empty hands. Attacks with the fists or open hands can be modified with a pinching action of the fingers, which has its origin in the pinch-grip of the badik. Bugis styles (''silat Ugi'') are based on these hand and arm movements and contain only limited kicks, almost all of the linear variety. The Bugis ''kekuda'' is identical to the southern Chinese [[horse stance]]. Styles from southwestern Sulawesi generally come under the Makassar category (''silat Mangkasara''). Chief among them are the [[kuntao]]-influenced tiger style Karena Macang and the kick-based Manca Tonaja from southern Sulawesi, which is believed to have Minang roots. The mangrove swamps and rocky inlets along the coasts of Sulawesi served as hiding places for pirates, so silat among the Bugis and Makasar community makes use of and defends against ambush. Countering surprise attacks is the specialty of Silat Tapu, a secretive system taught only to experienced practitioners.\n\n===Aceh===\nLocated on Sumatra's northwest coast on the westernmost tip of the archipelago, Aceh was the first port of call for traders sailing the Indian Ocean. Local culture and weapons (particularly knives) show distinct Indian-Muslim derivation. Unlike the more typical rattan shield, the Acehnese buckler is identical to the Indian [[dhal (shield)]], made from metal and with five or seven knobs on the surface. The Acehnese are recorded by both Indonesian and European sources as being the most warlike people in all of Sumatra, and this is reflected in the highly-aggressive nature of their pencak silat. Acehnese pencak silat borrows its foundation from silat Melayu and silek Minangkabau, particularly the arm-seizing techniques of the former and the ground-sitting postures of the latter. Bladed weaponry is favoured, specifically knives and swords. The primary weapon is the [[rencong]], an L-shaped dagger used mainly for thrusting but also for slashing. The [[kris]] is used as well but the native rencong takes precedence.\n\n===Batak===\nBatak land is situated between the Minangkabau to the south and Aceh to the north, and the culture shows both Indian and Chinese influence. The word [[Batak]] refers to a number of ethnic groups originally from the mountains of [[North Sumatra]]. The term typically refers to the [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]] while others may explicitly reject that label, preferring to identify themselves by their specific group. Batak silat is known by different names in each community, namely ''mossak'' (Toba), ''moncak'' ([[Mandailing]]), ''ndikar'' ([[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]) and ''dihar'' ([[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]]). Mossak is the most commonly-used due to the Toba being the most numerous. While each style is distinct, all share similar characteristics and weaponry. The Batak were historically in a near-perpetual state of warfare with their neighbours, so warriors trained daily for combat. Training was either done outdoors or in the ''balai'', a building in the [[kampung]] specifically made for combat practice. Batak silat is primarily armed, employing such weapons as the spear, single-edge blade, and a short-bladed knife known as the ''raut''. The raut is similar to the [[badik]] both in appearance and in its pinch-grip. The most common target is the opponent's midsection. The weapon is held loosely and used in an upward or downward hacking motion. Once the raut has pierced the enemy, the fighter pushes the knife further in with a palm strike. Unarmed techniques are derived from silek Minangkabau, as the kicks and footwork are well-suited to the mountainous Batak country.\n\n===Maluku===\nPencak silat in the [[Maluku Islands]] uses a wide variety of weaponry, some of which are indigenous to the area. The particular specialty of Moluccan silat is the ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), ''pisau'' (knife), and the wooden or metal ''galah'' (staff). The local ''pedang'' (sword) is long-bladed and associated with female fighters. On [[Haruku Island]], particular emphasis is placed on one-legged stances. This tactic was developed for fighting in the ankle-deep sands of the islands, allowing the exponent to use both kicking and eye-gouging techniques simultaneously.\n\n===Bajau===\nThe [[Sama-Bajau peoples|Bajau]] are a seafaring people of [[Sulawesi]]. Often nomadic, they were traditionally born and raised on longboats at sea although this is increasingly exceptional as the community has been forced to settle on land in recent decades. Colonial records often mistook them for pirates but - unlike the neighbouring Bugis - the Bajau lacked the organization and technology for piracy. In fact, they more often clashed with pirates than engaging in raids themselves. Their main and often only weapon was the fishing spear, which functioned as a hunting tool on land. The Bajau utilized a wide array of these harpoons as weapons both thrown and unthrown. Their aim was impeccable, having been honed by fishing and hunting. The spear may be of ''nibong'' wood or [[bamboo]], single-pronged or three-pronged, barbed or unbarbed, and tipped with wood or steel. Contact with the southern [[Philippines]] and the [[sultanate of Sulu|Sulu sultanate]] of Borneo allowed the Bajau to acquire other weapons through barter, specifically swords, shields, lances and [[parang]]. The most notable Bajau style of pencak silat is centered in [[Kendari]]. It is characterized by cross-legged stances and rapid turning, designed to be used in cramped spaces such as boats.\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:Pencak Silat Betawi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Disarming a [[golok]]]]\nGeneralizations in pencak silat technique are very difficult; styles and movements are as diverse as the Indonesian archipelago itself. Individual disciplines can be offensive as in Aceh, evasive as in Bali, or somewhere in between. They may focus on strikes (''pukulan''), kicks (''tendangan''), locks (''kuncian''), weapons (''senjata''), or even on spiritual development rather than physical fighting techniques. Most styles specialize in one or two of these, but still make use of them all to some degree. Certain characteristics tend to prevail in particular geographical regions, as follows:\n\n*'''Kicks''' - [[West Sumatra]], [[North Sumatra]]\n*'''Hands/Arms''' - [[West Java]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Kalimantan]]\n*'''Grappling''' - [[East Java]], [[Sumatra]]\n*'''Strikes''' (hands and feet) - [[Bali]], [[Central Java]], [[Madura]]\n\n===Stances and steps===\nStudents begin by learning basic body stances and steps. Steps or dancing sweep fan''langkah'' are ways of moving the feet from one point to another during a fight. Pencak silat has several basic steps, known as ''langkah 8 penjuru'' or \"eight directions of steps\". Traditional music is often used as a signal to change body position when practicing langkah.<ref name=\"PS Body Basic\">{{cite web|title=Pencak Silat Body Basics |publisher=Google.com |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sundanesepencaksilat/lesson-description/body-basics-1 |accessdate= 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nLangkah are taught in conjunction with preset stances, meant to provide a foundation from which to defend oneself or to launch attacks. The most basic stance is the [[horse stance]] (''kekuda'' or ''kuda-kuda''), which provides stability and firm body position by strengthening the quads. Other stances may train the feet, legs, thighs, glutes and back. Other essential stances are the middle stance, the side stance, and the forward stance. The crawling tiger stance, in which the body is kept low in a ground-hugging position, is most common in Minang silek. Stances are essentially a combination of langkah, body posture, and movement. Through their correct application, the practitioner will be able to attack or defend whether standing, crouching, or sitting down, and alternate smoothly from one position to another. When the student has become familiar with stances and langkah, all are combined in forms or ''jurus''.\n\n===Forms===\n[[File:Silat betawi.jpg|thumb|A ''jurus'' in Silat Betawi]]\nForms or ''[[kata|jurus]]'' are pre-meditated sets of steps and movements used for practicing proper technique, training agility, and conditioning the body. Repetition of jurus also develops muscle memory so the practitioner can act and react correctly within a split-second in any given combative situation without having to think. Either armed or unarmed, jurus may be solo, one against one, one against several, or even two against more than one. Forms involving more than one practitioner are meant to be performed at the speed of an actual fight. Real weapons are used in the case of armed jurus, but are sometimes unsharpened today. The ''kembang'' (lit. \"flower\") aspect of forms consists of fluid movements with the hands and arms resembling traditional [[Indonesian dance]]. As with Korean [[taekkyeon|Taekkyon]], these movements are preparation for defending or reversing the opponent's attack. Musical accompaniment provides a metronome to indicate the rhythm of motion. For example, the beat of a drum might signify an attack. Those not aware of the combative nature of these moves often mistake the forms for dancing rather than the formalized training of fighting techniques.<ref name=\"Black Belt\"/>\n\n===Offense===\nPencak silat uses the whole body for attack. The basic strikes are the punch (''pukul'') and kick (''tendang''), with many variations in between. Strikes may be performed with the fists, open palms, shins, feet (''kaki''), elbows (''sikut''), knees (''dengkul'' or ''lutut''), shoulders (''bahu''), or the fingers (''jari''). Even basic attacks may vary depending on style, lineage, and regional origin.<ref name=\"PS Punch\">{{cite web|title=Pencak Silat Punch and Blocking Techniques |publisher=Google.com |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sundanesepencaksilat/lesson-description/body-basics |accessdate= 7 July 2015}}</ref> Some systems may favour punching with the clenched fist, while others might prefer slapping with the palm of the hand. Other common tactics include feints (''tipuan'') or deceptive blows used as distraction, sweeping (''sapuan'') to knock the opponent down, and the scissors takedown (''guntingan'') which grips the legs around the opponent.\n\n===Defense===\nDefense in pencak silat consists of blocking, dodging, deflecting, and countering. Blocks or ''tangkisan'' are the most basic form of defense.<ref name=\"PS Punch\"/> Because pencak silat may target any part of the body, blocks can be done with the forearms, hands, shoulders, or shins. Blocking with the elbows may even hurt the attacker. Attacks can also be used defensively, such as kneeing a kicking opponent's leg. Hard blocks, in which force is met with force, are most suitable when fighting opponents of the same strength or lower. Styles that rely on physical power favour this approach, such as Tenaga Dasar. To minimize any damage sustained by the defender when blocking in this way, body conditioning is used such as toughening the forearms by hitting them against hard surfaces. In cases where the opponent is of greater strength, evasion (''elakan'') or deflections (''pesongan'') would be used, and are actually preferred in certain styles.\n\n==International competitions==\nThe major international competition is Pencak Silat World Championship, organised by PERSILAT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persilat.org/Pencak_Silat_Regulation.htm|title=International Pencak Silat Competition Regulations|year=2004|publisher=PERSILAT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121125146/http://www.persilat.org/Pencak_Silat_Regulation.htm|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref> This competition takes place every 2 or 3 years period.

The [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''silat'' is linked to [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] word ''silek''. Due to Sumatran origin of the language, the Sumatran origin of the term is likely.<ref name=\"Martial Arts of the World-Silat\"/>\n\nAlthough the word ''[[silat]]'' is widely known throughout much of [[Southeast Asia]], the term ''pencak silat'' is used mainly in Indonesia. Pencak silat was chosen in 1948 as a unifying term for the Indonesian fighting styles. It was a compound of the two most commonly used words for martial arts in Indonesia. ''Pencak'' was the term used in central and east [[Java]], while ''silat'' was used in [[Sumatra]], [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Borneo]]. In [[Minangkabau language|Minang]] usage, pencak and silat are seen as being two aspects of the same practice. Pencak is the essence of training, the outward aspect of the art which a casual observer is permitted to witness as performance. Silat is the essence of combat and self-defense, the true fighting application of the techniques which are kept secret from outsiders and not divulged to students until the guru deems them ready. While other definitions exist, all agree that silat cannot exist without pencak, and pencak without silat skills is purposeless.<ref name=\"Alexander, et.al.1979\">{{cite book |title=Pentjak Silat: The Indonesian Fighting Art |last=Alexander |first=Howard |last2=Chambers |first2=Quintin |last3=Draeger |first3=Donn F. |author-link3=Donn F. Draeger |publisher=Tokyo, Japan : Kodansha International Ltd.|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the words ''pencak'' and ''silat'' have not been proven. Some believe that pencak comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''pancha'' meaning five, or from the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term ''pencha'' or ''pungcha'' which implies parrying or deflecting, and striking or pressing.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Malay Art Of Self-defense: Silat Seni Gayong |author=Sheikh Shamsuddin |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-55643-562-2}}</ref><br /> Other terms may be used in particular dialects such as ''silek'', ''penca'', ''mancak'', ''maen po'' or ''main-po''.\n\nDutch East Indian newspapers of the colonial era recorded the terms for martial arts under [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spellings.

At the request of the local people, he successfully killed the monarch Dewata Cengkar of [[Medang Kamulan]] in battle and took his place as ruler. This story traditionally marks the rise of Java and the dawn of its Dharmic civilisation. The tale also illustrates the influence India had on Indonesian and Southeast Asian culture in general. Aji Saka is shown to be a fighter and swordsman, while his servants are also depicted as fighting with daggers. The Indian method of knife-duelling was adapted by the [[Batak people|Batak]] and [[Bugis]]-[[Makassar people]]s. Ancient Indonesian art from this period also depicts warriors mounted on elephants wielding Chinese weapons such as the [[jian]] or straight double-edge sword, which is still used in Java.\n\nThe earliest evidence of pencak silat being taught in a structured manner comes from 6th-century<ref name=\"Wonderful\">{{cite web |title=Silek Harimau Minangkabau: the True Martial Art of West Sumatra |publisher=Wonderful Indonesia |url=http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/467/padang/article/74/silek-harimau-minangkabau-seni-bela-diri-minangkabau |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708113338/http://www.indonesia.travel/en/destination/467/padang/article/74/silek-harimau-minangkabau-seni-bela-diri-minangkabau |archivedate=8 July 2015 }}</ref> [[Riau]] from where it spread to the Minangkabau capital in [[West Sumatra]]. The Minangkabau had a clan-based feudal government. Military officers called ''hulubalang'' acted as bodyguards to the king or ''yam tuan''. Minang warriors served without pay. The plunder was divided among them according to military merit, so fighters strove to outdo each other. They were skilled horsemen with the [[list of Indonesian horse breeds|native pony]] and also expert bladesmiths, producing arms both for their own use and for export to Aceh. Traditional Minang society was based around matrilineal custom, so pencak silat was commonly practiced by women.<ref name=\"Draeger1992\"/> As pencak silat became widespread in [[Srivijaya]], the empire was defeated by the Tamil [[Chola]]s of [[south India]] in the 13th century. The Tamil stick fighting art of [[silambam]] is still the most common Indian fighting system in Southeast Asia today.\n\nDuring the 13th century, [[Ken Arok]], a thug turned into a self made hero and ruler, took over the power from [[Kediri Kingdom]] and established the [[Rajasa Dynasty]]. This is pretty much reflected the ''jago'' (people's champion) culture of ancient Java, where a self made cunning man skillful in martial arts, could rally supports and took over the kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilnjEF_7J_MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Para+Jagoan:+Dari+Ken+Arok+sampai+Kusni+Kasdut&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWl-exn_TbAhVIWX0KHVwHC0gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Para%20Jagoan:%20Dari%20Ken%20Arok%20sampai%20Kusni%20Kasdut&f=false|title=Para Jagoan: Dari Ken Arok sampai Kusni Kasdut|last=Matanasi|first=Petrik|date=2011-07-01|publisher=Trompet Book|isbn=9786029913118|language=id}}</ref> His successor, the warrior-king [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]] conquered the [[Melayu Kingdom]], [[Maluku Islands]], [[Bali]], and other neighbouring areas. From 1280-1289, [[Kublai Khan]] sent envoys demanding that Singhasari submit to the Khan as Jambi and Melayu had already done, but Kertanegara responded defiantly by scarring the last envoy's face. Kublai Khan retaliated by sending a punitive expedition of 1000 junks to Java, but Kertanegara had already been killed by a vassal in Kediri before the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] force arrived. His son-in-law [[Raden Wijaya]] replaced Kertanegara as leader and allied himself with the arriving Mongol army. With their help Raden Wijaya was able to defeat the Kediri forces. With his silat-trained warriors, Raden Wijaya then turned on the Mongols so that they fled back to [[China]]. The village he founded became the [[Majapahit]] empire. This was the first empire to unite all of [[Indonesia]]'s major islands, and pencak silat reached its technical zenith during this period. In Majapahit, pencak silat became the specialised property of the nobility and its advanced secrets were hidden from commoners.<ref name=\"Draeger1992\"/>\n\n===Colonial era===\n[[File:baliwarriors.jpg|thumb|[[Balinese people|Balinese]] warriors armed with [[kris]] in the 1880s]]\nThe lucrative spice trade eventually brought colonists from Europe, first the Portuguese followed by the Dutch and British. The [[Dutch East India Company]] became the dominant power and established full colonial rule in Indonesia. Local revolts and uprisings were common, but all were suppressed by the Dutch armed with guns and cannons. The Dutch brought in even more Chinese workers to Indonesia, which brought a greater variety of local [[kuntao]] systems. But while the Europeans could effectively overtake and hold the cities, they found it impossible to control the smaller villages and roads connecting them. Indonesians took advantage of this, fighting an underground war through guerilla tactics. Local weapons were recorded as being used against the Dutch, particularly knives and edged weapons such as the [[golok]], [[Parang (knife)|parang]], [[kris]] and [[klewang]].\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]] allied with the Dutch colonists to destroy [[Makassar|Mangkasara]] rule over the surrounding area. While this increased Bugis power in the southwest, Dutch rule deprived seafaring merchants like the Bugis of their traditional employment. As a result, these communities increasingly turned to piracy during the 17th-18th centuries. Not only was pencak silat practiced by the pirates, but new styles were created to combat them.\n\nDuring the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]] of the 18th and 19th century, the [[Cultivation System|exploitative social and economic condition]] of the colony created the culture of the ''jago'' or local people's champion regarded as thugs and bandits by the colonial administration. Parallels can be seen in the ''jawara'' of [[Priangan]], ''jagoan'' of Betawi, and ''warok'' in the [[Ponorogo]] region of East Java. The most infamous band of ''jagoan'' was the 19th century [[Si Pitung]] and Si Jampang, experts in Silat Betawi. Traditionally depicted as Robin Hood-like figures, they upheld justice for the common man by robbing from the rich who acquired power and status by collaborating with the colonists. The ''jago'' were despised by the Dutch authorities as criminals and thieves but were highly respected by the native [[pribumi]] and [[Indonesian Chinese|local Chinese]].\n\n===Modern era===\nConflict with the European rulers provided an impetus for the proliferation of new styles of pencak silat, now founded on the platform of nationalism and the desire for freedom from colonisation. The Indonesian Pencak Silat Association (IPSI) was founded in 1948 to bring all of Indonesia's pencak silat under a single administration. The world's oldest nationwide silat organisation, its basis is that all pencak silat is built on a common source, and that less functional styles must give way to the technically superior. IPSI has avoided the tendency of modern martial arts that gravitate towards sport. The resistance to sport has lessened over time, however, and sparring in particular has become less combative. While nominally an Indonesian organisation, many of the rules and regulations outlined by IPSI have become the de facto standard for [[silat]] competitions worldwide. Indo-Dutch Eurasians who first began practicing pencak silat in the 20th century<ref name=\"nieuwsdag\" /> spread the art to the west in the late 20th century.\n\nToday pencak silat is one of the extra-curricular activities taught in Indonesian schools. It is included as a combat sport in local, national and international athletic events such as the [[SEA Games]] and Indonesia's [[Pekan Olahraga Nasional|National Sports Week]]. Since 2012, the Pencak Malioboro Festival has been held annually and features demonstrations by the biggest silat schools in Indonesia. The art features prominently in the Hollywood blockbuster ''[[John Wick 3]]'', with masters [[Yayan Ruhian]] and [[Cecep Arif Rahman]] appearing against Wick in the penultimate fight.\n\n==Weapons==\n{{main|Weapons of silat}}\n[[File:Kerambit knife and sheath.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kerambit]]]]\nAs with most ancient fighting arts, pencak silat historically prioritized weapons over unarmed combat. While this is usually not the case today, all pencak silat schools include weapons to some degree of importance. While pencak silat includes a wide array of weapons, the following are considered standard in all classical styles. In addition to these, many systems include a specialty or \"secret\" weapon taught only to advanced students.\n\n* '''''Toya''''': Staff usually made of [[rattan]] but sometimes wood or metal. Typically measures 5\u20136 feet long and 1.5-2 inches in diameter.\n* '''''Tombak/Lembing''''': Spear or javelin made of bamboo, steel or wood that sometimes has horsehair attached near the blade.\n* '''''[[Parang (knife)|Parang]]''''': Machete-like chopper, ranging from 10 to 36 inches long\n*'''''[[Golok]]''''': Heavy cleaver measuring 10-20 inches long. The blade is heaviest in the centre\n* '''''Pisau''''': Any short-bladed knife\n* '''''[[Kris]]''''': Double-edged dagger made by folding different types of metal together and then washing it in acid.\n* '''''[[Kama (weapon)|Sabit]]/Celurit''''': A sickle, commonly used in farming, cultivation and harvesting of crops.\n* '''''Tongkat/Galah''''': Short stick or cudgel\n* '''''Pedang''''': Sword, most often single-edged and either straight or slightly curved. Usually measures 15-35 inches overall with a blade upward of 10 inches long\n*'''''[[Klewang]]''''': Single-edge longsword with a protruding notch near its tip\n* '''''[[tekpi|Chabang]]''''': Short-handled trident, literally meaning \"branch\"\n* '''''[[Selendang]]''''': A silk that can be used for strangling, grappling and whipping\n* '''''[[Kerambit]]''''': A small curved knife resembling a claw.\n\n==Styles and schools==\n{{further|Styles of silat}}\nOver 150 styles of [[pencak silat]] are recognised in [[Indonesia]],<ref name=\"JP1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/05/passing-a-legacy.html|title=Passing on a legacy|author=Ika Krismantari|date=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132711/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/05/passing-a-legacy.html|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=|location=Jakarta}}</ref> although the actual number of existing systems is well beyond that. Older methods are typically identified with specific ethno-cultural groups or particular regions.\n\n===Riau===\nMuch of what constitutes classical Malay culture has its origin in the [[Riau]] Archipelago, including the earliest evidence of silat. Referred to as [[silat Melayu]], the regional fighting systems of Riau have influenced nearly the entirety of [[Indonesia]]n pencak silat, and into neighbouring [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. Fighting tactics dating back to the [[Srivijaya]] empire persist in [[Palembang]] today. Wide stances with the front foot turned slightly inward are typical, developed for fighting on Riau's muddy ground, while also preventing the knee joint from being exposed to frontal kicks. Seizing techniques which grab the arm are common. The most prominent weapons in silat Melayu are the staff (''toya'') and the spear. Spear forms in Riau usually begin with the blade pointed downward. Staff technique in silat Melayu of the Palembang area is said to be the best in all of Indonesian pencak silat. The weapon is made of wood and usually measures seven feet long. Fixed hand positions with very little sliding along the staff is characteristic of silat Melayu.\n\n===Minangkabau===\n[[File:Silek Harimau.jpg|thumb|right|A demonstration of the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] style of silat.]]\n[[File:Randai Padang Panjang.jpg|thumb|right|Minangkabau ''[[randai]]'' performance, incorporating some Minang ''silek'' movements.]]\nThe [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] formed the dominant sovereignty in West Sumatra and make up the majority of Sumatran pencak silat systems. These styles may be referred to as ''silat Minangkabau'', ''silat Padang'' (lit. field silat), or ''silek'', the local pronunciation of silat. Very few systems in Indonesia have not been influenced by silek, and its techniques form the core of pencak silat throughout Sumatra. It developed as an extension of the original silat Melayu from Riau. Folklore traces this to five masters, namely Ninik Datuak Suri Dirajo from [[Padang Panjang]], Kambiang Utan (\"forest goat\") from [[Cambodia]], Harimau Campo (\"tiger of [[Champa]]\") from [[Vietnam]], Kuciang Siam (\"[[Siamese cat]]\") from [[Thailand]] and Anjiang Mualim (\"teacher dog\") from [[Gujarat]].<ref>Thesis: ''Seni Silat Melayu'' by Abd Rahman Ismail (USM 2005 matter 188)</ref><ref>Djamal, Mid. Filsafat dan Silsilah Aliran-Aliran Silat Minangkabau. Penerbit CV. Tropic - Bukittinggi.1986</ref> Stealth and ambush were the preferred Minang war tactics, and they were said to be among the best assassins in the world when dispatched singly. Silek Minangkabau is characterised by its low stances and reliance on kicks and leg tactics. The low stance is said to have developed to offset the chance of falling on slippery ground, common in the rice fields of West Sumatra. The local practice of paddling rafts with the legs strengthened fighters' lower body muscles. Hand and arm movements are fast, honed through an exercise in which the exponent stands across from a partner tossing sharpened sticks or knives. The practitioner must redirect the sticks or knives and send them back at the thrower, using their hands and a minimum of movements with the rest of the body.\n\nThere are currently around ten major styles of silek, a few of which like Silek Lintau are commonly practiced even in Malaysia. IPSI recognises Silek Harimau (tiger silek) as among the oldest pencak silat in existence. Silek Harimau, also known as ''silek kuciang'' or cat silek, epitomizes the Minang techniques in that it focuses on crouching and kicking from a low position paired with rapid hand attacks. Sitaralak imitates the power of a herd of stampeding [[elephant]]s. Developed as a counter to silek Harimau, folklore tells that its practitioners were able to fight tigers. Sandang is the counter-system to Sitaralak, which defends against powerful attacks by misdirection. Kumango is another characteristically Minang system in its kicks and footwork. Its frequent thigh-slapping and [[taiji]]-like redirection maneuvers indicate both Indian and Chinese influence. Silek Tuo is considered by some to be the oldest Minang system due to its name meaning \"old silek\", but others claim it traces to the freedom fighter Tuanku Nan Tuo after whom it was named. All the classical pencak silat weapons are used in silek but the most prominent Minang weapons are the ''pedang'' (sword), ''tumbak'' (spear), ''[[kris|karih]]'' (dagger), ''[[klewang]]'' (longsword), ''[[kama (weapon)|sabik]]'' (sickle), ''payung'' (umbrella), ''[[kerambit|kurambik]]'' (claw), and various types of knives.\n\n===Java===\n[[File:Persaudaraan Setia Hati Terate - Tendangan terbang.jpg|thumb|right|Flying kick by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] style of silat at [[Barong Temple]], [[Yogyakarta]].]]\nFrom [[Srivijaya]], pencak silat quickly spread eastward into the Javanese [[Sailendra]] and [[Medang Kingdom]]s where the fighting arts developed in three geographical regions: [[West Java]], [[Central Java]], and [[East Java]]. Today [[Java]] is home to more styles of pencak silat than any other Indonesian island, and displays the greatest diversity of techniques. Many Javanese schools such as [[Perisai Diri]] and [[Inti Ombak]] have been established internationally in Asia, Europe and America. Merpati Putih or \"white dove\" style was developed in the [[keraton]] (royal courts) of 17th century [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and was not taught publicly until 1963.<ref name=\"MPSejarah\">{{cite web|title=Sejarah Merpati Putih |publisher=PPS Betako Merpati Putih, Pewaris - Pengurus Pusat |url=http://www.ppsbetakomerpatiputih.com/index.php# |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> Today it is the standard unarmed martial art of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"TNI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.mil.id/view-19916-koarmatim-siap-tarung.html|title=KOARMATIM Siap Tarung|publisher=Tentara Nasional Indonesia|language=Indonesian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608152810/http://www.tni.mil.id/view-19916-koarmatim-siap-tarung.html|archive-date=June 8, 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It includes weapons but focuses more on empty-handed self-defense and the development of internal strength developed through [[breathing technique]]s.<ref name=\"MP\">{{cite web|title=Merpati Putih |publisher=PPS Betako Merpati Putih, Pewaris - Pengurus Pusat |url=http://www.ppsbetakomerpatiputih.com/index.php |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> Pencak silat in Java draws from traditional [[kejawen]] and Hindu-Buddhist [[Javanese beliefs]] but after Indonesia's independence, some schools have adapted themselves in the context of modern religion.<ref name=\"Patzold2011\">{{cite book| title=Self-Defense and Music in Muslim Context in West Java in Divine Inspirations: Music and Islam in Indonesia|author=Uwe Patzold |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford, UK : Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538541-0}}</ref> Among the most popular modern styles is the Muslim-directed [[Tapak Suci]]. An evasive long-range system, it requires constant movement as the practitioner rotates on their own axis every few seconds. Similarly the Setia Hati school is Christian-organised. Rooted in silek Minangkabau of the [[Padang]] area, it relies on kicks and footwork while the hands are mainly used defensively for blocking and parrying.\n\n===Sunda===\nJava's western region was the first area from which pencak silat spread out of Sumatra. The [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] pencak silat of [[West Java]] may be called ''silat Sunda'' or ''silat Bandung''. In the [[Sundanese language]] they are generically referred to as ''penca'' (dialect form of pencak), ''ameng'', ''ulin'' or ''maen po'' (from the word ''main'' meaning \"play\"). Ameng is the more respectful term, while ulin and maen po are of lower speech levels. Sunda systems are easily identified by the prefix ''ci'' (spelled \"tji\" by the Dutch). Pronounced \"chi\", it comes from the Sundanese word ''cai'' meaning river water, alluding to the fact that they were originally developed in river-basin areas. The deep, wide stance and resulting gait attests to this, owing to the practice of carefully placing the feet from a lifted position onto wet ground. Today, systems of Sunda derivation prefixed with ''ci'' are found even in the high plateaus and mountain ranges of both West and Central Java. Penca instruction was traditionally done through apprenticeship, wherein prospective students offer to work as a servant in the master's house or a labourer in the rice fields. In exchange for working during the day, the master provides the student's meals and trains during the evening. Penca is characterized by reliance on hand and arm movements for both attack and defense. Compared to other Javanese systems, Sunda styles have less frontal contact with the opponent, instead preferring to evade in a circular manner and attack from the side. In one form of training designed to practice circular evasion, victory is attained simply by touching the opponent's torso. Fasting and [[mantra]] were traditionally used to heighten the senses for this purpose. \n\nThe oldest styles of penca were based on animals and movements of farming or tending the fields. IPSI recognises ''Cimacan'' (tiger style), ''Ciular'' (snake style), and ''Pamonyet'' (monkey style) as among the oldest existing pencak silat. Cimacan is said to have been created by a Buddhist monk.  The most prominent system of West Java is ''penca Cimande'', first taught publicly by a [[Baduy people|Badui]] man named Embah Kahir in Cimande village of the [[Sukabumi]] area around 1760.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cimande |publisher=Cimande France |url=http://www.cimandefrance.com/?page_id=43 |accessdate= 8 July 2015}}</ref> Cimande among the isolationist [[Baduy people|Badui community]] is said to be much older than Embah Kahir, and is believed by many masters to be the original penca of West Java tracing back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Cimande is a close-quarters system, with the elbows held close to the body. Students begin by learning to fight from a seated position before they are taught footwork. Arms are traditionally conditioned through smashing [[coconuts]], by concentrating the force of the blow into the wrist. Cimande always assumes there is a minimum of three enemies, but advanced students may spar with up to twelve opponents. As a defensive art, Cimande has no lethal techniques. The town of [[Cianjur]] - seen as the heartland of Sunda culture - is associated with a few systems, the most prominent of them being ''Cikalong'' or bat style. Borrowing its technical base from Cimande, Cikalong was founded by Raden Jayaperbata after meditating in a cave in the Cikalong Kulon village. While Cimande may attack with either the fists or open hands, Cikalong prefers the latter. Prominent Sunda weapons include the ''toya'' (staff), ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), long-bladed ''[[parang (knife)|parang]]'' (machete) and heavy ''[[golok]]'' (cleaver). The advanced weapon is the ''piau'' or throwing knife.\n\n===Betawi===\n[[File:Pencak Silat Betawi 1.jpg|right|thumb|Silat Betawi demonstration in [[Jakarta]]]]\nAmong the [[Betawi people]] of [[Greater Jakarta]], the pencak silat tradition is rooted in the culture of the ''jagoan'' or ''jawara'', local champions seen as heroes of the common people. They went against colonial authority and were despised by the Dutch as thugs and bandits. Silat Betawi is referred to in the local dialect as ''maen pukulan'' or ''main pukulan'', literally meaning \"strike-play\". The most well-known schools are [[Cingkrik]], [[Kwitang silat|Kwitang]], and [[Beksi]]. The acrobatic monkey-inspired Cingkrik is likely the oldest, the name implying agile movement. The art is said to trace back to a monkey style of [[kuntao]] attributed to Rama Isruna after his wife observed the actions of monkeys. A student of this kuntao named Ki Maing later expanded on the system after a monkey stole his walking stick. [[Cingkrik]] is highly evasive; blows are delivered as a counter after parrying or blocking, and usually target the face, throat and groin. Attacks mimic the grabbing and tearing actions of monkeys. [[Kwitang silat|Kwitang]] also employs evasion and some open-hand strikes but its focus is on powerful punches with the fist tightly-closed at the moment of impact, mainly targeting the centreline. Force is concentrated into the knuckles of the little and ring finger. Attacks are made with a curved arm; the elbow is never fully extended so as to prevent being caught in a joint lock. [[Beksi]], meaning \"defense of four directions\", is credited to a man named Lie Cheng Hok. It is distinguishable from other Betawi systems by its close-distance combat style and lack of offensive leg action. Silat Betawi includes all the classical pencak silat weapons, but places particular emphasis on the [[parang (knife)|parang]] (machete), [[golok]] (chopper), ''toya'' (staff), and ''pisau'' (knife). Kwitang practitioners are said to be the best [[tekpi|chabang]] fighters in Indonesia.<ref>{{citenews|title =Betawi pencak silat adapts to modern times | author =Nathalie Abigail Budiman |newspaper =The Jakarta Post | location =Jakarta | date = 1 August 2015 |url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/01/betawi-pencak-silat-adapts-modern-times.html|accessdate = 10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bali===\n[[File: Bali Silat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bhakti negara (Pencak silat of Bali)]]\nFollowing the invasion by Demak, many families of the Majapahit empire fled to Bali. The descendants of the Majapahit were traditionally resistant to outside influence and as a result, the people of Bali often make a distinction between \"pure\" Balinese pencak silat and styles introduced from outside such as Perisai Diri. The native systems - known locally as pencak - are ultimately rooted in those of Java, and preserve tactics dating back to the Majapahit empire. They are less direct than other styles, characteristically favouring deception over aggression. Hand movements are used to distract, and openings are deliberately exposed to bluff the opponent into attacking. This approach requires that exponents train their flexibility and stamina. As with Balinese warriors of the past, modern pencak practitioners in Bali often wear headbands as part of their uniform.\n\nThere are about four main systems considered purely Balinese. The most prominent of these is [[Bakti Negara]], which is firmly rooted in the old [[Balinese Hinduism|local Hindu philosophy]] of [[Tri Hita Karana]].<ref name =\"BN\">{{cite web|title =Tentang Bakti Negara | publisher = Bakti Negara |url =http://baktinegara.com/about-us/#translate-en | language =Indonesian | accessdate =10 August 2015}}</ref> Another system which has gained prominence is Seruling Dewata meaning \"God's flute\". Purported to date back to ancient times, it recognizes the Indian Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]] as the first patriarch, though not its creator. Eka Sentosa Setiti (ESSTI) was the first pencak silat association officially founded in Bali. Created and practiced in the island's south, it draws heavily from southern [[Shaolinquan|Saolim kuntao]]. The primary stance is the ''ting'' posture of kuntao, also the main stance of Japanese [[aikido]]. ESSTI keeps membership low and does not permit outsiders to view sparring matches. Finally, the Tridharma style is practiced in northern Bali. It utilizes circular hand movements and straight kicks. The ESSTI and Tridharma schools often exchange students so cross-training between the styles is common. All Balinese pencak schools traditionally keep sportive contests and performance to a minimum in order to emphasise combat effectiveness.\n\n===Bugis-Makassar===\nThe [[Bugis]] (''Ugi'') and [[Makassar people]] (''Mangkasara'') are two related maritime groups from [[Sulawesi]]. The Bugis in particular were renowned navigators and shipbuilders, but also feared as corsairs and slave-traders. Both the Bugis and Makassarese were famous for piracy, though this was more common among the former than the latter. As sailors for whom the knife is a vital tool, Bugis and Makassar combatives (known locally as silat) favour blades. The primary weapon is an indigenous knife called the [[badik]]. Other weapons include the ''[[kris|sele]]'' (dagger), ''[[parang (knife)|berang]]'' (machete), ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), and the ''mandau'' (cleaver). Silat in Sulawesi is closely tied to local animism, and weapons are believed to be imbued with a spirit of their own. Hand and arm movements are designed to be adaptable for use with a knife or with the empty hands. Attacks with the fists or open hands can be modified with a pinching action of the fingers, which has its origin in the pinch-grip of the badik. Bugis styles (''silat Ugi'') are based on these hand and arm movements and contain only limited kicks, almost all of the linear variety. The Bugis ''kekuda'' is identical to the southern Chinese [[horse stance]]. Styles from southwestern Sulawesi generally come under the Makassar category (''silat Mangkasara''). Chief among them are the [[kuntao]]-influenced tiger style Karena Macang and the kick-based Manca Tonaja from southern Sulawesi, which is believed to have Minang roots. The mangrove swamps and rocky inlets along the coasts of Sulawesi served as hiding places for pirates, so silat among the Bugis and Makasar community makes use of and defends against ambush. Countering surprise attacks is the specialty of Silat Tapu, a secretive system taught only to experienced practitioners.\n\n===Aceh===\nLocated on Sumatra's northwest coast on the westernmost tip of the archipelago, Aceh was the first port of call for traders sailing the Indian Ocean. Local culture and weapons (particularly knives) show distinct Indian-Muslim derivation. Unlike the more typical rattan shield, the Acehnese buckler is identical to the Indian [[dhal (shield)]], made from metal and with five or seven knobs on the surface. The Acehnese are recorded by both Indonesian and European sources as being the most warlike people in all of Sumatra, and this is reflected in the highly-aggressive nature of their pencak silat. Acehnese pencak silat borrows its foundation from silat Melayu and silek Minangkabau, particularly the arm-seizing techniques of the former and the ground-sitting postures of the latter. Bladed weaponry is favoured, specifically knives and swords. The primary weapon is the [[rencong]], an L-shaped dagger used mainly for thrusting but also for slashing. The [[kris]] is used as well but the native rencong takes precedence.\n\n===Batak===\nBatak land is situated between the Minangkabau to the south and Aceh to the north, and the culture shows both Indian and Chinese influence. The word [[Batak]] refers to a number of ethnic groups originally from the mountains of [[North Sumatra]]. The term typically refers to the [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]] while others may explicitly reject that label, preferring to identify themselves by their specific group. Batak silat is known by different names in each community, namely ''mossak'' (Toba), ''moncak'' ([[Mandailing]]), ''ndikar'' ([[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]) and ''dihar'' ([[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]]). Mossak is the most commonly-used due to the Toba being the most numerous. While each style is distinct, all share similar characteristics and weaponry. The Batak were historically in a near-perpetual state of warfare with their neighbours, so warriors trained daily for combat. Training was either done outdoors or in the ''balai'', a building in the [[kampung]] specifically made for combat practice. Batak silat is primarily armed, employing such weapons as the spear, single-edge blade, and a short-bladed knife known as the ''raut''. The raut is similar to the [[badik]] both in appearance and in its pinch-grip. The most common target is the opponent's midsection. The weapon is held loosely and used in an upward or downward hacking motion. Once the raut has pierced the enemy, the fighter pushes the knife further in with a palm strike. Unarmed techniques are derived from silek Minangkabau, as the kicks and footwork are well-suited to the mountainous Batak country.\n\n===Maluku===\nPencak silat in the [[Maluku Islands]] uses a wide variety of weaponry, some of which are indigenous to the area. The particular specialty of Moluccan silat is the ''[[tekpi|cabang]]'' (forked truncheon), ''pisau'' (knife), and the wooden or metal ''galah'' (staff). The local ''pedang'' (sword) is long-bladed and associated with female fighters. On [[Haruku Island]], particular emphasis is placed on one-legged stances. This tactic was developed for fighting in the ankle-deep sands of the islands, allowing the exponent to use both kicking and eye-gouging techniques simultaneously.\n\n===Bajau===\nThe [[Sama-Bajau peoples|Bajau]] are a seafaring people of [[Sulawesi]]. Often nomadic, they were traditionally born and raised on longboats at sea although this is increasingly exceptional as the community has been forced to settle on land in recent decades. Colonial records often mistook them for pirates but - unlike the neighbouring Bugis - the Bajau lacked the organization and technology for piracy. In fact, they more often clashed with pirates than engaging in raids themselves. Their main and often only weapon was the fishing spear, which functioned as a hunting tool on land. The Bajau utilized a wide array of these harpoons as weapons both thrown and unthrown. Their aim was impeccable, having been honed by fishing and hunting. The spear may be of ''nibong'' wood or [[bamboo]], single-pronged or three-pronged, barbed or unbarbed, and tipped with wood or steel. Contact with the southern [[Philippines]] and the [[sultanate of Sulu|Sulu sultanate]] of Borneo allowed the Bajau to acquire other weapons through barter, specifically swords, shields, lances and [[parang]]. The most notable Bajau style of pencak silat is centered in [[Kendari]]. It is characterized by cross-legged stances and rapid turning, designed to be used in cramped spaces such as boats.\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:Pencak Silat Betawi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Disarming a [[golok]]]]\nGeneralizations in pencak silat technique are very difficult; styles and movements are as diverse as the Indonesian archipelago itself. Individual disciplines can be offensive as in Aceh, evasive as in Bali, or somewhere in between. They may focus on strikes (''pukulan''), kicks (''tendangan''), locks (''kuncian''), weapons (''senjata''), or even on spiritual development rather than physical fighting techniques. Most styles specialize in one or two of these, but still make use of them all to some degree. Certain characteristics tend to prevail in particular geographical regions, as follows:\n\n*'''Kicks''' - [[West Sumatra]], [[North Sumatra]]\n*'''Hands/Arms''' - [[West Java]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Kalimantan]]\n*'''Grappling''' - [[East Java]], [[Sumatra]]\n*'''Strikes''' (hands and feet) - [[Bali]], [[Central Java]], [[Madura]]\n\n===Stances and steps===\nStudents begin by learning basic body stances and steps. Steps or dancing sweep fan''langkah'' are ways of moving the feet from one point to another during a fight. Pencak silat has several basic steps, known as ''langkah 8 penjuru'' or \"eight directions of steps\". Traditional music is often used as a signal to change body position when practicing langkah.<ref name=\"PS Body Basic\">{{cite web|title=Pencak Silat Body Basics |publisher=Google.com |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sundanesepencaksilat/lesson-description/body-basics-1 |accessdate= 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nLangkah are taught in conjunction with preset stances, meant to provide a foundation from which to defend oneself or to launch attacks. The most basic stance is the [[horse stance]] (''kekuda'' or ''kuda-kuda''), which provides stability and firm body position by strengthening the quads. Other stances may train the feet, legs, thighs, glutes and back. Other essential stances are the middle stance, the side stance, and the forward stance. The crawling tiger stance, in which the body is kept low in a ground-hugging position, is most common in Minang silek. Stances are essentially a combination of langkah, body posture, and movement. Through their correct application, the practitioner will be able to attack or defend whether standing, crouching, or sitting down, and alternate smoothly from one position to another. When the student has become familiar with stances and langkah, all are combined in forms or ''jurus''.\n\n===Forms===\n[[File:Silat betawi.jpg|thumb|A ''jurus'' in Silat Betawi]]\nForms or ''[[kata|jurus]]'' are pre-meditated sets of steps and movements used for practicing proper technique, training agility, and conditioning the body. Repetition of jurus also develops muscle memory so the practitioner can act and react correctly within a split-second in any given combative situation without having to think. Either armed or unarmed, jurus may be solo, one against one, one against several, or even two against more than one. Forms involving more than one practitioner are meant to be performed at the speed of an actual fight. Real weapons are used in the case of armed jurus, but are sometimes unsharpened today. The ''kembang'' (lit. \"flower\") aspect of forms consists of fluid movements with the hands and arms resembling traditional [[Indonesian dance]]. As with Korean [[taekkyeon|Taekkyon]], these movements are preparation for defending or reversing the opponent's attack. Musical accompaniment provides a metronome to indicate the rhythm of motion. For example, the beat of a drum might signify an attack. Those not aware of the combative nature of these moves often mistake the forms for dancing rather than the formalized training of fighting techniques.<ref name=\"Black Belt\"/>\n\n===Offense===\nPencak silat uses the whole body for attack. The basic strikes are the punch (''pukul'') and kick (''tendang''), with many variations in between. Strikes may be performed with the fists, open palms, shins, feet (''kaki''), elbows (''sikut''), knees (''dengkul'' or ''lutut''), shoulders (''bahu''), or the fingers (''jari''). Even basic attacks may vary depending on style, lineage, and regional origin.<ref name=\"PS Punch\">{{cite web|title=Pencak Silat Punch and Blocking Techniques |publisher=Google.com |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sundanesepencaksilat/lesson-description/body-basics |accessdate= 7 July 2015}}</ref> Some systems may favour punching with the clenched fist, while others might prefer slapping with the palm of the hand. Other common tactics include feints (''tipuan'') or deceptive blows used as distraction, sweeping (''sapuan'') to knock the opponent down, and the scissors takedown (''guntingan'') which grips the legs around the opponent.\n\n===Defense===\nDefense in pencak silat consists of blocking, dodging, deflecting, and countering. Blocks or ''tangkisan'' are the most basic form of defense.<ref name=\"PS Punch\"/> Because pencak silat may target any part of the body, blocks can be done with the forearms, hands, shoulders, or shins. Blocking with the elbows may even hurt the attacker. Attacks can also be used defensively, such as kneeing a kicking opponent's leg. Hard blocks, in which force is met with force, are most suitable when fighting opponents of the same strength or lower. Styles that rely on physical power favour this approach, such as Tenaga Dasar. To minimize any damage sustained by the defender when blocking in this way, body conditioning is used such as toughening the forearms by hitting them against hard surfaces. In cases where the opponent is of greater strength, evasion (''elakan'') or deflections (''pesongan'') would be used, and are actually preferred in certain styles.\n\n==International competitions==\nThe major international competition is Pencak Silat World Championship, organised by PERSILAT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persilat.org/Pencak_Silat_Regulation.htm|title=International Pencak Silat Competition Regulations|year=2004|publisher=PERSILAT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121125146/http://www.persilat.org/Pencak_Silat_Regulation.htm|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref> This competition takes place every 2 or 3 years period.

At the age of ten, he made a commercial for [[British Columbia Hydro]], with [[Gilda Radner]] playing his mother.<ref name=\"tiscali1\"/> At 12, he made a guest appearance as Ari on the TV series ''[[King of Kensington]]''.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Myers was accepted into [[The Second City]] Canadian touring company. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]], and in 1985 he was one of the founding members of [[The Comedy Store Players]], an improvisational group based at [[The Comedy Store (London)|The Comedy Store]] in London.\n\nThe next year, he starred in the British children's TV program [[Wide Awake Club (television)|'' Wide Awake Club'']], parodying the show's normal exuberance with his own \"Sound Asleep Club\", in partnership with [[Neil Mullarkey]].\n\nHe returned to [[Toronto]] and [[The Second City]] in 1986 as a cast member in The Second City's Toronto main stage show, [[Second City Theatre]].<ref name=ott>{{Cite web|title = Mike Myers|url = http://www.secondcity.com/people/other/mike-myers/|website = [[The Second City]]|accessdate = May 31, 2015}}</ref> In 1988, he moved from Second City in Toronto to [[Chicago]]. In Chicago, he trained, performed, and taught at the [[Improv Olympic]].\n\nMyers made many appearances, including as Wayne Campbell, on Toronto's [[Citytv]] in the early 1980s, on the alternative video show ''[[City Limits (TV series)|City Limits]]'' hosted by [[Christopher Ward (songwriter)|Christopher Ward]]; Myers also made several appearances after the launch of [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], for which ''City Limits'' was essentially the prototype. Myers also appeared as Wayne Campbell in the music video for Ward's Canadian hit \"Boys and Girls\".\n\nThe Wayne Campbell character was featured extensively in the 1986 summer series ''[[It's Only Rock & Roll (TV series)|It's Only Rock & Roll]]'', produced by Toronto's Insight Production Company for [[CBC Television]]. Wayne appeared both in-studio and in a series of location sketches directed and edited by [[Allan Novak]]. Myers wrote another sketch, \"Kurt and Dieter\", co-starring with Second City's [[Dana Andersen]] and also directed by Novak, which would later turn into the popular \"[[Sprockets (Saturday Night Live)|Sprockets]]\" sketch on ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\n===Film===\nMyers made his film debut when he and [[Dana Carvey]] adapted their [[Wayne's World]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) sketches into the feature ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992). It was among the most successful films of the year and was followed in 1993 by ''[[Wayne's World 2]]''; Myers starred in ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' the same year.

He moved to the [[United Kingdom]], and in 1985 he was one of the founding members of [[The Comedy Store Players]], an improvisational group based at [[The Comedy Store (London)|The Comedy Store]] in London.\n\nThe next year, he starred in the British children's TV program [[Wide Awake Club (television)|'' Wide Awake Club'']], parodying the show's normal exuberance with his own \"Sound Asleep Club\", in partnership with [[Neil Mullarkey]].\n\nHe returned to [[Toronto]] and [[The Second City]] in 1986 as a cast member in The Second City's Toronto main stage show, [[Second City Theatre]].<ref name=ott>{{Cite web|title = Mike Myers|url = http://www.secondcity.com/people/other/mike-myers/|website = [[The Second City]]|accessdate = May 31, 2015}}</ref> In 1988, he moved from Second City in Toronto to [[Chicago]]. In Chicago, he trained, performed, and taught at the [[Improv Olympic]].\n\nMyers made many appearances, including as Wayne Campbell, on Toronto's [[Citytv]] in the early 1980s, on the alternative video show ''[[City Limits (TV series)|City Limits]]'' hosted by [[Christopher Ward (songwriter)|Christopher Ward]]; Myers also made several appearances after the launch of [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], for which ''City Limits'' was essentially the prototype. Myers also appeared as Wayne Campbell in the music video for Ward's Canadian hit \"Boys and Girls\".\n\nThe Wayne Campbell character was featured extensively in the 1986 summer series ''[[It's Only Rock & Roll (TV series)|It's Only Rock & Roll]]'', produced by Toronto's Insight Production Company for [[CBC Television]]. Wayne appeared both in-studio and in a series of location sketches directed and edited by [[Allan Novak]]. Myers wrote another sketch, \"Kurt and Dieter\", co-starring with Second City's [[Dana Andersen]] and also directed by Novak, which would later turn into the popular \"[[Sprockets (Saturday Night Live)|Sprockets]]\" sketch on ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\n===Film===\nMyers made his film debut when he and [[Dana Carvey]] adapted their [[Wayne's World]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) sketches into the feature ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992). It was among the most successful films of the year and was followed in 1993 by ''[[Wayne's World 2]]''; Myers starred in ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' the same year. He took a two-year hiatus from performing after the end of his time as an ''SNL'' regular.\n\nMyers returned to acting with the film ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997), followed by the sequels ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' (1999) and ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002). Myers played the title role ([[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]]), the villain ([[Dr. Evil]]), a henchman ([[Fat Bastard]]) and another villain (Goldmember) in all three films.\n\nOne of Myers' rare non-comedic roles came in the film ''[[54 (film)|54]]'' (1998), in which he portrayed [[Steve Rubell]], proprietor of [[New York City]]'s famous 1970s [[discotheque]] [[Studio 54]].
