It has a [[masthead sloop]] rig with [[anodized]] [[aluminum]] spars and steel rod [[standing rigging]] for the three spreader mast. The design has a [[raked stem]], a [[reverse transom]], a spade-type [[rudder]] controlled by a [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] and a fixed fin [[keel]]. It displaces {{convert|14992|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and carries {{convert|6173|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of lead ballast.<ref name=\"Data\"/><ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe boat has a draft of {{convert|7.17|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the standard keel fitted.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe boat is fitted with a Japanese [[Yanmar]] [[diesel engine]] of {{convert|34|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds {{convert|33|u.s.gal}} and the fresh water tank has a capacity of {{convert|50|u.s.gal}}.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe cruising interior configuration provides sleeping accommodation for four people. There is an aft cabin under the cockpit with a king-sized berth and a bow cabin, with a \"V\"-berth. The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] is located on the starboard side at the foot of the [[companionway]] steps. It features a [[gimballed]] [[propane]]-fired stove and a [[stainless steel]] icebox and sink, with foot-pumped fresh water and sea water. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located amidships, opposite the galley, on the port side and includes a shower. It is accessible from the aft cabin and the saloon. A second head forward was a factory option. The saloon has two curved settees and a table with the keel-stepped mast passing through it. A navigation station is on the port side forward of the head.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nFor sailing there are winches for the mainsail, [[genoa (sail)|genoa]] and [[spinnaker]] internally-mounted [[halyard]]s, as well as for the [[mainsheet]]. There are [[Sheet (sailing)|sheeting]] winches for the genoa and spinnaker on each side of the cockpit, plus additional winches for the [[Cunningham (sailing)|Cunningham]] and for the [[Reefing|slab reefing]].<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe design has an IOR racing handicap of 25.7.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \"Baltic is a Finnish builder, and the 40, with its winged keel, is designed for both racing and cruising.

It has a [[masthead sloop]] rig with [[anodized]] [[aluminum]] spars and steel rod [[standing rigging]] for the three spreader mast. The design has a [[raked stem]], a [[reverse transom]], a spade-type [[rudder]] controlled by a [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] and a fixed fin [[keel]]. It displaces {{convert|14992|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and carries {{convert|6173|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of lead ballast.<ref name=\"Data\"/><ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe boat has a draft of {{convert|7.17|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the standard keel fitted.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe boat is fitted with a Japanese [[Yanmar]] [[diesel engine]] of {{convert|34|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds {{convert|33|u.s.gal}} and the fresh water tank has a capacity of {{convert|50|u.s.gal}}.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe cruising interior configuration provides sleeping accommodation for four people. There is an aft cabin under the cockpit with a king-sized berth and a bow cabin, with a \"V\"-berth. The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] is located on the starboard side at the foot of the [[companionway]] steps. It features a [[gimballed]] [[propane]]-fired stove and a [[stainless steel]] icebox and sink, with foot-pumped fresh water and sea water. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located amidships, opposite the galley, on the port side and includes a shower. It is accessible from the aft cabin and the saloon. A second head forward was a factory option. The saloon has two curved settees an a tablem with the keel-stepped mast passing through it. A navigation station is on the port side forward of the head.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nFor sailing there are winches for the mainsail, [[genoa (sail)|genoa]] and [[spinnaker]] internally-mounted [[halyard]]s, as well as for the [[mainsheet]]. There are [[Sheet (sailing)|sheeting]] winches for the genoa and spinnaker on each side of the cockpit, plus additional winches for the [[Cunningham (sailing)|Cunningham]] and for the [[Reefing|slab reefing]].<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe design has an IOR racing handicap of 25.7.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \"Baltic is a Finnish builder, and the 40, with its winged keel, is designed for both racing and cruising. The boat looks fast, and is, but notice that sleeping space is limited in the cruising version ... A second layout is available for a crew of nine.

It first flew on 4 November 1998 and was delivered to Cathay Pacific three weeks later on 25 November 1998.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/>\n\n==Accident==\nCathay Pacific Flight 780 started at Stand No.8 at [[Juanda International Airport]]. It took off from runway 28 at 08:24 local time (01:24 UTC). During the climb, both engines had small [[engine pressure ratio]] (EPR, a measure of the amount of thrust output) fluctuations, with No. 2 engine fluctuating over a greater range than No. 1 engine.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/> Just over half-an-hour after takeoff, when the aircraft was at its cruising altitude of [[Flight level]] (FL) 390 (about {{convert|39000|ft|m}} above sea level), the [[Electronic Flight Instrument System|Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring]] (ECAM) system displayed an \"ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT\" message.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/> The crew contacted the airline engineering department's Maintenance Control (MC) and discussed the fluctuations. As other engine operating parameters on both engines were normal the flight crew and MC decided it was safe for the flight to continue.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/>\n\nAlmost two hours after departure, at 03:16 UTC, the \"ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT\" ECAM message reappeared. The flight contacted MC to review the issue again. As all other engine parameters remained normal, both the flight crew and the MC were again satisfied that it was safe to continue flying to Hong Kong.\n\nAfter another two hours elapsed, the aircraft was on descent to Hong Kong when, at 05:19 UTC, at a position about {{convert|203|km|mi nmi}} southeast of Hong Kong's [[Chek Lap Kok Airport]], the aircraft's ECAM displayed \"ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT\" and \"ENG 2 STALL\" within a short period.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/> The second message signified an engine [[compressor stall]], a potentially serious engine problem. The flight crew accordingly carried out the necessary ECAM actions with No. 2 engine's thrust lever moved to the idle (or minimum-thrust) position. The crew increased No. 1 engine's thrust to Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) to compensate for the low thrust of No. 2 engine. Following these actions, the crew declared a \"[[pan-pan]]\" with Hong Kong [[Air Traffic Control]] (ATC), requesting the shortest possible route to the airport and priority landing.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/>\n\nA few minutes later, the aircraft was approximately {{convert|83|km|mi nmi}} southeast of Chek Lap Kok in a [[Descent (aeronautics)|descent]] and approaching an altitude of {{convert|8000|ft|0}} when an \"ENG 1 STALL\" ECAM message was annunciated. The flight crew carried out the actions for a No. 1 engine compressor stall and declared a \"[[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]]\" with ATC. The captain then moved the thrust levers to test the engines' responses. During these movements, No. 1 engine's rotational speed increased to about 74% [[Airbreathing jet engine#Terminology|N<sub>1</sub>]] while No. 2 engine remained at about 17% N<sub>1</sub>. This gave enough thrust to reach Hong Kong, but as the flight approached the airport, the crew found that movement of the thrust levers had no effect on reducing thrust below 74% N<sub>1</sub> on No. 1 engine.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/>\n\nAt 13:43 hours local time (05:43 UTC) and 11 minutes after declaring the \"Mayday\", the crew landed the aircraft on Chek Lap Kok's Runway 07L (length 3800 m; 12,470&nbsp;ft) at a groundspeed of {{convert|426|km/h|mph knot}}.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/> This speed was {{convert|176|km/h|mph knot}} above an A330's normal speed at touch-down,<ref name=\"FG\"/><ref name=\"Aust\"/> and as well as above both the maximum allowable flap-extension speed of the A330-300 and the speed rating of the tyres.<ref name=\"Aust\"/><ref name=\"Limits\"/> After touch-down only No. 1 engine's thrust reverser deployed and the crew brought the aircraft to a stop using maximum braking. {{nowrap|No. 1 engine}} remained at between 70% and 80% N<sub>1</sub> throughout until the crew shut down both engines after stopping the aircraft. Five of the aircraft's eight main wheel tires deflated and airport fire fighters reported that smoke and flames were coming from the landing gear.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/> Because of this the captain ordered an emergency evacuation, during which 57 passengers were injured; of these 10 were taken to hospital.<ref name=\"bulletin\"/>\n\n==Investigations==\nInvestigators from the [[Civil Aviation Department (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department]], the [[Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile]] (BEA) of France, and the [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) of the United Kingdom formed a team to investigate the accident.
