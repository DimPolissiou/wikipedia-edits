The institution changed shape and name numerous times over its history before being absorbed into the [[University of Lincoln]]. Midway through the nineteenth century, the then British Government's Department of Science and Art, based in South Kensington, began establishing a network of art schools as a means of promoting and aiding manufacturing.<ref>''Frank Bramley, RA 1857\u20131915'', (Usher Gallery/Lincolnshire County Council, Lincoln, 1999), p. 12</ref>  One of the oldest institutions of its kind in Britain,<ref>Hooten, C. W..  'Education in Lincoln', pp. 86-96, in ''Lincoln, Nineteen Hundred & Thirty Six'', (The Greg Publishing Company Limited, London, 1936), p. 95</ref> it became one of Britain's leading art schools, and was one of the first to introduce the teaching of the techniques derived from the French School of [[Impressionism]].  Many of its students went on to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]] and the [[Royal Academy]].  Amongst its alumni are members of the [[Newlyn School]] and two [[Royal Academicians]].  It also popularised the art and crafts exhibitions in [[Lincolnshire]] that became important annual events in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>Hill, Sir Francis..  ''Victorian Lincoln'', (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1974), p. 303</ref>\n\n==Founding and early years==\n\n[[File:Illustrated London News Front Page.JPG|thumb|Front page of The Illustrated London News, 26 November 1864, featuring an illustration of an exhibition of students' work.]]\nThe Lincoln School of Art has its origins in the art school movement that followed the 1851 [[Great Exhibition]].  The School was founded as a private venture, with the support of the Department of Science and Art, on Monday 2 February 1863, in a single room on the Corn Exchange, Lincoln.<ref>'Lincoln School of Art and Design', ''Lincolnshire Chronicles'', 23 January 1863</ref><ref>'The Lincoln School of Art', ''The Illustrated London News'',  26 November 1864</ref>  Its guiding light was John Somerville Gibney, a minor canon of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], and its first headmaster was [[Edward R. Taylor]], founder of [[Birmingham School of Art]] and inventor of [[Ruskin Pottery]].<ref>Garland, A.  'Art and the Drama', pp. 110-119, in ''Lincoln, Nineteen Hundred & Thirty Six'', (The Greg Publishing Company Limited, London, 1936), p. 115</ref>\n\nThe courses on offer were arranged into three levels: Elementary, Advanced, and Special or Technical.  These levels were divided into classes:\n#  Elementary: Practical Geometry, Model Drawing, Figure from the Flat, Linear Perspective Free-hand Drawing and Shading, and Elementary Colour;\n#  Advanced: Drawing the figure from Casts, Painting: Ornament, Flowers, Landscape, Still Life;\n#  Special or Technical: Design, Architectural and Mechanical Drawing, Artistic Anatomy, Modelling.<ref>'Lincoln School of Art and Design', ''Lincolnshire Chronicles'', 23 January 1863</ref>\n\nAs a result of the school's success in its first year, new premises were sought for and acquired above the National School for Boys' on the south side of Silver Street.<ref>Hill, Sir Francis.

''Victorian Lincoln'', (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1974), p. n.278</ref>  With the growth of engineering in Lincoln, there was a need for draughtsmen to produce accurate drawings of machine and engineering parts, and to illustrate catalogues, and so the school offered courses on draughtsmanship.<ref>Wright, M..

'The Life and Times of John Somerville Gibney: A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requisites for the degree of Master of Philosophy at De Montfort University', (De Montfort University, Leicester, 2004), p. 231</ref>\n\nBy 1868 and 1869, the school was ranked in 6th place by the Department of Science and Art, after schools such as Edinburgh and Nottingham.<ref>'Lincoln School of Art', ''Lincoln, Rutland & Stamford Mercury'', 14 August 1868</ref><ref>'Lincoln School of Art', ''Lincoln, Rutland & Stamford Mercury'', 20 October 1869</ref>  By 1873 there were some 130 schools of art in Britain, and Lincoln was rated in 9th place.<ref>'Lincoln School of Art', ''Lincoln, Rutland & Stamford Mercury'', 19 December 1873</ref>\n\n===Death of Rev. Gibney===\n\nIn 1875, the Rev. J. S. Gibney, the school's honorary secretary since its inception, died when he fell through a skylight.  He had been inspecting the roof of the school with a joiner, George Allis, and in particular had been discussing with Allis alterations he wanted made to a skylight,<ref>'Shocking Death of a Lincoln Clergyman', ''Lincoln, Rutland & Stamford Mercury'', 15 January 1875</ref> when he began tapping the glass with his right foot, lost his balance, and fell through, down into the model room below.<ref>'Shocking Death of the Rev.

He died [[intestate]].<ref>Wright, M..  'The Life and Times of John Somerville Gibney: A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requisites for the degree of Master of Philosophy at De Montfort University', (De Montfort University, Leicester, 2004), p. 287</ref>\n\n===Gibney Art Scholarship===\n\nIn honour of the Rev. Gibney and his work, the school established a scholarship in his name.  Awarded to students at the school, its purpose was to allow the successful student to devote his or her time wholly to the cultivation of art.<ref>'Gibney Memorial Studentship', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 28 August 1874</ref>  Holders of the Gibney Scholarship have included [[William Logsdail]], [[Frederick Hall (painter)|Frederick Hall]], [[Frederick William Elwell]], May Yeomans (who would go on to be principal at the school), and ceramics artist Robert Blatherwick.<ref>''Lincoln School of Art, Prospectus: Session 1946\u20131947'', (City of Lincoln Education Committee, Lincoln, 1946), p. 9</ref>\n\n==Rules of the school==\n\n[[File:LSA Rules Board.jpg|thumb|Notice board of the LSA rules of school]]\n\nDuring its early years, the committee running the school drew up a list of rules, signed by the Rev. J. Mansell, the Honorary Secretary who succeeded the Rev. Gibney in 1875: \n#  All applications for Admission to the School must be made to the Head Master.  No Student will be admitted to the Evening Classes under 12 years of age, without special permission of the Committee.\n#  All Fees are to be paid in advance at the commencement of each Half-year, when Students will receive a Ticket of admission, which they are to produce whenever required.  If the Fees are not paid within 14 days, a Fine of 2/6 will be imposed on Students of the Morning Classes, and 1/- on Students of the Evening Classes.\n#  The School will be open for Morning Classes at 9.30, on Tuesday, and Saturday, in each week.  Also at 2 o'Clock each Monday and Thursday, and the door will be closed at 4 o'Clock.  Evening Classes on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday in each week, will commence at 7 and close at 9.  No Student is to remain in the School after the Master has left (unless by special leave).\n#  Students are required to come punctually to the Classes, and to remain till the close of the Classes they attend.\n#  All Conversation and all necessary Moving about are strictly prohibited.\n#  Any Students guilty of Insubordination, Levity, or any impropriety; or who shall injure Desks, Seats, Works of art; Scribble on the Walls, use the Lavatory Basins for getting rid of the Scrapings of Pallets, or in any way Damage or Deface the property of the School shall be liable to immediate Suspension by the Master, who must report forthwith such Suspension to the Committee.\n#  Students are strictly prohibited from touching the Gas, moving Casts or Objects of study, except with the special leave of the Master.\n#  At the close of the Classes Students are required to leave their paintings, drawings, and easels in such places as shall be assigned to these, respectively, by the Master.\n#  All Drawings executed by the Students must be delivered to the head Master immediately on their completion.  Every Drawing or Work executed in the School belongs to the School till it has been sent to South Kensington, and must not be taken away from the School.  It will be given to the Student after it has been submitted to the Authorities at South Kensington and returned by them.\n#  All Students received at the Lower Scale of Fees are required to make at least 20 Attendances, and to sit at the Government Examination in the Subjects for which they are registered.  These examinations are held in April or May.\n#  Students are expressly forbidden to take home examples or property belonging to the School.\n\n==Controversy==\n\nBy the late 1880s, the school was teaching Greek art and using classically based subject matter, as well as importing the then new idiom of [[Impressionism]].\n\nThe painter and Royal Academician [[John Callcott Horsley]], attending the annual prize-giving in April, 1890, criticised the school for teaching its students such techniques found in the French school of painting, to the detriment of the English school.  He called these techniques a 'fad' and one of those 'ridiculous crazes' that had been imported from Paris.<ref>'Lincoln School of Art, Distribution of Prizes and Medals, Address by Mr. Horsley, R. A.', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 12 April 1890</ref>  He then went on to expand his criticism to schools of art in general, which he called 'the greatest possible misfortune' to British art (although he did make an exception with Lincoln).<ref>'Lincoln School of Art, Distribution of Prizes and Medals, Address by Mr. Horsley, R. A.', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 12 April 1890</ref>\n\nAlfred G. Webster, the then principal of the school, replied in an open letter published in the ''Lincoln Gazette'', expressing the belief that discoveries and ideas from abroad ought not to be disregarded simply as a result of their foreign origins.  He pointed out that [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], [[Normans]], and [[Saxons]] all 'had the misfortune to be foreigners', and that the [[English art|English School]] had been founded on the practises of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Peter Paul Rubens]], all foreigners.<ref>'Mr. Horsley, R.A., and the Lincoln School of Art - To the Editor', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 14 April 1890</ref>\n\n==School of Science and Art==\n\n[[File:Fine Art Exhibition, School of Art, 1887.JPG|thumb|Fine Art Exhibition held at the Lincoln School of Art on Monks Road in 1887, most likely in the Painting Room on the first floor.]]\nThe School moved to premises on Monks Road in 1886,<ref>''Report by H. M. Inspectors on Lincoln School of Art, Inspected in March, 1950'', (Ministry of Education, London, 1950), p. 3</ref> where it became one-half of a 'School of Science and Art', with its own principal and organising committee.<ref>Gray-Fow, M. J. G..  ''Lincoln School of Art: from its beginnings to the close of the nineteenth century'', (University of Nottingham, 1978), p. 14</ref>  The ground floor was home to the Science School (except for the Modelling Room), with shared use of the Lecture Theatre and the Porters' Room, while the Art School was based on the first floor, with shared use of the Committee and Secretary's Rooms.  Both floors had rooms for the respective schools' masters.  The Basement had two bedrooms and a living room, and was shared use, except that the Science School used the Laboratory and Balance Room.  The Science School increased in size and added a technical wing to the Monks Road premises in 1891, a reflection of the rise of industry in Lincoln in general,<ref>Gray-Fow, M. J. G..  ''Lincoln School of Art: from its beginnings to the close of the nineteenth century'', (University of Nottingham, 1978), p. 19</ref> which was further demonstrated in an article from the ''Lincoln Gazette'', dated 1897, which described a conversazione at the combined school in 1897, during which [[x-rays]], [[glass-blowing]], and a [[cinematograph]] were exhibited.  Of twelve paragraphs, only one is devoted to the art school.<ref>'Conversazione at the School of Science and Art, A Brilliant Success', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 1897</ref>  In 1901 the combined school was renamed the City of Lincoln Municipal Technical School,<ref>'Centenary Echo, 1893\u20131993', ''Lincolnshire Echo'', 13 March 1993, Issue No. 4, p. 1</ref> and then the Lincoln Technical College in 1928.<ref>Lambert, M.

Sketch by Duncan Scott Mackenzie.]]\n\nThe School of Art had originally been supported by the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington.  With the Department's closure in 1899, the school lost that support and so was eventually absorbed into the Technical College, under the authority of the Lincoln Education Authority,<ref>Lambert, M. R., &, Sprague, M. S..  ''Lincoln'', (Blackwell, Oxford, 1933), p. 235</ref> where it effectively ceased to be a private venture and an independent educational institution.\n\nThe School remained part of the Technical College for the next six decades.  The range of subjects taught widened during this time to include (along with the more traditional subjects) costume, typography, lettering, metalwork and silver-smithing, dress design, and bookcraft,<ref>''Lincoln School of Art, Prospectus 1949\u20131950'', (Lincoln, 1949), p. 7</ref> in keeping with headmaster Austin Garland's statement that the students be 'taught to make ''things'', and to bring artistic methods to bear upon the problems of everyday life'.<ref>Garland, A..  'Art and the Drama', pp. 110-119, in ''Lincoln, Nineteen Hundred & Thirty Six'', (The Greg Publishing Company Limited, London, 1936), p. 114</ref>  In 1948, the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (R.I.B.A.) recognised the school as an approved centre for training up to the intermediary standard.<ref>''Lincoln School of Art, Prospectus 1949\u20131950'', (Lincoln, 1949), p. 4</ref>\n\nPottery was also taught at the school.  Lincolnshire ceramics artist Robert Blatherwick, who had studied at the school, returned to teach there from the early forties to the late sixties.<ref>[http://www.ceramike.com/PastPotters/Blatherwick/RobertBlatherwick.asp], accessed 31 May 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1950, a report by His Majesty's Inspectors criticised the 'inadequate' accommodation and stated that this 'handicapped' the students.<ref>''Report by H. M. Inspectors on Lincoln School of Art, Inspected in March, 1950'', (Ministry of Education, London, 1950), p. 4</ref>  They also stated that the school was understaffed, with full-time staff sometimes having to supervise more than one group at a time.<ref>''Report by H. M. Inspectors on Lincoln School of Art, Inspected in March, 1950'', (Ministry of Education, London, 1950), p. 5</ref>  During the 1937\u201338 academic year, the school's students numbered 251 (including part-time and evening classes), while by 1949\u201350, that number had grown to 415 students.<ref>''Report by H. M. Inspectors on Lincoln School of Art, Inspected in March, 1950'', (Ministry of Education, London, 1950), p. 5</ref>\n\n==Christ's Hospital Terrace==\n\nThe School was transferred to the Bluecoat School building on Christ's Hospital Terrace in 1957, where it regained some of its independence from the technical college,<ref>Gray-Fow, M. J. G..  ''Lincoln School of Art: from its beginnings to the close of the nineteenth century'', (unpublished manuscript, part of M. Ed. course, University of Nottingham, 1978), p. 21</ref> which became the Lincoln College of Technology in the 1970s and developed into the present [[Lincoln College, Lincolnshire]].\n\n===1958 fire===\n\nIn May, 1958, a fire broke out in the west wing of the School of Art.<ref>'Students' Work Damaged in Fire', ''The Times'', 24 May 1958, p. 8</ref>  Although the damage to the building was light, many art works were destroyed.\n\n==Lincoln College of Art==\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the official name of the school had been changed to the Lincoln College of Art.  In 1975, the college's administration was moved to the old Girl's High School building on Lindum Road, now called the Greestone Building.\n\nAt this time, a number of influential figures emerged amongst the teaching staff, both locally and nationally.  The principal, Peter Williams (1936\u20132005), described by ''The Guardian'' newspaper as both an artist and art educationist,<ref>'Obituaries: Peter Williams', ''The Guardian'', 11 January 2006, p. 31</ref> also held the post of Art Advisor to the City of Lincoln Authority.<ref>''Lincoln College of Art, Prospectus, 1973/74'', Lincoln College of Art, 1973, p. 5</ref>  He would go on to become a prime mover and founding director of the [[Kent Institute of Art & Design]].<ref>'Obituaries: Peter Williams', ''The Guardian'', 11 January 2006, p. 31</ref>\n\nArtist Gill Nadin (1928\u20131996) taught at the college.

The exhibition featured prospectuses dating from as far back as 1947, nineteenth-century works by students, a video of a cricket match and picnic dating from July, 1979, and a selection of student art from the university's own art collection.  The opening was held on Saturday, 2 February, exactly 150 years to the day the school opened and was attended by many ex-staff and students.

J. Mansell, the Honorary Secretary who succeeded the Rev. Gibney in 1875: \n#  All applications for Admission to the School must be made to the Head Master.  No Student will be admitted to the Evening Classes under 12 years of age, without special permission of the Committee.\n#  All Fees are to be paid in advance at the commencement of each Half-year, when Students will receive a Ticket of admission, which they are to produce whenever required.  If the Fees are not paid within 14 days, a Fine of 2/6 will be imposed on Students of the Morning Classes, and 1/- on Students of the Evening Classes.\n#  The School will be open for Morning Classes at 9.30, on Tuesday, and Saturday, in each week.  Also at 2 o'Clock each Monday and Thursday, and the door will be closed at 4 o'Clock.  Evening Classes on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday in each week, will commence at 7 and close at 9.  No Student is to remain in the School after the Master has left (unless by special leave).\n#  Students are required to come punctually to the Classes, and to remain till the close of the Classes they attend.\n#  All Conversation and all necessary Moving about are strictly prohibited.\n#  Any Students guilty of Insubordination, Levity, or any impropriety; or who shall injure Desks, Seats, Works of art; Scribble on the Walls, use the Lavatory Basins for getting rid of the Scrapings of Pallets, or in any way Damage or Deface the property of the School shall be liable to immediate Suspension by the Master, who must report forthwith such Suspension to the Committee.\n#  Students are strictly prohibited from touching the Gas, moving Casts or Objects of study, except with the special leave of the Master.\n#  At the close of the Classes Students are required to leave their paintings, drawings, and easels in such places as shall be assigned to these, respectively, by the Master.\n#  All Drawings executed by the Students must be delivered to the head Master immediately on their completion.  Every Drawing or Work executed in the School belongs to the School till it has been sent to South Kensington, and must not be taken away from the School.  It will be given to the Student after it has been submitted to the Authorities at South Kensington and returned by them.\n#  All Students received at the Lower Scale of Fees are required to make at least 20 Attendances, and to sit at the Government Examination in the Subjects for which they are registered.  These examinations are held in April or May.\n#  Students are expressly forbidden to take home examples or property belonging to the School.\n\n==Controversy==\n\nBy the late 1880s, the school was teaching Greek art and using classically based subject matter, as well as importing the then new idiom of [[Impressionism]].\n\nThe painter and Royal Academician [[John Callcott Horsley]], attending the annual prize-giving in April, 1890, criticised the school for teaching its students such techniques found in the French school of painting, to the detriment of the English school.  He called these techniques a 'fad' and one of those 'ridiculous crazes' that had been imported from Paris.<ref>'Lincoln School of Art, Distribution of Prizes and Medals, Address by Mr. Horsley, R. A.', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 12 April 1890</ref>  He then went on to expand his criticism to schools of art in general, which he called 'the greatest possible misfortune' to British art (although he did make an exception with Lincoln).<ref>'Lincoln School of Art, Distribution of Prizes and Medals, Address by Mr. Horsley, R. A.', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 12 April 1890</ref>\n\nAlfred G. Webster, the then principal of the school, replied in an open letter published in the ''Lincoln Gazette'', expressing the belief that discoveries and ideas from abroad ought not to be disregarded simply as a result of their foreign origins.  He pointed out that [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], [[Normans]], and [[Saxons]] all 'had the misfortune to be foreigners', and that the [[English art|English School]] had been founded on the practises of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Peter Paul Rubens]], all foreigners.<ref>'Mr. Horsley, R.A., and the Lincoln School of Art - To the Editor', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 14 April 1890</ref>\n\n==School of Science and Art==\n\n[[File:Fine Art Exhibition, School of Art, 1887.JPG|thumb|Fine Art Exhibition held at the Lincoln School of Art on Monks Road in 1887, most likely in the Painting Room on the first floor.]]\nThe School moved to premises on Monks Road in 1886,<ref>''Report by H.

''Lincoln School of Art: from its beginnings to the close of the nineteenth century'', (University of Nottingham, 1978), p. 19</ref> which was further demonstrated in an article from the ''Lincoln Gazette'', dated 1897, which described a conversazione at the combined school in 1897, during which [[x-rays]], [[glass-blowing]], and a [[cinematograph]] were exhibited.  Of twelve paragraphs, only one is devoted to the art school.<ref>'Conversazione at the School of Science and Art, A Brilliant Success', ''Lincoln Gazette'', 1897</ref>  In 1901 the combined school was renamed the City of Lincoln Municipal Technical School,<ref>'Centenary Echo, 1893\u20131993', ''Lincolnshire Echo'', 13 March 1993, Issue No. 4, p. 1</ref> and then the Lincoln Technical College in 1928.<ref>Lambert, M.

Sketch by Duncan Scott Mackenzie.]]\n\nThe School of Art had originally been supported by the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington.  With the Department's closure in 1899, the school lost that support and so was eventually absorbed into the Technical College, under the authority of the Lincoln Education Authority,<ref>Lambert, M. R., &, Sprague, M. S..  ''Lincoln'', (Blackwell, Oxford, 1933), p. 235</ref> where it effectively ceased to be a private venture and an independent educational institution.\n\nThe School remained part of the Technical College for the next six decades.  The range of subjects taught widened during this time to include (along with the more traditional subjects) costume, typography, lettering, metalwork and silver-smithing, dress design, and bookcraft,<ref>''Lincoln School of Art, Prospectus 1949\u20131950'', (Lincoln, 1949), p. 7</ref> in keeping with headmaster Austin Garland's statement that the students be 'taught to make ''things'', and to bring artistic methods to bear upon the problems of everyday life'.<ref>Garland, A..  'Art and the Drama', pp. 110-119, in ''Lincoln, Nineteen Hundred & Thirty Six'', (The Greg Publishing Company Limited, London, 1936), p. 114</ref>  In 1948, the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (R.I.B.A.) recognised the school as an approved centre for training up to the intermediary standard.<ref>''Lincoln School of Art, Prospectus 1949\u20131950'', (Lincoln, 1949), p. 4</ref>\n\nPottery was also taught at the school.  Lincolnshire ceramics artist Robert Blatherwick, who had studied at the school, returned to teach there from the early forties to the late sixties.<ref>[http://www.ceramike.com/PastPotters/Blatherwick/RobertBlatherwick.asp], accessed 31 May 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1950, a report by His Majesty's Inspectors criticised the 'inadequate' accommodation and stated that this 'handicapped' the students.<ref>''Report by H. M. Inspectors on Lincoln School of Art, Inspected in March, 1950'', (Ministry of Education, London, 1950), p. 4</ref>  They also stated that the school was understaffed, with full-time staff sometimes having to supervise more than one group at a time.<ref>''Report by H.

M. Inspectors on Lincoln School of Art, Inspected in March, 1950'', (Ministry of Education, London, 1950), p. 5</ref>\n\n==Christ's Hospital Terrace==\n\nThe School was transferred to the Bluecoat School building on Christ's Hospital Terrace in 1957, where it regained some of its independence from the technical college,<ref>Gray-Fow, M. J. G..  ''Lincoln School of Art: from its beginnings to the close of the nineteenth century'', (unpublished manuscript, part of M. Ed. course, University of Nottingham, 1978), p. 21</ref> which became the Lincoln College of Technology in the 1970s and developed into the present [[Lincoln College, Lincolnshire]].\n\n===1958 fire===\n\nIn May, 1958, a fire broke out in the west wing of the School of Art.<ref>'Students' Work Damaged in Fire', ''The Times'', 24 May 1958, p. 8</ref>  Although the damage to the building was light, many art works were destroyed.\n\n==Lincoln College of Art==\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the official name of the school had been changed to the Lincoln College of Art.  In 1975, the college's administration was moved to the old Girl's High School building on Lindum Road, now called the Greestone Building.\n\nAt this time, a number of influential figures emerged amongst the teaching staff, both locally and nationally.  The principal, Peter Williams (1936\u20132005), described by ''The Guardian'' newspaper as both an artist and art educationist,<ref>'Obituaries: Peter Williams', ''The Guardian'', 11 January 2006, p. 31</ref> also held the post of Art Advisor to the City of Lincoln Authority.<ref>''Lincoln College of Art, Prospectus, 1973/74'', Lincoln College of Art, 1973, p. 5</ref>  He would go on to become a prime mover and founding director of the [[Kent Institute of Art & Design]].<ref>'Obituaries: Peter Williams', ''The Guardian'', 11 January 2006, p. 31</ref>\n\nArtist Gill Nadin (1928\u20131996) taught at the college. The Lincolnshire Artists' Society instituted an art prize in her name.<ref>http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Acclaimed-artist-s-work-display-Sam-Scorer/story-18274621-detail/story.html#axzz2ROIfgDlr{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Another notable lecturer at the college was the Czech emigre artist [[Tony Bartl]] (1912\u20131998) who was appointed in 1948.<ref>Sam Scorer Gallery, Lincoln www.samscorergallery.co.uk/antonin-bartl-100-years-retrospective/</ref>\n\nBetween 1970 and 1980, the ceramics artist Peter Moss was Head of Department and a college governor.<ref>[http://www.petermoss.me.uk/cv.htm]</ref>  He went on to be acting principal and then vice-principal when the college became Lincolnshire College of Art.

The latter used the fa\u00e7ade of what had once been the City of Lincoln Municipal Technical School,<ref>'Centenary Echo, 1893\u20131993', ''Lincolnshire Echo'', 13 March 1993, Issue No. 4, p. 1</ref> where the School of Art had been joined with the School of Science.\n\nIn an interview on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]]'' in May 2014, the celebrated ceramic artist and author of ''[[The Hare with Amber Eyes]]'', [[Edmund de Waal]], stated that when he was five years old, he was taken to a ceramics evening class at the college where he discovered ceramics.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b043wvy7 Interview on BBC Radio 4 ''Front Row'', 19 May 2014</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Lincolnshire College of Art & Design was ranked 7th in the Guardian's league table for further education colleges.<ref>'Further Education Results, In a league of their own', ''The Guardian'', 24 November 1993, p. 20</ref>\n\n===1991 Lindum Road fire===\n\nA fire broke out on the upper floor of the general office building in 1991.

In 2001, the School of Art was divided in two, between [[Lincoln College, Lincolnshire|Lincoln College]], which took many of the FE (Further Education) art courses, and the [[University of Lincoln]], which took the HE (Higher Education) art courses.\n\nAs part of the University of Lincoln, the school was incorporated as the Lincoln School of Art and Design, within the College of Art. The [[University of Lincoln]]'s College of Art has later since been reorganised and provision from the original Lincoln College of Art is now spread across schools within the [[University of Lincoln]]'s College of Art.\n\n==150th Anniversary Year==\n\n[[File:LSA 150th Opening Night.JPG|thumb|LSA 150th Anniversary Exhibition opening night party, Feb. 2013.]]\nThe year 2013 marked the 150th anniversary of the founding of the school.  As part of the celebrations, the [[University of Lincoln]] held an exhibition entitled ''Lincoln School of Art:  A Celebration of 150 Years'' in the gallery of the Greestone Building.  The exhibition featured prospectuses dating from as far back as 1947, nineteenth-century works by students, a video of a cricket match and picnic dating from July, 1979, and a selection of student art from the university's own art collection.  The opening was held on Saturday, 2 February, exactly 150 years to the day the school opened and was attended by many ex-staff and students.

Works by artists such as [[William Logsdail]], [[George Francis Carline]], [[Frank Bramley]], as well as paintings by the school's headmasters such as Alfred G.
