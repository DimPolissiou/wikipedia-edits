On April 2, 1939, their first son, [[Marvin Gaye|Marvin Jr.]] was born. Son [[Frankie Gaye|Frankie (born Frances)]] and daughter Zeola followed shortly afterwards. In 1970, Gay fathered a son named Antwaun Carey with another woman as a result of one of his [[extramarital affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.detnews.com/entertainment/article?a=2013302160303&f=1216|title=Gaye's second wife calls play 'completely and utterly exploitative'|date=February 16, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Ministry work==\nOn one of his first missions as preacher at a church in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]], Gay impressed the congregation, and his church later made him Bishop.{{sfn|Glatt|2011|p=218}} According to his son Marvin, his father was known as a healer.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=6}} Gay eventually settled as a minister of a local House of God church. When his son was around four or five, his father brought him to church congregations and revivals to sing for audiences.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=14}}{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=8}} According to Marvin Gaye's relatives, the elder Marvin Gay was a passable self-taught piano player. He bought a secondhand piano at a [[rummage sale]] and coached his son in piano lessons, which the younger Marvin Gay learned by ear, and it was one of the few stable times in the father and son's relationship.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=15}} Marvin Sr. nurtured Marvin Jr.'s musical talents, so long as he stuck with liturgical music.\n\nHowever, by the late 1940s, Gay had left the House of God to join another sect called the House of the Living God, but soon returned to the House of God to head its Board of Apostles in the early 1950s.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=15}} Gay left the House of God altogether in the mid-1950s after not being named Chief Apostle of the church{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=15}} and according to his son, \"that's when my father lost his healing powers\".{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=15}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriage, family life and relationship with Marvin Gaye===\nIn most accounts, Gay was described as a strict and sometimes overbearing father to his four children. According to his children, Gay would make them observe an extended Sabbath, which was every Saturday. Gay was against the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition of attending church Sunday, accusing them of going against observing God on \"[[Lord's Day]]\", which he contended was Saturdays.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=332}} According to Gay's sister, Jeanne, he was someone who never \"spared the rod, he was very, very strict\" in reference to the saying \"spare the rod, spoil the child\".<ref>''What's Going On: The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye, 2006''</ref> Gay also would question his children on Biblical passages, administering [[child abuse|beatings]] if they answered wrong.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=14}}{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=6}} All four of Gay's children had problems with [[bed wetting]], which led to more beatings.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=12}}\n\nGay administered most of his harshest punishments on Marvin Jr. According to Marvin's sister, Jeanne, from the age of seven well into his [[teenage]] years, Marvin's life consisted of \"brutal whippings\" since Gay Sr. would strike him for any shortcoming, including putting his hair brush in the wrong place or coming home from school a minute late.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=12}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=13}} Marvin would state later, \"living with Father was like living with a king, an all-cruel, changeable, cruel and all-powerful king\".{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=13}} He further stated to David Ritz, \"if it wasn't for Mother, who was always there to console me and praise me for my singing, I think I would have been one of those child [[suicide]]s you read about in the papers.\"{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=13}} Alberta Gay later stated that her husband hated Marvin, as she told David Ritz in 1979:{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=6}}\n{{quote|My husband never wanted Marvin, and he never liked him. He used to say he didn't think he was really his child. I told him that was nonsense. He knew Marvin was his. But for some reason, he didn't love Marvin, and what's worse, he didn't want me to love Marvin either. Marvin wasn't very old before he understood that.}}\n\nConversely, Gay said this about Marvin Jr.,{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=6}}\n{{quote|It was important that I have a male child. A namesake is what I wanted. The day he was born, I felt he was destined for greatness. I thanked God for the blessing of his life. I thanked God for Marvin. I knew he was a special child.}}\n\nAccording to Jeanne Gay, her father never held a job for longer than three years.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=20}} Gay worked briefly in the [[post office]] and at [[Western Union]], but a back injury laid him off early{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=19}} and when explaining why he left the latter job, Gay stated to Ritz that people were working on the \"day of the [[Sabbath]]\".{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=19}} Eventually, Gay withdrew from social life, developing [[alcoholism]] and was involved in [[cross-dressing]], which humiliated his son who, at the age of twelve, spied on his father dressing in his mother's clothes.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=17}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=18}} Due to this difficulty, Gay's wife provided for most of the family's income working as a [[domestic worker]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=19}} As Marvin grew older, his relationship with his father worsened and Gay often threw his son out for allegations of [[misbehavior]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=25}} Neighbors of the Gay family, as well as other students at school, according to Frankie Gaye, often teased them for their name, their father's manner and religion. Gay's sons often found themselves having to confront the neighbors, vocally defending their father and their religion.{{sfn|Gaye|2003|pp=8-10}} According to Alberta, Gay began to drink heavily in the 1950s, only furthering the friction in his relationship with Marvin and \"he never did develop any love for the boy.\"{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=25}} As a teenager, Marvin Jr. attempted to leave home for good following one big fight by enlisting in the [[US Air Force]]; a move which the younger Gay later admitted was a bad idea, as he found himself under superiors who had similar authoritarian leanings as his father.\n\nFollowing Marvin's musical career beginnings, he refused to be in the same room with his father for a number of years. This decision led to Marvin adding an \"e\" to his final name, which, it was stated, was done to quiet any rumors of his own [[sexual orientation]], to emulate his idol [[Sam Cooke]] who had also used a stage name of a silent \"E\"; and to add more distance from his father.{{sfn|Jet|1985|p=17}}\n\n===Son's fame and relocation to Los Angeles===\nAfter Marvin had found musical stardom at [[Motown Records|Motown]], he purchased a house on the corner of Fifteenth and Varnum in a black middle-class section of [[Washington, D.C.]] and moved his parents out of the projects and into the new house, where the couple would reside until the early 1970s. Alberta finally stopped working, so that she could enjoy the security of owning a house, and the new residence was roomy and spacious with large outside porches, but Marvin didn't visit often due to his strained relationship with his father.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=83}}\n\nBy 1968, however, Marvin extended an olive branch, giving his father a [[Cadillac]] as a present, but he said his father's response was not affecting.{{sfn|Glatt|2011|p=226}}  Four years later, Marvin reunited with his parents in Washington, D.C. after the city honored Gaye with a day in his honor called Marvin Gaye Day; a day, Marvin later said, on which he felt he had made his father \"proud\".{{sfn|Glatt|2011|p=228}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=162}}  In 1974, dressed in a female wig and clothing, Gay appeared on his son's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|Midnight Special]]'' episode.

It occurs naturally in the deserts of northern Africa, where it forms from puddles of animal urine.  It can be prepared artificially by boiling 5 parts of urine, 1 part of sea salt, and \u00bd part of chimney soot until the mixture has dried.

In [[R\u00f8mer scale|R\u00f8mer's scale]], brine freezes at zero, water freezes and melts at 7.5&nbsp;degrees, body temperature is 22.5, and water boils at 60&nbsp;degrees. Fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and make the scale more [[granularity|fine-grained]]. He then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two, allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power).<ref name=TMU>{{Cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-71590-4 |last=Frautschi |first=Steven C. |author2=Richard P.
