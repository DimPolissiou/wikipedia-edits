It has a [[conical bore]], like that of the [[euphonium]] and [[flugelhorn]]. The mellophone is used as the middle-voiced brass instrument in [[marching band]]s and [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] in place of [[French horn]]s, and can also be used to play French horn parts in [[concert band]]s and [[orchestra]]s.\n\nThese instruments are used instead of French horns for marching because their bells face forward instead of to the back (or to the side), as dissipation of the sound becomes a concern in the open-air environment of marching. Tuning is done solely by adjusting the tuning slide, unlike the French horn where the pitch is affected by the hand position in the bell. Fingerings for the mellophone are the same as fingerings for the [[trumpet]], [[alto horn|alto (tenor) horn]], and most valved brass instruments. Owing to its use primarily outside concert music, there is little solo literature for the mellophone, other than that used within drum and bugle corps.\n\n==Characteristics ==\nThe present-day mellophone has three [[piston valve|valves]], operated with the right hand. Mellophone fingering is the same as the [[french horn]] or trumpet, depending on which key it is in. It is typically pitched lower, in the [[key (music)|key]] of F or E{{music|flat}}. The [[overtone series]] of the F mellophone is an octave above that of the F [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]. The tubing length of a mellophone is the same as that of the [[French horn#Single horn|F-alto (high) single horn]] or the F-alto (high) branch of a [[German horn#Triple horn|triple horn]] or [[German horn#Construction|double-descant horn]].\n\nThe direction of the bell as well as the much-reduced amount of tubing (compared to a French horn) make the mellophone look like a large trumpet. The mellophone uses the same mouthpiece as the alto (tenor) horn, which is in between the size of a trombone and trumpet mouthpiece. This mouthpiece usually has a deep cup, like that of the [[flugelhorn]], and has a wider inner diameter than a trumpet mouthpiece. These mouthpieces give the mellophone a dark, round sound. Some trumpet players who double on mellophone use a trumpet-style [[parabola|parabolic]] (\"cup\") [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] on the instrument, resulting in a much brighter, more trumpet-like sound. Horn players doubling on mellophone often use a smaller, lighter, [[cone (geometry)|conical]] (\"funnel\") mouthpiece, as used on French horns, with an adapter to allow them to fit in the larger-bore leadpipe of the mellophone. This style mouthpiece gives the instrument a warmer sound than using a trumpet mouthpiece, and allows French horn players to play the mellophone without changing their embouchure between the two instruments.<ref>[http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/mouthpieces.html Mellophone mouthpieces]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTwo instruments carry the name mellophone:\n# Traditional mellophones with a rear or sideways facing bell similar to the [[french horn]].\n# The marching mellophone, with a forward-facing bell.\n\nIn general, the mellophone has its origin in the horn design boom of the 19th century. The earliest version was the Koenig horn, based on a design by [[Herman Koenig]], but manufactured by [[Antoine Courtois]], who may also have played a significant role in its design.  Courtois had just won the right to manufacture the [[saxhorn]], in a lawsuit against the inventor of the [[saxophone]], [[Adolphe Sax]]. The Koenig horn had three [[piston valve]]s \u2014 the kind used on a modern trumpet, which were a relatively new technology at that time \u2014 and was otherwise shaped somewhat like a modern [[French horn]], but smaller. This shape was largely influenced by the [[post horn]].<ref>[http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/history.html The History of the Mellophone]<br/>Courtois came out with an instrument that bore the name of a virtuoso cornetist and instrument builder named Herman Koenig, this instrument being called the Koenig horn. Koenig\u2019s role is uncertain- he was a very good instrument builder in his own right, but it is also possible that the instruments were built by Courtois at a suggestion or request by Koenig, or the two men may have worked together on the instrument.</ref>\n\n[[K\u00f6hler & Son]] originally began using the name \"mellophone\" for its line of horns based loosely on similar instruments by [[Distin]]. These were also post horn-like instruments with valves, but the mouthpieces and bell angle were slowly evolving to allow for more projection and control of sound with the technology of valves.\n\nThe traditional instrument is visually modeled on the horn, with a round shape and a rear-facing bell. Unlike French horns, it is played with the right hand, and the bell points to the rear left of the player. It was used as an alto voice both outdoors and indoors by community and school bands in place of the French horn. The manufacture of these instruments declined significantly in the mid-twentieth century, and they are rarely in use today.\n\nMellophone bugles keyed in G were manufactured for American drum and bugle corps from approximately the 1950s until around 2000 when [[Drum Corps International]] changed the rules to allow brass instruments in any key; however, Kanstul and Dynasty still make them in small quantities.\n\nModern marching mellophones are more directly related to bugle-horns such as the [[flugelhorn]], [[euphonium]], and [[tuba]]. Their tube profile is likewise more conical than the trumpet or trombone.\n\n== Difference from the horn ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:USMC-120309-M-RT059-998.jpg|thumb|329x329px| A [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps|U.S. Marine Drum & Bugle Corps]] mellophone player]]\nThe marching mellophone is used in place of the horn for marching because it is a bell-front instrument allowing projection of the sound in the direction that the player is facing. This is especially important in drum corps and marching bands because the audience is typically on only one side of the band. There are also marching B{{music|flat}} French horns with a bell-front configuration. Mellophones are usually constructed with a smaller bore for louder volume than marching French horns. Marching B{{music|flat}} horns do use a horn mouthpiece and have a more French horn-like sound but are more difficult to play accurately on the field.\n\nAnother factor in the greater use of mellophones is its ease of use as compared to the difficulty of playing a French horn consistently well. In a French horn, the length of tubing (and the bore size) make the partials much closer together than other brass instruments in their normal range and, therefore, harder to play accurately. The F mellophone has tubing half the length of a French horn, which gives it an overtone series more similar to a trumpet and most other brass instruments.\n\nIn summary, the mellophone is an instrument designed specifically to bring the approximate sound of a horn in a package which is conducive to playing while marching. Outside a marching setting, the traditional French horn is ubiquitous and the mellophone is rarely used, though they can be used to play French horn parts in a [[concert band]] or [[orchestra]].\n\n== Mellophonium ==\n\n===Stan Kenton's instrument===\n[[File:Mellophonium Description-xr.jpg|thumb|right|The type of Mellophonium used by [[Stan Kenton]]'s orchestra, which variously used mellophone mouthpieces and a specially designed horn-trumpet hybrid mouthpiece for Stan Kenton's band.]]\n\n[[C.G.

American bandleader [[Stan Kenton]] himself was not involved in the design of the mellophonium; in 1961, however, he provided an endorsement for Conn's advertising upon adopting the instrument. Kenton had for several years wished to add another brass voice alongside the trumpets and trombones in his orchestra and experimented unsuccessfully with additional instruments before discovering the Conn Mellophonium which bridged the gap he was seeking to fill:\n\n\"For some time, I recognized the need for using an instrument that would not only give the orchestra another solo voice, but would add more warmth and emphasis to the thematic line.

My decision to use four Mellophoniums didn't just happen overnight. Nor are they gimmick instruments.

At its most basic, an earth oven is a pit in the ground used to trap heat and bake, smoke, or steam food. Earth ovens have been used in many places and cultures in the past, and the presence of such cooking pits is a key sign of human settlement often sought by [[archaeologists]]. Earth ovens remain a common tool for cooking large quantities of food where no equipment is available. They have been used in various civilizations around the world and are still commonly found in the [[Pacific Rim|Pacific region]] to date.\n\nTo bake food, the fire is built, then allowed to burn down to a [[Smouldering|smoulder]]. The food is then placed in the oven and covered. This covered area can be used to bake bread or other various items. Steaming food in an earth oven covers a similar process. Fire-heated rocks are put into a pit and are covered with green vegetation to add moisture and large quantities of food. More green vegetation and sometimes water are then added, if more moisture is needed. Finally, a covering of earth is added over everything. The food in the pit can take up to several hours to a full day to cook, regardless of the dry or wet method used.\n[[File:Lovo.jpg|thumb|[[Fijian lovo]] of cooked staples]]\nToday, many communities still use cooking pits for ceremonial or celebratory occasions, including the indigenous [[Fiji]]an [[lovo]], the [[Hawaii]]an [[imu]], the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] [[h\u0101ngi]], the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[barbacoa]], and the [[New England clam bake]]. The central Asian [[tandoor]] use the method primarily for uncovered, live-fire baking, which is a transitional design between the earth oven and the horizontal-plan [[masonry oven]]. This method is essentially a permanent earth oven made out of clay or firebrick with a constantly burning, very hot fire in the bottom.\n\n== Americas ==\n\nIn many areas, [[archaeologists]] recognize \"pit-hearths\" as being commonly used in the past. In Central [[Texas]], there are large \"burned-rock middens\" speculated to be used for large-scale cooking of plants of various sorts, especially the bulbs of [[sotol]]. The Mayan ''pib'' and Andean ''[[Huatia|watia]]'' are other examples. In [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] nations, [[barbacoa]] is a common practice. Barbacoa, originally a [[Taino]] word referring to the pit itself, consists of slow-roasted meat in a [[maguey]]-lined pit, popular in Mexico alongside [[birria]], [[tortillas]], and [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]].\n\nThe [[New England clam bake|clam bake]], invented by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on the Atlantic seaboard and considered a traditional element of [[New England]] cuisine, traditionally uses a type of ad hoc earth oven (usually built on the beach). A large enough hole is dug into the sand and heated rocks are added to the bottom of the hole. A layer of seaweed is then laid on top to create moisture and steam, followed by the food. Lastly, another layer of seaweed is added to trap in the steam and cook the food, which mainly consists of [[shellfish]] and vegetables.\n\nThe [[Curanto]] of the [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]] consists of [[shellfish]], meat, potatoes, [[milcao]] [[chapalele]]s, and vegetables traditionally prepared in an earth oven. It has spread to the southern areas of [[Chile]].\n\nThe [[huatia]] or watia and pachamanca are traditional earth ovens of the [[Andes|Andean]] regions of [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], and Chile. They are both indigenous practices that pre-date the [[Inca Empire]].\n\n== Middle East and North Africa ==\n\nEarth oven cooking is sometimes used for celebratory cooking in North Africa, particularly [[Morocco]]: a whole lamb is cooked in an earth oven (called a ''tandir'', etymologically related to the Central- and South-Asian [[tandoor]] and possibly descended from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''tinuru'') in a manner similar to the [[Hawaii]]an [[kalua]]. Among [[Bedouin]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads, a simple earth oven is used \u2013 often when men travel without family or kitchen equipment in the desert. The oven is mostly used to bake bread but is also used to cook [[venison]] and [[Desert Monitor|waran]]. When baking bread, the wheat or barley flour is mixed with water and some salt and then placed directly into the hot sands beneath the camp fire. It is then covered again by hot coal and left to bake. This kind of bread is eaten with [[black tea]] (in the absence of [[labneh]]). The sand has to be knocked off carefully before consuming the bread. Sometimes this type of bread is also made when the family is together, because people like the taste of it. The bread is often mixed with molten fat (sometimes oil or butter) and [[labneh]] (goat milk yoghurt) and then formed into a dough before eating. This bread is known as [[Arbut]]<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBjP1AkTDPo|title=Bedouin bread - YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> but may be known under other local names.\n\n==Pacific {{anchor|the Pacific}}==\n[[File:Maori earth oven.svg|thumb|200px|A M\u0101ori earth oven]]\nEarth oven cooking was very common in the past and continues into the present \u2013 particularly for special occasions, since the earth oven process is very labor-intensive.\n\nIn some part-[[Melanesian languages|Melanesian]], [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]], and other closely related languages, the general term is \"umu,\" from the [[Proto-Oceanic]] root *qumun (e.g. [[Tongan language|Tongan]] ''{{okina}}umu'', [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] ''umu'' or ''[[h\u0101ngi]]'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] [[Hawaiian imu|imu]], [[Samoan language|S\u0101moan]] ''umu'', [[Cook Island M\u0101ori]] umu). In some non-Polynesian, part-Polynesian, and Micronesian parts of the Pacific, which some islands use the similar word umu, but not all Micronesian islands having many different languages use that base word umu, however, other words are used instead of umu - in [[Fijian language|Fiji]] it is a ''lovo'' and in [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]] it is a ''koua''.\n\nIn [[Papua New Guinea]], \"mumu\" is used by [[Tok Pisin]] and English speakers, but each of the other [[Papuan languages|hundreds]] of local languages has its own word. In the [[Solomon Islands]] the word in Pidgin is Motu.\n\nDespite the similarities, there are many differences in the details of preparation, their cultural significance, and current usage. Earth ovens are said to have originated in Papua New Guinea and have been adopted by the later arriving Polynesians.\n\n=== Samoan umu ===\n[[File:Pig on the Samoan Umu.jpg|thumb|200px|Samoan ''umu'' preparation with pig and [[taro]] on hot rocks above ground, later covered by leaves for cooking.]]\nThe Samoan ''umu'' uses the same method of cooking as many other earth ovens and is closely related to the Hawaiian earth oven, the ''imu'', which is made underground by digging a pit (although generally the ''umu'' is done above ground rather than in a pit). It is a common day-to-day method of preparing roasted foods, with modern ovens being restricted to western-style houses. In the traditional village house, gas burners will be used inside the house to cook some food in pots. The ''umu'' is sheltered by a roof in case of rain, and it is separate from the house. There are no walls, which allows the smoke from the ''umu'' to escape.\n\nThe Samoan ''umu'' starts with a fire to heat rocks which have been tested by fire as to whether they will explode upon heating. These rocks are used repeatedly but eventually are discarded and replaced when it is felt that they no longer hold enough heat. Once the rocks are hot enough, they are stacked around the parcels of food which are wrapped in banana leaves or aluminium foil. Leaves are then placed over the assembly and the food is left to cook for a few hours until it is fully cooked.\n\n=== Hawaiian imu ===\nThe Hawaiian ''imu'' was the easiest way to cook large quantities of food quickly and efficiently for the [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]]. Because their creation was so labor-intensive, ''imu''s were only created for special events or ceremonies where it would be worth the time and hard work. An ''imu'' is created by first digging a 2- to 4-foot hole in the ground. Porous rocks are heated for a while and subsequently added to the bottom of the pit; next, a layer of banana stumps is added on top of them along with banana leaves. After the vegetation is laid down, the meat, fish, and any other foods are placed on top and covered once again with more vegetation. Wet cocoa sacks are also sometimes added on top to add even more moisture and trap in more heat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n== Europe ==\nAlthough not believed to be common in Europe, earth ovens were used from the Neolithic period onwards with examples from this period found at the sites of Rinyo and Links of Notland on [[Orkney]],<ref>Renfrew, J 2005</ref> but are more commonly known in the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages from sites such as [[Trethellan Farm]], [[Newquay]]{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} and [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]]{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}. Examples from these periods vary in form but are generally bowl-shaped and shallow in depth (30\u201345&nbsp;cm) with diameters between 0.5 and 2 metres.\n\nExceptions do exist, such as the Irish [[Fulacht fiadh]] in common use up to the Middle Ages. In [[Greek cuisine]], there is also a tradition of ''[[Klephts|kleftiko]]'' (\"thief style\") dishes, ascribed to anti-Turkish partisans during the [[Greek War of Independence]], which involve wrapping the food in clay and cooking it in a covered pit, allegedly at first to avoid detection by Turkish forces.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[H\u0101ngi]]\n*[[Kalua]]\n* [[List of ovens]]\n*[[Pit barbecue]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Citation | title = The Roasted and the Boiled: Food Composition and Heat Treatment with Special Emphasis on Pit-Hearth Cooking | journal = Journal of Anthropological Archaeology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201348 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1006/jaar.1997.0303 | author = Wandsnider, L | postscript =. | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=anthropologyfacpub }}\n* {{citation | last = Brennan | first = Jennifer | title = Tradewinds & Coconuts: A Reminiscence & Recipes from the Pacific Islands | publisher = Periplus | year = 2000 | pages = 127\u2013134 | isbn = 978-962-593-819-6 }}\n* {{citation | last1 = Lewin | first1 = J.G | author2 = P.J.

This method is essentially a permanent earth oven made out of clay or firebrick with a constantly burning, very hot fire in the bottom.\n\n== Americas ==\n\nIn many areas, [[archaeologists]] recognize \"pit-hearths\" as being commonly used in the past. In Central [[Texas]], there are large \"burned-rock middens\" speculated to be used for large-scale cooking of plants of various sorts, especially the bulbs of [[sotol]]. The Mayan ''pib'' and Andean ''[[Huatia|watia]]'' are other examples. In [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] nations, [[barbacoa]] is a common practice. Barbacoa, originally a [[Taino]] word referring to the pit itself, consists of slow-roasted meat in a [[maguey]]-lined pit, popular in Mexico alongside [[birria]], [[tortillas]], and [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]].\n\nThe [[New England clam bake|clam bake]], invented by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on the Atlantic seaboard and considered a traditional element of [[New England]] cuisine, traditionally uses a type of ad hoc earth oven (usually built on the beach). A large enough hole is dug into the sand and heated rocks are added to the bottom of the hole. A layer of seaweed is then laid on top to create moisture and steam, followed by the food. Lastly, another layer of seaweed is added to trap in the steam and cook the food, which mainly consists of [[shellfish]] and vegetables.\n\nThe [[Curanto]] of the [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]] consists of [[shellfish]], meat, potatoes, [[milcao]] [[chapalele]]s, and vegetables traditionally prepared in an earth oven. It has spread to the southern areas of [[Chile]].\n\nThe [[huatia]] or watia and pachamanca are traditional earth ovens of the [[Andes|Andean]] regions of [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], and Chile. They are both indigenous practices that pre-date the [[Inca Empire]].\n\n== Middle East and North Africa ==\n\nEarth oven cooking is sometimes used for celebratory cooking in North Africa, particularly [[Morocco]]: a whole lamb is cooked in an earth oven (called a ''tandir'', etymologically related to the Central- and South-Asian [[tandoor]] and possibly descended from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''tinuru'') in a manner similar to the [[Hawaii]]an [[kalua]]. Among [[Bedouin]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads, a simple earth oven is used \u2013 often when men travel without family or kitchen equipment in the desert. The oven is mostly used to bake bread but is also used to cook [[venison]] and [[Desert Monitor|waran]]. When baking bread, the wheat or barley flour is mixed with water and some salt and then placed directly into the hot sands beneath the camp fire. It is then covered again by hot coal and left to bake. This kind of bread is eaten with [[black tea]] (in the absence of [[labneh]]). The sand has to be knocked off carefully before consuming the bread. Sometimes this type of bread is also made when the family is together, because people like the taste of it. The bread is often mixed with molten fat (sometimes oil or butter) and [[labneh]] (goat milk yoghurt) and then formed into a dough before eating. This bread is known as [[Arbut]]<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBjP1AkTDPo|title=Bedouin bread - YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> but may be known under other local names.\n\n==Pacific {{anchor|the Pacific}}==\n[[File:Maori earth oven.svg|thumb|200px|A M\u0101ori earth oven]]\nEarth oven cooking was very common in the past and continues into the present \u2013 particularly for special occasions, since the earth oven process is very labor-intensive.\n\nIn some part-[[Melanesian languages|Melanesian]], [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]], and other closely related languages, the general term is \"umu,\" from the [[Proto-Oceanic]] root *qumun (e.g. [[Tongan language|Tongan]] ''{{okina}}umu'', [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] ''umu'' or ''[[h\u0101ngi]]'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] [[Hawaiian imu|imu]], [[Samoan language|S\u0101moan]] ''umu'', [[Cook Island M\u0101ori]] umu). In some non-Polynesian, part-Polynesian, and Micronesian parts of the Pacific, which some islands use the similar word umu, but not all Micronesian islands having many different languages use that base word umu, however, other words are used instead of umu - in [[Fijian language|Fiji]] it is a ''lovo'' and in [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]] it is a ''koua''.\n\nIn [[Papua New Guinea]], \"mumu\" is used by [[Tok Pisin]] and English speakers, but each of the other [[Papuan languages|hundreds]] of local languages has its own word. In the [[Solomon Islands]] the word in Pidgin is Motu.\n\nDespite the similarities, there are many differences in the details of preparation, their cultural significance, and current usage. Earth ovens are said to have originated in Papua New Guinea and have been adopted by the later arriving Polynesians.\n\n=== Samoan umu ===\n[[File:Pig on the Samoan Umu.jpg|thumb|200px|Samoan ''umu'' preparation with pig and [[taro]] on hot rocks above ground, later covered by leaves for cooking.]]\nThe Samoan ''umu'' uses the same method of cooking as many other earth ovens and is closely related to the Hawaiian earth oven, the ''imu'', which is made underground by digging a pit (although generally the ''umu'' is done above ground rather than in a pit). It is a common day-to-day method of preparing roasted foods, with modern ovens being restricted to western-style houses. In the traditional village house, gas burners will be used inside the house to cook some food in pots. The ''umu'' is sheltered by a roof in case of rain, and it is separate from the house. There are no walls, which allows the smoke from the ''umu'' to escape.\n\nThe Samoan ''umu'' starts with a fire to heat rocks which have been tested by fire as to whether they will explode upon heating. These rocks are used repeatedly but eventually are discarded and replaced when it is felt that they no longer hold enough heat. Once the rocks are hot enough, they are stacked around the parcels of food which are wrapped in banana leaves or aluminium foil. Leaves are then placed over the assembly and the food is left to cook for a few hours until it is fully cooked.\n\n=== Hawaiian imu ===\nThe Hawaiian ''imu'' was the easiest way to cook large quantities of food quickly and efficiently for the [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]]. Because their creation was so labor-intensive, ''imu''s were only created for special events or ceremonies where it would be worth the time and hard work. An ''imu'' is created by first digging a 2- to 4-foot hole in the ground. Porous rocks are heated for a while and subsequently added to the bottom of the pit; next, a layer of banana stumps is added on top of them along with banana leaves. After the vegetation is laid down, the meat, fish, and any other foods are placed on top and covered once again with more vegetation. Wet cocoa sacks are also sometimes added on top to add even more moisture and trap in more heat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n== Europe ==\nAlthough not believed to be common in Europe, earth ovens were used from the Neolithic period onwards with examples from this period found at the sites of Rinyo and Links of Notland on [[Orkney]],<ref>Renfrew, J 2005</ref> but are more commonly known in the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages from sites such as [[Trethellan Farm]], [[Newquay]]{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} and [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]]{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}. Examples from these periods vary in form but are generally bowl-shaped and shallow in depth (30\u201345&nbsp;cm) with diameters between 0.5 and 2 metres.\n\nExceptions do exist, such as the Irish [[Fulacht fiadh]] in common use up to the Middle Ages. In [[Greek cuisine]], there is also a tradition of ''[[Klephts|kleftiko]]'' (\"thief style\") dishes, ascribed to anti-Turkish partisans during the [[Greek War of Independence]], which involve wrapping the food in clay and cooking it in a covered pit, allegedly at first to avoid detection by Turkish forces.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[H\u0101ngi]]\n*[[Kalua]]\n* [[List of ovens]]\n*[[Pit barbecue]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Citation | title = The Roasted and the Boiled: Food Composition and Heat Treatment with Special Emphasis on Pit-Hearth Cooking | journal = Journal of Anthropological Archaeology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201348 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1006/jaar.1997.0303 | author = Wandsnider, L | postscript =. | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=anthropologyfacpub }}\n* {{citation | last = Brennan | first = Jennifer | title = Tradewinds & Coconuts: A Reminiscence & Recipes from the Pacific Islands | publisher = Periplus | year = 2000 | pages = 127\u2013134 | isbn = 978-962-593-819-6 }}\n* {{citation | last1 = Lewin | first1 = J.G | author2 = P.J.
