It began with the [[Congress of Vienna]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 and ended with the onset of the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Although the term itself is a historical reference, it is used mostly to denote the artistic styles that flourished in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts, and interior design. It has influenced later styles, especially those with origins in [[Vienna]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/arts/design/01bied.html</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Prince Metternich by Lawrence.jpeg|thumb|The [[Concert of Europe]], ensured by the Austrian chancellor and foreign minister [[Klemens von Metternich]], enabled the period of peace in which ''Biedermeier'' sensibilities developed.]]\nThe ''Biedermeier'' period does not refer to the era as a whole, but to a particular mood and set of trends that grew out of the unique underpinnings of the time in [[Central Europe]]. There were two driving forces for the development of the period. One was the growing urbanization and industrialization leading to a new urban middle class, which created a new kind of audience for the arts. The other was the political stability prevalent under [[Klemens von Metternich]] following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"Murray\">Christopher John Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXnMs-YDEF4C&pg=PA89 ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760\u20131850'', Volume 1] p. 89, Taylor & Francis, 2004.</ref> The effect was for artists and society in general to concentrate on the domestic and (at least in public) the non-political. Writers, painters, and musicians began to stay in safer territory, and the emphasis on home life for the growing middle class meant a blossoming of furniture design and interior decorating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biedermeier.us/biedermeier.htm |title=Biedermeier \u2013 Elegant, Simple Interior Design |publisher=Biedermeier.us |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\nThe term \"''Biedermeier''\" appeared first in literary circles in the form of a pseudonym, Gottlieb Biedermaier, used by the country doctor [[Adolf Kussmaul]] and lawyer [[Ludwig Eichrodt]] in poems that the duo had published in the [[Munich]] journal ''[[Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter]]''. The verses parodied the people of the era, namely [[Samuel Friedrich Sauter]], a primary teacher and sort of amateurish poet, as depoliticized and [[petite bourgeoisie|petit-bourgeois]].<ref>Ludwig Eichrodt 1827-1892 Renate Begemann Verlag der Badischen Landesbibliothek, 1992, p.115</ref> The name was constructed from the titles of two poems\u2014\"''Biedermanns Abendgem\u00fctlichkeit''\" (Biedermann's Evening Comfort) and \"''Bummelmaiers Klage''\" (Bummelmaier's Complaint)\u2014which [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] had published in 1848 in the same magazine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} As a label for the epoch, the term has been used since around 1900.\n\nDue to the strict control of publication and official censorship, ''Biedermeier'' writers primarily concerned themselves with non-political subjects, like historical fiction and country life. Political discussion was usually confined to the home, in the presence of close friends.\n\nTypical ''Biedermeier'' poets are [[Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso]], [[Friedrich Halm]], [[Eduard M\u00f6rike]], and [[Wilhelm M\u00fcller]], the last two of whom have well-known musical settings by [[Hugo Wolf]] and [[Franz Schubert]] respectively. [[Adalbert Stifter]] was a novelist and short story writer whose work also reflected the concerns of the ''Biedermeier'' movement, particularly with his novel, ''[[Der Nachsommer]]''. As historian [[Carl Emil Schorske]] put it, \"To illustrate and propagate his concept of Bildung, compounded of Benedictine world piety, German humanism, and Biedermeier conventionality, Stifter gave to the world his novel ''Der Nachsommer''\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = [[Carl E.

The period extended into Scandinavia, as disruptions due to numerous states that made up the German nation were not unified by rule from Berlin until 1871. {{clarify|date=January 2016}} These post-''Biedermeier'' struggles, influenced by historicism, created their own styles. Throughout the period, emphasis was kept upon clean lines and minimal ornamentation consistent with basis of ''Biedermeier''' in utilitarian principles. As the period progressed, however, the style moved from the early rebellion against Romantic-era fussiness to increasingly ornate commissions by a rising middle class, eager to show their newfound wealth. The idea of clean lines and utilitarian postures would resurface in the 20th century, continuing into the present day. Middle to late-''Biedermeier'' furniture design represented a heralding towards historicism and revival eras long sought for. Social forces originating in France would change the artisan-patron system that achieved this period of design, first in the German states, and then into Scandinavia. The middle class growth originated in the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain and many ''Biedermeier'' designs owe their simplicity to Georgian lines of the 19th century, as the proliferation of design publications reached the loose German states and Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe ''Biedermeier'' style was a simplified interpretation of the influential French [[Empire style]] of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], which introduced the romance of ancient Roman Empire styles, adapting these to modern early 19th century households. ''Biedermeier'' furniture used locally available materials such as cherry, ash, and oak woods rather than the expensive timbers such as fully imported mahogany. Whilst this timber was available near trading ports such as [[Antwerp]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Stockholm]], it was taxed heavily whenever it passed through another principality. This made mahogany very expensive to use and much local cherry and pearwood was stained to imitate the more expensive timbers. Stylistically, the furniture was simple and elegant. Its construction utilised the ideal of truth through material, something that later influenced the ''[[Bauhaus]]'' and [[Art Deco]] periods.\n\nMany unique designs were created in Vienna, primarily because a young apprentice was examined on his use of material, construction, originality of design, and quality of cabinet work, before being admitted to the league of approved master cabinetmakers. Furniture from the earlier period (1815\u20131830) was the most severe and neoclassical in inspiration. It also supplied the most fantastic forms which the second half of the period (1830\u20131848) lacked, being influenced by the many style publications from Britain. ''Biedermeier'' furniture was the first style in the world that emanated from the growing middle class. It preceded Victoriana and influenced mainly German-speaking countries. In Sweden, [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], whom Napoleon appointed as ambassador to Sweden to sideline his ambitions, abandoned his support for Napoleon in a shrewd political move. Later, after being adopted by the King of Sweden (who was childless), he became Sweden's new king as Karl XIV Johan. The Swedish Karl Johan style, similar to ''Biedermeier'', retained its elegant and blatantly Napoleonic style throughout the 19th century.\n\n''Biedermeier'' furniture and lifestyle was a focus on exhibitions at the Vienna applied arts museum in 1896. The many visitors to this exhibition were so influenced by this fantasy style and its elegance that a new resurgence or revival period became popular amongst European cabinetmakers. This revival period lasted up until the Art Deco style was taken up. ''Biedermeier'' also influenced the various ''Bauhaus'' styles through their truth in material philosophy.\n\nThe original ''Biedermeier'' period changed with the political unrests of 1845\u20131848 (its end date). With the revolutions in European [[historicism (art)|historicism]], furniture of the later years of the period took on a distinct [[Wilhelminism|Wilhelminian]] or [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian style]].\n\nThe term ''Biedermeier'' is also used to refer to a style of clocks made in Vienna in the early 19th century. The clean and simple lines included a light and airy aesthetic, especially in Viennese regulators of the ''{{ill|Laterndluhr|de}}'' and ''Dachluhr'' styles.\n\n== Architecture==\n[[File:Florastoeckl Baden.jpg|left|thumb|House in [[Lower Austria]] in ''Biedermeier'' style]]\n''Biedermeier'' architecture was marked by simplicity and elegance, exemplified by the paintings of [[Jakob Alt]] and [[Carl Spitzweg]].

It began with the [[Congress of Vienna]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 and ended with the onset of the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Although the term itself is a historical reference, it is used mostly to denote the artistic styles that flourished in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts, and interior design. It has influenced later styles, especially those with origins in [[Vienna]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/arts/design/01bied.html</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Prince Metternich by Lawrence.jpeg|thumb|The [[Concert of Europe]], ensured by the Austrian chancellor and foreign minister [[Klemens von Metternich]], enabled the period of peace in which ''Biedermeier'' sensibilities developed.]]\nThe ''Biedermeier'' period does not refer to the era as a whole, but to a particular mood and set of trends that grew out of the unique underpinnings of the time in [[Central Europe]]. There were two driving forces for the development of the period. One was the growing urbanization and industrialization leading to a new urban middle class, which created a new kind of audience for the arts. The other was the political stability prevalent under [[Klemens von Metternich]] following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"Murray\">Christopher John Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXnMs-YDEF4C&pg=PA89 ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760\u20131850'', Volume 1] p. 89, Taylor & Francis, 2004.</ref> The effect was for artists and society in general to concentrate on the domestic and (at least in public) the non-political. Writers, painters, and musicians began to stay in safer territory, and the emphasis on home life for the growing middle class meant a blossoming of furniture design and interior decorating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biedermeier.us/biedermeier.htm |title=Biedermeier \u2013 Elegant, Simple Interior Design |publisher=Biedermeier.us |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\nThe term \"''Biedermeier''\" appeared first in literary circles in the form of a pseudonym, Gottlieb Biedermaier, used by the country doctor [[Adolf Kussmaul]] and lawyer [[Ludwig Eichrodt]] in poems that the duo had published in the [[Munich]] journal ''[[Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter]]''. The verses parodied the people of the era, namely [[Samuel Friedrich Sauter]], a primary teacher and sort of amateurish poet, as depoliticized and [[petite bourgeoisie|petit-bourgeois]].<ref>Ludwig Eichrodt 1827-1892 Renate Begemann Verlag der Badischen Landesbibliothek, 1992, p.115</ref> The name was constructed from the titles of two poems\u2014\"''Biedermanns Abendgem\u00fctlichkeit''\" (Biedermann's Evening Comfort) and \"''Bummelmaiers Klage''\" (Bummelmaier's Complaint)\u2014which [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] had published in 1848 in the same magazine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} As a label for the epoch, the term has been used since around 1900.\n\nDue to the strict control of publication and official censorship, ''Biedermeier'' writers primarily concerned themselves with non-political subjects, like historical fiction and country life. Political discussion was usually confined to the home, in the presence of close friends.\n\nTypical ''Biedermeier'' poets are [[Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso]], [[Friedrich Halm]], [[Eduard M\u00f6rike]], and [[Wilhelm M\u00fcller]], the last two of whom have well-known musical settings by [[Hugo Wolf]] and [[Franz Schubert]] respectively. [[Adalbert Stifter]] was a novelist and short story writer whose work also reflected the concerns of the ''Biedermeier'' movement, particularly with his novel, ''[[Der Nachsommer]]''. As historian [[Carl Emil Schorske]] put it, \"To illustrate and propagate his concept of Bildung, compounded of Benedictine world piety, German humanism, and Biedermeier conventionality, Stifter gave to the world his novel ''Der Nachsommer''\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = [[Carl E.

The period extended into Scandinavia, as disruptions due to numerous states that made up the German nation were not unified by rule from Berlin until 1871. {{clarify|date=January 2016}} These post-''Biedermeier'' struggles, influenced by historicism, created their own styles. Throughout the period, emphasis was kept upon clean lines and minimal ornamentation consistent with basis of ''Biedermeier''' in utilitarian principles. As the period progressed, however, the style moved from the early rebellion against Romantic-era fussiness to increasingly ornate commissions by a rising middle class, eager to show their newfound wealth. The idea of clean lines and utilitarian postures would resurface in the 20th century, continuing into the present day. Middle to late-''Biedermeier'' furniture design represented a heralding towards historicism and revival eras long sought for. Social forces originating in France would change the artisan-patron system that achieved this period of design, first in the German states, and then into Scandinavia. The middle class growth originated in the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain and many ''Biedermeier'' designs owe their simplicity to Georgian lines of the 19th century, as the proliferation of design publications reached the loose German states and Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe ''Biedermeier'' style was a simplified interpretation of the influential French [[Empire style]] of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], which introduced the romance of ancient Roman Empire styles, adapting these to modern early 19th century households. ''Biedermeier'' furniture used locally available materials such as cherry, ash, and oak woods rather than the expensive timbers such as fully imported mahogany. Whilst this timber was available near trading ports such as [[Antwerp]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Stockholm]], it was taxed heavily whenever it passed through another principality. This made mahogany very expensive to use and much local cherry and pearwood was stained to imitate the more expensive timbers. Stylistically, the furniture was simple and elegant. Its construction utilised the ideal of truth through material, something that later influenced the ''[[Bauhaus]]'' and [[Art Deco]] periods.\n\nMany unique designs were created in Vienna, primarily because a young apprentice was examined on his use of material, construction, originality of design, and quality of cabinet work, before being admitted to the league of approved master cabinetmakers. Furniture from the earlier period (1815\u20131830) was the most severe and neoclassical in inspiration. It also supplied the most fantastic forms which the second half of the period (1830\u20131848) lacked, being influenced by the many style publications from Britain. ''Biedermeier'' furniture was the first style in the world that emanated from the growing middle class. It preceded Victoriana and influenced mainly German-speaking countries. In Sweden, [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], whom Napoleon appointed as ambassador to Sweden to sideline his ambitions, abandoned his support for Napoleon in a shrewd political move. Later, after being adopted by the King of Sweden (who was childless), he became Sweden's new king as Karl XIV Johan. The Swedish Karl Johan style, similar to ''Biedermeier'', retained its elegant and blatantly Napoleonic style throughout the 19th century.\n\n''Biedermeier'' furniture and lifestyle was a focus on exhibitions at the Vienna applied arts museum in 1896. The many visitors to this exhibition were so influenced by this fantasy style and its elegance that a new resurgence or revival period became popular amongst European cabinetmakers. This revival period lasted up until the Art Deco style was taken up. ''Biedermeier'' also influenced the various ''Bauhaus'' styles through their truth in material philosophy.\n\nThe original ''Biedermeier'' period changed with the political unrests of 1845\u20131848 (its end date). With the revolutions in European [[historicism (art)|historicism]], furniture of the later years of the period took on a distinct [[Wilhelminism|Wilhelminian]] or [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian style]].\n\nThe term ''Biedermeier'' is also used to refer to a style of clocks made in Vienna in the early 19th century.

Police recruits had begun training in an armory located in Elysian Park in 1924. The LAPRAAC had been founded as a private club in 1925 by LAPD officers to practice their marksmanship. In 1932, their range was used during the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] for shooting events. In recognition, the [[Olympic Committee]] donated the dormitory used as the [[Olympic Village]], and the  dormitory building was dismantled and reassembled at the site of the range in Elysian Fields. The building would eventually house the restaurant for the new training facility that would become the LAPD's Police Academy. From 1935 to 1995, all recruits were trained at the Elysian Field site, when the new Recruit Training Center was opened in Westchester. The Elysian Park facilities, the legacy of Chief Davis, are to be used for in-service training.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Police Academy: a rich history|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1134|work=Los Angeles Police Department: Official Web Site|publisher=Los Angeles Police Department|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe rules and regulations for the new Police Academy were drafted by L.A.P.D Lieutenant [[William H.

Siegel quietly and quickly seized control of vice operations in the region, which put him at odds with [[Los Angeles crime family|local racketeers]], especially [[Jack Dragna]] and [[Guy McAfee]]. As a result of the reform election of 1938, McAfee and others who'd operated the \"Combination\" moved their operations to  Las Vegas, clearing the field for Siegel and his East Coast partners. After Siegel's assassination in June 1947, Cohen was anointed head of the national syndicate's operations in the Southwest - a move that sparked a gang war in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"tereba\">{{Cite book |title=Mickey Cohen: The Life and Crimes of L.A.'s Notorious Mobster |first=Tere |last=Tereba |year=2012 |publisher=ECW Press Inc. |isbn=978-1770410008 |pages=60\u201380; 293 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Corruption continued to flourish in Los Angeles.

Clinton proved to be a [[Social gadfly|gadfly]] who demanded an investigation of vice in Los Angeles, and was turned down by the grand jury foreman. Angered, he went to Mayor  Shaw, who endorsed an independent committee, CIVIC (Citizens Independent Vice Investigating Committee) over the objections of Chief Davis. A corrupt politician who eventually was recalled from office in 1938, Mayor Shaw soon regretted his decision.  CIVIC and its citizen volunteers discovered that vice was rampant in Los Angeles. The profits from 600 brothels, 1,800 bookmaking operations, 23,000 slot machines and prostitution were being used to finance political elections, and the LAPD was working hand-in-hand with the underworld. The grand jury rejected CIVIC's report, and after seeking the advice of Superior Court Judge [[Fletcher Bowron]] (who had overseen a grand jury that nearly brought down L.A. District Attorney [[Buron Fitts]] for corruption), CIVIC issued a minority report that was only published after Judge Bowron's intervention.\n\nA notary public that testified before the grand jury that the foreman was a corrupt ally of Mayor Shaw was beaten by police at his own home in the presence of Fitts and the grand jury foreman. Clinton was harassed by city officials, who boosted his taxes and denied him a license to open up a new cafeterias, while the ''Los Angeles Times'' attacked him and his restaurant chain. Then his home was bombed, most likely by  members of the LAPD secret Intelligence Squad, and the backlash enveloped Mayor Shaw and Chief Davis. The Intelligence Squad wiretapped Clinton's home, as well as the home of Judge Bowron and other members of the reform movement.\n\nA second bombing brought down Mayor Shaw. Investigator Harry Raymond, a former policeman who worked as a private investigator and was digging up dirt on the Shaw administration, survived a car bombing on January 14, 1937. The bomb was planted by LAPD Captain Earl Kynette, who headed  a secret intelligence unit that had Raymond under surveillance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank Shaw - First U.S. Mayor Successfully Recalled From Office|url=http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi06f.htm|publisher=Los Angeles Almanac|accessdate=15 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814071456/http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi06f.htm|archivedate=14 August 2011}}</ref> The LAPD and the ''Los Angeles Times'', which was in league with D.A. Fitts, said the bombing was a publicity stunt staged by Clinton and Raymond, but witnesses testified that the police had had Clinton's house under surveillance. Seven members of the intelligence squad refused to testify before the grand jury, pledging their right not to incriminate themselves. Captain Kynette later was convicted of the bombing.\n\nDistrict Attorney Fitts and Chief Davis began a desultory investigation that led the director of the L.A. [[Chamber of Commerce]] to send a letter to U.S. Senator [[Hiram Johnson]], which called Fitts a psychopath. The public outcry led to Mayor Shaw being recalled by voters in 1938 and the election of Judge Bowron as mayor.\n\nDavis was called as a witness at the trial of Captain Kynette. It was revealed that the LAPD had been operating a vast intelligence operation targeting not only reformers but politicians, judges, and even a federal agent investigating corruption in San Francisco. Chief Davis did poorly on the stand and he was forced from office by Mayor Bowron, who went on to sack many of the senior officers of the LAPD.\n\n==Later life and death==\nDavis died of stroke at a [[Montana]] ranch in 1949.<ref>\"JE DAVIS, RETIRED POLICE CHIEF, DIES.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', Jun 21, 1949.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In the 2008 film ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'', based on these events, Davis was played by [[Colm Feore]].\n*In [[James Ellroy|James Ellroy's]] 2014 novel ''[[Perfidia (James Ellroy novel)|Perfidia]]'', Ellroy provides a fictionalized version of James E.

These migrants were commonly referred to as \"[[Okie]]s\", named for the early migrants who fled Oklahoma after the state was ravaged by the Dust Bowl.\n\nIn 1930s became near to [[fascism]], he supported [[Adolf Hitler]]'s policies against Jews.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wampler|first=Susan L.|url=https://news.usc.edu/128058/historian-tells-a-cautionary-tale-of-nazis-fascists-foiled-in-1940s-l-a/|title=Fascists foiled in 1940s L.A.: USC historian tells the cautionary tale|editor=University of South California|date=October 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Corruption===\nIn 1937, restaurateur [[Clifford Clinton]], a reform-minded businessman who ran a chain of cafeteria-style restaurants, got himself appointed to the [[Los Angeles County]] grand jury. Clinton proved to be a [[Social gadfly|gadfly]] who demanded an investigation of vice in Los Angeles, and was turned down by the grand jury foreman. Angered, he went to Mayor  Shaw, who endorsed an independent committee, CIVIC (Citizens Independent Vice Investigating Committee) over the objections of Chief Davis. A corrupt politician who eventually was recalled from office in 1938, Mayor Shaw soon regretted his decision.  CIVIC and its citizen volunteers discovered that vice was rampant in Los Angeles. The profits from 600 brothels, 1,800 bookmaking operations, 23,000 slot machines and prostitution were being used to finance political elections, and the LAPD was working hand-in-hand with the underworld. The grand jury rejected CIVIC's report, and after seeking the advice of Superior Court Judge [[Fletcher Bowron]] (who had overseen a grand jury that nearly brought down L.A. District Attorney [[Buron Fitts]] for corruption), CIVIC issued a minority report that was only published after Judge Bowron's intervention.\n\nA notary public that testified before the grand jury that the foreman was a corrupt ally of Mayor Shaw was beaten by police at his own home in the presence of Fitts and the grand jury foreman. Clinton was harassed by city officials, who boosted his taxes and denied him a license to open up a new cafeterias, while the ''Los Angeles Times'' attacked him and his restaurant chain. Then his home was bombed, most likely by  members of the LAPD secret Intelligence Squad, and the backlash enveloped Mayor Shaw and Chief Davis. The Intelligence Squad wiretapped Clinton's home, as well as the home of Judge Bowron and other members of the reform movement.\n\nA second bombing brought down Mayor Shaw. Investigator Harry Raymond, a former policeman who worked as a private investigator and was digging up dirt on the Shaw administration, survived a car bombing on January 14, 1937. The bomb was planted by LAPD Captain Earl Kynette, who headed  a secret intelligence unit that had Raymond under surveillance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank Shaw - First U.S. Mayor Successfully Recalled From Office|url=http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi06f.htm|publisher=Los Angeles Almanac|accessdate=15 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814071456/http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi06f.htm|archivedate=14 August 2011}}</ref> The LAPD and the ''Los Angeles Times'', which was in league with D.A. Fitts, said the bombing was a publicity stunt staged by Clinton and Raymond, but witnesses testified that the police had had Clinton's house under surveillance. Seven members of the intelligence squad refused to testify before the grand jury, pledging their right not to incriminate themselves. Captain Kynette later was convicted of the bombing.\n\nDistrict Attorney Fitts and Chief Davis began a desultory investigation that led the director of the L.A. [[Chamber of Commerce]] to send a letter to U.S. Senator [[Hiram Johnson]], which called Fitts a psychopath. The public outcry led to Mayor Shaw being recalled by voters in 1938 and the election of Judge Bowron as mayor.\n\nDavis was called as a witness at the trial of Captain Kynette. It was revealed that the LAPD had been operating a vast intelligence operation targeting not only reformers but politicians, judges, and even a federal agent investigating corruption in San Francisco. Chief Davis did poorly on the stand and he was forced from office by Mayor Bowron, who went on to sack many of the senior officers of the LAPD.\n\n==Later life and death==\nDavis died of stroke at a [[Montana]] ranch in 1949.<ref>\"JE DAVIS, RETIRED POLICE CHIEF, DIES.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', Jun 21, 1949.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In the 2008 film ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'', based on these events, Davis was played by [[Colm Feore]].\n*In [[James Ellroy|James Ellroy's]] 2014 novel ''[[Perfidia (James Ellroy novel)|Perfidia]]'', Ellroy provides a fictionalized version of James E.

Exceptions are, for example, [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]]'s [[FITS]] convention where it is measured from the south and increasing westward, or the [[FITS]] convention of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] where it is measured from the south and increasing eastward.\n\nThe horizontal coordinate system is sometimes called other names, such as the '''az/el system''',<ref>[http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/KSDs/40/html/ksd40-55.4.html hawaii.edu]</ref> the '''alt/az system''', or the '''alt-azimuth system''', from the name of [[altazimuth mount|the mount]] used for [[telescope]]s, whose two axes follow altitude and azimuth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/271741/horizon-system |title=horizon system |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref>\n\n==General observations==\n[[File:Sureal Horizon.jpg|thumb|right|A [[sunset]] over the horizon of the [[Mojave Desert]], [[California]], USA]]\n\nThe horizontal coordinate system is fixed to a location on Earth, not the stars. Therefore, the altitude and azimuth of an object in the sky changes with time, as the object appears to drift across the sky with [[Earth's rotation]]. In addition, since the horizontal system is defined by the observer's local horizon, the same object viewed from different locations on Earth at the same time will have different values of altitude and azimuth.\n\nThe [[Cardinal direction|cardinal points]] on the horizon have specific values of azimuth that are helpful references.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Azimuth Values for the Cardinal Directions\n!Cardinal Point\n!Azimuth\n|-\n|North\n|0\u00b0\n|-\n|East\n|90\u00b0\n|-\n|South\n|180\u00b0\n|-\n|West\n|270\u00b0\n|}\nHorizontal coordinates are very useful for determining the rise and set times of an object in the sky. When an object's altitude is 0\u00b0, it is on the horizon. If at that moment its altitude is increasing, it is rising, but if its altitude is decreasing, it is setting. However, all objects on the [[celestial sphere]] are subject to [[diurnal motion]], which always appears to be westward.\n\nA northern observer can determine whether altitude is increasing or decreasing by instead considering the azimuth of the celestial object:\n*If the azimuth is between 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 (north\u2013east\u2013south), the object is rising.\n*If the azimuth is between 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 (south\u2013west\u2013north), the object is setting.\n\nThere are the following special cases:\n*All directions are south when viewed from the [[North Pole]], and all directions are north when viewed from the [[South Pole]], so the azimuth is undefined in both locations. When viewed from either pole, a star (or any object with fixed [[equatorial coordinates]]) has constant altitude and thus [[circumpolar star|never rises or sets]]. The [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planets]] can rise or set over the span of a year when viewed from the poles because their [[declination]]s are constantly changing.\n*When viewed from the [[Equator]], objects on the celestial poles stay at fixed points on the horizon.\n\nNote that the above considerations are strictly speaking true for the ''geometric'' horizon only. That is, the horizon as it would appear for an observer at sea level on a perfectly smooth Earth without an atmosphere. In practice, the ''apparent'' horizon has a slight negative altitude due to the curvature of Earth, the value of which gets more negative as the observer ascends higher above [[sea level]].
