Presumptive nominee Joe Biden won the primary taking 55.3% of the vote after the distribution of preferences compared to Bernie Sanders 44.7%. On the first count Biden took 49.9% of the vote, Sanders 39.3% and 10.8% for other candidates who had withdrawn from the race, including 7.1% for Warren. On the final count, Biden had 54.8%, Sanders 44.3% and 0.9% of votes were exhausted votes (i.e votes that didn't have a preference for either of the candidates left). This meant excluding exhausted votes that Biden won by 55.3% to 44.7%. \n\nOf the 2,133 first preference votes (10.8%) not cast for Biden or Sanders, overall, 45.6% went to Biden, 46.4% to Sanders and 8% to neither (i.e. were exhausted). Of those who did give a preference for Biden or Sanders, 49.5% went to Biden, 50.5% to Sanders, but this slight advantage for Sanders was not enough to overcome Biden's lead. <ref> https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bee0c9e4b0441ce96c4681/t/5e9275be2121991619e69679/1586656703552/AK+PRP+RCV+Display.pdf </ref>\n\n==Procedure==\nAlaska was scheduled to hold its primary on April 4, 2020,<ref name=\"FHQ-primarydates\">{{cite web|last1=Putnam|first1=Josh|title=The 2020 Presidential Primary Calendar|url=https://frontloading.blogspot.com/p/2020-presidential-primary-calendar.html|publisher=Frontloading HQ|accessdate=June 23, 2019}}</ref> although all in-person voting has been cancelled and mail-in ballots will be counted so long as they are received by April 10, 2020.\n\nThe draft delegate selection plan calls for a party-run primary using ranked-choice voting, abandoning the caucus system used in past years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bohrer|first1=Becky|title=Alaska Democrats consider switching from caucuses to primary for 2020 election|url=https://www.adn.com/politics/2019/04/04/alaska-democrats-consider-switching-from-caucuses-to-primary-for-2020-election/|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=April 4, 2019|accessdate=June 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nVoting with paper ballots was, before the in person primary was cancelled, expected to take place throughout the state from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. until 2:00&nbsp;p.m., though some parts of the [[Alaska Democratic Party]]'s delegate selection plan make note of a voting period between 9:00&nbsp;a.m. and 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Prospective voters would also have had the option to cast electronic and absentee ballots between March 3 and March 24 given the short voting window; this period was extended to include all ballots arriving by April 10 after in person voting was cancelled.

The 14 pledged delegates to the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]] will be allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of the 15 pledged delegates, 9 are district delegates allocated in proportion to the statewide result and another 2 are allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 4 at-large pledged delegates.

Although these speculations have become somewhat well-known within [[popular culture]], particularly the idea of an African connection to the Olmec, they are not regarded as credible by mainstream researchers of [[Mesoamerica]] and are considered [[Fringe theory|fringe theories]].\n\n==Mainstream scientific consensus==\nThe great majority of scholars who specialize in Mesoamerican history, archaeology and linguistics remain unconvinced by alternative origin speculations.<ref>See Grove (1976) or Ortiz de Montellano (1997).</ref> Many are more critical and regard the promotion of such unfounded theories as a form of ethnocentric [[racism]] at the expense of [[indigenous Americans]].<ref>*[http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&file=article&sid=73 Robbing Native American Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs] an article from ''Current Anthropology''.</ref> The [[scientific consensus|consensus]] view maintained across publications in peer-reviewed academic journals that are concerned with Mesoamerican and other pre-Columbian research is that the Olmec and their achievements arose from influences and traditions that were wholly indigenous to the region, or at least the New World, and there is no reliable material evidence to suggest otherwise.<ref>Taube, p. 17.  \"There simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century.\"</ref>  They, and their neighbouring cultures with whom they had contact, developed their own characters which were founded entirely on a remarkably interlinked and ancient cultural and agricultural heritage that was locally shared, but [[cradle of civilization|arose independently]] of any extra-hemispheric influences.<ref>Diehl (2004); Coe (1968).</ref>\n\n==African origins==\n[[File:20041229-Olmec Head (Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda).jpg|right|thumb|[[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] Colossal Head 6, a 3-meter-high Olmec sculpture with lips and nose said to resemble African facial features.]]\nSome writers claim that the Olmecs were related to peoples of Africa - based primarily on their interpretation of facial features of Olmec statues. They additionally contend that epigraphical, genetic, and osteological evidence supports their claims. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\nThe idea was first suggested by Jos\u00e9 Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862 and subsequently published two papers that attributed this head to a \"Negro race.\"<ref>Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar (1869) and Melgar (1871).</ref> The view was espoused in the early 20th century by [[Leo Wiener]] and others.<ref name=\"Ortizde\">Ort\u00edz de Montellano, Bernard & Gabriel Haslip Viera & Warren Barbour 1997</ref> Some modern proponents such as [[Ivan Van Sertima]] and Clyde Ahmad Winters have identified the Olmecs with the [[Mand\u00e9]] people of West Africa.<ref name=\"Ortizde\" />\n\n===Claims of epigraphic evidence===\nSome researchers claim that the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] are related to African scripts.

(September, 1988). \"Black kings of ancient America\", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122.  See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) \"An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'\", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174.</ref> He supports this claim with [[Human cranium|cranial]] evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: [[Tlatilco]] and [[Cerro de las Mesas]]. Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\"<ref>Wiercinski (1972b).</ref>  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.\n\nTo determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid.

These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasian, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.\n\nAn interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.<ref>Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez-Jos\u00e9 et al.

B. Hammond|Andrew Benoni Hammond]]'s [[timber]] operations on the [[United States West Coast]]. She served in this capacity for 11 years before she sank off the [[Columbia Bar]] on the coast of [[Oregon]]. The disaster killed 35 of the 37 passengers aboard and all 25 crewmen. It was the worst maritime accident in the history of Oregon and was attributed to the ship being overloaded with [[railroad tie]]s.\n\n==Construction==\nIn 1903, with his timber operations in full bloom in the [[Pacific Northwest]], timber baron A. B. Hammond began acquiring what became known as \"Hammond\u2032s Navy,\" a flotilla of 72 ships (not all owned simultaneously) that served his operations. The [[flagship]] of this flotilla was ''Francis H. Leggett'', which Hammond named after one of his business partners and commissioned to be the largest ship in the Pacific lumber trade.<ref name=\"Gordon\">Gordon, p. 267</ref> With a capacity of 1.5 million [[board-foot|board-feet]] of [[lumber]], her steel [[Hull (ship)|hull]] was so large that she could not enter many of the ports on U.S. West Coast. Nicknamed \"Hammond's Folly,\" she nevertheless was a commercial success when she arrived on the U.S. West Coast from the Virginia shipyard where she was built.<ref>[http://nyti.ms/1rdDvoD \"The Francis H.

Leggett'' and her [[sister ship]] ''Arctic'' netted Hammond $62,000 in profit, more than the profit of some of his timber operations. The success of ''Francis H. Leggett'' led Hammond to acquire more ships.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/>\n\nLater, ''Francis H. Leggett'' was one of the pioneering ships behind the technique of ocean rafting (also called [[Benson raft]]ing), whereby large rafts of logs were chained together and towed. These rafts could be up to {{convert|700|ft|m}} long and contain up to 11 million board feet of timber.<ref>[http://nyti.ms/XIbECk \"The Largest Lumber Raft,\"] ''The New York Times''.

Leggett'' departed [[Grays Harbor, Washington|Grays Harbor]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], for [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], with a load of railroad ties lashed to her deck. While the weather was calm in Grays Harbor, it worsened as the ship steamed south, where a {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} [[gale]] was blowing off the coast of Oregon. On September 18, the ship\u2032s cargo of railroad ties began to shift, and a hatch cover was torn off by the storm, allowing waves to flood into the ship.<ref name=\"engines\">Lienhard, John H.

Leggett''''' was an American-flagged [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] [[schooner]] built in 1903 by [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Virginia]], as a timber-hauling ship serving [[A. B. Hammond|Andrew Benoni Hammond]]'s [[timber]] operations on the [[United States West Coast]]. She served in this capacity for 11 years before she sank off the [[Columbia Bar]] on the coast of [[Oregon]]. The disaster killed 35 of the 37 passengers aboard and all 25 crewmen. It was the worst maritime accident in the history of Oregon and was attributed to the ship being overloaded with [[railroad tie]]s.\n\n==Construction==\nIn 1903, with his timber operations in full bloom in the [[Pacific Northwest]], timber baron A. B. Hammond began acquiring what became known as \"Hammond\u2032s Navy,\" a flotilla of 72 ships (not all owned simultaneously) that served his operations. The [[flagship]] of this flotilla was ''Francis H. Leggett'', which Hammond named after one of his business partners and commissioned to be the largest ship in the Pacific lumber trade.<ref name=\"Gordon\">Gordon, p. 267</ref> With a capacity of 1.5 million [[board-foot|board-feet]] of [[lumber]], her steel [[Hull (ship)|hull]] was so large that she could not enter many of the ports on U.S. West Coast. Nicknamed \"Hammond's Folly,\" she nevertheless was a commercial success when she arrived on the U.S. West Coast from the Virginia shipyard where she was built.<ref>[http://nyti.ms/1rdDvoD \"The Francis H. Leggett Launched,\"] ''The New York Times''. Feb. 1, 1903. Retrieved Sept. 21, 2014.</ref> In 1905 alone, ''Francis H. Leggett'' and her [[sister ship]] ''Arctic'' netted Hammond $62,000 in profit, more than the profit of some of his timber operations. The success of ''Francis H. Leggett'' led Hammond to acquire more ships.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/>\n\nLater, ''Francis H. Leggett'' was one of the pioneering ships behind the technique of ocean rafting (also called [[Benson raft]]ing), whereby large rafts of logs were chained together and towed. These rafts could be up to {{convert|700|ft|m}} long and contain up to 11 million board feet of timber.<ref>[http://nyti.ms/XIbECk \"The Largest Lumber Raft,\"] ''The New York Times''. Aug. 24, 1906. Retrieved Sept. 21, 2014.</ref> After some years of success, the practice was banned by the [[United States Congress]] in 1912 after several rafts broke up in storms, spreading large logs up and down the coast and creating a hazard to shipping.<ref>Gordon, p. 269</ref>\n\n==Sinking==\nOn September 17, 1914, ''Francis H. Leggett'' departed [[Grays Harbor, Washington|Grays Harbor]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], for [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], with a load of railroad ties lashed to her deck. While the weather was calm in Grays Harbor, it worsened as the ship steamed south, where a {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} [[gale]] was blowing off the coast of Oregon. On September 18, the ship\u2032s cargo of railroad ties began to shift, and a hatch cover was torn off by the storm, allowing waves to flood into the ship.<ref name=\"engines\">Lienhard, John H.

The \"100 Page\" count included both sides of the front and back covers as pages.  Each numbered issue appearing under this title featured a wrap-around cover with all editorial content  and no advertisements.  Versions after late 1973 included advertisements.\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe ''DC 100 Page Super Spectacular'' series was the \"next wave\" of \"Giant\" comics featuring reprint stories in the company's vast trove of tales during a 1971 editorial transition at DC Comics, when the Superman titles were taken over by [[Julius Schwartz]] after the retirement of [[Mort Weisinger]], who had overseen all Superman-related comics since the early 1950s.  The first DC Giant was the \"[[80 Page Giant]]\", which ran as an annual and then alternately as its own title and as part of regular, ongoing titles throughout the 1960s.  Comics prices increased quickly in the early part of the 1970s. As page count dropped to accommodate the 25\u00a2 price, the 80 Page Giant became simply \"Giant\" comics and DC then quickly switched to a monthly 52-page format at the 25\u00a2 price point and DC 100 Page Super Spectacular series became the standard for \"Giant\" comics.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Eury|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Eury|title= A Look at DC's Super Specs|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 81|pages= 4\u201310|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= July 2015|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\n== Editorial ==\nThis comic series is one of [[E. Nelson Bridwell]]'s contributions to DC's history and its growing array of characters.<ref>Eury, p. 11</ref> As DC acquired the rights to [[Quality Comics]] characters, [[Fawcett Comics]] characters, and other folded comics companies' characters, a quick way to secure their rights was by publishing reprints featuring these characters.  DC characters such as [[Johnny Quick]] made reappearances in these reprints and sometimes gained some popularity among readers.  These were stand-alone stories, all written to capture any first-time reader when they were originally published, so the reader needed no real introduction to many of these characters.  There were brief synopses provided on the inside cover, identifying and giving background to the characters shown on the wraparound cover and a table of contents that provided any information one would need on [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters that had not been seen in a while.  Johnny Quick makes the first of what will turn out to be numerous appearances in many of the 100 Pagers. Quality Comics characters such as [[Max Mercury]] (known in the Golden Age as \"Quicksilver\", and named such on the wraparound cover of DC-11), the [[Black Condor]], the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] and [[Doll Man]] made their first DC Comics appearances in these books.\n\n== Collectibility ==\nWhile the books languished in relative obscurity in the collector's market for the first 20-odd years of their existence, their ''[[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]'' estimated value from 1973&ndash;1995 did not exceed $3.00, these comic books - particularly the first three issues - have become some of the most sought-after Bronze Age books. Their ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide'' estimated value has increased from approximately $45.00 to hundreds of dollars each in the 1997-2006 editions.   The first three issues were published in relatively small numbers and were entirely editorial content.  DC-5, which was a romance comic and, therefore, published in very small numbers, has been heralded as the \"rarest of all Bronze Age books\" by the ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''.  The first issue to feature super-heroes was DC-6 which had a wraparound cover by [[Neal Adams]] featuring the [[Justice League of America]] and [[Justice Society of America]]. This issue also listed every comic book character that DC owned in all of the spaces that otherwise would have been occupied by house ads.  For the remainder of the series, super-heroes would dominate the title.\n\n== Numbering ==\nThe series is numbered oddly.  There were no issues 1, 2, or 3.<ref>Eury, pp. 8-9: \"The reasons for this numbering are unclear, and those DC editors and executives who might have shed light on this conundrum are no longer with us.\"</ref>  The first three issues published (4, 5, and 6) had subtitles \u2014 the first two of which were later used for ongoing comics series. The title ran as a part of regular, ongoing series titles for seven issues with the prefix \"DC\" added to the numbering (DC-7 through DC-13) in addition to the masthead title's own numbering (e.g., Superman #245 was also DC-7). It reverted to its own title again (DC-14 through DC-22) utilizing as cover titles the existing titles of regular, ongoing series, but not being part of those regular series' numbering.  A planned \"DC-23\" was mentioned in the [[Comic book letter column|letters column]] of DC-22 by editor E. Nelson Bridwell, but it became ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' #8<ref>{{Gcdb issue|id= 26954|title= ''Shazam!'' #8}}</ref> and the Super Spectacular's own numbering disappeared, while advertisements were added.  The \"DC 100 Page Super Spectacular\" title itself was used on another 96 issues of varying regular, ongoing titles through 1975.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 158|quote = To help combat its own growing costs, DC Comics...reduced the total amount of books produced by more than 25 percent.  A portion of that drastic drop-off, however, was attributed to a huge increase in 100-page super-spectaculars and giants.  For example, marrying Superman's supporting cast into one ''Superman Family'' series saved publishing costs on three individual titles alone.}}</ref> It began to become a regular version of selected ongoing titles for about a year and then increased its cost to 60\u00a2 with the publishing date of April&ndash;May 1974 and continued this pricing until its end.

One shots may feature as many as 9 stories, though they may all be reprinted material. \n\nThe revival titles were initially a Wal-Mart exclusive, which ended in October 2019.

The \"100 Page\" count included both sides of the front and back covers as pages.  Each numbered issue appearing under this title featured a wrap-around cover with all editorial content  and no advertisements.  Versions after late 1973 included advertisements.\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe ''DC 100 Page Super Spectacular'' series was the \"next wave\" of \"Giant\" comics featuring reprint stories in the company's vast trove of tales during a 1971 editorial transition at DC Comics, when the Superman titles were taken over by [[Julius Schwartz]] after the retirement of [[Mort Weisinger]], who had overseen all Superman-related comics since the early 1950s.  The first DC Giant was the \"[[80 Page Giant]]\", which ran as an annual and then alternately as its own title and as part of regular, ongoing titles throughout the 1960s.  Comics prices increased quickly in the early part of the 1970s. As page count dropped to accommodate the 25\u00a2 price, the 80 Page Giant became simply \"Giant\" comics and DC then quickly switched to a monthly 52-page format at the 25\u00a2 price point and DC 100 Page Super Spectacular series became the standard for \"Giant\" comics.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Eury|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Eury|title= A Look at DC's Super Specs|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 81|pages= 4\u201310|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= July 2015|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\n== Editorial ==\nThis comic series is one of [[E. Nelson Bridwell]]'s contributions to DC's history and its growing array of characters.<ref>Eury, p. 11</ref> As DC acquired the rights to [[Quality Comics]] characters, [[Fawcett Comics]] characters, and other folded comics companies' characters, a quick way to secure their rights was by publishing reprints featuring these characters.  DC characters such as [[Johnny Quick]] made reappearances in these reprints and sometimes gained some popularity among readers.  These were stand-alone stories, all written to capture any first-time reader when they were originally published, so the reader needed no real introduction to many of these characters.  There were brief synopses provided on the inside cover, identifying and giving background to the characters shown on the wraparound cover and a table of contents that provided any information one would need on [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters that had not been seen in a while.  Johnny Quick makes the first of what will turn out to be numerous appearances in many of the 100 Pagers. Quality Comics characters such as [[Max Mercury]] (known in the Golden Age as \"Quicksilver\", and named such on the wraparound cover of DC-11), the [[Black Condor]], the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] and [[Doll Man]] made their first DC Comics appearances in these books.\n\n== Collectibility ==\nWhile the books languished in relative obscurity in the collector's market for the first 20-odd years of their existence, their ''[[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]'' estimated value from 1973&ndash;1995 did not exceed $3.00, these comic books - particularly the first three issues - have become some of the most sought-after Bronze Age books. Their ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide'' estimated value has increased from approximately $45.00 to hundreds of dollars each in the 1997-2006 editions.   The first three issues were published in relatively small numbers and were entirely editorial content.  DC-5, which was a romance comic and, therefore, published in very small numbers, has been heralded as the \"rarest of all Bronze Age books\" by the ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''.  The first issue to feature super-heroes was DC-6 which had a wraparound cover by [[Neal Adams]] featuring the [[Justice League of America]] and [[Justice Society of America]]. This issue also listed every comic book character that DC owned in all of the spaces that otherwise would have been occupied by house ads.  For the remainder of the series, super-heroes would dominate the title.\n\n== Numbering ==\nThe series is numbered oddly.  There were no issues 1, 2, or 3.<ref>Eury, pp. 8-9: \"The reasons for this numbering are unclear, and those DC editors and executives who might have shed light on this conundrum are no longer with us.\"</ref>  The first three issues published (4, 5, and 6) had subtitles \u2014 the first two of which were later used for ongoing comics series. The title ran as a part of regular, ongoing series titles for seven issues with the prefix \"DC\" added to the numbering (DC-7 through DC-13) in addition to the masthead title's own numbering (e.g., Superman #245 was also DC-7). It reverted to its own title again (DC-14 through DC-22) utilizing as cover titles the existing titles of regular, ongoing series, but not being part of those regular series' numbering.  A planned \"DC-23\" was mentioned in the [[Comic book letter column|letters column]] of DC-22 by editor E. Nelson Bridwell, but it became ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' #8<ref>{{Gcdb issue|id= 26954|title= ''Shazam!'' #8}}</ref> and the Super Spectacular's own numbering disappeared, while advertisements were added.  The \"DC 100 Page Super Spectacular\" title itself was used on another 96 issues of varying regular, ongoing titles through 1975.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 158|quote = To help combat its own growing costs, DC Comics...reduced the total amount of books produced by more than 25 percent.

One shots may feature as many as 9 stories, though they may all be reprinted material. \n\nThe revival titles were initially a Wal-Mart exclusive, which ended in October 2019.
