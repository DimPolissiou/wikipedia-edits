He served as Prime Minister from 1852 until 1855 in a coalition between the Whigs and Peelites, with Radical and Irish support. The [[Aberdeen ministry]] was filled with powerful and talented politicians, whom Aberdeen was largely unable to control and direct. Despite his trying to avoid this happening, it took Britain into the [[Crimean War]], and fell when its conduct became unpopular, after which Aberdeen retired from politics.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family with largest estates in Scotland, his personal life was marked by the loss of both parents by the time he was eleven, and of his first wife after only seven years of a happy marriage. His daughters died young, and his relations with his sons were difficult.<ref>MacIntyre, 644</ref> He travelled extensively in Europe, including Greece, and he had a serious interest in the classical civilisations and their archaeology. His Scottish estates having been neglected by his father, he devoted himself (when he came of age) to modernising them according to the latest standards.\n\nAfter 1812 he became a diplomat, and in 1813, at age 29, was given the critically important embassy to [[Vienna]], where he organized and financed the [[War of the Sixth Coalition| sixth and final coalition that defeated Napoleon.]] His rise in politics was equally rapid and lucky, and \"two accidents \u2014 [[George Canning|Canning's]] death and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s impulsive acceptance of the Canningite resignations\" led to his becoming Foreign Secretary for Prime Minister Wellington in 1828 despite \"an almost ludicrous lack of official experience\"; he had been a minister for less than six months. After holding the position for two years, followed by another cabinet role, by 1841 his experience led to his appointment as Foreign Secretary again under [[Robert Peel]] for a longer term.<ref>MacIntyre, 641</ref> His diplomatic successes include organizing the coalition against Napoleon In 1812\u201314, normalizing relations with post-Napoleonic France, settling the old border dispute between Canada and the United States, and ending the [[First Opium War]] with China in 1842, whereby [[Hong Kong]] was obtained. Aberdeen was a poor speaker, but this scarcely mattered in the [[House of Lords]]. He exhibited a \"dour, awkward, occasionally sarcastic exterior\".<ref>MacIntyre, 642, 644.</ref>  His friend [[William Ewart Gladstone]], said of him that he was \"the man in public life of all others whom I have {{em|loved}}.

On his return to Britain, he founded the Athenian Society. In 1805, he married [[Catherine Hamilton-Gordon, Countess of Aberdeen|Lady Catherine Elizabeth]], daughter of [[John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn]].\n\n==Political and diplomatic career, 1805\u20131828==\nIn December 1805 Lord Aberdeen took his seat as a [[Tory]] [[Representative peer|Scottish representative peer]] in the [[House of Lords]]. In 1808, he was created a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]]. Following the death of his wife from [[tuberculosis]] in 1812 he joined the Foreign Service. He was appointed [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Austria|Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria]],<ref name=EB/> and signed the [[Treaty of T\u00f6plitz]] between Britain and Austria in [[Vienna]] in October 1813. In the company of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|the Austrian Emperor, Francis II]], he was an observer at the decisive Coalition victory of the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813; he had met [[Napoleon]] in his earlier travels. He became one of the central diplomatic figures in European diplomacy at this time,<ref name=EB/> and he was one of the British representatives at the [[Congress of Ch\u00e2tillon]] in February 1814, and at the negotiations which led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] in May of that year.<ref name=EB/><ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 4</ref>\n\nAberdeen was greatly affected by the aftermath of war which he witnessed at first hand.  He wrote home:\n\n<blockquote>The near approach of war and its effects are horrible beyond what you can conceive.  The whole road from Prague to [Teplitz] was covered with waggons full of wounded, dead, and dying.  The shock and disgust and pity produced by such scenes are beyond what I could have supposed possible...the scenes of distress and misery have sunk deeper in my mind.  I have been quite haunted by them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur|title=The Earl of Aberdeen|date=1893|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston and Company|location=London|page=31}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Shield of arms of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, KG, KT, FRSE, FRS, PC.png|thumb|upright|left|Shield of arms of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, as displayed on his [[Order of the Garter]] stall plate in [[St George's Chapel]].]]\nReturning home he was created a peer of the United Kingdom as '''Viscount Gordon''', of Aberdeen in the County of Aberdeen (1814),<ref name=EB/> and made a member of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. In July 1815 he married his former sister-in-law Harriet, daughter of John Douglas, and widow of [[James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton]]; the marriage was much less happy than his first.

It was during his second stint as Foreign Secretary that he had the harbor settlement of 'Little Hong Kong', on the south side of Hong Kong Island, named after him. It was probably the most productive period of his career; he settled two disagreements with the US: the northeast boundary dispute by the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] (1842), and the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon dispute]] by the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846.<ref name=EB/>  He enjoyed the trust of [[Queen Victoria]], which was still important for a Foreign Secretary. He worked closely with [[Henry Bulwer]], his ambassador to Madrid, to help arrange marriages for Queen Isabella and her younger sister the Infanta Luisa Fernanda. They helped stabilize Spain's internal and external relations.<ref>Laurence Guymer,  \"The Wedding Planners: Lord Aberdeen, Henry Bulwer, and the Spanish Marriages, 1841\u20131846.\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' 21.4 (2010): 549-573.</ref> He sought better relations with France, relying on his friendship with [[Guizot]]. However Britain was annoyed with France on a series of issues, especially French colonial policies, the right to search slave ships, the French desire to control Belgium, disputes in the Pacific, and French intervention in Morocco.<ref>A.B. Cunningham, \"Peel, Aberdeen and the Entente cordiale.\" ''Historical Research'' 30.82 (1957): 189-206.</ref><ref>R.W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 223-41. </ref>\n\n===In opposition===\nAberdeen again followed his leader and resigned with Peel over the issue of the [[Corn Laws]].  After Peel's death in 1850 he became the recognised leader of the [[Peelites]]. In July 1852, a general election of Parliament was held which resulted in the election of 325 Tory/Conservative party members to Parliament. This represented 42.7% of the seats in Parliament. The main opposition to the Tory/Conservative Party was the Whig Party, which elected 292 members of the party to the Parliament in July 1852. Although occupying fewer seats than the Tory/Conservatives, the Whigs had a chance to draw support from the minor parties and independents who were also elected in July 1852. Lord Aberdeen was one of 38 Peelites elected to members of Parliament independently of the Tory/Conservative Party.<ref>Lucille Iremonger, ''Lord Aberdeen: a biography of the fourth Earl of Aberdeen, KG, KT, Prime Minister 1852\u20131855'' (1978).</ref>\n\nWhile the Peelites agreed with the Whigs on issues dealing with international trade, there were other issues on which the Peelites disagreed with the Whigs. Indeed, Lord Aberdeen's own dislike of the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851|Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill]], the rejection of which he failed to secure in 1851, prevented him from joining the Whig government of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] in 1851. Additionally, 113 of the members of Parliament elected in July 1852 were [[Free Traders]].<ref>Karl Marx, \"Result of the Elections\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Freederick Engels: Volume 11,'' p. 352.</ref> These members agreed with the Peelites on the repeal of the \"[[Corn Laws]],\" but they felt that the tariffs on ''all'' consumer products should be removed.\n\nFurthermore, 63 members of Parliament elected in 1852 were members of the \"[[Independent Irish Party|Irish Brigade]],\" who voted with the Peelites and the Whigs for the repeal of the Corn Laws because they sought an end the Great Irish Famine by means of cheaper wheat and bread prices for the poor and middle classes in Ireland.  Currently, however, the Free Traders and the Irish Brigade had disagreements with the Whigs that prevented them from joining with the Whigs to form a government. Accordingly, the Tory/Conservative Party leader the [[Earl of Derby]] was asked to form a \"minority government\". Derby appointed [[Benjamin Disraeli]] as the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the minority government.\n\nWhen in December 1852 Disraeli submitted his budget to Parliament on behalf of the minority government, the Peelites, the Free Traders, and the Irish Brigade were all alienated by the proposed budget. Accordingly, those groups suddenly forgot their differences with the Whig Party and voted with the Whigs against the proposed budget. The vote was 286 in favour of the budget and 305 votes against the budget.<ref>Karl Marx, \"The Defeat of the Ministry\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: volume 11,'' p. 466.</ref> Because the leadership of the minority government had made the vote on the budget vote a \"vote of confidence\", the defeat of the Disraeli budget was a \"vote of no confidence\" in the minority government and meant its downfall. Accordingly, Lord Aberdeen was asked to form a new government.\n\n==Prime Minister, 1852\u20131855==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen]], [[Premiership of Lord Aberdeen]], [[Premiership of the Earl of Aberdeen]], [[Prime ministership of Lord Aberdeen]], [[Prime ministership of the Earl of Aberdeen]] -->\n{{Further|Aberdeen ministry}}\n[[File:George Hamilton-Gordon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Aberdeen in the 1850s]] Following the downfall of the Tory/Conservative minority government under Lord Derby in December 1852, Lord Aberdeen formed a new government from the coalition of Free Traders, Peelites, and Whigs that had voted no confidence in the minority government. Lord Aberdeen was able to put together a coalition that held 53.8% of the seats of Parliament. Thus Lord Aberdeen, a Peelite, became Prime Minister and headed a coalition ministry of Whigs and Peelites.\n\nAlthough united on international trade issues and on questions of domestic reform, his cabinet also contained Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, who were certain to differ on questions of foreign policy. [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] wrote in his ''Memoirs'', \"In the present cabinet are five or six first-rate men of equal, or nearly equal, pretensions, none of them likely to acknowledge the superiority or defer to the opinions of any other, and every one of these five or six considering himself abler and more important than their premier\"; and [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] wrote, \"It is a powerful team, but it will require good driving\", which Aberdeen was unable to provide.  During the  administration, much trouble was caused by the rivalry between Palmerston and Russell, and over the course of it Palmerston managed to out-manoeuvre Russell to emerge as the Whig heir apparent.<ref>Martin, 110\u2013112</ref>  The cabinet also included a single Radical, [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]], but much later, when justifying to the Queen his own new appointments, Gladstone told her: \"For instance, even in Ld Aberdeen's Govt, in 52, Sir William Molesworth had been selected, at that time, a very advanced Radical, but who was perfectly harmless, & took little, or no part.... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office\", which she admitted had been the case.<ref>Queen Victoria's Journals, Wednesday 28 April 1880, Windsor Castle, from Princess Beatrice's copies, Volume72 (1 January 1880-18 August 1880), p.167, [http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItem.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=2738816315824&filterSequence=0&PageNumber=1&ItemNumber=14&ItemID=qvj17246&volumeType=PSBEA online from the Bodleian Library]</ref>\n\nOne of the foreign policy issues on which Palmerston and Russell disagreed was the type of relationship that Britain should have with France and especially France's ruler, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]]. Bonaparte was the nephew of the famous [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had become dictator and then Emperor of France from 1804 until 1814. The younger Bonaparte had been elected to a three-year term as President of the Second Republic of France on 20 December 1848. The Constitution of the Second Republic limited the President to a single term in office. Thus, Louis Bonaparte would be unable to succeed himself and after 20 December 1851 would no longer be President. Consequently, on 2 December 1851, shortly before the end of his single three-year term in office was to expire, [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Bonaparte staged a coup against the Second Republic in France]], disbanded the elected Constituent Assembly, arrested some of the Republican leaders, and declared himself Emperor Napoleon III of France. This coup upset many democrats in England as well as in France. Some British government officials felt that Louis Bonaparte was seeking foreign adventure in the spirit of his uncle, Napoleon I. Consequently, these officials felt that any close association with Bonaparte would eventually lead Britain into another series of wars, like the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France and Napoleon]] dating from 1793 until 1815. British relations with France had scarcely improved since 1815. As prime minister, the Earl of Aberdeen was one of these officials who feared France and Bonaparte.<ref>Jonathan Philip Parry,  \"The impact of Napoleon III on British politics, 1851\u20131880.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (Sixth Series) 11 (2001): 147\u2013175.</ref>\n\nHowever, other British government officials were beginning to worry more about the rising political dominance of the [[Russian Empire]] in eastern Europe and the corresponding decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Lord Palmerston]] at the time of Louis Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup was serving as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Whig government of Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]. Without informing the rest of the cabinet or Queen Victoria, Palmerston had sent a private note to the French ambassador endorsing Louis Bonaparte's coup and congratulating Louis Bonaparte himself on the coup. Queen Victoria and members of the Russell government demanded that Palmerston be dismissed as Foreign Minister. Russell requested Palmerston's resignation and Palmerston reluctantly provided it.\n\nIn February 1852, Palmerston took revenge on Russell by voting with the Conservatives in a \"no confidence\" vote against the Russell government. This brought an end to the Russell Whig government and set the stage for a general election in July 1852 which eventually brought the Conservatives to power in a minority government under the Earl of Derby. Later in the year, another problem facing the Earl of Aberdeen in the formation of his own new government in December 1852 was Lord John Russell himself. Russell was the leader of the Whig Party, the largest group in the coalition government. Consequently, Lord Aberdeen, was required to appoint Russell as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which he had done on 29 December 1852. However, Russell sometimes liked to use this position to speak for the whole government, as if he were the prime minister. In 1832, Russell had been nicknamed \"Finality John\" because of his statement that the 1832 Reform Act had just been approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords would be the \"final\" expansion of the vote in Britain. There would be no further extension of the ballot to the common people of Britain. However, as political pressure in favour of further reform had risen over the twenty years since 1832, Russell had changed his mind. Russell had said, in January 1852, that he intended to introduce a new reform bill into the House of Commons which would equalise the populations of the districts from which members of Parliament were elected. Probably as a result of their continuing feud, Palmerston declared himself against this Reform Bill of 1852. As a result, support for the bill dwindled and Russell was forced to change his mind again and not introduce any Reform Bill in 1852.<ref>C. H. Stuart, \"The Formation of the Coalition Cabinet of 1852.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (Fifth Series) 4 (1954): 45\u201368.</ref>\n\nIn order to form the coalition government, the Earl of Aberdeen had been required to appoint both Palmerston and Russell to his cabinet. Because of the controversy surrounding Palmerston's removal as [[Foreign Minister|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], Palmerston could not now be appointed Foreign Minister again so soon after his removal from that position. Accordingly, on 28 December 1852, Aberdeen appointed Palmerston as [[Home Secretary]] and appointed Russell as Foreign Minister.<ref>Stuart, \"The Formation of the Coalition Cabinet of 1852.\" (1954): 45\u201368.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Norman McCord|author2=Bill Purdue|title=British History 1815\u20131914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9yjeJEfq7cC&pg=PA269|year=2007|publisher=Oxford UP|page=269ff|isbn=9780199261642}}</ref>\n\n==The \"Eastern Question\"==\nGiven the differences of opinion within the Lord Aberdeen cabinet over the direction of foreign policy with regard to relations between Britain and France under Napoleon III, it is not surprising that debate raged within the government as Louis Bonaparte, now assuming the title of Emperor Napoleon III. As Prime Minister of the Peelite/Whig coalition government, Aberdeen eventually led Britain into war on the side of the French and Ottomans against the Russian Empire. This war would eventually be called the [[Crimean War]], but throughout the foreign policy negotiations surrounding the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, which would continue throughout the middle and end of nineteenth century, the problem would be referred to as the \"[[Eastern Question]]\".<ref>M. S. Anderson. ''The Eastern Question, 1774\u20131923'' (London, 1966),  pp. 110\u2013149.</ref>\n\nThe cabinet was bitterly divided. Palmerston stirred up anti-reform feeling in Parliament and pro-war public opinion to out-maneuver Russell. The result was that the weak Aberdeen government went to war with Russia as the result of internal British political rivalries. Aberdeen accepted Russian arguiments at face value because he sympathised with Russian interests against French pressure and.was not in favour of the Crimean War. However, he was unable to resist the pressure that was being exerted on him by Palmerston's faction. In the end, the Crimean War proved to be the downfall of his government.<ref>David F. Krein. \"War and Reform: Russell, Palmerston and the Struggle for Power in the Aberdeen Cabinet, 1853\u201354\". ''Maryland Historian'' (1976) 7#2 pp. 67\u201384.</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Question flared up on 2 December 1852, with the Napoleon's coup against the Second Republic. As Napoleon III was forming his new imperial government, he sent an ambassador to the Ottoman Empire with instructions to assert France's right to protect Christian sites in Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]]. The Ottoman Empire agreed to this condition to avoid conflict or even war with France. Aberdeen, as Foreign Secretary in 1845, had himself tacitly authorised the construction of the first [[Christ Church, Jerusalem|Anglican church in Jerusalem]], following his predecessor's commission in 1838 of the first European Consul in Jerusalem on Britain's behalf, which lead to series of successive appointments by other nations. Both resulted from [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s canvassing with substantial public support.<ref name= Lewis>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2 January 2014 | location = Cambridge | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}</ref><ref name= sokolow>{{cite book | last = Sokolow | first = Nahum| title = History of Zionism, 1600-1918 | publisher = Forgotten Books | date = 2015-09-27 | volume= 1 | location = Charleston SC USA | page = 418 | isbn =9781330331842}}</ref><ref name= Hyamson>[[Albert Montefiore Hyamson|Hyamson, Albert M.]], ''The British Consulate in Jerusalem in Relation to the Jews of Palestine, 1838\u20131914'', {{ISBN|978-0404562786}}, cited in Lewis, D.</ref> \n\nNevertheless, Britain became increasingly worried about the situation in Turkey, and Prime Minister Aberdeen sent [[Lord Stratford de Redcliffe]], a diplomat with vast experience in Turkey, as a special envoy to the Ottoman Empire to guard British interests. Russia protested the Turkish agreement with the French as a violation of the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] of 1778, which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)]]. Under the treaty, the Russians had been granted the exclusive right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly, on 7 May 1853, the Russians sent Prince [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]], one their premier statesmen, to negotiate a settlement of the issue.<ref>Karl Marx. \"Affairs in Holland\u2014Denmark\u2014Conversion of the British Debt\u2014India, Turkey and Russia\". In ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 105.</ref> Prince Menshikov called the attention of the Turks to the fact that during the Russo-Turkish War, the Russians had occupied the Turkish-controlled provinces of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] on the north bank of the Danube River, and he reminded them that pursuant to the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca, the Russians had returned these \"Danubian provinces\" to Ottoman control in exchange for the right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly, the Turks reversed themselves and agreed with the Russians.\n\nThe French sent one of their premier [[ship of the line|ships-of-the-line]], the ''[[French ship Charlemagne (1852)|Charlemagne]]'', to the Black Sea as a show of force. In light of the French show of force, the Turks, again, reversed themselves and recognised the French right to protect the Christian sites. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was advising the Ottomans during this time,<ref>Karl Marx. \"Mazzini\u2014Switzerland and Austria\u2014Turkish Question\". In ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 109.</ref> and later it was alleged that he had been instrumental in persuading the Turks to reject the Russian arguments.\n\nAs war became inevitable, Aberdeen wrote to Russell:\n<blockquote>The abstract justice of the cause, although indisputable, is but a poor consolation for the inevitable calamities of all war, or for a decision which I am not without fear may prove to have been impolitic and unwise. My conscience upbraids me the more, because seeing, as I did from the first, all that was to be apprehended, it is possible that by a little more energy and vigour, not on the Danube, but in Downing Street, it might have been prevented.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walpole|first1=Spencer|title=The Life of Lord John Russell \u2013 Volume II|date=1889|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London|page=204}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Crimean War 1853\u20131856==\n[[File:Coalition Ministry of 1854.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The coalition [[Aberdeen ministry]] of 1854 after a painting by [[John Gilbert (painter)|Sir John Gilbert]], 1855]]\n\nIn response this latest change of mind by the Ottomans, the Russians on 2 July 1853 occupied the Turkish satellite states of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], as they had during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Turkey and Russia\u2014the Connivance of the Aberdeen Ministry with Russia\u2014The Budget\u2014Tax on Newspaper Supplements\u2014Parliamentary Corruption\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 145.</ref> Almost immediately, the Russian troops deployed along the northern banks of the Danube River, implying that they might cross the river. Aberdeen ordered the British Fleet to Constantinople and later into the Black Sea.<ref name=EB/> On 23 October 1853, the Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. A Russian naval raid on Sinope, on 30 November 1853, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish fleet in the [[battle of Sinope]]. When Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to abandon the Danubian provinces, Britain and France declared war on Russia on 28 March 1854. In September 1854, British and French troops landed on the Crimean peninsula at [[Yevpatoria|Eupatoria]], north of [[Sevastopol]]. The Allied troops then moved across the Alma River on 20 September 1854 at the [[battle of Alma]] and set [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|siege to the fort of Sevastopol]].\n\nA Russian attack on the allied supply base at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] on 25 October 1854 was rebuffed. The [[Battle of Balaclava]] is noted for its famous (or rather infamous) [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. On 5 November 1854, Russian forces tried to relieve the siege at Sevastopol and defeat the Allied armies in the field in the [[Battle of Inkerman]]. However, this attempt failed. Dissatisfaction as to the course of the war grew in England. As reports returned detailing the mismanagement of the conflict, Parliament began to investigate. On 29 January 1855, [[John Arthur Roebuck]] introduced a motion for the appointment of a select committee to enquire into the conduct of the war.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Fall of the Aberdeen Ministry\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'' (International Publishers: New York, 1980) p. 631.</ref> This motion was carried by the large majority of 305 in favour and 148 against.\n\nTreating this as a vote of no confidence in his government, Aberdeen resigned, and retired from active politics, speaking for the last time in the House of Lords in 1858. In visiting [[Windsor Castle]] to resign, he told the Queen: \"Nothing could have been better, he said than the feeling of the members towards each other.

In 1842, Aberdeen sent Lord Ashburton to Washington to settle all disputes, especially the border between Canada and Maine, the boundary along the Great Lakes, the Oregon boundary, the African slave trade, and  the [[Caroline affair]] about boundaries in 1837 and the [[Creole case]] of 1841 involving a slave revolt on the high seas.<ref>Charles M.

Later in 1846, the United States announced its intention of annexing Hawaii, and Britain not only complained but sent a naval force to make the point.

Before the Crimean debacle that ended his career he scored numerous diplomatic triumphs, starting in 1813-14 when as ambassador to the Austrian Empire he negotiated the alliances and financing that led to the defeat of Napoleon. In Paris, he normalized relations with the newly-restored Bourbon government and convinced London it could be trusted.  He worked well with top European diplomats such as his friends [[Klemens von Metternich]] in Vienna and [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] in Paris. He brought Britain into the center of Continental diplomacy on critical issues, such as the local wars in Greece, Portugal, and Belgium. Simmering troubles on numerous issues with the United States were ended by friendly compromises. He played a central role in winning the [[Opium Wars]] against China, gaining control of Hong Kong in the process.<ref> Robert  Eccleshall and  Graham S. Walker, eds.

In the House of Lords, in 1840 and 1843, he raised two Compromise Bills to allow presbyteries but not congregations the right of veto.

{{postnominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=100%|KG|KT|FRSE|FRS|PC|FSAs}} (28 January 1784{{snd}}14 December 1860),<ref name=EB/> styled '''Lord Haddo''' from 1791 to 1801, was a British statesman, diplomat and Scottish landowner, successively a [[Tory]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Peelite]] politician and specialist in foreign affairs. He served as Prime Minister from 1852 until 1855 in a coalition between the Whigs and Peelites, with Radical and Irish support. The [[Aberdeen ministry]] was filled with powerful and talented politicians, whom Aberdeen was largely unable to control and direct. Despite his trying to avoid this happening, it took Britain into the [[Crimean War]], and fell when its conduct became unpopular, after which Aberdeen retired from politics.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family with largest estates in Scotland, his personal life was marked by the loss of both parents by the time he was eleven, and of his first wife after only seven years of a happy marriage. His daughters died young, and his relations with his sons were difficult.<ref>MacIntyre, 644</ref> He travelled extensively in Europe, including Greece, and he had a serious interest in the classical civilisations and their archaeology. His Scottish estates having been neglected by his father, he devoted himself (when he came of age) to modernising them according to the latest standards.\n\nAfter 1812 he became a diplomat, and in 1813, at age 29, was given the critically important embassy to [[Vienna]], where he organized and financed the [[War of the Sixth Coalition| sixth and final coalition that defeated Napoleon.]] His rise in politics was equally rapid and lucky, and \"two accidents \u2014 [[George Canning|Canning's]] death and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s impulsive acceptance of the Canningite resignations\" led to his becoming Foreign Secretary for Prime Minister Wellington in 1828 despite \"an almost ludicrous lack of official experience\"; he had been a minister for less than six months. After holding the position for two years, followed by another cabinet role, by 1841 his experience led to his appointment as Foreign Secretary again under [[Robert Peel]] for a longer term.<ref>MacIntyre, 641</ref> His diplomatic successes include organizing the coalition against Napoleon In 1812-14, normalizing relations with post-Napoleonic France, settling the old border dispute between Canada and the United States, and ending the [[First Opium War]] with China in 1842, whereby [[Hong Kong]] was obtained. Aberdeen was a poor speaker, but this scarcely mattered in the [[House of Lords]]. He exhibited a \"dour, awkward, occasionally sarcastic exterior\".<ref>MacIntyre, 642, 644.</ref>  His friend [[William Ewart Gladstone]], said of him that he was \"the man in public life of all others whom I have {{em|loved}}. I say emphatically {{em|loved}}. I have {{em|loved}} others, but never like him\".<ref>MacIntyre, 643, quoted</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Edinburgh]] on 28 January 1784, he was the eldest son of [[George Gordon, Lord Haddo]], son of [[George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen]]. His mother was Charlotte, youngest daughter of William Baird of Newbyth.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Dod | first = Robert P. | title = The Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland | year = 1860 | publisher = Whitaker and Co. | location = London | pages = 81 }}</ref> He lost his father on 18  October 1791 and his mother in 1795, and he was brought up by [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]] and [[William Pitt the Younger]].<ref name=EB/> He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] in 1804.<ref>{{acad|id=GRDN800GH|name=Gordon, George Hamilton (Lord Haddo)}}</ref> Before this, however, he had become [[Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Earl of Aberdeen]] on his grandfather's death in 1801,<ref name=EB/> and had travelled all over Europe. On his return to Britain, he founded the Athenian Society. In 1805, he married [[Catherine Hamilton-Gordon, Countess of Aberdeen|Lady Catherine Elizabeth]], daughter of [[John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn]].\n\n==Political and diplomatic career, 1805\u20131828==\nIn December 1805 Lord Aberdeen took his seat as a [[Tory]] [[Representative peer|Scottish representative peer]] in the [[House of Lords]]. In 1808, he was created a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]]. Following the death of his wife from [[tuberculosis]] in 1812 he joined the Foreign Service. He was appointed [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Austria|Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria]],<ref name=EB/> and signed the [[Treaty of T\u00f6plitz]] between Britain and Austria in [[Vienna]] in October 1813. In the company of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|the Austrian Emperor, Francis II]], he was an observer at the decisive Coalition victory of the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813; he had met [[Napoleon]] in his earlier travels. He became one of the central diplomatic figures in European diplomacy at this time,<ref name=EB/> and he was one of the British representatives at the [[Congress of Ch\u00e2tillon]] in February 1814, and at the negotiations which led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] in May of that year.<ref name=EB/><ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 4</ref>\n\nAberdeen was greatly affected by the aftermath of war which he witnessed at first hand.  He wrote home:\n\n<blockquote>The near approach of war and its effects are horrible beyond what you can conceive.  The whole road from Prague to [Teplitz] was covered with waggons full of wounded, dead, and dying.  The shock and disgust and pity produced by such scenes are beyond what I could have supposed possible...the scenes of distress and misery have sunk deeper in my mind.  I have been quite haunted by them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur|title=The Earl of Aberdeen|date=1893|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston and Company|location=London|page=31}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Shield of arms of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, KG, KT, FRSE, FRS, PC.png|thumb|upright|left|Shield of arms of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, as displayed on his [[Order of the Garter]] stall plate in [[St George's Chapel]].]]\nReturning home he was created a peer of the United Kingdom as '''Viscount Gordon''', of Aberdeen in the County of Aberdeen (1814),<ref name=EB/> and made a member of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. In July 1815 he married his former sister-in-law Harriet, daughter of John Douglas, and widow of [[James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton]]; the marriage was much less happy than his first. During the ensuing thirteen years Aberdeen took a less prominent part in public affairs.\n\n==Political career, 1828\u20131852==\n[[File:Georgehamiltongordonaberdeen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Earl of Aberdeen by [[Thomas Lawrence]] in 1829]]\n[[File:George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen by John Partridge.jpg|thumb|Lord Aberdeen {{c.|1847}} by [[John Partridge (artist)|John Partridge]]]]\nLord Aberdeen served as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] between January and June 1828 and subsequently as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] until 1830 under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].<ref name=EB/> He resigned with Wellington over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832]].\n\nHe was [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] between 1834 and 1835, and again Foreign Secretary between 1841 and 1846 under [[Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]]. It was during his second stint as Foreign Secretary that he had the harbor settlement of 'Little Hong Kong', on the south side of Hong Kong Island, named after him. It was probably the most productive period of his career; he settled two disagreements with the US: the northeast boundary dispute by the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] (1842), and the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon dispute]] by the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846.<ref name=EB/>  He enjoyed the trust of [[Queen Victoria]], which was still important for a Foreign Secretary. He worked closely with [[Henry Bulwer]], his ambassador to Madrid, to help arrange marriages for Queen Isabella and her younger sister the Infanta Luisa Fernanda. They helped stabilize Spain's internal and external relations.<ref>Laurence Guymer,  \"The Wedding Planners: Lord Aberdeen, Henry Bulwer, and the Spanish Marriages, 1841\u20131846.\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' 21.4 (2010): 549-573.</ref> He sought better relations with France, relying on his friendship with [[Guizot]]. However Britain was annoyed with France on a series of issues, especially French colonial policies, the right to search slave ships, the French desire to control Belgium, disputes in the Pacific, and French intervention in Morocco.<ref>A.B. Cunningham, \"Peel, Aberdeen and the Entente cordiale.\" ''Historical Research'' 30.82 (1957): 189-206.</ref><ref>R.W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 223-41. </ref>\n\n===In opposition===\nAberdeen again followed his leader and resigned with Peel over the issue of the [[Corn Laws]].  After Peel's death in 1850 he became the recognised leader of the [[Peelites]]. In July 1852, a general election of Parliament was held which resulted in the election of 325 Tory/Conservative party members to Parliament. This represented 42.7% of the seats in Parliament. The main opposition to the Tory/Conservative Party was the Whig Party, which elected 292 members of the party to the Parliament in July 1852. Although occupying fewer seats than the Tory/Conservatives, the Whigs had a chance to draw support from the minor parties and independents who were also elected in July 1852. Lord Aberdeen was one of 38 Peelites elected to members of Parliament independently of the Tory/Conservative Party.<ref>Lucille Iremonger, ''Lord Aberdeen: a biography of the fourth Earl of Aberdeen, KG, KT, Prime Minister 1852\u20131855'' (1978).</ref>\n\nWhile the Peelites agreed with the Whigs on issues dealing with international trade, there were other issues on which the Peelites disagreed with the Whigs. Indeed, Lord Aberdeen's own dislike of the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851|Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill]], the rejection of which he failed to secure in 1851, prevented him from joining the Whig government of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] in 1851. Additionally, 113 of the members of Parliament elected in July 1852 were [[Free Traders]].<ref>Karl Marx, \"Result of the Elections\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Freederick Engels: Volume 11,'' p. 352.</ref> These members agreed with the Peelites on the repeal of the \"[[Corn Laws]],\" but they felt that the tariffs on ''all'' consumer products should be removed.\n\nFurthermore, 63 members of Parliament elected in 1852 were members of the \"[[Independent Irish Party|Irish Brigade]],\" who voted with the Peelites and the Whigs for the repeal of the Corn Laws because they sought an end the Great Irish Famine by means of cheaper wheat and bread prices for the poor and middle classes in Ireland.  Currently, however, the Free Traders and the Irish Brigade had disagreements with the Whigs that prevented them from joining with the Whigs to form a government. Accordingly, the Tory/Conservative Party leader the [[Earl of Derby]] was asked to form a \"minority government\". Derby appointed [[Benjamin Disraeli]] as the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the minority government.\n\nWhen in December 1852 Disraeli submitted his budget to Parliament on behalf of the minority government, the Peelites, the Free Traders, and the Irish Brigade were all alienated by the proposed budget. Accordingly, those groups suddenly forgot their differences with the Whig Party and voted with the Whigs against the proposed budget. The vote was 286 in favour of the budget and 305 votes against the budget.<ref>Karl Marx, \"The Defeat of the Ministry\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: volume 11,'' p. 466.</ref> Because the leadership of the minority government had made the vote on the budget vote a \"vote of confidence\", the defeat of the Disraeli budget was a \"vote of no confidence\" in the minority government and meant its downfall. Accordingly, Lord Aberdeen was asked to form a new government.\n\n==Prime Minister, 1852\u20131855==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen]], [[Premiership of Lord Aberdeen]], [[Premiership of the Earl of Aberdeen]], [[Prime ministership of Lord Aberdeen]], [[Prime ministership of the Earl of Aberdeen]] -->\n{{Further|Aberdeen ministry}}\n[[File:George Hamilton-Gordon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Aberdeen in the 1850s]] Following the downfall of the Tory/Conservative minority government under Lord Derby in December 1852, Lord Aberdeen formed a new government from the coalition of Free Traders, Peelites, and Whigs that had voted no confidence in the minority government. Lord Aberdeen was able to put together a coalition that held 53.8% of the seats of Parliament. Thus Lord Aberdeen, a Peelite, became Prime Minister and headed a coalition ministry of Whigs and Peelites.\n\nAlthough united on international trade issues and on questions of domestic reform, his cabinet also contained Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, who were certain to differ on questions of foreign policy. [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] wrote in his ''Memoirs'', \"In the present cabinet are five or six first-rate men of equal, or nearly equal, pretensions, none of them likely to acknowledge the superiority or defer to the opinions of any other, and every one of these five or six considering himself abler and more important than their premier\"; and [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] wrote, \"It is a powerful team, but it will require good driving\", which Aberdeen was unable to provide.  During the  administration, much trouble was caused by the rivalry between Palmerston and Russell, and over the course of it Palmerston managed to out-manoeuvre Russell to emerge as the Whig heir apparent.<ref>Martin, 110\u2013112</ref>  The cabinet also included a single Radical, [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]], but much later, when justifying to the Queen his own new appointments, Gladstone told her: \"For instance, even in Ld Aberdeen's Govt, in 52, Sir William Molesworth had been selected, at that time, a very advanced Radical, but who was perfectly harmless, & took little, or no part.... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office\", which she admitted had been the case.<ref>Queen Victoria's Journals, Wednesday 28 April 1880, Windsor Castle, from Princess Beatrice's copies, Volume72 (1 January 1880-18 August 1880), p.167, [http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItem.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=2738816315824&filterSequence=0&PageNumber=1&ItemNumber=14&ItemID=qvj17246&volumeType=PSBEA online from the Bodleian Library]</ref>\n\nOne of the foreign policy issues on which Palmerston and Russell disagreed was the type of relationship that Britain should have with France and especially France's ruler, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]]. Bonaparte was the nephew of the famous [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had become dictator and then Emperor of France from 1804 until 1814. The younger Bonaparte had been elected to a three-year term as President of the Second Republic of France on 20 December 1848. The Constitution of the Second Republic limited the President to a single term in office. Thus, Louis Bonaparte would be unable to succeed himself and after 20 December 1851 would no longer be President. Consequently, on 2 December 1851, shortly before the end of his single three-year term in office was to expire, [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|Bonaparte staged a coup against the Second Republic in France]], disbanded the elected Constituent Assembly, arrested some of the Republican leaders, and declared himself Emperor Napoleon III of France. This coup upset many democrats in England as well as in France. Some British government officials felt that Louis Bonaparte was seeking foreign adventure in the spirit of his uncle, Napoleon I. Consequently, these officials felt that any close association with Bonaparte would eventually lead Britain into another series of wars, like the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France and Napoleon]] dating from 1793 until 1815. British relations with France had scarcely improved since 1815. As prime minister, the Earl of Aberdeen was one of these officials who feared France and Bonaparte.<ref>Jonathan Philip Parry,  \"The impact of Napoleon III on British politics, 1851\u20131880.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (Sixth Series) 11 (2001): 147\u2013175.</ref>\n\nHowever, other British government officials were beginning to worry more about the rising political dominance of the [[Russian Empire]] in eastern Europe and the corresponding decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Lord Palmerston]] at the time of Louis Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup was serving as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Whig government of Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]. Without informing the rest of the cabinet or Queen Victoria, Palmerston had sent a private note to the French ambassador endorsing Louis Bonaparte's coup and congratulating Louis Bonaparte himself on the coup. Queen Victoria and members of the Russell government demanded that Palmerston be dismissed as Foreign Minister. Russell requested Palmerston's resignation and Palmerston reluctantly provided it.\n\nIn February 1852, Palmerston took revenge on Russell by voting with the Conservatives in a \"no confidence\" vote against the Russell government. This brought an end to the Russell Whig government and set the stage for a general election in July 1852 which eventually brought the Conservatives to power in a minority government under the Earl of Derby. Later in the year, another problem facing the Earl of Aberdeen in the formation of his own new government in December 1852 was Lord John Russell himself. Russell was the leader of the Whig Party, the largest group in the coalition government. Consequently, Lord Aberdeen, was required to appoint Russell as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which he had done on 29 December 1852. However, Russell sometimes liked to use this position to speak for the whole government, as if he were the prime minister. In 1832, Russell had been nicknamed \"Finality John\" because of his statement that the 1832 Reform Act had just been approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords would be the \"final\" expansion of the vote in Britain. There would be no further extension of the ballot to the common people of Britain. However, as political pressure in favour of further reform had risen over the twenty years since 1832, Russell had changed his mind. Russell had said, in January 1852, that he intended to introduce a new reform bill into the House of Commons which would equalise the populations of the districts from which members of Parliament were elected. Probably as a result of their continuing feud, Palmerston declared himself against this Reform Bill of 1852. As a result, support for the bill dwindled and Russell was forced to change his mind again and not introduce any Reform Bill in 1852.<ref>C. H. Stuart, \"The Formation of the Coalition Cabinet of 1852.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (Fifth Series) 4 (1954): 45\u201368.</ref>\n\nIn order to form the coalition government, the Earl of Aberdeen had been required to appoint both Palmerston and Russell to his cabinet. Because of the controversy surrounding Palmerston's removal as [[Foreign Minister|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], Palmerston could not now be appointed Foreign Minister again so soon after his removal from that position. Accordingly, on 28 December 1852, Aberdeen appointed Palmerston as [[Home Secretary]] and appointed Russell as Foreign Minister.<ref>Stuart, \"The Formation of the Coalition Cabinet of 1852.\" (1954): 45\u201368.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Norman McCord|author2=Bill Purdue|title=British History 1815\u20131914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9yjeJEfq7cC&pg=PA269|year=2007|publisher=Oxford UP|page=269ff|isbn=9780199261642}}</ref>\n\n==The \"Eastern Question\"==\nGiven the differences of opinion within the Lord Aberdeen cabinet over the direction of foreign policy with regard to relations between Britain and France under Napoleon III, it is not surprising that debate raged within the government as Louis Bonaparte, now assuming the title of Emperor Napoleon III. As Prime Minister of the Peelite/Whig coalition government, Aberdeen eventually led Britain into war on the side of the French and Ottomans against the Russian Empire. This war would eventually be called the [[Crimean War]], but throughout the foreign policy negotiations surrounding the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, which would continue throughout the middle and end of nineteenth century, the problem would be referred to as the \"[[Eastern Question]]\".<ref>M. S. Anderson. ''The Eastern Question, 1774\u20131923'' (London, 1966),  pp. 110\u2013149.</ref>\n\nThe cabinet was bitterly divided. Palmerston stirred up anti-reform feeling in Parliament and pro-war public opinion to out-maneuver Russell. The result was that the weak Aberdeen government went to war with Russia as the result of internal British political rivalries. Aberdeen accepted Russian arguiments at face value because he sympathised with Russian interests against French pressure and.was not in favour of the Crimean War. However, he was unable to resist the pressure that was being exerted on him by Palmerston's faction. In the end, the Crimean War proved to be the downfall of his government.<ref>David F. Krein. \"War and Reform: Russell, Palmerston and the Struggle for Power in the Aberdeen Cabinet, 1853\u201354\". ''Maryland Historian'' (1976) 7#2 pp. 67\u201384.</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Question flared up on 2 December 1852, with the Napoleon's coup against the Second Republic. As Napoleon III was forming his new imperial government, he sent an ambassador to the Ottoman Empire with instructions to assert France's right to protect Christian sites in Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]]. The Ottoman Empire agreed to this condition to avoid conflict or even war with France. Aberdeen, as Foreign Secretary in 1845, had himself tacitly authorised the construction of the first [[Christ Church, Jerusalem|Anglican church in Jerusalem]], following his predecessor's commission in 1838 of the first European Consul in Jerusalem on Britain's behalf, which lead to series of successive appointments by other nations. Both resulted from [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s canvassing with substantial public support.<ref name= Lewis>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2 January 2014 | location = Cambridge | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}</ref><ref name= sokolow>{{cite book | last = Sokolow | first = Nahum| title = History of Zionism, 1600-1918 | publisher = Forgotten Books | date = 2015-09-27 | volume= 1 | location = Charleston SC USA | page = 418 | isbn =9781330331842}}</ref><ref name= Hyamson>[[Albert Montefiore Hyamson|Hyamson, Albert M.]], ''The British Consulate in Jerusalem in Relation to the Jews of Palestine, 1838\u20131914'', {{ISBN|978-0404562786}}, cited in Lewis, D.</ref> \n\nNevertheless, Britain became increasingly worried about the situation in Turkey, and Prime Minister Aberdeen sent [[Lord Stratford de Redcliffe]], a diplomat with vast experience in Turkey, as a special envoy to the Ottoman Empire to guard British interests. Russia protested the Turkish agreement with the French as a violation of the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] of 1778, which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)]]. Under the treaty, the Russians had been granted the exclusive right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly, on 7 May 1853, the Russians sent Prince [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]], one their premier statesmen, to negotiate a settlement of the issue.<ref>Karl Marx. \"Affairs in Holland\u2014Denmark\u2014Conversion of the British Debt\u2014India, Turkey and Russia\". In ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 105.</ref> Prince Menshikov called the attention of the Turks to the fact that during the Russo-Turkish War, the Russians had occupied the Turkish-controlled provinces of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] on the north bank of the Danube River, and he reminded them that pursuant to the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca, the Russians had returned these \"Danubian provinces\" to Ottoman control in exchange for the right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly, the Turks reversed themselves and agreed with the Russians.\n\nThe French sent one of their premier [[ship of the line|ships-of-the-line]], the ''[[French ship Charlemagne (1852)|Charlemagne]]'', to the Black Sea as a show of force. In light of the French show of force, the Turks, again, reversed themselves and recognised the French right to protect the Christian sites. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was advising the Ottomans during this time,<ref>Karl Marx. \"Mazzini\u2014Switzerland and Austria\u2014Turkish Question\". In ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 109.</ref> and later it was alleged that he had been instrumental in persuading the Turks to reject the Russian arguments.\n\nAs war became inevitable, Aberdeen wrote to Russell:\n<blockquote>The abstract justice of the cause, although indisputable, is but a poor consolation for the inevitable calamities of all war, or for a decision which I am not without fear may prove to have been impolitic and unwise. My conscience upbraids me the more, because seeing, as I did from the first, all that was to be apprehended, it is possible that by a little more energy and vigour, not on the Danube, but in Downing Street, it might have been prevented.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walpole|first1=Spencer|title=The Life of Lord John Russell \u2013 Volume II|date=1889|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London|page=204}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Crimean War 1853\u20131856==\n[[File:Coalition Ministry of 1854.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The coalition [[Aberdeen ministry]] of 1854 after a painting by [[John Gilbert (painter)|Sir John Gilbert]], 1855]]\n\nIn response this latest change of mind by the Ottomans, the Russians on 2 July 1853 occupied the Turkish satellite states of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], as they had during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Turkey and Russia\u2014the Connivance of the Aberdeen Ministry with Russia\u2014The Budget\u2014Tax on Newspaper Supplements\u2014Parliamentary Corruption\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12'', p. 145.</ref> Almost immediately, the Russian troops deployed along the northern banks of the Danube River, implying that they might cross the river. Aberdeen ordered the British Fleet to Constantinople and later into the Black Sea.<ref name=EB/> On 23 October 1853, the Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. A Russian naval raid on Sinope, on 30 November 1853, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish fleet in the [[battle of Sinope]]. When Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to abandon the Danubian provinces, Britain and France declared war on Russia on 28 March 1854. In September 1854, British and French troops landed on the Crimean peninsula at [[Yevpatoria|Eupatoria]], north of [[Sevastopol]]. The Allied troops then moved across the Alma River on 20 September 1854 at the [[battle of Alma]] and set [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|siege to the fort of Sevastopol]].\n\nA Russian attack on the allied supply base at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] on 25 October 1854 was rebuffed. The [[Battle of Balaclava]] is noted for its famous (or rather infamous) [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. On 5 November 1854, Russian forces tried to relieve the siege at Sevastopol and defeat the Allied armies in the field in the [[Battle of Inkerman]]. However, this attempt failed. Dissatisfaction as to the course of the war grew in England. As reports returned detailing the mismanagement of the conflict, Parliament began to investigate. On 29 January 1855, [[John Arthur Roebuck]] introduced a motion for the appointment of a select committee to enquire into the conduct of the war.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Fall of the Aberdeen Ministry\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'' (International Publishers: New York, 1980) p. 631.</ref> This motion was carried by the large majority of 305 in favour and 148 against.\n\nTreating this as a vote of no confidence in his government, Aberdeen resigned, and retired from active politics, speaking for the last time in the House of Lords in 1858. In visiting [[Windsor Castle]] to resign, he told the Queen: \"Nothing could have been better, he said than the feeling of the members towards each other.

In 1842, Aberdeen sent Lord Ashburton to Washington to settle all disputes, especially the border between Canada and Maine, the boundary along the Great Lakes, the Oregon boundary, the African slave trade, and  the [[Caroline affair]] about boundaries in 1837 and the [[Creole case]] of 1841 involving a slave revolt on the high seas.<ref>Charles M.

Later in 1846, the United States announced its intention of annexing Hawaii, and Britain not only complained but sent a naval force to make the point.

Before the Crimean debacle that ended his career he scored numerous diplomatic triumphs, starting in 1813-14 when as ambassador to the Austrian Empire he negotiated the alliances and financing that led to the defeat of Napoleon. In Paris, he normalized relations with the newly-restored Bourbon government and convinced London it could be trusted.  He worked well with top European diplomats such as his friends [[Klemens von Metternich]] in Vienna and [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] in Paris. He brought Britain into the center of Continental diplomacy on critical issues, such as the local wars in Greece, Portugal, and Belgium. Simmering troubles on numerous issues with the United states were ended by friendly compromises. He played a central role in winning the [[Opium Wars]] against China, gaining control of Hong Kong in the process.<ref> Robert  Eccleshall and  Graham S. Walker, eds.

In the House of Lords, in 1840 and 1843, he raised two Compromise Bills to allow presbyteries but not congregations the right of veto. The first failed to pass (and was voted against by the General Assembly) but the latter, raised post-schism, became law for Scotland and remained in force until patronage of Scots livings was abolished in 1874.<ref name=odnb3>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 22|pages=902\u2013903}}</ref>\n\nIt was under his prime ministership that the revival of the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York]] began, though they did not obtain their potential power till 1859.\n\nHe is said in the last few months of his life, after the Crimean War, to have declined to contribute to building a church on his Scotland estates because of a sense of guilt in having \"shed much blood\", citing biblically King David's being forbidden to build the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 22|page=907}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Aberdeen, George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of|volume=1|page=46}}\n* Anderson, Olive.

'blue sky, white clouds'). The foundation's work includes medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental work such as recycling. It is operated by a worldwide network of volunteers and employees and has been awarded a special consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].<ref>O'Neill, Mark (2010), ''[http://www.books.com.tw/exep/assp.php/jamezku/products/F012089631 Tzu Chi: Serving With Compassion]'', John Wiley & Sons</ref> \n\nThe Tzu Chi Foundation was founded by Master [[Cheng Yen]], a Taiwanese Buddhist nun, or ''[[bhikkhuni]]'', in 1966 as a Buddhist humanitarian organization. The organization began as a group of thirty housewives who saved money for needy families. Tzu Chi gradually expanded its services over time, opening a free medical clinic in 1972 and building its first hospital in 1986. The organization underwent a rapid expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with a surge of popularity in [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in Taiwan. In the 1990s the organization started major international disaster relief efforts. Tzu Chi is known for undertaking long term projects such as building new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. As of 2013, the organization was estimated at over 10 million members worldwide throughout 47 countries. \n\nTzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, however [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] teachings are often integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Heavenly Kings (Taiwan)|Four Heavenly Kings]]\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, and Tzu Chi itself is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Great Mountains (Taiwan)|Four Great Mountains]]\", or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan along with [[Fo Guang Shan]], [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], and [[Chung Tai Shan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |title=Come to Taiwan, Return with good memories |publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw |accessdate=2012-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shuai|first=J.

Medicine]] in 1994.  This college became [[Tzu Chi University]] in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for [[body donation]]s surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country.\n\nIn 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Disaster relief ==\n[[File:Tzu Chi Culture and Communication Foundation 20080309.jpg|thumb|Tzu Chi Culture and Communications building]]\nTzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide.

Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in [[China]] as \"Building a Bridge of Love.\" The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the [[Cross-Strait relations|political tensions]] between Taiwan and China and Communist China's disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] to help the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi.\n\nTzu Chi's involvement in the [[People's Republic of China]] began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after [[Eastern China flood of 1991|severe floods hit central and eastern China]]. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi's first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People's Republic of China.

The foundation has several sub-organizations such as the Tzu Chi International Medical Association (TIMA) and also the Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association (Tzu Ching) ({{zh|t=\u6148\u6fdf\u5927\u5c08\u9751\u5e74\u806f\u8abc\u6703 (\u6148\u9751))}}. Tzu Chi volunteers and relief workers are mostly recognizable by their blue and white uniforms called, in {{zh|t=\u85cd\u5929\u767d\u96f2}}, ''l\u00e1nti\u0101n b\u00e1iy\u00fan'', ( lit. 'blue sky, white clouds'). The foundation's work includes medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental work such as recycling. It is operated by a worldwide network of volunteers and employees and has been awarded a special consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].<ref>O'Neill, Mark (2010), ''[http://www.books.com.tw/exep/assp.php/jamezku/products/F012089631 Tzu Chi: Serving With Compassion]'', John Wiley & Sons</ref> \n\nThe Tzu Chi Foundation was founded by Master [[Cheng Yen]], a Taiwanese Buddhist nun, or ''[[bhikkhuni]]'', in 1966 as a Buddhist humanitarian organization. The organization began as a group of thirty housewives who saved money for needy families. Tzu Chi gradually expanded its services over time, opening a free medical clinic in 1972 and building its first hospital in 1986. The organization underwent a rapid expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with a surge of popularity in [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in Taiwan. In the 1990s the organization started major international disaster relief efforts. Tzu Chi is known for undertaking long term projects such as building new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. As of 2013, the organization was estimated at over 10 million members worldwide throughout 47 countries. \n\nTzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, however [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] teachings are often integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Heavenly Kings (Taiwan)|Four Heavenly Kings]]\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, and Tzu Chi itself is considered to be one of the \"[[Four Great Mountains (Taiwan)|Four Great Mountains]]\", or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan along with [[Fo Guang Shan]], [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], and [[Chung Tai Shan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |title=Come to Taiwan, Return with good memories |publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw |accessdate=2012-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shuai|first=J.

Medicine]] in 1994.  This college became [[Tzu Chi University]] in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for [[body donation]]s surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country.\n\nIn 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Disaster relief ==\n[[File:Tzu Chi Culture and Communication Foundation 20080309.jpg|thumb|Tzu Chi Culture and Communications building]]\nTzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide.

Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in [[China]] as \"Building a Bridge of Love.\" The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the [[Cross-Strait relations|political tensions]] between Taiwan and China and Communist China's disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] to help the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi.\n\nTzu Chi's involvement in the [[People's Republic of China]] began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after [[Eastern China flood of 1991|severe floods hit central and eastern China]]. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi's first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People's Republic of China.

[[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassinated]] at the terminal's Gate 8 (now Gate 11) after returning to the Philippines from his self-imposed exile in the United States. Ironically, his flight number, China Airlines 811, was the same flight number that was involved in an accident three years ago at the same airport, albeit that the aircraft involved in the 1983 assassination was a Boeing 767-200. Four years after the incident he was memorialized by having the airport named in his honor, by virtue of [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] No. 6639.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/11438/today-in-history-ninoy-aquino-assassinated-at-airport|title=TODAY IN HISTORY: Ninoy Aquino assassinated at airport|work=InterAksyon.com|access-date=August 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808050751/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/11438/today-in-history-ninoy-aquino-assassinated-at-airport|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1987/ra_6639_1987.html|title=R.A. 6639|work=lawphil.net}}</ref>\n\nPlans for a new terminal were conceived in 1989, when the Department of Transportation and Communications commissioned [[A\u00e9roports de Paris]] to do a feasibility study to expand capacity. The recommendation was to build two new terminals, and in 1998 Terminal 2 was completed. Terminal 2 was nicknamed the Centennial Terminal as its completion coincided with the 100th anniversary of the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain. In 1997 the government approved the construction of Terminal 3, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 2002. After many delays caused by technical and legal issues, the terminal became partially operational in mid-2008 and fully operational in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/174122/naia-3-fully-operational-by-aug-1-miaa-officials|title=Naia 3 fully operational by Aug. 1\u2013Miaa officials|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=July 4, 2014|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> The government aims to return services from many of the airlines which cancelled services to Manila as a result of Terminal 1's problems.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:NAIA Terminal 3 Departure 2009 MC.jpg|thumb|Departure hall of NAIA Terminal 3]]\nThe original proposal for the construction of a third terminal was proposed by Asia's Emerging Dragon Corporation (AEDP).<ref name=\"AEDC\">{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20110417-331708/Impossible-Dream|title=Impossible Dream|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> AEDP eventually lost the bid to PairCargo and its partner [[Fraport|Fraport AG]] of Germany, who went on to begin construction of the terminal under the administration of Joseph Estrada. In August 1997, President [[Fidel V.

Inc. (Piatco), over the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract, delayed the final completion and opening of the terminal.<ref name=\"Piatco\"/>\n\nWhile the original agreement was one in which PairCargo and Fraport AG would operate the airport for several years after its construction, followed by a handing over of the terminal to the Philippine government, the government offered to buy out Fraport AG for $400 million, to which Fraport agreed. However, before the terminal could be fully completed, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, called the contract \"onerous\" and therefore formed a committee to evaluate the agreement to buy out Fraport AG. It is this action that sparked the most controversy. The Philippine Supreme Court eventually found the Piatco contract \"null and void\" citing a variety of anomalies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/hl/hl017922.htm|title=PIATCO NAIA3 Deal Null and Void -- Supreme Court|publisher=newsflash.org|date=May 6, 2003|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo eventually abrogated Piatco's BOT Contract for allegedly having been anomalous in certain important respects. In a subsequent decision, the Philippine Supreme Court upheld the Philippine Government's position on the matter and declared the BOT contract \"null and void\" for, among other things, violations of certain provisions of the BOT law. More specifically, the Court found that the original contract was revised to allow for a Philippine government guarantee of Piatco's obligations to its creditors, contractors and suppliers. The BOT law disallows the granting of such sovereign guarantees. Piatco disagrees and continues to maintain that the provisions cited by the Supreme Court do not amount to a prohibited sovereign guarantee by the Philippine Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/philippines/ninoy_aquino_intl_philippines.php|publisher=airports-worldwide.com|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:NAIA from the Air.JPG|thumb|right|A shot of the airport taken from a departing aircraft]]\nIn December 2004, the Philippine government expropriated the terminal project from Piatco through an order of the Pasay City Regional Trial Court. However, the court only allowed the Philippine government to take over the terminal upon payment of an initial amount of {{Philippine peso|3 billion}} (approximately US$64 million) to Piatco. The Philippine government paid Piatco this amount during the second week of September 2006. According to the Philippine government, NAIA-3 was 98% complete (prior in 2006) and required at least an additional US$6 million to complete. The government was then in the process of negotiating a contract with the builder of the terminal, [[Takenaka Corporation]], because another factor that delayed the terminal's opening was the ongoing investigation into the collapse of an {{convert|100|m2|adj=on}} area of the terminal's ceiling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/119513/news/nation/naia-terminal-3-ceiling-falls-off-one-more-time|title=NAIA terminal 3 ceiling falls off one more time|publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPiatco (and its German partner, Fraport) have instituted arbitration proceedings before different international bodies to recover a fair settlement.

The recommendation was to build two new terminals, and in 1998 Terminal 2 was completed. Terminal 2 was nicknamed the Centennial Terminal as its completion coincided with the 100th anniversary of the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain. In 1997 the government approved the construction of Terminal 3, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 2002. After many delays caused by technical and legal issues, the terminal became partially operational in mid-2008 and fully operational in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/174122/naia-3-fully-operational-by-aug-1-miaa-officials|title=Naia 3 fully operational by Aug. 1\u2013Miaa officials|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=July 4, 2014|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> The government aims to return services from many of the airlines which cancelled services to Manila as a result of Terminal 1's problems.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:NAIA Terminal 3 Departure 2009 MC.jpg|thumb|Departure hall of NAIA Terminal 3]]\nThe original proposal for the construction of a third terminal was proposed by Asia's Emerging Dragon Corporation (AEDP).<ref name=\"AEDC\">{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20110417-331708/Impossible-Dream|title=Impossible Dream|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> AEDP eventually lost the bid to PairCargo and its partner [[Fraport|Fraport AG]] of Germany, who went on to begin construction of the terminal under the administration of Joseph Estrada.

However, before the terminal could be fully completed, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, called the contract \"onerous\" and therefore formed a committee to evaluate the agreement to buy out Fraport AG. It is this action that sparked the most controversy. The Philippine Supreme Court eventually found the Piatco contract \"null and void\" citing a variety of anomalies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/hl/hl017922.htm|title=PIATCO NAIA3 Deal Null and Void -- Supreme Court|publisher=newsflash.org|date=May 6, 2003|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo eventually abrogated Piatco's BOT Contract for allegedly having been anomalous in certain important respects. In a subsequent decision, the Philippine Supreme Court upheld the Philippine Government's position on the matter and declared the BOT contract \"null and void\" for, among other things, violations of certain provisions of the BOT law. More specifically, the Court found that the original contract was revised to allow for a Philippine government guarantee of Piatco's obligations to its creditors, contractors and suppliers. The BOT law disallows the granting of such sovereign guarantees. Piatco disagrees and continues to maintain that the provisions cited by the Supreme Court do not amount to a prohibited sovereign guarantee by the Philippine Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/philippines/ninoy_aquino_intl_philippines.php|publisher=airports-worldwide.com|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:NAIA from the Air.JPG|thumb|right|A shot of the airport taken from a departing aircraft]]\nIn December 2004, the Philippine government expropriated the terminal project from Piatco through an order of the Pasay City Regional Trial Court.

The Philippine government paid Piatco this amount during the second week of September 2006. According to the Philippine government, NAIA-3 was 98% complete (prior in 2006) and required at least an additional US$6 million to complete. The government was then in the process of negotiating a contract with the builder of the terminal, [[Takenaka Corporation]], because another factor that delayed the terminal's opening was the ongoing investigation into the collapse of an {{convert|100|m2|adj=on}} area of the terminal's ceiling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/119513/news/nation/naia-terminal-3-ceiling-falls-off-one-more-time|title=NAIA terminal 3 ceiling falls off one more time|publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPiatco (and its German partner, Fraport) have instituted arbitration proceedings before different international bodies to recover a fair settlement.

It is divided into two wings: the North Wing, for international flights, and the South Wing, which handles domestic operations. It currently has 12 jet bridges. There are several cafes and restaurants in the Terminal post-security. There is also a small duty-free section in the north wing. The need for two more terminals was proposed by a Master Plan Review of the Airport that was undertaken in 1989 by A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP). The study was facilitated by means of a grant from the [[French Government]]. The review cost 2.9 million [[French franc]]s and was submitted to the Philippine Government for evaluation in 1990.<ref name=\"T1\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the French government granted a 30-million-franc soft loan to the Philippine government, which was to be used to cover the Detailed Architectural and Engineering Design of the NAIA Terminal 2. ADP completed the design in 1992 and in 1994, the Japanese Government granted an 18.12-billion-[[Japanese yen|yen]] soft loan to the Philippine Government to finance 75% of the terminal's construction costs and 100% of the supervision costs. Construction of the Centennial Terminal began on December 11, 1995, and was formally turned over to the government of the Philippines on December 28, 1998.
