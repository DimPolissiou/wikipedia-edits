{"title_page": "Port, Templeport", "text_new": "[[File:Port, Templeport.jpg|thumb|Road beside Templeport Lough, County Cavan, Ireland, heading west.]]\n\n'''Port''' ({{Irish derived place name|Port meaning 'A Landing-Place'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. Port is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme'' (probably Irish 'Achadh an Mhanaigh' meaning \"The Field of the Monk\").<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good. Dignum [arbitramur]''.<ref>Calendar of Papal Registers Relating To Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 6, 1404-1415, ed. W H Bliss and J A Twemlow (London, 1904), p. 476.</ref> In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''. Port was one of these four polls.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/MonasticonHibernicumV1|page=[https://archive.org/details/MonasticonHibernicumV1/page/n90 71]|quote=Kilfert.|title=Monasticon Hibernicum: or, a history of the abbeys, priories, and other religious houses in Ireland; interspersed with memoirs of their several founders and benefactors, and of their abbots and other superiors, to the time of their final suppression|first=Mervyn|last=Archdall|date=14 September 1873|publisher=W.

This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=popOAAAAIAAJ&dq=killfeart+templeporte+killadough&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=templeporte]</ref> Port was one of these six pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''. Port was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]]. Port formed part of the six polls in this lease.\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Templepart'' to Oliver Lambert\u2019s son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as ''The Lord of Cavan'', who also appears as proprietor of several other Templeport townlands in the same survey.\n\n'''Rectorial Tithes'''\n\nFrom medieval times the rectorial tithes were split between the local parish priest who received 1/3 and the Abbey of Kells who received 2/3, until they were seized in the 16th century [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].\n\nA list of the rectories owned by King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1542 included ''Templeporte''. <ref>[https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/399f6945-52dd-488f-b5ca-67b1ebee2197]</ref>\n\nIn 1587 [[Elizabeth I of England]] granted the rectory of ''Templeporte'' to Garret (otherwise Gerald) Fleming of Cabragh.\n\nOn 30 October 1603 the aforementioned Gerrald Fleming surrendered the rectory of ''Templeporte'' to King [[James VI and I]] and it was regranted to him for a term of 21 years.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NOpEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Templeporte+-%22temple.+porte%22&source=bl&ots=XWUq-iU279&sig=ACfU3U0b7j0pzmsRAZHvk6kXEsnjPlr0zQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiokNW3qbbhAhXnUhUIHei8DegQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Templeporte%20-%22temple.%20porte%22&f=false]</ref> \n\nBy grant dated 22 December 1608, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of the rectories, churches, or chapels formerly belonging to Kells Abbey, including ''Templeporte'' to Gerald Fleminge of Cabragh, County Cavan.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XD5JAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=%27%27Templeporte%27%27+Garret&source=bl&ots=sGV4wUjhEp&sig=ACfU3U0mP1uxoar0qOGb-BvYxf9wWd13qg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih25KI2sjjAhUPWhUIHczeAjAQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=''Crodraghe''%20Garret&f=false]</ref>\n\nOn 4 March 1609 the aforementioned Gerrald Fleming sold the rectory of ''Templeporte'' to his son James Fleming and Walter Talbot of [[Ballyconnell]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUepqE-K4PAC&pg=PR111&lpg=PR111&dq=Templeporte+-%22temple.+porte%22&source=bl&ots=q1ovKk1-Vm&sig=ACfU3U33GHoNgmSL8I9RZRps4POAcS2nGg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihlav7qrbhAhV1SxUIHfDCD-04ChDoATAEegQIBRAB#v=onepage&q=Templeporte%20-%22temple.%20porte%22&f=false]</ref> On 8 June 1619 the aforesaid James Fleming and Walter Talbot were pardoned by King [[James VI and I]] for obtaining the said rectory of ''Templeport'' without getting a licence from the king.\n\nAn Inquisition held at Cavan on 19 October 1616 stated that the aforementioned Gerald Fleming died on 5 April 1615 and his son Thomas Fleming (born 1589) succeeded to the rectorial tithes of ''Templeporte''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUepqE-K4PAC&pg=RA6-PA9&dq=Clontegrigenie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjn2_as1PraAhVsLsAKHaGyBo0Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=crodragh&f=false]</ref>\n\nIn 1622 Thomas Moigne, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]] made a visitation to the parish. He found that the rectory was impropriate to the vicar of Templeport, John Patrick, who was not a resident, but that there was a curate resident. The annual value of the rectory was \u00a320. The church was in a ruinous condition and the parsonage was a timber house.\n\nOn 9 March 1669 King [[Charles II of England]] granted ''to Josias Hallington, incumbent of Templeport, Co.

In his book ''Memoirs of Major M\u2019Gauran'', Volume I, Page 127 (London 1786), he states (about the year 1765)- ''Upon my return from Luxemburg, the General wrote to Mr. John M'Gauran, of '''Port''', in the County of Cavan, married to Ann O'Donnel, the General's cousin-german, telling him that a cousin of his, grand-son of Colonel Bryan M'Gauran, and son of Mary O'Donnel, was serving then in Loudon's regiment, quartered where he resided. Mr. M'Gauran, jealous of my prosperity, having many young sons of his own, whom he thought better entitled to the General's protection; but, notwithstanding, though he knew me to be his own near relation, wrote to the General, to inform him that I was not the son of Mary O'Donnel, but an impostor. The General shewed me the letter, and asked me the truth, which I told him, together with the motives I had for not revealing it sooner; all of which he approved, and matters seemed to be accommodated''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofmajore_01mgau]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofmajored02mgau]</ref>\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Purt''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts Port as still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. Port is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme'' (probably Irish 'Achadh an Mhanaigh' meaning \"The Field of the Monk\").<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good.

Port was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]].

The play looked like a total bust, as [[Aaron Rodgers]] was wrapped up and brought down, seemingly ending the game. However, the Lions were called for a controversial facemask penalty that gave the Packers one more chance on an untimed down.

The ball traveled 68 yards through the air, making it the longest touchdown pass in NFL history by air. The pass gave the Packers a 27\u201323 win.

The play looked like a total bust, as [[Aaron Rodgers]] was wrapped up and brought down, seemingly ending the game. However, the Lions were called for a controversial facemask penalty that gave the Packers one more chance on an untimed down. On the next play, Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to [[Richard Rodgers (American football)|Richard Rodgers]] to end the game. The ball traveled 68 yards through the air, making it the longest touchdown pass in NFL history by air. The pass gave the Packers a 27\u201323 win.

The earliest known [[recorded history]] [[Classical African civilization|arose]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and later in [[Nubia]], the [[Sahel]], the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\nFollowing the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahara]], North African history became entwined with the [[Middle East]] and [[Southern Europe]] while the [[Bantu expansion]] swept from modern day [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 0 [[AD]], creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]] spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel. Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

This is particularly true of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Nubia]]. In the [[Horn of Africa]] the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] ruled modern-day [[Eritrea]], northern [[Ethiopia]] and the coastal area of the western part of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The Ancient Egyptians established ties with the [[Land of Punt]] in 2,350 BC. Punt was a trade partner of Ancient Egypt and it is believed that it was located in modern-day [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]] or [[Eritrea]].<ref>Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', (Algora Publishing: 2004), p.258.</ref> [[Phoenicia]]n cities such as [[Carthage]] were part of the Mediterranean [[Iron Age]] and [[classical antiquity]].

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].<ref>Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30\u201333.

By 2,200 BC, the Old Kingdom's stability was undermined by rivalry among the governors of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] who challenged the power of pharaohs and by invasions of Asiatics into the Nile Delta.

Connections with the southern regions of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], Wawat and Irthet at the second cataract were made stronger. Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. Egypt became a [[superpower]] controlling Nubia and [[Judea]] while exerting political influence on the Libyans to the West and on the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nAs before, the New Kingdom ended with invasion from the west by Libyan princes, leading to the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Beginning with [[Shoshenq I]], the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] was established. It ruled for two centuries.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nTo the south, Nubian independence and strength was being reasserted. This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751\u2013730 BC) and [[Shabaka]] (716\u2013695 BC). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]]. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons. The Nubian pharaoh [[Tantamani]] was the last of the Twenty-fifth dynasty.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nWhen the Assyrians and Nubians left, a new [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] emerged from [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. It lasted until 525 BC, when Egypt was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Unlike the Assyrians, the Persians stayed. In 332, Egypt was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. This was the beginning of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], which ended with [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest]] in 30 BC.

Ta-Seti was a powerful sacral kingdom in the Nile Valley at the 1st and 2nd cataracts that exerted an influence over nearby chiefdoms based on pictorial representation ruling over [[Upper Egypt]]. Ta-Seti traded as far as [[Syro-Palestine]], as well as with Egypt. Ta-Seti exported gold, copper, ostrich feathers, [[ebony]] and [[ivory trade|ivory]] to the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. By the 32nd century BC, Ta-Seti was in decline. After the unification of Egypt by [[Narmer]] in 3,100 BC, Ta-Seti was invaded by the Pharaoh [[Hor-Aha]] of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], destroying the final remnants of the kingdom.

Around the latter part of the third millennium, there was further consolidation of the sacral kingdoms.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Two kingdoms in particular emerged: the Sai kingdom, immediately south of Egypt, and the [[Kingdom of Kerma]] at the third cataract. Sometime around the 18th century BC, the Kingdom of Kerma conquered the Kingdom of Sai, becoming a serious rival to Egypt. Kerma occupied a territory from the first cataract to the confluence of the [[Blue Nile]], [[White Nile]], and [[Atbarah River]]. About 1,575 to 1,550 BC, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.<ref>Alberge, Dalya. \"Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret\", ''The Times'' {London}, 28 July 2003.</ref> The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nEgypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire. The empire extended from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the confluence of the Blue Nile, the White Nile, and River Atbara.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 760 BC, the Kushites were expelled from Egypt by iron-wielding [[Assyria]]ns. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually, with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production.

The Libyans were agriculturalists like the [[Mauri (people)|Mauri]] of [[Morocco]] and the [[Numidians]] of central and eastern [[Algeria]] and [[Tunis]]. They were also nomadic, having the horse, and occupied the arid pastures and desert, like the [[Gaetuli]]. Berber desert nomads were typically in conflict with Berber coastal agriculturalists.<ref>Iliffe, John (2007), ''Africans: The History of a Continent'', p. 30. 2nd ed.

They began to populate the North African coast with settlements{{mdash}}trading and mixing with the native Berber population. In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans. Salt and metal goods were traded for gold, slaves, beads, and ivory.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 63\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of Carthage]]\nThe [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] were rivals to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Carthage fought the [[Punic Wars]], three wars with Rome: the [[First Punic War]] (264 to 241 BC), over [[Sicily]]; the [[Second Punic War]] (218 to 201 BC), in which [[Hannibal]] invaded Europe; and the [[Third Punic War]] (149 to 146 BC). Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olive]]s, and [[olive oil]] to [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]] via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories. The Berber kingdoms subsequently regained their independence.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Africa at [[Alexandria]] in the 1st century AD and spread to [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]]. By 313 AD, with the [[Edict of Milan]], all of Roman North Africa was Christian.

[[Berber people|Berber]] civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others. By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed one of the largest element, with Gauls, of the Carthaginian army.\n\nIn the [[Mercenary War]] (241-238 BC), a rebellion was instigated by mercenary soldiers of Carthage and African allies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/first-punic-war|title=The First Punic War {{!}} Dickinson College Commentaries|website=dcc.dickinson.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Berber soldiers participated after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. Berbers succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.

Sedentary tribes lost their autonomy and connection with the land. Berber opposition to the Roman presence was nearly constant. The [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]] established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aur\u00e8s and [[Nemencha]] mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern [[Biskra]]) to Ad Majores ([[Hennchir Besseriani]], southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended at least as far as Castellum Dimmidi (modern [[Messa\u00e2d]], southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort.

Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAside from [[Carthage]], urbanization in North Africa came in part with the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors [[Claudius]] (reigned 41\u201354), [[Nerva]] (96\u201398), and [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117).

The prosperity of most towns depended on [[agriculture]]. Called the \"granary of the empire\", North Africa became one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, shipping to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like [[Roman Italy|Italy]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Roman imperial decline]] seemed less serious in North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]].

The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284\u2013305). The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306\u2013337) in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe occasionally violent Donatist controversy has been characterized{{by whom|date=December 2013}} as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics.

Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BC, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants. It imported silver, gold, olive oil, and wine. Aksum manufactured glass crystal, brass, and copper for export. A powerful Aksum emerged, unifying parts of eastern Sudan, northern Ethiopia ([[Tigray Region|Tigre]]), and [[Eritrea]]. Its kings built stone palatial buildings and were buried under megalithic monuments. By 300 AD, Aksum was minting its own coins in silver and gold.<ref>Collins, Robert O., and James M.

The Red Sea trade diminished as it was diverted to the [[Persian Gulf]] and dominated by [[Arabs]], causing Aksum to decline.

Then Bantu-speakers pushed westward to the savannahs of present-day [[Angola]] and eastward into [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]] in the 1st century AD.

At its height it encompassed an area covering not only much of [[Chad]], but also parts of modern southern [[Libya]], eastern [[Niger]], northeastern [[Nigeria]], northern [[Cameroon]], parts of [[South Sudan]] and the [[Central African Republic]].

Kanem arose by engaging in the trans-Saharan trade. It exchanged slaves captured by raiding the south for horses from North Africa, which in turn aided in the acquisition of slaves. By the late 11th century, the Islamic [[Sayfawa Dynasty|Sayfawa (Saifawa) dynasty]] was founded by [[Hummay|Humai (Hummay) ibn Salamna]]. The Sayfawa Dynasty ruled for 771 years, making it one of the longest-lasting dynasties in human history.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\"/> In addition to trade, taxation of local farms around Kanem became a source of state income. Kanem reached its peak under ''Mai'' (king) [[Dunama Dabbalemi|Dunama Dibalemi ibn Salma]] (1210\u20131248). The empire reportedly was able to field 40,000 cavalry, and it extended from [[Fezzan]] in the north to the [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] state in the south.

He founded the Kongolo Dynasty, which was later ousted by [[Kalala Ilunga]]. Kalala expanded the kingdom west of [[Lake Kisale]]. A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads. The ''balopwe'' was the direct communicator with the ancestral spirits and chosen by them. Conquered states were integrated into the system and represented in the court, with their titles. The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo. Two major empires claiming Luba descent were the [[Lunda Empire]] and [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]].

His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'', ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system.

''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in [[Zambia]] also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade.

The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the ''manikongo''. Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]]. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing [[millet]] as a main staple.<ref>Jevan Cherniwchana and Juan Moreno-Cruz, \"Maize and Precolonial Africa\", ''Journal of Development Economics'' 136 (January 2019), 137-150. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.10.008</ref>\n[[File:KingdomKongo1711.png|thumb|right|240px|Kongo in 1711]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the ''manikongo'' held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east.

Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE.

This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people.

Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders. Madagascar functioned in the East African medieval period as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Zanzibar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSeveral kingdoms emerged after the 15th century: the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava Kingdom]] (16th century) on the west coast, [[Tsitambala]] Kingdom (17th century) on the east coast, and [[Merina]] (15th century) in the central highlands. By the 19th century, Merina controlled the whole island.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u20131861) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\n{{Main|History of Buganda|Karagwe District#History}}\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]].

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Rwanda#Pre-colonization}}\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657\u20131705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n{{Main|History of West Africa}}\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n{{Main|Sahelian kingdoms#History of Sahel kingdoms}}\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{Main|Ghana Empire#Origin}}\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]].

He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao.

By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sultanate-sokoto-sokoto-caliphate/ |title=About the Sokoto Caliphate  |last=Amy Yoo |first=Jiwon |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt.

Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital.

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The [[Queen mothers (Africa)|queen mother]] who produced the future ''oba'' wielded immense influence.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nBenin was never a significant exporter of slaves, as Alan Ryder's book Benin and the Europeans showed. By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast.

These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{Main|Southern Africa#History}}\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\n{{Main|Nguni people#History}}\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|250px|Zulu warriors]]\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]].

Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]].

For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans.

In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Livingstone attacked by a lion in Africa. Lithograph.

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp. 180\u2013189.</ref> Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the proto-German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by [[Jan Smuts]], an Afrikaner who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire.

With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

This is particularly true of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Nubia]]. In the [[Horn of Africa]] the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] ruled modern-day [[Eritrea]], northern [[Ethiopia]] and the coastal area of the western part of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The Ancient Egyptians established ties with the [[Land of Punt]] in 2,350 BC. Punt was a trade partner of Ancient Egypt and it is believed that it was located in modern-day [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]] or [[Eritrea]].<ref>Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', (Algora Publishing: 2004), p.258.</ref> [[Phoenicia]]n cities such as [[Carthage]] were part of the Mediterranean [[Iron Age]] and [[classical antiquity]].

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].<ref>Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30\u201333.

By 2,200 BC, the Old Kingdom's stability was undermined by rivalry among the governors of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] who challenged the power of pharaohs and by invasions of Asiatics into the Nile Delta. The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]] had begun, a time of political division and uncertainty.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\">Davidson (1991), pp. 30\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of Egypt arose when Mentuhotep II of [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] unified Egypt once again between 2041 and 2016 BC beginning with his conquering of [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|Tenth Dynasty]] in 2041 BC.<ref name=\"Grimal 155\">[[#Grimal1988|Grimal.

Connections with the southern regions of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], Wawat and Irthet at the second cataract were made stronger. Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. Egypt became a [[superpower]] controlling Nubia and [[Judea]] while exerting political influence on the Libyans to the West and on the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nAs before, the New Kingdom ended with invasion from the west by Libyan princes, leading to the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Beginning with [[Shoshenq I]], the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] was established. It ruled for two centuries.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nTo the south, Nubian independence and strength was being reasserted. This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751\u2013730 BC) and [[Shabaka]] (716\u2013695 BC). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]]. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons. The Nubian pharaoh [[Tantamani]] was the last of the Twenty-fifth dynasty.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nWhen the Assyrians and Nubians left, a new [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] emerged from [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. It lasted until 525 BC, when Egypt was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Unlike the Assyrians, the Persians stayed. In 332, Egypt was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. This was the beginning of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], which ended with [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest]] in 30 BC.

Ta-Seti was a powerful sacral kingdom in the Nile Valley at the 1st and 2nd cataracts that exerted an influence over nearby chiefdoms based on pictorial representation ruling over [[Upper Egypt]]. Ta-Seti traded as far as [[Syro-Palestine]], as well as with Egypt. Ta-Seti exported gold, copper, ostrich feathers, [[ebony]] and [[ivory trade|ivory]] to the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. By the 32nd century BC, Ta-Seti was in decline. After the unification of Egypt by [[Narmer]] in 3,100 BC, Ta-Seti was invaded by the Pharaoh [[Hor-Aha]] of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], destroying the final remnants of the kingdom.

Around the latter part of the third millennium, there was further consolidation of the sacral kingdoms.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Two kingdoms in particular emerged: the Sai kingdom, immediately south of Egypt, and the [[Kingdom of Kerma]] at the third cataract. Sometime around the 18th century BC, the Kingdom of Kerma conquered the Kingdom of Sai, becoming a serious rival to Egypt. Kerma occupied a territory from the first cataract to the confluence of the [[Blue Nile]], [[White Nile]], and [[Atbarah River]]. About 1,575 to 1,550 BC, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.<ref>Alberge, Dalya. \"Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret\", ''The Times'' {London}, 28 July 2003.</ref> The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nEgypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire. The empire extended from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the confluence of the Blue Nile, the White Nile, and River Atbara.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 760 BC, the Kushites were expelled from Egypt by iron-wielding [[Assyria]]ns. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually, with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production. In 350 AD, the Aksumite king [[Ezana]] brought Mer\u00f6e to an end.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 42\u201345.</ref>\n\n===Carthage===\n{{main|Ancient Carthage#History}}\n[[File:Carthaginianempire.PNG|thumb|250px|Carthaginian Empire]]\nThe Egyptians referred to the people west of the Nile, ancestral to the [[Berber people|Berbers]], as [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]]. The Libyans were agriculturalists like the [[Mauri (people)|Mauri]] of [[Morocco]] and the [[Numidians]] of central and eastern [[Algeria]] and [[Tunis]]. They were also nomadic, having the horse, and occupied the arid pastures and desert, like the [[Gaetuli]]. Berber desert nomads were typically in conflict with Berber coastal agriculturalists.<ref>Iliffe, John (2007), ''Africans: The History of a Continent'', p. 30. 2nd ed.

They began to populate the North African coast with settlements{{mdash}}trading and mixing with the native Berber population. In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans. Salt and metal goods were traded for gold, slaves, beads, and ivory.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 63\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of Carthage]]\nThe [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] were rivals to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Carthage fought the [[Punic Wars]], three wars with Rome: the [[First Punic War]] (264 to 241 BC), over [[Sicily]]; the [[Second Punic War]] (218 to 201 BC), in which [[Hannibal]] invaded Europe; and the [[Third Punic War]] (149 to 146 BC). Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olive]]s, and [[olive oil]] to [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]] via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories. The Berber kingdoms subsequently regained their independence.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Africa at [[Alexandria]] in the 1st century AD and spread to [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]]. By 313 AD, with the [[Edict of Milan]], all of Roman North Africa was Christian. [[Egyptians]] adopted [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] Christianity and formed the independent [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. Berbers adopted [[Donatism|Donatist]] Christianity.

[[Berber people|Berber]] civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others. By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed one of the largest element, with Gauls, of the Carthaginian army.\n\nIn the [[Mercenary War]] (241-238 BC), a rebellion was instigated by mercenary soldiers of Carthage and African allies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/first-punic-war|title=The First Punic War {{!}} Dickinson College Commentaries|website=dcc.dickinson.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Berber soldiers participated after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. Berbers succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n===Somalia===\n{{Main|History of Somalia}}\n{{Further|Maritime history of Somalia}}\n[[File:Qableh1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ruins of [[Qa'ableh]], an early center of [[Somali people|Somali]] civilization]]\nThe ancestors of the [[Somali people]] were an important link in the [[Horn of Africa]] connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world.

Sedentary tribes lost their autonomy and connection with the land. Berber opposition to the Roman presence was nearly constant. The [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]] established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aur\u00e8s and [[Nemencha]] mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern [[Biskra]]) to Ad Majores ([[Hennchir Besseriani]], southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended at least as far as Castellum Dimmidi (modern [[Messa\u00e2d]], southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort.

Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAside from [[Carthage]], urbanization in North Africa came in part with the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors [[Claudius]] (reigned 41\u201354), [[Nerva]] (96\u201398), and [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117). In Algeria such settlements included [[Tipasa]], Cuicul or Curculum (modern [[Dj\u00e9mila|Djemila]], northeast of S\u00e9tif), Thamugadi (modern [[Timgad]], southeast of S\u00e9tif), and Sitifis (modern S\u00e9tif). The prosperity of most towns depended on [[agriculture]]. Called the \"granary of the empire\", North Africa became one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, shipping to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like [[Roman Italy|Italy]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Roman imperial decline]] seemed less serious in North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]]. Some Jews had been deported from [[Judea]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD for rebelling against Roman rule; others had come earlier with [[Punics|Punic]] settlers. In addition, a number of Berber tribes had converted to [[Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nChristianity arrived in the 2nd century and soon gained converts in the towns and among slaves. More than eighty bishops, some from distant frontier regions of Numidia, attended the [[Council of Carthage (256)]] in 256.

The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284\u2013305). The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306\u2013337) in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe occasionally violent Donatist controversy has been characterized{{by whom|date=December 2013}} as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in Carthage in 411, Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA decline in trade weakened Roman control.

D'mt traded through the [[Red Sea]] with Egypt and the Mediterranean, providing frankincense. By the 5th and 3rd centuries, D'mt had declined, and several successor states took its place. Later there was greater trade with [[South Arabia]], mainly with the port of [[Sabaeans|Saba]]. [[Adulis]] became an important commercial center in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The interaction of the peoples in the two regions, the southern Arabia [[Sabaeans]] and the northern Ethiopians, resulted in the [[Ge'ez]] culture and language and eventual development of the [[Ge'ez script]]. Trade links increased and expanded from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, with Egypt, Israel, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, to the Black Sea, and to Persia, India, and China. Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BC, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants.

Kanem arose by engaging in the trans-Saharan trade. It exchanged slaves captured by raiding the south for horses from North Africa, which in turn aided in the acquisition of slaves. By the late 11th century, the Islamic [[Sayfawa Dynasty|Sayfawa (Saifawa) dynasty]] was founded by [[Hummay|Humai (Hummay) ibn Salamna]]. The Sayfawa Dynasty ruled for 771 years, making it one of the longest-lasting dynasties in human history.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\"/> In addition to trade, taxation of local farms around Kanem became a source of state income. Kanem reached its peak under ''Mai'' (king) [[Dunama Dabbalemi|Dunama Dibalemi ibn Salma]] (1210\u20131248). The empire reportedly was able to field 40,000 cavalry, and it extended from [[Fezzan]] in the north to the [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] state in the south.

A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads. The ''balopwe'' was the direct communicator with the ancestral spirits and chosen by them. Conquered states were integrated into the system and represented in the court, with their titles. The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo. Two major empires claiming Luba descent were the [[Lunda Empire]] and [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]].

His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'', ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system.

''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in [[Zambia]] also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade.

The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth.

Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]].

Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE.

This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel.

Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders. Madagascar functioned in the East African medieval period as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Zanzibar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSeveral kingdoms emerged after the 15th century: the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava Kingdom]] (16th century) on the west coast, [[Tsitambala]] Kingdom (17th century) on the east coast, and [[Merina]] (15th century) in the central highlands. By the 19th century, Merina controlled the whole island.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u20131861) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\n{{Main|History of Buganda|Karagwe District#History}}\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]].

However, very little is known about Kitara; some scholars even question its historical existence.

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Rwanda#Pre-colonization}}\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657\u20131705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n{{Main|History of West Africa}}\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n{{Main|Sahelian kingdoms#History of Sahel kingdoms}}\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{Main|Ghana Empire#Origin}}\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]].

He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88\u201389.</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013102, 179\u2013181.</ref>\n\n=====Sokoto Caliphate=====\n{{Main|Sokoto Caliphate#History}}\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nThe [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sultanate-sokoto-sokoto-caliphate/ |title=About the Sokoto Caliphate  |last=Amy Yoo |first=Jiwon |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt.

Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital.

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The [[Queen mothers (Africa)|queen mother]] who produced the future ''oba'' wielded immense influence.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nBenin was never a significant exporter of slaves, as Alan Ryder's book Benin and the Europeans showed. By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>\n\n=====Niger Delta and Igbo=====\n{{Further|Igbo people#History|Kingdom of Bonny#Early history|Kalabari Kingdom#History|Kingdom of Warri#History|Kingdom of Nri#History|List of rulers of Nri}}\n{{Igbo land labelled map}}\nThe [[Niger Delta]] comprised numerous [[city-state]]s with numerous forms of government. These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{Main|Southern Africa#History}}\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\n{{Main|Nguni people#History}}\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|250px|Zulu warriors]]\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]].

Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]].

For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans.

In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Livingstone attacked by a lion in Africa. Lithograph.

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945.

With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

The term has also been modified to describe '''top 50'''; '''top 30'''; '''top 20'''; '''top 10'''; '''hot 100''' (each with its number of songs) and '''hot hits''' radio formats, but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with [[Todd Storz]] as further refined by [[Gordon McLendon]] as well as [[Bill Drake]].  The format became especially popular in the mid-sixties as radio stations constrained disc jockeys to numbered play lists in the wake of the [[payola]] scandal.\n\n==Variations==\n===Mainstream CHR===\n{{see also|Billboard Hot 100|Mainstream Top 40}}\nAlso known as CHR/pop or teen CHR. Plays [[pop music|pop]], and [[Electronic dance music|dance]], and sometimes [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[country music|country]] crossover as well. Often referred as \"[[top 40]]\"; in terms of incorporating a variety of genres of music, CHR/pop is the successor to the original concept of top 40 radio which originated in the 1950s. Examples of CHR/pop stations in the United States, Brazil and the Philippines include [[WHTZ]] in [[New York City]], [[KIIS-FM]] and [[KAMP-FM]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Jovem Pan]] And [[Jovem Pan FM]] in [[Brazil]], [[KLUC]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[KRBE]] in [[Houston]], [[WIOQ]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[WXKS-FM]] and [[WODS]] in [[Boston]], [[WKSC-FM]] and [[WBBM-FM]] in [[Chicago]], [[WFLZ]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]/[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[WHYI]] in [[Miami]], [[WNCI]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[WZPL]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[KDWB]] in [[Minneapolis]]/[[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], and [[DWFO|87.5 FM1]], [[DWTM|Magic 89.9]] and [[DWRT-FM|99.5 Play FM]] in [[Manila, Philippines]].\n\n===Adult CHR===\nThese stations typically are hybrids of the contemporary hit radio (CHR/pop) and [[Adult contemporary music#Hot adult contemporary|hot AC]] formats. This format contains a strong focus on current chart, contemporary and recurrent hits as well as placing a minority of older, classic hits from the 2000s and early to mid 2010s onto the playlist. Adult CHR stations play pop-friendly rhythmic, dance and hip hop titles from artists such as [[Rihanna]], [[Post Malone]], [[Khalid]], [[Lizzo]], [[Black Eyed Peas]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Doja Cat]] and [[Blackbear (musician)|Blackbear]] <ref> All Access Hot AC chart, https://www.allaccess.com/mediabase/q/report/sevenDay/format/A2/panel/R/detail/C/reportType/R </ref> alongside standard mainstream pop and pop rock fare.\n\nExamples in the U.S. include [[WKRQ]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[WWMX]] in [[Baltimore]], [[WKFR-FM]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[WROK-FM|WROK]] in [[Rockford, Illinois]], [[WKCI-FM|WKCI]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[WZYP]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[KBMX]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[WMXZ]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], Sirius XM Hits 1, [[WNDV]] in [[South Bend]], [[WIXX]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[KLTG]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] and [[KZZO]] in [[Sacramento]]. United Kingdom (UK) media regulator [[Ofcom]] states: \"where a format requires a contemporary and [[UK Singles Chart|chart music]] service, the main diet must be of modern music, reflecting the charts of today and recent months. Older, classic tracks would not be out of place, but only as spice to the main offering.\"<ref>[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/radio/formats-content/about-formats Ofcom| About radio formats]</ref>\n\nThe adult CHR format is sometimes utilized by stations which are heritage Top 40/CHR outlets in their respective markets which have been in the format since the 1970s or 1980s or FM successors to former AM top 40s. ''See also: [[Adult Top 40]], a US Billboard chart.''\n\n===Rhythmic CHR===\n\n{{main|Rhythmic contemporary}}\nAlso known as CHR/rhythmic, or CHR/urban. These stations focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[dance-pop]]. There are differences between CHR/rhythmic and the [[urban contemporary]] format; urban stations will often play [[R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]] songs that CHR/rhythmic stations will not, and CHR/rhythmic stations, despite playlists heavy with urban product, sometimes have white disc jockeys and will include [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and rhythmic pop music that urban outlets will not play. [[KYLD]] in [[San Francisco]], [[WQHT]] in [[New York City|New York]], and [[KPWR]] in [[Los Angeles]] are among the most successful CHR/rhythmic stations in the U.S. and among the pioneers of the format.\n\n=== Bilingual CHR ===\nBilingual Spanish CHRs (such as [[WPOW]] in [[Miami]], [[KHHM]] in [[Sacramento, California]], [[KKPS]] in [[Brownsville, Texas]], [[KBHH]] in [[Fresno, California]] and [[WRUM]]-HD2 in [[Orlando, Florida]]) combine current and recent mainstream and rhythmic CHR hits with recent Latin pop hits, targeting young [[Latinas|Latina]] listeners. Similarly, bilingual French CHRs (such as [[CKOI-FM]] in [[Montreal]]) are common in many Canadian markets, and combine anglophone and [[French pop]] hits.\n\n===CHR/dance===\nPlaying [[electronic dance music|dance]] remixes of popular songs with perhaps some current hits from the dance charts. Pure dance-music radio stations (as opposed to CHR/rhythmic and [[rhythmic AC]] formats such as [[MOViN]]) are not very common but tend to have loyal audiences in the markets where they do exist.  Examples include [[KFCO|KDHT-FM]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[WPTY]] on [[Long Island, NY]] and [[KNHC]] in [[Seattle]]. ''See also: [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]''\n\n===CHR/rock===\n{{See also|Album-oriented rock#Spin-off formats}}\nStations with this format are similar in some ways to the adult CHR and mainstream CHR/pop formats, but also incorporate [[modern rock]] and [[modern AC]] titles in an upbeat presentation. Examples include [[KSXY]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]] and [[KKCK]] in [[Marshall, Minnesota]].\n\nAn early version of rock-leaning CHR is '''Rock 40''', which was popular in the late 1980s. This format, developed by Joint Communications who [[Service mark|servicemarked]] the name in 1987, is a young-male-targeted hybrid of CHR and [[album-oriented rock]] (AOR) that combines the formatics of the former with the music mix of the latter. After a short period of successful ratings, the Rock 40 format began to decline because it was too similar to conventional AOR yet lacked appeal among CHR fans who desired less emphasis on rock. According to [[Lee Abrams]], a pioneer of the AOR format, Rock 40 was \"too wimpy for the real rockers and too hard for the mainstream people\".<ref name=\"RR 1989-07-20\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/90s/90/RR-1990-07-20-OCR-Page-0060.pdf |last=Kojan |first=Harvey |title=Whatever Happened To Rock 40? |magazine=[[Radio & Records]] |page=60 |date=July 20, 1989 |access-date=June 18, 2019 }}</ref> Stations that previously broadcast the format include [[KEGL]] in [[Dallas]], [[KQLZ (defunct)|KQLZ]] (Pirate Radio) in [[Los Angeles]], [[KFBT|KRZR]] in [[Fresno, California]], [[WDAF-FM|KXXR]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and [[WMMS]] in [[Cleveland]].<ref name=\"RR 1989-11-17\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/80s/89/RR-1989-11-17-OCR-Page-0052.pdf |last=Kojan |first=Harvey |title=Rock 40 Vs.

In Greater China (People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), there is also [[Mandopop]] and [[Cantopop]] which are the top 40 variants in that language.\n\n==Key contributors==\n\n===Todd Storz===\nCredit for the format is widely given to [[Todd Storz]], who was the director of radio station [[KCRO|KOWH]]-AM in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1951.  At that time typical AM radio programming consisted largely of [[full service (radio format)|full-service]] \"[[block programming]]\": pre-scheduled, sponsored programs of a wide variety, including [[radio drama]]s and variety shows.  Local popular music hits, if they made it on the air at all, had to be worked in between these segments.  Storz noted the great response certain songs got from the record-buying public and compared it to the way certain selections on [[jukebox]]es were played over and over.  He expanded his domain of radio stations, purchasing [[WQNO|WTIX-AM]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], gradually converted his stations to an all-hits format, and pioneered the practice of surveying record stores to determine which singles were popular each week.  Storz found that the more people heard a given song on the radio or from the jukebox, the more likely they were to buy a copy; a conclusion not obvious in the industry at the time.  In 1952 he purchased what was then WLAF-AM in Lafayette, Indiana and constructed WAZY-AM/FM which is still the longest running top 40 FM station in existence to this day. In 1954, Storz purchased [[WHB]]-AM, a high-powered station in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] which could be heard throughout the Midwest and Great Plains, converted it to an all-hits format, and dubbed the result \"top 40\".  Shortly thereafter WHB debuted the first \"top 40 countdown\", a reverse-order playing of the station's ranking of hit singles for that week.  Within a few years, top 40 stations appeared all over the country to great success, spurred by the burgeoning popularity of [[rock and roll]] music, especially that of [[Elvis Presley]]. A 1950s employee at WHB, Ruth Meyer, went on to have tremendous success in the early to mid-60's as program director of New York's premiere top 40 station at that time, WMCA.\n\nStorz Broadcasting Company consisted of six AM radio stations, all featuring top 40 in the sixties.\n\n===Gordon McLendon===\nAlthough Todd Storz is regarded as the father of the top 100 format{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Gordon McLendon]] of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]], is regarded as the person who took an idea and turned it into a mass media marketing success in combination with the development in that same city of [[PAMS]] jingles. McLendon's successful Mighty 1190 [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] in Dallas, along with his two other [[Texas Triangle]] stations, 610 [[KILT (AM)]] Houston and 550 [[KTSA]] San Antonio, which went top 40 during the mid to late 1950s, soon became perhaps the most imitated radio stations in America. With careful attention to programming, McLendon presented his stations as packages to advertisers and listeners alike.  It was the combination of top 40 and PAMS jingles which became the key to the success of the radio format itself. Not only were the same records played on different stations across America, but so were the same jingle music beds whose lyrics were resung repetitively for each station to create individual station identity. To this basic mix were added contests, games and [[disc jockey]] patter. Various groups (including [[Bartell Broadcasters]]) emphasized local variations on their top 40 stations.\n\nGordon McLendon would operate approximately a dozen and a half AM, FM and TV stations at various times, experimenting with formats other than top 40 (including [[beautiful music]] and all-news).\n\n===Rick Sklar===\nIn the early 1960s [[Rick Sklar]] also developed the top 40 format for radio station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in [[New York City]] which was then copied by stations in the eastern and mid-western United States such as [[WWKB|WKBW]] and [[WLS (AM)|WLS]].\n\n===Bill Drake===\n[[Bill Drake]] built upon the foundation established by Storz and McLendon to create a variation called \"[[Boss Radio]]\". This format began in California in early 1961 at [[KSTN (AM)|KSTN]] in Stockton, then expanded in 1962\u201363 to [[KYNO]] in Fresno, in 1964 to [[KLSD|KGB]] in San Diego, and finally to [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] in Los Angeles in May 1965; it was further adapted to stations across the western US. Boss Radio was later broadcast by American disc jockeys as a hybrid format on [[pirate radio]] station [[Swinging Radio England]], broadcasting from onboard a ship anchored off the coast of southern England in international waters. At that time there were no commercial radio stations in the UK, and BBC radio offered only sporadic top 40 programming. Other noteworthy North American top 40 stations that used the Drake approach included [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]] in San Francisco; [[CKLW]] in Windsor, Ontario; [[WRKO]] in Boston; [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]] in Memphis; [[WOLF (AM)|WOLF]] in Syracuse, New York; and [[WEPN-FM|WOR-FM]] in New York City. Most listeners identified Boss Radio with less talk, shorter jingles and more music.\n\n===Mike Joseph and hot hits===\nMike Joseph's \"[[hot hits]]\" stations of the late 1970s and early 1980s attempted to revitalize the format by refocusing listeners' attention on current, active \"box-office\" music. Thus, hot hits stations played only current hit songs\u2014no oldies unless they were on current chart albums\u2014in a fast, furious and repetitive fashion, with fast-talking personalities and loud, pounding jingles. In 1977, [[WTIC-FM]] in Hartford, CT, dropped its long-running classical format for Joseph's format as \"96 Tics\" and immediately became one of the top radio stations in the market. The first Joseph station to use the term \"hot hits\" on the air was [[WFBL]] (\"Fire 14\", which played its top 14 hits in very tight rotation) in Syracuse, NY, in 1979. Then [[WOGL|WCAU-FM]] in Philadelphia switched to hot hits as \"98 Now\" in the fall of 1981 and was instantly successful.  Other major-market stations which adopted the hot hits format in the early 1980s included [[WBBM-FM]] Chicago, WHYT (now [[WDVD]]) Detroit, WMAR-FM (now [[WWMX]]) Baltimore, which we might add was not successful against market leader WBSB B104, [[KITS]] San Francisco, and [[WNVZ]] Norfolk.\n\n===Don Pierson===\n[[Don Pierson]] took the formats of Gordon McLendon, boss radio and PAMS jingles to the UK in the form of [[Wonderful Radio London]], (a [[pirate radio]] ship) and subsequently revolutionized the popular music format. On 14 August 1967 The Marine Offences Act was introduced in the UK and the pirate stations were shut down.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation were chosen by the UK government to come up with a station to replace the pirates, and so in 1967 [[BBC Radio 1]] started broadcasting, employing many of the DJ's from the pirate stations (Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett and John Peel etc.) and obtaining re-sings of the PAMS jingles.\n\nIn fact{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} it was Tony Blackburn who played the first pop record on Radio 1, The Move's \"Flowers In The Rain\".\n\n==Countdowns, shows and personalities==\n*[[List of number-one hits (United States)]]\n*[[Rick Dees Weekly Top 40]]\n*[[Ryan Seacrest]]\n*[[Sean Hamilton|Sean \u201cHollywood\u201d Hamilton]]\n*[[The Vodafone Big Top 40]], the [[United Kingdom]]'s nationally syndicated chart show.

There are differences between CHR/rhythmic and the [[urban contemporary]] format; urban stations will often play [[R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]] songs that CHR/rhythmic stations will not, and CHR/rhythmic stations, despite playlists heavy with urban product, sometimes have white disc jockeys and will include [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and rhythmic pop music that urban outlets will not play. [[KYLD]] in [[San Francisco]], [[WQHT]] in [[New York City|New York]], and [[KPWR]] in [[Los Angeles]] are among the most successful CHR/rhythmic stations in the U.S. and among the pioneers of the format.\n\n=== Bilingual CHR ===\nBilingual Spanish CHRs (such as [[WPOW]] in [[Miami]], [[KHHM]] in [[Sacramento, California]], [[KKPS]] in [[Brownsville, Texas]], [[KBHH]] in [[Fresno, California]] and [[WRUM]]-HD2 in [[Orlando, Florida]]) combine current and recent mainstream and rhythmic CHR hits with recent Latin pop hits, targeting young [[Latina]] listeners. Similarly, bilingual French CHRs (such as [[CKOI-FM]] in [[Montreal]]) are common in many Canadian markets, and combine anglophone and [[French pop]] hits.\n\n===CHR/dance===\nPlaying [[electronic dance music|dance]] remixes of popular songs with perhaps some current hits from the dance charts. Pure dance-music radio stations (as opposed to CHR/rhythmic and [[rhythmic AC]] formats such as [[MOViN]]) are not very common but tend to have loyal audiences in the markets where they do exist.  Examples include [[KFCO|KDHT-FM]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[WPTY]] on [[Long Island, NY]] and [[KNHC]] in [[Seattle]]. ''See also: [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]''\n\n===CHR/rock===\n{{See also|Album-oriented rock#Spin-off formats}}\nStations with this format are similar in some ways to the adult CHR and mainstream CHR/pop formats, but also incorporate [[modern rock]] and [[modern AC]] titles in an upbeat presentation. Examples include [[KSXY]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]] and [[KKCK]] in [[Marshall, Minnesota]].\n\nAn early version of rock-leaning CHR is '''Rock 40''', which was popular in the late 1980s. This format, developed by Joint Communications who [[Service mark|servicemarked]] the name in 1987, is a young-male-targeted hybrid of CHR and [[album-oriented rock]] (AOR) that combines the formatics of the former with the music mix of the latter. After a short period of successful ratings, the Rock 40 format began to decline because it was too similar to conventional AOR yet lacked appeal among CHR fans who desired less emphasis on rock. According to [[Lee Abrams]], a pioneer of the AOR format, Rock 40 was \"too wimpy for the real rockers and too hard for the mainstream people\".<ref name=\"RR 1989-07-20\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/90s/90/RR-1990-07-20-OCR-Page-0060.pdf |last=Kojan |first=Harvey |title=Whatever Happened To Rock 40? |magazine=[[Radio & Records]] |page=60 |date=July 20, 1989 |access-date=June 18, 2019 }}</ref> Stations that previously broadcast the format include [[KEGL]] in [[Dallas]], [[KQLZ (defunct)|KQLZ]] (Pirate Radio) in [[Los Angeles]], [[KFBT|KRZR]] in [[Fresno, California]], [[WDAF-FM|KXXR]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and [[WMMS]] in [[Cleveland]].<ref name=\"RR 1989-11-17\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/80s/89/RR-1989-11-17-OCR-Page-0052.pdf |last=Kojan |first=Harvey |title=Rock 40 Vs. AOR: The Story So Far |magazine=[[Radio & Records]] |page=52 |date=November 17, 1989 |access-date=June 18, 2019 }}</ref> Rock 40 stations eventually segued to CHR or an AOR spinoff format such as [[active rock]] or [[modern rock]].\n\n===Other variations===\nThere are also [[ethnicity|ethnic]] variations, such as '''CHR/espa\u00f1ol''' ([[Latin pop]]), and '''CHR/Tejano''' ([[Tejano music|Tex-Mex and Tejano]]) which are commonly found in [[Arizona]], [[Texas]], [[California]], and Mexico.  In Greater China (People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), there is also [[Mandopop]] and [[Cantopop]] which are the top 40 variants in that language.\n\n==Key contributors==\n\n===Todd Storz===\nCredit for the format is widely given to [[Todd Storz]], who was the director of radio station [[KCRO|KOWH]]-AM in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1951.  At that time typical AM radio programming consisted largely of [[full service (radio format)|full-service]] \"[[block programming]]\": pre-scheduled, sponsored programs of a wide variety, including [[radio drama]]s and variety shows.  Local popular music hits, if they made it on the air at all, had to be worked in between these segments.  Storz noted the great response certain songs got from the record-buying public and compared it to the way certain selections on [[jukebox]]es were played over and over.  He expanded his domain of radio stations, purchasing [[WQNO|WTIX-AM]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], gradually converted his stations to an all-hits format, and pioneered the practice of surveying record stores to determine which singles were popular each week.  Storz found that the more people heard a given song on the radio or from the jukebox, the more likely they were to buy a copy; a conclusion not obvious in the industry at the time.  In 1952 he purchased what was then WLAF-AM in Lafayette, Indiana and constructed WAZY-AM/FM which is still the longest running top 40 FM station in existence to this day. In 1954, Storz purchased [[WHB]]-AM, a high-powered station in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] which could be heard throughout the Midwest and Great Plains, converted it to an all-hits format, and dubbed the result \"top 40\".  Shortly thereafter WHB debuted the first \"top 40 countdown\", a reverse-order playing of the station's ranking of hit singles for that week.  Within a few years, top 40 stations appeared all over the country to great success, spurred by the burgeoning popularity of [[rock and roll]] music, especially that of [[Elvis Presley]]. A 1950s employee at WHB, Ruth Meyer, went on to have tremendous success in the early to mid-60's as program director of New York's premiere top 40 station at that time, WMCA.\n\nStorz Broadcasting Company consisted of six AM radio stations, all featuring top 40 in the sixties.\n\n===Gordon McLendon===\nAlthough Todd Storz is regarded as the father of the top 100 format{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Gordon McLendon]] of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]], is regarded as the person who took an idea and turned it into a mass media marketing success in combination with the development in that same city of [[PAMS]] jingles. McLendon's successful Mighty 1190 [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] in Dallas, along with his two other [[Texas Triangle]] stations, 610 [[KILT (AM)]] Houston and 550 [[KTSA]] San Antonio, which went top 40 during the mid to late 1950s, soon became perhaps the most imitated radio stations in America. With careful attention to programming, McLendon presented his stations as packages to advertisers and listeners alike.  It was the combination of top 40 and PAMS jingles which became the key to the success of the radio format itself. Not only were the same records played on different stations across America, but so were the same jingle music beds whose lyrics were resung repetitively for each station to create individual station identity. To this basic mix were added contests, games and [[disc jockey]] patter. Various groups (including [[Bartell Broadcasters]]) emphasized local variations on their top 40 stations.\n\nGordon McLendon would operate approximately a dozen and a half AM, FM and TV stations at various times, experimenting with formats other than top 40 (including [[beautiful music]] and all-news).\n\n===Rick Sklar===\nIn the early 1960s [[Rick Sklar]] also developed the top 40 format for radio station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in [[New York City]] which was then copied by stations in the eastern and mid-western United States such as [[WWKB|WKBW]] and [[WLS (AM)|WLS]].\n\n===Bill Drake===\n[[Bill Drake]] built upon the foundation established by Storz and McLendon to create a variation called \"[[Boss Radio]]\". This format began in California in early 1961 at [[KSTN (AM)|KSTN]] in Stockton, then expanded in 1962\u201363 to [[KYNO]] in Fresno, in 1964 to [[KLSD|KGB]] in San Diego, and finally to [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] in Los Angeles in May 1965; it was further adapted to stations across the western US. Boss Radio was later broadcast by American disc jockeys as a hybrid format on [[pirate radio]] station [[Swinging Radio England]], broadcasting from onboard a ship anchored off the coast of southern England in international waters. At that time there were no commercial radio stations in the UK, and BBC radio offered only sporadic top 40 programming. Other noteworthy North American top 40 stations that used the Drake approach included [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]] in San Francisco; [[CKLW]] in Windsor, Ontario; [[WRKO]] in Boston; [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]] in Memphis; [[WOLF (AM)|WOLF]] in Syracuse, New York; and [[WEPN-FM|WOR-FM]] in New York City. Most listeners identified Boss Radio with less talk, shorter jingles and more music.\n\n===Mike Joseph and hot hits===\nMike Joseph's \"[[hot hits]]\" stations of the late 1970s and early 1980s attempted to revitalize the format by refocusing listeners' attention on current, active \"box-office\" music. Thus, hot hits stations played only current hit songs\u2014no oldies unless they were on current chart albums\u2014in a fast, furious and repetitive fashion, with fast-talking personalities and loud, pounding jingles. In 1977, [[WTIC-FM]] in Hartford, CT, dropped its long-running classical format for Joseph's format as \"96 Tics\" and immediately became one of the top radio stations in the market. The first Joseph station to use the term \"hot hits\" on the air was [[WFBL]] (\"Fire 14\", which played its top 14 hits in very tight rotation) in Syracuse, NY, in 1979. Then [[WOGL|WCAU-FM]] in Philadelphia switched to hot hits as \"98 Now\" in the fall of 1981 and was instantly successful.  Other major-market stations which adopted the hot hits format in the early 1980s included [[WBBM-FM]] Chicago, WHYT (now [[WDVD]]) Detroit, WMAR-FM (now [[WWMX]]) Baltimore, which we might add was not successful against market leader WBSB B104, [[KITS]] San Francisco, and [[WNVZ]] Norfolk.\n\n===Don Pierson===\n[[Don Pierson]] took the formats of Gordon McLendon, boss radio and PAMS jingles to the UK in the form of [[Wonderful Radio London]], (a [[pirate radio]] ship) and subsequently revolutionized the popular music format. On 14 August 1967 The Marine Offences Act was introduced in the UK and the pirate stations were shut down.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation were chosen by the UK government to come up with a station to replace the pirates, and so in 1967 [[BBC Radio 1]] started broadcasting, employing many of the DJ's from the pirate stations (Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett and John Peel etc.) and obtaining re-sings of the PAMS jingles.\n\nIn fact{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} it was Tony Blackburn who played the first pop record on Radio 1, The Move's \"Flowers In The Rain\".\n\n==Countdowns, shows and personalities==\n*[[List of number-one hits (United States)]]\n*[[Rick Dees Weekly Top 40]]\n*[[Ryan Seacrest]]\n*[[Sean Hamilton|Sean \u201cHollywood\u201d Hamilton]]\n*[[The Vodafone Big Top 40]], the [[United Kingdom]]'s nationally syndicated chart show.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFCoSSKTffcC&pg=PA382#v=onepage (Google Books)]</ref>\n\nThe most basic explanation for the hypostatic union is Jesus Christ being both God and man. He is both perfectly divine and perfectly human.\n\nThe [[Athanasian Creed]] recognized this doctrine and affirmed its importance, stating that \"He is God from the essence of the Father, begotten before time; and he is human from the essence of his mother, born in time; completely God, completely human, with a rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards divinity, less than the Father as regards humanity. Although he is God and human, yet Christ is not two, but one. He is one, however, not by his divinity being turned into flesh, but by God's taking humanity to himself. He is one, certainly not by the blending of his essence, but by the unity of his person. For just as one human is both rational soul and flesh, so too the one Christ is both God and human.\"\n\n==''Hypostasis''==\n{{Main|Hypostasis (philosophy)}}\n\nThe Greek term ''hypostasis'' had come into use as a technical term prior to the Christological debates of the late fourth and fifth centuries.  In pre-Christian times, [[Greek philosophy]] (primarily [[Stoicism]]) used the word.<ref>R. Norris, \"Hypostasis,\" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. E. Ferguson.

''Hypostasis'' denotes an actual, concrete existence, in contrast to abstract categories such as [[Platonic ideal]]s.\n\nIn [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard's]] ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', the dual nature of Christ is explored as a paradox, i.e. as \"the ultimate paradox\", because God, understood as a perfectly good, perfectly wise, perfectly powerful being, fully became a human, in the [[Fall of man|Christian understanding of the term]]: burdened by sin, limited in goodness, knowledge, and understanding.<ref>Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 217 (read p.202-217) also see ''Philosophical Fragments'' p.31-35 and The Sickness Unto Death p. 132-133 Hannay</ref> This paradox can only be resolved, Kierkegaard believed, by a [[leap of faith]] away from one's understanding and reason towards belief in God; thus the paradox of the hypostatic union was crucial to an abiding faith in the Christian God.\n\nAs the precise nature of this union is held to defy finite human comprehension, the hypostatic union is also referred to by the alternative term \"mystical union\".\n\n==Through history==\n{{Christology}}\n[[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] was the first to use the term hypostasis in trying to understand the [[Incarnation]].<ref>Gregory of Nyssa, ''Antirrheticus Adversus Apollinarem.''</ref>  Apollinaris described the union of the divine and human in Christ as being of a single nature and having a single essence \u2014 a single hypostasis.\n\n===Council of Ephesus===\nIn the 5th century, a dispute arose between [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Nestorius]] in which Nestorius claimed that the term ''[[theotokos]]'' could not be used to describe Mary, the mother of Christ. Nestorius argued for two distinct natures of Christ, maintaining that God could not be born because the divine nature is unoriginate.  Therefore, Nestorius believed that the man Jesus of Nazareth was born in union with, but separate from and not strictly identifiable with, the Logos of God. The [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, under the leadership of Cyril himself as well as the Ephesian bishop Memnon, labeled Nestorius a neo-[[adoptionism|adoptionist]], implying that the man Jesus is divine and the Son of God only by grace and not by nature, and deposed him as a heretic. In his letter to Nestorius, Cyril used the term \"hypostatic\" (Greek, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd ''kath' hyp\u00f3stasin'') to refer to Christ's divine and human natures being one, saying, \u201cWe must follow these words and teachings, keeping in mind what \u2018having been made flesh\u2019 means \u2026. We say \u2026 that the Word, by having united to himself hypostatically flesh animated by a rational soul, inexplicably and incomprehensibly became man.\u201d<ref>Saint Cyril of Alexandria. St. Cyril of Alexandria: Letters. Trans. John McEnerney. Washington D.C.: Catholic University of America, 1987. Print.</ref>\n\n===Council of Chalcedon===\nThe preeminent Antiochene theologian [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], contending against the [[monophysitism|monophysite]] heresy of [[Apollinarism]], is believed to have taught that in Christ there are two natures ([[dyophysite]]), human and divine, and two corresponding hypostases (in the sense of \"subject\", \"essence\", or \"person\") which co-existed.<ref>\"Theodore\" in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian History'', ed. J. Brauer.  Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971.</ref> However, in Theodore's time the word ''hypostasis'' could be used in a sense synonymous with ''[[ousia]]'' (which clearly means \"essence\" rather than \"person\") as it had been used by [[Tatian]] and [[Origen]]. The Greek and Latin interpretations of Theodore's Christology have come under scrutiny since the recovery of his ''Catechetical Orations'' in the Syriac language.\n\nIn 451, the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon promulgated the [[Chalcedonian Definition]]. It agreed with Theodore that there were two natures in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]].  However, the [[Council of Chalcedon]] also insisted that hypostasis be used as it was in the Trinitarian definition: to indicate the person ([[prosopon]]) and not the nature as with Apollinaris. \n\n===Oriental Orthodox rejection of Chalcedonian definition===\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es, having rejected the Chalcedonian Creed, were known as [[Miaphysites]] because they maintain the [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyrilian]] definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature. The [[Chalcedonian]] \"in two natures\" formula (based, at least partially, on {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:9|ESV}}) was seen as derived from and akin to a [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] Christology.<ref>[http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php Britishorthodox.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619000000/http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php |date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref> Contrariwise, the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards [[Eutychianism|Eutychian]] Monophysitism. However, the Oriental Orthodox persistently specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches, that they have always affirmed that Christ's humanity is consubstantial with our own, and they thus prefer the term [[Miaphysite]] to be referred to as a reference to Cyrillian Christology, which used the phrase \"{{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}}\", \"''m\u00eda ph\u00fdsis to\u00fb theo\u00fb l\u00f3gou sesark\u014dm\u00e9n\u0113''\".

[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFCoSSKTffcC&pg=PA382#v=onepage (Google Books)]</ref>\n\nThe most basic explanation for the hypostatic union is Jesus Christ being both God and man. He is both perfectly divine and perfectly human.\n\nThe [[Athanasian Creed]] recognized this doctrine and affirmed its importance, stating that \"He is God from the essence of the Father, begotten before time; and he is human from the essence of his mother, born in time; completely God, completely human, with a rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards divinity, less than the Father as regards humanity. Although he is God and human, yet Christ is not two, but one. He is one, however, not by his divinity being turned into flesh, but by God's taking humanity to himself. He is one, certainly not by the blending of his essence, but by the unity of his person. For just as one human is both rational soul and flesh, so too the one Christ is both God and human.\"\n\n==''Hypostasis''==\n{{Main|Hypostasis (philosophy)}}\n\nThe Greek term ''hypostasis'' had come into use as a technical term prior to the Christological debates of the late fourth and fifth centuries.  In pre-Christian times, [[Greek philosophy]] (primarily [[Stoicism]]) used the word.<ref>R. Norris, \"Hypostasis,\" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. E. Ferguson.

''Hypostasis'' denotes an actual, concrete existence, in contrast to abstract categories such as [[Platonic ideal]]s.\n\nIn [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard's]] ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', the dual nature of Christ is explored as a paradox, i.e. as \"the ultimate paradox\", because God, understood as a perfectly good, perfectly wise, perfectly powerful being, fully became a human, in the [[Fall of man|Christian understanding of the term]]: burdened by sin, limited in goodness, knowledge, and understanding.<ref>Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 217 (read p.202-217) also see ''Philosophical Fragments'' p.31-35 and The Sickness Unto Death p. 132-133 Hannay</ref> This paradox can only be resolved, Kierkegaard believed, by a [[leap of faith]] away from one's understanding and reason towards belief in God; thus the paradox of the hypostatic union was crucial to an abiding faith in the Christian God.\n\nAs the precise nature of this union is held to defy finite human comprehension, the hypostatic union is also referred to by the alternative term \"mystical union\".\n\n==Through history==\n{{Christology}}\n[[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] was the first to use the term hypostasis in trying to understand the [[Incarnation]].<ref>Gregory of Nyssa, ''Antirrheticus Adversus Apollinarem.''</ref>  Apollinaris described the union of the divine and human in Christ as being of a single nature and having a single essence \u2014 a single hypostasis.\n\n===Council of Ephesus===\nIn the 5th century, a dispute arose between [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Nestorius]] in which Nestorius claimed that the term ''[[theotokos]]'' could not be used to describe Mary, the mother of Christ. Nestorius argued for two distinct natures of Christ, maintaining that God could not be born because the divine nature is unoriginate.  Therefore, Nestorius believed that the man Jesus of Nazareth was born in union with, but separate from and not strictly identifiable with, the Logos of God. The [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, under the leadership of Cyril himself as well as the Ephesian bishop Memnon, labeled Nestorius a neo-[[adoptionism|adoptionist]], implying that the man Jesus is divine and the Son of God only by grace and not by nature, and deposed him as a heretic. In his letter to Nestorius, Cyril used the term \"hypostatic\" (Greek, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd ''kath' hyp\u00f3stasin'') to refer to Christ's divine and human natures being one, saying, \u201cWe must follow these words and teachings, keeping in mind what \u2018having been made flesh\u2019 means \u2026. We say \u2026 that the Word, by having united to himself hypostatically flesh animated by a rational soul, inexplicably and incomprehensibly became man.\u201d<ref>Saint Cyril of Alexandria. St. Cyril of Alexandria: Letters. Trans. John McEnerney. Washington D.C.: Catholic University of America, 1987. Print.</ref>\n\n===Council of Chalcedon===\nThe preeminent Antiochene theologian [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], contending against the [[monophysitism|monophysite]] heresy of [[Apollinarism]], is believed to have taught that in Christ there are two natures ([[dyophysite]]), human and divine, and two corresponding hypostases (in the sense of \"subject\", \"essence\", or \"person\") which co-existed.<ref>\"Theodore\" in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian History'', ed. J. Brauer.  Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971.</ref> However, in Theodore's time the word ''hypostasis'' could be used in a sense synonymous with ''[[ousia]]'' (which clearly means \"essence\" rather than \"person\") as it had been used by [[Tatian]] and [[Origen]]. The Greek and Latin interpretations of Theodore's Christology have come under scrutiny since the recovery of his ''Catechetical Orations'' in the Syriac language.\n\nIn 451, the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon promulgated the [[Chalcedonian Definition]]. It agreed with Theodore that there were two natures in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]].  However, the [[Council of Chalcedon]] also insisted that hypostasis be used as it was in the Trinitarian definition: to indicate the person ([[prosopon]]) and not the nature as with Apollinaris. \n\n===Oriental Orthodox rejection of Chalcedonian definition===\nThe [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es, having rejected the Chalcedonian Creed, were known as [[Miaphysites]] because they maintain the [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyrilian]] definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature. The [[Chalcedonian]] \"in two natures\" formula (based, at least partially, on {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:9|ESV}}) was seen as derived from and akin to a [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] Christology.<ref>[http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php Britishorthodox.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619000000/http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php |date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref> Contrariwise, the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards [[Eutychianism|Eutychian]] Monophysitism. However, the Oriental Orthodox persistently specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches, that they have always affirmed that Christ's humanity is consubstantial with our own, and they thus prefer the term [[Miaphysite]] to be referred to as, a reference to Cyrillian Christology, which used the phrase \"{{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}}\", \"''m\u00eda ph\u00fdsis to\u00fb theo\u00fb l\u00f3gou sesark\u014dm\u00e9n\u0113''\".

For these reasons, the LDL decomposition may be preferred.\nFor real matrices, the factorization has the form '''A''' = '''LDL'''<sup>T</sup> and is often referred to as '''LDLT decomposition''' (or LDL<sup>T</sup> decomposition, or LDL\u2032).  It is closely related to the [[eigendecomposition of a matrix#Real symmetric matrices|eigendecomposition of real symmetric matrices]], '''A''' = '''Q\u039bQ'''<sup>T</sup>.\n\n== Example ==\n\nHere is the Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric real matrix:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n      4 &  12 & -16 \\\\\n     12 &  37 & -43 \\\\\n    -16 & -43 &  98 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n=\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     2 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n     6 &  1 &  0 \\\\\n    -8 &  5 &  3 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     2 &  6 & -8 \\\\\n     0 &  1 &  5 \\\\\n     0 &  0 &  3 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAnd here is its LDL<sup>T</sup> decomposition:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n      4 &  12 & -16 \\\\\n     12 &  37 & -43 \\\\\n    -16 & -43 &  98 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n& =\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     1 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n     3 &  1 &  0 \\\\\n    -4 &  5 &  1 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     4 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n     0 &  1 &  0 \\\\\n     0 &  0 &  9 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     1 &  3 & -4 \\\\\n     0 &  1 &  5 \\\\\n     0 &  0 &  1 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Applications ==\nThe Cholesky decomposition is mainly used for the numerical solution of [[system of linear equations|linear equations]] <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math>. If '''A''' is symmetric and positive definite, then we can solve  <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math> by first computing the Cholesky decomposition  <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{LL}^\\mathrm{*}</math>, then solving <math>\\mathbf{Ly} = \\mathbf{b}</math> for '''y''' by [[forward substitution]], and finally solving <math>\\mathbf{L^*x} = \\mathbf{y}</math> for '''x''' by [[back substitution]].\n\nAn alternative way to eliminate taking square roots in the <math>\\mathbf{LL}^\\mathrm{*}</math> decomposition is to compute the Cholesky decomposition <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{LDL}^\\mathrm{*}</math>, then solving <math>\\mathbf{Ly} = \\mathbf{b}</math> for '''y''', and finally solving <math>\\mathbf{DL}^\\mathrm{*}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}</math>.\n\nFor linear systems that can be put into symmetric form, the Cholesky decomposition (or its LDL variant) is the method of choice, for superior efficiency and numerical stability. Compared to the [[LU decomposition]], it is roughly twice as efficient.<ref name=\"NR\"/>\n\n===Linear least squares===\nSystems of the form '''Ax''' = '''b''' with '''A''' symmetric and positive definite arise quite often in applications. For instance, the normal equations in [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] problems are of this form. It may also happen that matrix '''A''' comes from an energy functional, which must be positive from physical considerations; this happens frequently in the numerical solution of [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\n===Non-linear optimization===\nNon-linear multi-variate functions may be minimized over their parameters using variants of [[Newton's method]] called ''quasi-Newton'' methods.  At iteration k, the search steps in a direction <math> p_k </math> defined by solving <math> B_k p_k </math> = <math> -g_k </math> for <math> p_k </math>, where <math> p_k </math> is the step direction, <math> g_k </math> is the [[gradient]], and <math> B_k </math> is an approximation to the [[Hessian matrix]] formed by repeating rank-1 updates at each iteration.  Two well-known update formulas are called [[Davidon\u2013Fletcher\u2013Powell]] (DFP) and [[BFGS method|Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno]] (BFGS). Loss of the positive-definite condition through round-off error is avoided if rather than updating an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian, one updates the Cholesky decomposition of an approximation of the Hessian matrix itself.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Monte Carlo simulation===\nThe Cholesky decomposition is commonly used in the [[Monte Carlo method]] for simulating systems with multiple correlated variables. The [[covariance matrix]] is decomposed to give the lower-triangular '''L'''. Applying this to a vector of uncorrelated samples '''u''' produces a sample vector '''Lu''' with the covariance properties of the system being modeled.<ref name=\"Matlab documentation\">[http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/randn.html Matlab randn documentation]. mathworks.com.</ref>\n\nThe following simplified example shows the economy one gets from the Cholesky decomposition:  suppose the goal is to generate two correlated normal variables <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math> with given correlation coefficient <math>\\rho</math>. To accomplish that, it is necessary to first generate two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables <math>z_1</math> and <math>z_2</math>, which can be done using a [[Box\u2013Muller transform]].  Given the  required correlation coefficient <math>\\rho</math>, the correlated normal variables can be obtained via the transformations <math>x_1 = z_1</math> and <math>x_2 =  \\rho z_1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\rho^2} z_2</math>.\n\n===Kalman filters===\n[[Unscented Kalman filter]]s commonly use the Cholesky decomposition to choose a set of so-called sigma points.  The Kalman filter tracks the average state of a system as a vector '''x''' of length ''N'' and covariance as an ''N'' \u00d7 ''N'' matrix '''P'''.  The matrix '''P''' is always positive semi-definite and can be decomposed into '''LL'''<sup>T</sup>.  The columns of '''L''' can be added and subtracted from the mean '''x''' to form a set of 2''N'' vectors called ''sigma points''.  These sigma points completely capture the mean and covariance of the system state.\n\n===Matrix inversion===\nThe explicit [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of a Hermitian matrix can be computed by Cholesky decomposition, in a manner similar to solving linear systems, using <math>n^3</math> operations (<math>\\tfrac{1}{2} n^3</math> multiplications).<ref name=\"kri\"/> The entire inversion can even be efficiently performed in-place.\n\nA non-Hermitian matrix '''B''' can also be inverted using the following identity, where '''BB'''* will always be Hermitian:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}^{-1} = \\mathbf{B}^* (\\mathbf{B B}^*)^{-1}.</math>\n\n== Computation ==\nThere are various methods for calculating the Cholesky decomposition. The computational complexity of commonly used algorithms is ''O''(''n''<sup>3</sup>) in general.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The algorithms described below all involve about ''n''<sup>3</sup>/3 [[FLOP]]s (''n''<sup>3</sup>/6 multiplications and the same number of additions), where ''n'' is the size of the matrix '''A'''. Hence, they have half the cost of the [[LU decomposition]], which uses 2''n''<sup>3</sup>/3 FLOPs (see Trefethen and Bau 1997).\n\nWhich of the algorithms below is faster depends on the details of the implementation. Generally, the first algorithm will be slightly slower because it accesses the data in a less regular manner.\n\n=== The Cholesky algorithm ===\nThe '''Cholesky algorithm''', used to calculate the decomposition matrix ''L'', is a modified version of [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nThe recursive algorithm starts with ''i'' := 1 and\n:'''A'''<sup>(1)</sup> := '''A'''.\n\nAt step ''i'', the matrix '''A'''<sup>(''i'')</sup> has the following form:\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}^{(i)}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0              & 0 \\\\\n0                & a_{i,i}        & \\mathbf{b}_{i}^{*} \\\\\n0                & \\mathbf{b}_{i} & \\mathbf{B}^{(i)}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nwhere '''I'''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub> denotes the [[identity matrix]] of dimension ''i'' \u2212 1.\n\nIf we now define the matrix '''L'''<sub>''i''</sub> by\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}_{i}:=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0                                  & 0 \\\\\n0                & \\sqrt{a_{i,i}}           & 0 \\\\\n0                & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_{i,i}}} \\mathbf{b}_{i} & \\mathbf{I}_{n-i}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nthen we can write '''A'''<sup>(''i'')</sup> as\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{L}_{i} \\mathbf{A}^{(i+1)} \\mathbf{L}_{i}^{*}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}^{(i+1)}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0                & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0                & 0 & \\mathbf{B}^{(i)} - \\frac{1}{a_{i,i}} \\mathbf{b}_{i} \\mathbf{b}_{i}^{*}\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nNote that '''b'''<sub>''i''</sub> '''b'''*<sub>''i''</sub> is an [[outer product]], therefore this algorithm is called the ''outer-product version'' in (Golub & Van Loan).\n\nWe repeat this for ''i'' from 1 to ''n''. After ''n'' steps, we get '''A'''<sup>(''n''+1)</sup> = '''I'''. Hence, the lower triangular matrix ''L'' we are looking for is calculated as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} := \\mathbf{L}_{1} \\mathbf{L}_{2} \\dots \\mathbf{L}_{n}.</math>\n\n=== The Cholesky\u2013Banachiewicz and Cholesky\u2013Crout algorithms ===\n[[File:Chol.gif|thumb|Access pattern (white) and writing pattern (yellow) for the in-place Cholesky\u2014Banachiewicz algorithm on a 5\u00d75 matrix]]\nIf we write out the equation\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{LL}^T & =\n\\begin{pmatrix}   L_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   L_{21} & L_{22} & 0 \\\\\n   L_{31} & L_{32} & L_{33}\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}   L_{11} & L_{21} & L_{31} \\\\\n   0 & L_{22} & L_{32} \\\\\n   0 & 0 & L_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n& =\n\\begin{pmatrix}   L_{11}^2 &   &(\\text{symmetric})   \\\\\n   L_{21}L_{11} & L_{21}^2 + L_{22}^2& \\\\\n   L_{31}L_{11} & L_{31}L_{21}+L_{32}L_{22} & L_{31}^2 + L_{32}^2+L_{33}^2\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwe obtain the following:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{L} = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{A_{11}} &  0 & 0  \\\\\nA_{21}/L_{11} & \\sqrt{A_{22} - L_{21}^2} & 0 \\\\\nA_{31}/L_{11} &  \\left( A_{32} - L_{31}L_{21} \\right) /L_{22}  &\\sqrt{A_{33}- L_{31}^2 - L_{32}^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand therefore the following formulas for the entries of '''L''':\n\n:<math> L_{j,j} = (\\pm)\\sqrt{ A_{j,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{j,k}^2 }, </math>\n:<math> L_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{L_{j,j}} \\left( A_{i,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{i,k} L_{j,k} \\right) \\quad \\text{for } i>j. </math>\n\nFor complex and real matrices, inconsequential arbitrary sign changes of diagonal and associated off-diagonal elements are allowed. The expression under the [[square root]] is always positive if '''A''' is real and positive-definite. \n\nFor complex Hermitian matrix, the following formula applies:\n\n:<math> L_{j,j} = \\sqrt{ A_{j,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{j,k}L_{j,k}^* }, </math>\n:<math> L_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{L_{j,j}} \\left( A_{i,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{i,k} L_{j,k}^* \\right) \\quad \\text{for } i>j. </math>\n\nSo we can compute the (''i'', ''j'') entry if we know the entries to the left and above. The computation is usually arranged in either of the following orders:\n* The '''Cholesky\u2013Banachiewicz algorithm''' starts from the upper left corner of the matrix ''L'' and proceeds to calculate the matrix row by row.\n* The '''Cholesky\u2013Crout algorithm''' starts from the upper left corner of the matrix ''L'' and proceeds to calculate the matrix column by column.\n\nEither pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in-place if desired.\n\n=== Stability of the computation ===\nSuppose that we want to solve a [[condition number|well-conditioned]] system of linear equations. If the LU decomposition is used, then the algorithm is unstable unless we use some sort of pivoting strategy. In the latter case, the error depends on the so-called growth factor of the matrix, which is usually (but not always) small.\n\nNow, suppose that the Cholesky decomposition is applicable. As mentioned above, the algorithm will be twice as fast. Furthermore, no [[Pivot element|pivoting]] is necessary, and the error will always be small. Specifically, if we want to solve '''Ax''' = '''b''', and '''y''' denotes the computed solution, then '''y''' solves the perturbed system ('''A''' + '''E''')'''y''' = '''b''', where\n:<math> \\|\\mathbf{E}\\|_2 \\le c_n \\varepsilon \\|\\mathbf{A}\\|_2. </math>\nHere ||\u00b7||<sub>2</sub> is the [[matrix norm|matrix 2-norm]], ''c<sub>n</sub>'' is a small constant depending on ''n'', and \u03b5 denotes the [[unit round-off]].\n\nOne concern with the Cholesky decomposition to be aware of is the use of square roots. If the matrix being factorized is positive definite as required, the numbers under the square roots are always positive ''in exact arithmetic''. Unfortunately, the numbers can become negative because of [[round-off error]]s, in which case the algorithm cannot continue. However, this can only happen if the matrix is very ill-conditioned. One way to address this is to add a diagonal correction matrix to the matrix being decomposed in an attempt to promote the positive-definiteness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fang|first=Haw-ren|author2=O'Leary, Dianne P.|author2-link= Dianne P.

In more details, one has already computed the Cholesky decomposition <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^*</math> of some matrix <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, then one changes the matrix <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> in some way into another matrix, say <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>, and one wants to compute the Cholesky decomposition of the updated matrix: <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{L}} \\tilde{\\mathbf{L}}^* </math>. The question is now whether one can use the Cholesky decomposition of <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> that was computed before to compute the Cholesky decomposition of <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>.\n\n==== Rank-one update ====\nThe specific case, where the updated matrix <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math> is related to the matrix <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> by <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} = \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{x}^* </math>, is known as a ''rank-one update''.\n\nHere is a little function<ref>Based on: {{cite book|last=Stewart|first=G.

This only works if the new matrix <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math> is still positive definite.\n\nThe code for the rank-one update shown above can easily be adapted to do a rank-one downdate: one merely needs to replace the two additions in the assignment to <code> r </code> and <code> L((k+1):n, k) </code> by subtractions.\n\n==== Adding and removing rows and columns ====\nIf we have a symmetric and positive definite matrix <math> \\mathbf A </math> represented in block form as\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{A} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf A_{11} & \\mathbf A_{13} \\\\\n \\mathbf A_{13}^{\\mathrm{T}} & \\mathbf A_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nand its upper Cholesky factor\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{L} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf L_{11} &  \\mathbf L_{13} \\\\\n  0      & \\mathbf L_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\n\nthen for a new matrix <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>, which is the same as <math> \\mathbf A </math> but with the insertion of new rows and columns,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} &= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf A_{11} & \\mathbf A_{12} & \\mathbf A_{13} \\\\\n \\mathbf A_{12}^{\\mathrm{T}} & \\mathbf A_{22} & \\mathbf A_{23} \\\\\n \\mathbf A_{13}^{\\mathrm{T}} & \\mathbf A_{23}^{\\mathrm{T}} &  \\mathbf A_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwe are interested in finding the Cholesky factorisation of <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>, which we call <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf S} </math>, without directly computing the entire decomposition. \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{S}} &= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf S_{11} & \\mathbf S_{12} & \\mathbf S_{13} \\\\\n 0 & \\mathbf S_{22} & \\mathbf S_{23} \\\\\n 0 & 0 &  \\mathbf S_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWriting <math> \\mathbf A \\setminus \\mathbf{b}</math> for the solution of <math> \\mathbf A \\mathbf x = \\mathbf b</math>, which can be found easily for triangular matrices, and <math> \\text{chol} (\\mathbf M)</math> for the Cholesky decomposition of <math> \\mathbf M </math>, the following relations can be found:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf S_{11} &= \\mathbf L_{11}, \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{12} &= \\mathbf L_{11}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\setminus \\mathbf A_{12}, \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{13} &= \\mathbf L_{13}, \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{22} &= \\text{chol} (\\mathbf A_{22}  - \\mathbf S_{12}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf S_{12}), \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{23} &= \\mathbf S_{22}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\setminus (\\mathbf A_{23} - \\mathbf S_{12}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf S_{13}), \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{33} &= \\text{chol} (\\mathbf L_{33}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf L_{33} - \\mathbf S_{23}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf S_{23}). \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThese formulas may be used to determine the Cholesky factor after the insertion of rows or columns in any position, if we set the row and column dimensions appropriately (including to zero).

(2010), Appendix B.</ref>\n\n== Proof for positive semi-definite matrices ==\n\n=== Proof by limiting argument ===\nThe above algorithms show that every positive definite matrix <math> \\mathbf{A} </math> has a Cholesky decomposition. This result can be extended to the positive semi-definite case by a limiting argument. The argument is not fully constructive, i.e., it gives no explicit numerical algorithms for computing Cholesky factors.\n\nIf <math> \\mathbf{A} </math> is an <math> n \\times n </math> [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite matrix]], then the sequence <math> \\left(\\mathbf{A}_k\\right)_k := \\left(\\mathbf{A} + \\frac{1}{k} \\mathbf{I}_n\\right)_k </math> consists of [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite matrices]]. (This is an immediate consequence of, for example, the spectral mapping theorem for the polynomial functional calculus.) Also,\n:<math> \n\\mathbf{A}_k \\rightarrow \\mathbf{A}\n\\quad \\text{for} \\quad\nk \\rightarrow \\infty\n</math> \nin [[operator norm]]. From the positive definite case, each <math> \\mathbf{A}_k </math> has Cholesky decomposition <math> \\mathbf{A}_k = \\mathbf{L}_k\\mathbf{L}_k^* </math>. By property of the operator norm,\n\n:<math>\\| \\mathbf{L}_k \\|^2 \\geq \\| \\mathbf{L}_k \\mathbf{L}_k^* \\| = \\| \\mathbf{A}_k \\| \\,.</math>\n\nSo <math> \\left(\\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math> is a bounded set in the [[Banach space]] of operators, therefore [[relatively compact]] (because the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional). \nConsequently, it has a convergent subsequence, also denoted by <math> \\left( \\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math>, with limit <math> \\mathbf{L}</math>. \nIt can be easily checked that this <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> has the desired properties, i.e. <math> \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^* </math>, and <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries: for all <math> x</math> and <math> y</math>,\n\n:<math> \n\\langle \\mathbf{A} x, y \\rangle \n= \\left\\langle \\lim \\mathbf{A}_k x, y \\right\\rangle \n= \\langle \\lim \\mathbf{L}_k \\mathbf{L}_k^* x, y \\rangle \n= \\langle \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{L}^*x, y \\rangle \\,. \n</math>\n\nTherefore, <math> \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^* </math>. \nBecause the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional, all topologies on the space of operators are equivalent. \nSo <math> \\left( \\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math> tends to <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> in norm means <math> \\left( \\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math> tends to <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> entrywise. \nThis in turn implies that, since each <math> \\mathbf{L}_k</math> is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries, <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> is also.\n\n=== Proof by QR decomposition ===\n\nLet <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> be a [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite matrix]] Hermitian matrix. Then it can be written as a product of its [[Square root of a matrix|square root matrix]], <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{B}^*</math>. Now [[QR decomposition]] can be applied to <math>\\mathbf{B}^*</math>, resulting in <math>\\mathbf{B}^* = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R}</math>\n, where <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> is unitary and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> is upper triangular. Inserting the decomposition into the original equality yields <math>A = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{B}^* = (\\mathbf{QR})^*\\mathbf{QR} = \\mathbf{R}^*\\mathbf{Q}^*\\mathbf{QR} = \\mathbf{R}^*\\mathbf{R}</math>. Setting <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{R}^*</math> completes the proof.\n\n== Generalization ==\nThe Cholesky factorization can be generalized {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} to (not necessarily finite) matrices with operator entries. Let <math>\\{\\mathcal{H}_n \\}</math> be a sequence of [[Hilbert spaces]]. Consider the operator matrix\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{A}_{11}   & \\mathbf{A}_{12}   & \\mathbf{A}_{13} & \\; \\\\\n\\mathbf{A}_{12}^* & \\mathbf{A}_{22}   & \\mathbf{A}_{23} & \\; \\\\\n\\mathbf{A} _{13}^* & \\mathbf{A}_{23}^* & \\mathbf{A}_{33} & \\; \\\\\n\\;       & \\;       & \\;     & \\ddots\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nacting on the direct sum\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\bigoplus_n \\mathcal{H}_n,</math>\n\nwhere each\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}_{ij} : \\mathcal{H}_j \\rightarrow \\mathcal{H} _i</math>\n\nis a [[bounded operator]].

One can also take the diagonal entries of '''L''' to be positive.\n\n== Implementations in programming libraries ==\n* [[C programming language]]: the [[GNU Scientific Library]] provides several implementations of Cholesky decomposition.\n* [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]] computer algebra system: function ''cholesky'' computes Cholesky decomposition.\n* [[GNU Octave]] numerical computations system provides several functions to calculate, update, and apply a Cholesky decomposition.\n* The [[LAPACK]] library provides a high performance implementation of the Cholesky decomposition that can be accessed from Fortran, C and most languages.\n* In [[Python]], the function \"cholesky\" from the numpy.linalg module performs Cholesky decomposition.\n* In [[Matlab]] and R, the \"chol\" function gives the Cholesky decomposition.. \n* In [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], the \"cholesky\" function from the LinearAlgebra standard library gives the Cholesky decomposition.\n* In [[Mathematica]], the function \"CholeskyDecomposition\" can be applied to a matrix.\n* In [[C++]], the command \"chol\" from the armadillo library performs Cholesky decomposition.

For these reasons, the LDL decomposition may be preferred.\nFor real matrices, the factorization has the form '''A''' = '''LDL'''<sup>T</sup> and is often referred to as '''LDLT decomposition''' (or LDL<sup>T</sup> decomposition, or LDL\u2032).  It is closely related to the [[eigendecomposition of a matrix#Real symmetric matrices|eigendecomposition of real symmetric matrices]], '''A''' = '''Q\u039bQ'''<sup>T</sup>.\n\n== Example ==\n\nHere is the Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric real matrix:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n      4 &  12 & -16 \\\\\n     12 &  37 & -43 \\\\\n    -16 & -43 &  98 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n=\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     2 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n     6 &  1 &  0 \\\\\n    -8 &  5 &  3 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     2 &  6 & -8 \\\\\n     0 &  1 &  5 \\\\\n     0 &  0 &  3 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAnd here is its LDL<sup>T</sup> decomposition:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n      4 &  12 & -16 \\\\\n     12 &  37 & -43 \\\\\n    -16 & -43 &  98 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n& =\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     1 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n     3 &  1 &  0 \\\\\n    -4 &  5 &  1 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     4 &  0 &  0 \\\\\n     0 &  1 &  0 \\\\\n     0 &  0 &  9 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{*{3}{r}}\n     1 &  3 & -4 \\\\\n     0 &  1 &  5 \\\\\n     0 &  0 &  1 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Applications ==\nThe Cholesky decomposition is mainly used for the numerical solution of [[system of linear equations|linear equations]] <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math>. If '''A''' is symmetric and positive definite, then we can solve  <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math> by first computing the Cholesky decomposition  <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{LL}^\\mathrm{*}</math>, then solving <math>\\mathbf{Ly} = \\mathbf{b}</math> for '''y''' by [[forward substitution]], and finally solving <math>\\mathbf{L^*x} = \\mathbf{y}</math> for '''x''' by [[back substitution]].\n\nAn alternative way to eliminate taking square roots in the <math>\\mathbf{LL}^\\mathrm{*}</math> decomposition is to compute the Cholesky decomposition <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{LDL}^\\mathrm{*}</math>, then solving <math>\\mathbf{Ly} = \\mathbf{b}</math> for '''y''', and finally solving <math>\\mathbf{DL}^\\mathrm{*}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}</math>.\n\nFor linear systems that can be put into symmetric form, the Cholesky decomposition (or its LDL variant) is the method of choice, for superior efficiency and numerical stability. Compared to the [[LU decomposition]], it is roughly twice as efficient.<ref name=\"NR\"/>\n\n===Linear least squares===\nSystems of the form '''Ax''' = '''b''' with '''A''' symmetric and positive definite arise quite often in applications. For instance, the normal equations in [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] problems are of this form. It may also happen that matrix '''A''' comes from an energy functional, which must be positive from physical considerations; this happens frequently in the numerical solution of [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\n===Non-linear optimization===\nNon-linear multi-variate functions may be minimized over their parameters using variants of [[Newton's method]] called ''quasi-Newton'' methods.  At iteration k, the search steps in a direction <math> p_k </math> defined by solving <math> B_k p_k </math> = <math> -g_k </math> for <math> p_k </math>, where <math> p_k </math> is the step direction, <math> g_k </math> is the [[gradient]], and <math> B_k </math> is an approximation to the [[Hessian matrix]] formed by repeating rank-1 updates at each iteration.  Two well-known update formulas are called [[Davidon\u2013Fletcher\u2013Powell]] (DFP) and [[BFGS method|Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno]] (BFGS). Loss of the positive-definite condition through round-off error is avoided if rather than updating an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian, one updates the Cholesky decomposition of an approximation of the Hessian matrix itself.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Monte Carlo simulation===\nThe Cholesky decomposition is commonly used in the [[Monte Carlo method]] for simulating systems with multiple correlated variables. The [[covariance matrix]] is decomposed to give the lower-triangular '''L'''. Applying this to a vector of uncorrelated samples '''u''' produces a sample vector '''Lu''' with the covariance properties of the system being modeled.<ref name=\"Matlab documentation\">[http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/randn.html Matlab randn documentation]. mathworks.com.</ref>\n\nThe following simplified example shows the economy one gets from the Cholesky decomposition:  suppose the goal is to generate two correlated normal variables <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math> with given correlation coefficient <math>\\rho</math>. To accomplish that, it is necessary to first generate two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables <math>z_1</math> and <math>z_2</math>, which can be done using a [[Box\u2013Muller transform]].  Given the  required correlation coefficient <math>\\rho</math>, the correlated normal variables can be obtained via the transformations <math>x_1 = z_1</math> and <math>x_2 =  \\rho z_1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\rho^2} z_2</math>.\n\n===Kalman filters===\n[[Unscented Kalman filter]]s commonly use the Cholesky decomposition to choose a set of so-called sigma points.  The Kalman filter tracks the average state of a system as a vector '''x''' of length ''N'' and covariance as an ''N'' \u00d7 ''N'' matrix '''P'''.  The matrix '''P''' is always positive semi-definite and can be decomposed into '''LL'''<sup>T</sup>.  The columns of '''L''' can be added and subtracted from the mean '''x''' to form a set of 2''N'' vectors called ''sigma points''.  These sigma points completely capture the mean and covariance of the system state.\n\n===Matrix inversion===\nThe explicit [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of a Hermitian matrix can be computed by Cholesky decomposition, in a manner similar to solving linear systems, using <math>n^3</math> operations (<math>\\tfrac{1}{2} n^3</math> multiplications).<ref name=\"kri\"/> The entire inversion can even be efficiently performed in-place.\n\nA non-Hermitian matrix '''B''' can also be inverted using the following identity, where '''BB'''* will always be Hermitian:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}^{-1} = \\mathbf{B}^* (\\mathbf{B B}^*)^{-1}.</math>\n\n== Computation ==\nThere are various methods for calculating the Cholesky decomposition. The computational complexity of commonly used algorithms is ''O''(''n''<sup>3</sup>) in general.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The algorithms described below all involve about ''n''<sup>3</sup>/3 [[FLOP]]s (''n''<sup>3</sup>/6 multiplications and the same number of additions), where ''n'' is the size of the matrix '''A'''. Hence, they have half the cost of the [[LU decomposition]], which uses 2''n''<sup>3</sup>/3 FLOPs (see Trefethen and Bau 1997).\n\nWhich of the algorithms below is faster depends on the details of the implementation. Generally, the first algorithm will be slightly slower because it accesses the data in a less regular manner.\n\n=== The Cholesky algorithm ===\nThe '''Cholesky algorithm''', used to calculate the decomposition matrix ''L'', is a modified version of [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nThe recursive algorithm starts with ''i'' := 1 and\n:'''A'''<sup>(1)</sup> := '''A'''.\n\nAt step ''i'', the matrix '''A'''<sup>(''i'')</sup> has the following form:\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}^{(i)}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0              & 0 \\\\\n0                & a_{i,i}        & \\mathbf{b}_{i}^{*} \\\\\n0                & \\mathbf{b}_{i} & \\mathbf{B}^{(i)}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nwhere '''I'''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub> denotes the [[identity matrix]] of dimension ''i'' \u2212 1.\n\nIf we now define the matrix '''L'''<sub>''i''</sub> by\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}_{i}:=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0                                  & 0 \\\\\n0                & \\sqrt{a_{i,i}}           & 0 \\\\\n0                & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_{i,i}}} \\mathbf{b}_{i} & \\mathbf{I}_{n-i}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nthen we can write '''A'''<sup>(''i'')</sup> as\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{L}_{i} \\mathbf{A}^{(i+1)} \\mathbf{L}_{i}^{*}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}^{(i+1)}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0                & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0                & 0 & \\mathbf{B}^{(i)} - \\frac{1}{a_{i,i}} \\mathbf{b}_{i} \\mathbf{b}_{i}^{*}\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nNote that '''b'''<sub>''i''</sub> '''b'''*<sub>''i''</sub> is an [[outer product]], therefore this algorithm is called the ''outer-product version'' in (Golub & Van Loan).\n\nWe repeat this for ''i'' from 1 to ''n''. After ''n'' steps, we get '''A'''<sup>(''n''+1)</sup> = '''I'''. Hence, the lower triangular matrix ''L'' we are looking for is calculated as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} := \\mathbf{L}_{1} \\mathbf{L}_{2} \\dots \\mathbf{L}_{n}.</math>\n\n=== The Cholesky\u2013Banachiewicz and Cholesky\u2013Crout algorithms ===\n[[File:Chol.gif|thumb|Access pattern (white) and writing pattern (yellow) for the in-place Cholesky\u2014Banachiewicz algorithm on a 5\u00d75 matrix]]\nIf we write out the equation\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{LL}^T & =\n\\begin{pmatrix}   L_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   L_{21} & L_{22} & 0 \\\\\n   L_{31} & L_{32} & L_{33}\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}   L_{11} & L_{21} & L_{31} \\\\\n   0 & L_{22} & L_{32} \\\\\n   0 & 0 & L_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n& =\n\\begin{pmatrix}   L_{11}^2 &   &(\\text{symmetric})   \\\\\n   L_{21}L_{11} & L_{21}^2 + L_{22}^2& \\\\\n   L_{31}L_{11} & L_{31}L_{21}+L_{32}L_{22} & L_{31}^2 + L_{32}^2+L_{33}^2\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwe obtain the following:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{L} = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{A_{11}} &  0 & 0  \\\\\nA_{21}/L_{11} & \\sqrt{A_{22} - L_{21}^2} & 0 \\\\\nA_{31}/L_{11} &  \\left( A_{32} - L_{31}L_{21} \\right) /L_{22}  &\\sqrt{A_{33}- L_{31}^2 - L_{32}^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand therefore the following formulas for the entries of '''L''':\n\n:<math> L_{j,j} = (\\pm)\\sqrt{ A_{j,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{j,k}^2 }, </math>\n:<math> L_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{L_{j,j}} \\left( A_{i,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{i,k} L_{j,k} \\right) \\quad \\text{for } i>j. </math>\n\nFor complex and real matrices, inconsequential arbitrary sign changes of diagonal and associated off-diagonal elements are allowed. The expression under the [[square root]] is always positive if '''A''' is real and positive-definite. \n\nFor complex Hermitian matrix, the following formula applies:\n\n:<math> L_{j,j} = \\sqrt{ A_{j,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{j,k}L_{j,k}^* }, </math>\n:<math> L_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{L_{j,j}} \\left( A_{i,j} - \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{i,k} L_{j,k}^* \\right) \\quad \\text{for } i>j. </math>\n\nSo we can compute the (''i'', ''j'') entry if we know the entries to the left and above. The computation is usually arranged in either of the following orders:\n* The '''Cholesky\u2013Banachiewicz algorithm''' starts from the upper left corner of the matrix ''L'' and proceeds to calculate the matrix row by row.\n* The '''Cholesky\u2013Crout algorithm''' starts from the upper left corner of the matrix ''L'' and proceeds to calculate the matrix column by column.\n\nEither pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in-place if desired.\n\n=== Stability of the computation ===\nSuppose that we want to solve a [[condition number|well-conditioned]] system of linear equations. If the LU decomposition is used, then the algorithm is unstable unless we use some sort of pivoting strategy. In the latter case, the error depends on the so-called growth factor of the matrix, which is usually (but not always) small.\n\nNow, suppose that the Cholesky decomposition is applicable. As mentioned above, the algorithm will be twice as fast. Furthermore, no [[Pivot element|pivoting]] is necessary, and the error will always be small. Specifically, if we want to solve '''Ax''' = '''b''', and '''y''' denotes the computed solution, then '''y''' solves the perturbed system ('''A''' + '''E''')'''y''' = '''b''', where\n:<math> \\|\\mathbf{E}\\|_2 \\le c_n \\varepsilon \\|\\mathbf{A}\\|_2. </math>\nHere ||\u00b7||<sub>2</sub> is the [[matrix norm|matrix 2-norm]], ''c<sub>n</sub>'' is a small constant depending on ''n'', and \u03b5 denotes the [[unit round-off]].\n\nOne concern with the Cholesky decomposition to be aware of is the use of square roots. If the matrix being factorized is positive definite as required, the numbers under the square roots are always positive ''in exact arithmetic''. Unfortunately, the numbers can become negative because of [[round-off error]]s, in which case the algorithm cannot continue. However, this can only happen if the matrix is very ill-conditioned. One way to address this is to add a diagonal correction matrix to the matrix being decomposed in an attempt to promote the positive-definiteness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fang|first=Haw-ren|author2=O'Leary, Dianne P.|author2-link= Dianne P.

In more details, one has already computed the Cholesky decomposition <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^*</math> of some matrix <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, then one changes the matrix <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> in some way into another matrix, say <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>, and one wants to compute the Cholesky decomposition of the updated matrix: <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{L}} \\tilde{\\mathbf{L}}^* </math>. The question is now whether one can use the Cholesky decomposition of <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> that was computed before to compute the Cholesky decomposition of <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>.\n\n==== Rank-one update ====\nThe specific case, where the updated matrix <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math> is related to the matrix <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> by <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} = \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{x}^* </math>, is known as a ''rank-one update''.\n\nHere is a little function<ref>Based on: {{cite book|last=Stewart|first=G. W.|title=Basic decompositions|year=1998|publisher=Soc. for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-89871-414-1}}</ref> written in [[Matlab]] syntax that realizes a rank-one update:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"matlab\">\nfunction [L] = cholupdate(L, x)\n    n = length(x);\n    for k = 1:n\n        r = sqrt(L(k, k)^2 + x(k)^2);\n        c = r / L(k, k);\n        s = x(k) / L(k, k);\n        L(k, k) = r;\n        if k < n\n            L((k+1):n, k) = (L((k+1):n, k) + s * x((k+1):n)) / c;\n            x((k+1):n) = c * x((k+1):n) - s * L((k+1):n, k);\n        end\n    end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Rank-one downdate ====\nA ''rank-one downdate'' is similar to a rank-one update, except that the addition is replaced by subtraction: <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} = \\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{x}^* </math>. This only works if the new matrix <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math> is still positive definite.\n\nThe code for the rank-one update shown above can easily be adapted to do a rank-one downdate: one merely needs to replace the two additions in the assignment to <code> r </code> and <code> L((k+1):n, k) </code> by subtractions.\n\n==== Adding and removing rows and columns ====\nIf we have a symmetric and positive definite matrix <math> \\mathbf A </math> represented in block form as\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{A} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf A_{11} & \\mathbf A_{13} \\\\\n \\mathbf A_{13}^{\\mathrm{T}} & \\mathbf A_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nand its upper Cholesky factor\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{L} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf L_{11} &  \\mathbf L_{13} \\\\\n  0      & \\mathbf L_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\n\nthen for a new matrix <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>, which is the same as <math> \\mathbf A </math> but with the insertion of new rows and columns,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} &= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf A_{11} & \\mathbf A_{12} & \\mathbf A_{13} \\\\\n \\mathbf A_{12}^{\\mathrm{T}} & \\mathbf A_{22} & \\mathbf A_{23} \\\\\n \\mathbf A_{13}^{\\mathrm{T}} & \\mathbf A_{23}^{\\mathrm{T}} &  \\mathbf A_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwe are interested in finding the Cholesky factorisation of <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf{A}} </math>, which we call <math> \\tilde{\\mathbf S} </math>, without directly computing the entire decomposition. \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{S}} &= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\mathbf S_{11} & \\mathbf S_{12} & \\mathbf S_{13} \\\\\n 0 & \\mathbf S_{22} & \\mathbf S_{23} \\\\\n 0 & 0 &  \\mathbf S_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWriting <math> \\mathbf A \\setminus \\mathbf{b}</math> for the solution of <math> \\mathbf A \\mathbf x = \\mathbf b</math>, which can be found easily for triangular matrices, and <math> \\text{chol} (\\mathbf M)</math> for the Cholesky decomposition of <math> \\mathbf M </math>, the following relations can be found:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf S_{11} &= \\mathbf L_{11}, \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{12} &= \\mathbf L_{11}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\setminus \\mathbf A_{12}, \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{13} &= \\mathbf L_{13}, \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{22} &= \\text{chol} (\\mathbf A_{22}  - \\mathbf S_{12}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf S_{12}), \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{23} &= \\mathbf S_{22}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\setminus (\\mathbf A_{23} - \\mathbf S_{12}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf S_{13}), \\\\\n\\mathbf S_{33} &= \\text{chol} (\\mathbf L_{33}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf L_{33} - \\mathbf S_{23}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf S_{23}). \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThese formulas may be used to determine the Cholesky factor after the insertion of rows or columns in any position, if we set the row and column dimensions appropriately (including to zero).

(2010), Appendix B.</ref>\n\n== Proof for positive semi-definite matrices ==\n\n=== Proof by limiting argument ===\nThe above algorithms show that every positive definite matrix <math> \\mathbf{A} </math> has a Cholesky decomposition. This result can be extended to the positive semi-definite case by a limiting argument. The argument is not fully constructive, i.e., it gives no explicit numerical algorithms for computing Cholesky factors.\n\nIf <math> \\mathbf{A} </math> is an <math> n \\times n </math> [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite matrix]], then the sequence <math> \\left(\\mathbf{A}_k\\right)_k := \\left(\\mathbf{A} + \\frac{1}{k} \\mathbf{I}_n\\right)_k </math> consists of [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite matrices]]. (This is an immediate consequence of, for example, the spectral mapping theorem for the polynomial functional calculus.) Also,\n:<math> \n\\mathbf{A}_k \\rightarrow \\mathbf{A}\n\\quad \\text{for} \\quad\nk \\rightarrow \\infty\n</math> \nin [[operator norm]]. From the positive definite case, each <math> \\mathbf{A}_k </math> has Cholesky decomposition <math> \\mathbf{A}_k = \\mathbf{L}_k\\mathbf{L}_k^* </math>. By property of the operator norm,\n\n:<math>\\| \\mathbf{L}_k \\|^2 \\geq \\| \\mathbf{L}_k \\mathbf{L}_k^* \\| = \\| \\mathbf{A}_k \\| \\,.</math>\n\nSo <math> \\left(\\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math> is a bounded set in the [[Banach space]] of operators, therefore [[relatively compact]] (because the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional). \nConsequently, it has a convergent subsequence, also denoted by <math> \\left( \\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math>, with limit <math> \\mathbf{L}</math>. \nIt can be easily checked that this <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> has the desired properties, i.e. <math> \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^* </math>, and <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries: for all <math> x</math> and <math> y</math>,\n\n:<math> \n\\langle \\mathbf{A} x, y \\rangle \n= \\left\\langle \\lim \\mathbf{A}_k x, y \\right\\rangle \n= \\langle \\lim \\mathbf{L}_k \\mathbf{L}_k^* x, y \\rangle \n= \\langle \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{L}^*x, y \\rangle \\,. \n</math>\n\nTherefore, <math> \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^* </math>. \nBecause the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional, all topologies on the space of operators are equivalent. \nSo <math> \\left( \\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math> tends to <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> in norm means <math> \\left( \\mathbf{L}_k \\right)_k</math> tends to <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> entrywise. \nThis in turn implies that, since each <math> \\mathbf{L}_k</math> is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries, <math> \\mathbf{L}</math> is also.\n\n=== Proof by QR decomposition ===\n\nLet <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> be a [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite matrix]] Hermitian matrix. Then it can be written as a product of its [[Square root of a matrix|square root matrix]], <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{B}^*</math>. Now [[QR decomposition]] can be applied to <math>\\mathbf{B}^*</math>, resulting in <math>\\mathbf{B}^* = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R}</math>\n, where <math>\\mathbf{Q}</math> is unitary and <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> is upper triangular. Inserting the decomposition into the original equality yields <math>A = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{B}^* = (\\mathbf{QR})^*\\mathbf{QR} = \\mathbf{R}^*\\mathbf{Q}^*\\mathbf{QR} = \\mathbf{R}^*\\mathbf{R}</math>. Setting <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{R}^*</math> completes the proof.\n\n== Generalization ==\nThe Cholesky factorization can be generalized {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} to (not necessarily finite) matrices with operator entries. Let <math>\\{\\mathcal{H}_n \\}</math> be a sequence of [[Hilbert spaces]]. Consider the operator matrix\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{A}_{11}   & \\mathbf{A}_{12}   & \\mathbf{A}_{13} & \\; \\\\\n\\mathbf{A}_{12}^* & \\mathbf{A}_{22}   & \\mathbf{A}_{23} & \\; \\\\\n\\mathbf{A} _{13}^* & \\mathbf{A}_{23}^* & \\mathbf{A}_{33} & \\; \\\\\n\\;       & \\;       & \\;     & \\ddots\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nacting on the direct sum\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} = \\bigoplus_n \\mathcal{H}_n,</math>\n\nwhere each\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A}_{ij} : \\mathcal{H}_j \\rightarrow \\mathcal{H} _i</math>\n\nis a [[bounded operator]]. If '''A''' is positive (semidefinite) in the sense that for all finite ''k'' and for any\n\n:<math>h \\in \\bigoplus_{n = 1}^k \\mathcal{H}_k ,</math>\n\nwe have <math>\\langle h, \\mathbf{A} h\\rangle \\ge 0</math>, then there exists a lower triangular operator matrix '''L''' such that '''A''' = '''LL'''*. One can also take the diagonal entries of '''L''' to be positive.\n\n== Implementations in programming libraries ==\n* [[C programming language]]: the [[GNU Scientific Library]] provides several implementations of Cholesky decomposition.\n* [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]] computer algebra system: function ''cholesky'' computes Cholesky decomposition.\n* [[GNU Octave]] numerical computations system provides several functions to calculate, update, and apply a Cholesky decomposition.\n* The [[LAPACK]] library provides a high performance implementation of the Cholesky decomposition that can be accessed from Fortran, C and most languages.\n* In [[Python]], the function \"cholesky\" from the numpy.linalg module performs Cholesky decomposition.\n* In [[Matlab]] and R, the \"chol\" function gives the Cholesky decomposition.. \n* In [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], the \"cholesky\" function from the LinearAlgebra standard library gives the Cholesky decomposition.\n* In [[Mathematica]], the function \"CholeskyDecomposition\" can be applied to a matrix.\n* In [[C++]], the command \"chol\" from the armadillo library performs Cholesky decomposition.

{"title_page": "Road transport in Peterborough", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2011}}\n{{original research|date=January 2014}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe '''City of [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]]''' in [[East Anglia]] has an extensive and well integrated road network, owing partly to its status as a [[new town]]. Since the 1960s, the city has seen considerable expansion and its various suburbs are linked by a system of [[parkway]]s.\n[[File:Peterborough Parkways.PNG|thumb|alt=A Map with the various parkways highlighted|Peterborough's Parkways]]Despite its large-scale growth, Peterborough has the fastest peak and off-peak travel times for a city of its size in the United Kingdom, due to the construction of the parkways. The [[Local Transport Plan]] anticipates expenditure totalling around \u00a3180 million for the period up to 2010 on major road schemes to accommodate future development.<ref>[http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page-4536 The Second Local Transport Plan] Peterborough City Council, March 2006</ref>\n\nThe [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1/A1(M)]] broadly follows the path of the historic [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] from London, through Peterborough (Junction 17), continuing north a further 335 miles (539&nbsp;km) to central [[Edinburgh]].\n\n==Numbered Junctions==\n[[File:Peterborough Queensgate Roundabout Sign.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A numbered roundabout sign in [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]].]]\n[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] has so many roundabouts and grade separated junctions within its roads and parkway system that junctions are numbered using the same system as is used to number British motorway and major A road junctions to guide and help drivers. Peterborough is to date the only city within the United Kingdom to use the system in this way and has been using this system since the 1970s.\n\n==Parkways and major roads==\nThe parkways were constructed under guidelines from the [[Peterborough Development Corporation]] as a system of high speed roads to connect the new townships which housed London's post-war [[London overspill|overspill]] population and were mostly built from the early 1970s to the late 1980s\n\nThe majority of Peterborough's parkways are dual carriageways, to accommodate the large quantity of local traffic within the city, and national and regional traffic bypassing it. However, due to their age, many of the parkways do not have hard-shoulders. Most of the parkways that bypass the city have graded [[Roundabout interchange|roundabout junctions]].\n\n===Wittering to Norman Cross===\nThe A1 is located just to the west of Peterborough. The road does not play a major part in Peterborough's road network itself although it is a major route. The road goes past RAF Wittering before meeting the A47 at Wansford on a grade separated junction. The A1 then moves south passing very close to the Nene Valley Railway line before reaching the city section of the A605 at another grade separated junction before reaching the A1139/A605 Oundle Section grade separated junction. This is also where the A1(M) starts and as a motorway the road quickly moves southward to reach the A15 at Norman Cross where the motorway moves out of the Peterborough area.\n\n[[Image:UK road A15.svg|130px]]\n\n=== Glinton to New England (Werrington Parkway)===\nThe Werrington Parkway runs from the south of [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]], where the A15 forks into the Peterborough east bypass and main road into the city centre. The road is dual carriageway from [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]] to the centre of Peterborough. There are no grade separated junctions along its route but does contain a number of smaller roundabouts which give direct and easy access to [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]] and its industrial estates. The Parkway then becomes less and standard dual-carriageway to which speed limits are in place to pass through [[New England, Cambridgeshire|New England]] and its retail park along with a major supermarket just prior to reaching the junction with the [[A47 road|A47]] at a major junction. Because of the speed restrictions along the majority of its route traffic coming into [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] are now encouraged to use the Paston Parkway instead to access the city centre and in the past few years signposts have been changed to reflect this.\n\n=== Glinton to Eye (Paston Parkway/A15 Spur Road)===\nThe Paston Parkway bypasses the eastern edge of Peterborough, terminating at a roundabout with the [[A1139 road|A1139]], where the city bypass becomes the Frank Perkins Parkway. The road starts at the southernmost roundabout of the Glinton and heads eastward as a single carriageway before coming to a roundabout for local traffic. The road then becomes a major dual carriageway, although it has only one grade separated junction (with the A47), with the other junctions being roundabouts. In 2008, Peterborough City Council funded the dualling of the northernmost stretch of the Paston Parkway between two roundabouts east of [[Gunthorpe, Peterborough|Gunthorpe]]. This has significantly reduced congestion, as the route is used as a commuter run between the city's Eastern Industry development in [[Fengate, Peterborough|Fengate]] and settlements north of the city.\n\n=== City Centre===\nThe A15 moves southward as a minor dual carriageway from its junction with the A47 with several more roundabouts lining its route. The road goes past some rail sidings that are rarely used and also goes past a retail shopping area on the site of the city's former Parcel Force depot. After passing the city's Toys R Us store the A15 reaches Queensgate Shopping Centre. The road passes the shopping centre between two of the centre's major Car Parks with a 1980s style footbridge crossing over the top. Two roundabouts are located at either end of the complex. The southern roundabout is a junction with the A1179 and gives access to the city's Bus Station (part of the shopping centre). The A15 then passes through the Westgate shopping area and the city's courts before reaching a roundabout where the dual carriageway part of the road ends.\n\n=== City Centre to Norman Cross===\nThe A15 moves out of Peterborough heading southwards as a single carriageway road going past Peterborough United Football Ground. After some traffic light junctions the A15 goes under the A1139 before coming to a roundabout for a business estate. Then the A15 quickly comes to a second roundabout with the A1260 near to [[Serpentine Green]]. Then the A15 moves into open countryside before touching the outermost part of [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]] where it meets the B1091. The A15 again moves into countryside before reaching the A1(M) at a major junction at [[Norman Cross]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1139.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Eye===\nThe A1139 starts as a single carriageway road at a minor roundabout with the A47 at Eye. After a second small roundabout the road passes through some housing before meeting the A15 on a major roundabout near Paston.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"white\" style=\"color: #black\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Eye'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Leicester]], [[A47 road|A47]]\n|Start\n||[[Wisbech]], [[King's Lynn]] [[A47 road|A47]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|[[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]],<br>Peterborough Road\n|}\n\n=== Frank Perkins Parkway===\n[[Image:Frank Perkins Parkway (A1139), Peterborough - geograph.org.uk - 84269.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Frank Perkins Parkway heading towards [[Newark, Cambridgeshire|Newark]] ]]\nThe [[Frank Perkins (engineer)|Frank Perkins]] Parkway is named after Frank Perkins, local founder of [[Perkins Engines]] and is the main Eastern Bypass for Peterborough. The parkway has access to the Perkins Engines site. The Parkway heads south as a major dual carriageway from a major roundabout with the A15 near Eye and quickly passes its first junction, which is restricted to southbound traffic and the Perkins Factory before reaching to Junction 5 which is a major inlet for city bound traffic. The road then passes over the [[River Nene]] and quickly reaches junction 4 where it meets the A605, which runs parallel to junction 3a and the new Stanground bypass out of Peterborough and the old A605, now the B1092. The Frank Perkins Parkway also becomes the Fletton Parkway here.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Frank Perkins Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sleaford]], [[A15 road|A15]] <br>\n|J8\n|[[Parnwell, Cambridgeshire|Parnwell]], Parnwell Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Newark, Oxney Road\n|J7\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|J6\n|[[Perkins Engines|Perkins Engines Access]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], Boongate\n|J5\n|Newark, Boongate\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|J4\n|[[Stanground]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Fletton Parkway===\nFletton Parkway comprises the entire southern bypass of Peterborough and terminates westbound at the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]. The Fletton Parkway officially starts at junction 4 as a major dual carriageway before which it is named the Frank Perkins Parkway due to them being constructed at different times. The later construction of junction 3A, an access road for the Kingston Park distribution centres large IKEA depot and the new A605 Stanground Bypass, meant a major re-design of junction 4 and a new single carriageway road running parallel with the Fletton Parkway from junctions 3A to 4 providing the only link from junction 4 to the Fletton Parkway.  This follows the closure to traffic of the original junction 4 on slip road and removal of the off slip road on safety grounds. At the same time the original on slip road to the Frank Perkins Parkway which actually joined the Fletton Parkway was closed and a new direct on slip road constructed to the north of junction 4.  The dual carriageway quickly passes over the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] before reaching the grade separated junction (3) with the A1260 which links up with the A15 and the A47. The on slip road then forms a third lane and it moves very quickly to junction two, which is a local access road to the Orton and Hampton townships, before reaching its final junction (1) with the Orton Parkway where it reverts to two lanes before the on slip road again forms a third lane. . The Fletton Parkway then meets the A1, the A1(M) and the A605 at Junction 17.\nWhen first opened in 1976 the Fletton Parkway went from the A1 at Haddon to junction 3 where it joined Peterborough's western and northern bypass roads, the Nene Parkway, Soke Parkway and Paston Parkway.  A single carriageway road, Phorpres Way, running parallel to the future course of the Fletton Parkway providing a link to the A15.  Around 1979 when the eastern bypass, the Frank Perkins Parkway, was completed the Fletton Parkway was extended to junction 4 to join it and complete the ring road\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Fletton Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Northbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Southbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Ikea Distribution Centre, Junction 4 access <br>\n|J3A\n|[[Whittlesey]], [[A605 road|A605]], [[Kingston Park Distribution Centre]],\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Bretton]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 Nene Parkway]]\n|J3\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 The Serpentine]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Malborne]], Malborne Way<br>[[The Ortons|Orton Goldhay]], Goldway Way\n|J2\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], Natures Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Centre]], [[A1139 road (England)|A1139 Orton Parkway]]\n|J1\n|[[Great Haddon]], [[Roxhill Distribution Centre]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Northampton]], [[A605 road|A605]]<br>[[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]\n|Terminus\n|[[Huntingdon]], London, [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]]\n|}\n\n=== Orton Parkway===\nThe Orton Parkway is a short minor dual carriageway, that is officially classed as the A1139, although it is not part of the main road itself. There is one small roundabout which provides local access to Orton Goldhay, [[Orton Southgate]] and [[Orton Brimbles]]. The road also helps to carry traffic to events at the nearby [[East of England Showground]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1179.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Longthorpe Parkway and Thorpe Road===\nThe A1179 is a short major road that is half dual carriageway and half single carriageway. It runs from the A1260 to the A15 near [[Queensgate shopping centre, United Kingdom|Queensgate shopping centre]], passing over a metal arch bridge over the East Coast main line just before its eastern end.\n\n[[Image:UK road A1260.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Nene Parkway===\nThe A1260 is a major road that serves the western side of Peterborough. The road is dual-carriageway from its southern terminus with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] at [[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]] to its northern terminus with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] at [[Longthorpe]]. The road is also known as the \"Nene Parkway\" and serves as major route from getting from the southern end of Peterborough to the Northern end without having to travel into the centre of the city via the [[A15 road (England)|A15]]. The road itself starts at Hampton at a small roundabout with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] where after it goes past [[Serpentine Green]] at another roundabout before it very quickly heads to a major junction where its meets the A1139 (Fletton Parkway).  After that junction the road takes on the form of a major dual-carriageway with its own grade separated junctions where it meets the [[A605]] on a restricted junction before passing over the River Nene before meeting the A1179 (Longthorpe Parkway) on another junction. After that junction the road quickly heads north before coming to a major junction with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] where the road ends on a large roundabout with the A47 passing over on top. In 2008, the city council undertook improvements to the roundabout at the southern terminus of the parkway, increasing the southbound and eastbound approaches to three approach lanes and adding a third lane northbound on the roundabout for traffic using a newly constructed running-lane between junctions 1 and 2, where there are now three lanes northbound. Traffic lights have also been installed. Traffic signals are also planned on the roundabout at the northern terminus of the parkway with the A47 Soke Parkway.\n\n[[Image:UK road A47.svg|130px]]\n\n=== Thorney to Eye===\n\nThe A47 heads west to Peterborough from Wisbech. It bypasses Thorney along a minor dual carriageway. Eye is bypassed by a single carriageway where the A47 meets the [[A16 road (England)|A16]] and then the [[A1139 road|A1139]] at separate roundabouts. The A47 then becomes dual carriageway, passing a large rubbish tip to reach a major junction with the [[A15 road|A15]] at Paston.\n\n=== Soke Parkway (Longthorpe to Wansford)===\n[[Image:A47 at Ailsworth, Peterborough, looking west - geograph.org.uk - 208615.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[A47 road|A47]] Soke Parkway heading towards [[Wansford, Cambridgeshire|Wansford]] ]]\nThe Soke Parkway consists of the entire section of the A47 that runs through Peterborough. As a trunk route, the stretch of road is maintained by the Highways Agency, who have recently undertaken an update of road lighting on the route.  This section of road is called the ''Soke Parkway'' (named after the [[Soke of Peterborough]]). When this was first built, in the mid-1970s, the A47 followed what is now the A1139 ''Paston Parkway''.  Apart from a roundabout on the eastern edge of the city, the parkway is an unbroken major dual carriageway. The road passes over the A15 (Paston Parkway) as a roundabout and than heads westwards passing one grade separated junction with a local road. The road then meets the city section of the A15 on an unusual junction. It crosses the [[East Coast Main Line]] near to a [[Morrisons]] (former [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]]), and Boulevard and Brotherhood retail parks in [[New England, Peterborough|New England]].  After passing the A15 the A47 quickly heads south-westwards, where after passing another grade separated junction for local traffic the road meets the A1260 at [[Longthorpe]]. The Nene Parkway terminates in the Peterborough Longthorpe [[Grade separation|Grade separated junction]] (GSJ) (which opened in December 1987) where it meets the A1260 Nene Parkway. There is a GSJ for [[Bretton, Peterborough|Bretton]] and a [[Sainsbury's]], and it passes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144937/http://www.bwcs.org.uk/ Bretton Woods Community School]. The \u00a31.2m Peterborough [[Westwood, Peterborough|Westwood]] GSJ opened in January 1987. After passing this junction the A47 heads westward into open countryside where it bypasses Castor and Ailsworth before the road becomes a single carriageway before reaching the A1 at Wansford.\n\n[[Image:UK road A605.PNG|130px]]\n\n===  Stanground/Kingston Park ===\nThe A605 comes into Peterborough from Whittlesey and comes into the city via the Stanground bypass. Once on the bypass the road heads towards the Kingston Park distribution center and then turns right at the roundabout and continues under the A1139 Fletton Parkway. From there it follows a short piece of single carriageway until it meets up with the Stanground roundabout junction with the A1139 and B1091. From there it continues towards the city and once again under the A1139 and finally meets with the A15 at the Peacock junction just short of the Peterborough United football ground.\n\n===  City Section ===\nThis section of the A605 is now completely isolated from the rest of the other sections of this road. The city section starts at the Town Bridge junction with the A15 near Peterborough United football ground.  The road heads in a westward direction towards the A1 as single carriageway.  The road meets the A1260 at a restricted junction near [[Orton, Peterborough|The Ortons]] with the road passing underneath.  The road than passes into The Ortons, where it provides a lot of local traffic to those who live in those areas. The road passes a couple of roundabouts which allow for local access, and also Ferry Meadows before reaching an industrial estate and Business park, where it meets a spur of the A1139.  The road than passes another small roundabout before reaching the A1.\nTo reach the Peterborough to Elton section of this road you must follow the A1139 spur until the junction with the main A1139 then take a right at the roundabout and follow the signs for the A1/A1(M)/A605 Northampton/Oundle\n\n===  Peterborough to Elton ===\nThe A605 leaves its junction with the A1(M)/A1/A1139 as a major single carriageway by widening to three lanes, before climbing up a hill close to the Peterborough (Morborne) FM & DAB radio transmitter is located. It then moves back to two lanes before moving on to Elton and out of Peterborough.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Stagecoach in Peterborough and Delaine ]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Peterborough}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Peterborough]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2011}}\n{{original research|date=January 2014}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe '''City of [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]]''' in [[East Anglia]] has an extensive and well integrated road network, owing partly to its status as a [[new town]]. Since the 1960s, the city has seen considerable expansion and its various suburbs are linked by a system of [[parkway]]s.\n[[File:Peterborough Parkways.PNG|thumb|alt=A Map with the various parkways highlighted|Peterborough's Parkways]]Despite its large-scale growth, Peterborough has the fastest peak and off-peak travel times for a city of its size in the United Kingdom, due to the construction of the parkways. The [[Local Transport Plan]] anticipates expenditure totalling around \u00a3180 million for the period up to 2010 on major road schemes to accommodate future development.<ref>[http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page-4536 The Second Local Transport Plan] Peterborough City Council, March 2006</ref>\n\nThe [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1/A1(M)]] broadly follows the path of the historic [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] from London, through Peterborough (Junction 17), continuing north a further 335 miles (539&nbsp;km) to central [[Edinburgh]].\n\n==Numbered Junctions==\n[[File:Peterborough Queensgate Roundabout Sign.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A numbered roundabout sign in [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]].]]\n[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] has so many roundabouts and grade separated junctions within its roads and parkway system that junctions are numbered using the same system as is used to number British motorway and major A road junctions to guide and help drivers. Peterborough is to date the only city within the United Kingdom to use the system in this way and has been using this system since the 1970s.\n\n==Parkways and major roads==\nThe parkways were constructed under guidelines from the [[Peterborough Development Corporation]] as a system of high speed roads to connect the new townships which housed London's post-war [[London overspill|overspill]] population and were mostly built from the early 1970s to the late 1980s\n\nThe majority of Peterborough's parkways are dual carriageways, to accommodate the large quantity of local traffic within the city, and national and regional traffic bypassing it. However, due to their age, many of the parkways do not have hard-shoulders. Most of the parkways that bypass the city have graded [[Roundabout interchange|roundabout junctions]].\n\n===Wittering to Norman Cross===\nThe A1 is located just to the west of Peterborough. The road does not play a major part in Peterborough's road network itself although it is a major route. The road goes past RAF Wittering before meeting the A47 at Wansford on a grade separated junction. The A1 then moves south passing very close to the Nene Valley Railway line before reaching the city section of the A605 at another grade separated junction before reaching the A1139/A605 Oundle Section grade separated junction. This is also where the A1(M) starts and as a motorway the road quickly moves southward to reach the A15 at Norman Cross where the motorway moves out of the Peterborough area.\n\n[[Image:UK road A15.svg|130px]]\n\n=== Glinton to New England (Werrington Parkway)===\nThe Werrington Parkway runs from the south of [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]], where the A15 forks into the Peterborough east bypass and main road into the city centre. The road is dual carriageway from [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]] to the centre of Peterborough. There are no grade separated junctions along its route but does contain a number of smaller roundabouts which give direct and easy access to [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]] and its industrial estates. The Parkway then becomes less and standard dual-carriageway to which speed limits are in place to pass through [[New England, Cambridgeshire|New England]] and its retail park along with a major supermarket just prior to reaching the junction with the [[A47 road|A47]] at a major junction. Because of the speed restrictions along the majority of its route traffic coming into [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] are now encouraged to use the Paston Parkway instead to access the city centre and in the past few years signposts have been changed to reflect this.\n\n=== Glinton to Eye (Paston Parkway/A15 Spur Road)===\nThe Paston Parkway bypasses the eastern edge of Peterborough, terminating at a roundabout with the [[A1139 road|A1139]], where the city bypass becomes the Frank Perkins Parkway. The road starts at the southernmost roundabout of the Glinton and heads eastward as a single carriageway before coming to a roundabout for local traffic. The road then becomes a major dual carriageway, although it has only one grade separated junction (with the A47), with the other junctions being roundabouts. In 2008, Peterborough City Council funded the dualling of the northernmost stretch of the Paston Parkway between two roundabouts east of [[Gunthorpe, Peterborough|Gunthorpe]]. This has significantly reduced congestion, as the route is used as a commuter run between the city's Eastern Industry development in [[Fengate, Peterborough|Fengate]] and settlements north of the city.\n\n=== City Centre===\nThe A15 moves southward as a minor dual carriageway from its junction with the A47 with several more roundabouts lining its route. The road goes past some rail sidings that are rarely used and also goes past a retail shopping area on the site of the city's former Parcel Force depot. After passing the city's Toys R Us store the A15 reaches Queensgate Shopping Centre. The road passes the shopping centre between two of the centre's major Car Parks with a 1980s style footbridge crossing over the top. Two roundabouts are located at either end of the complex. The southern roundabout is a junction with the A1179 and gives access to the city's Bus Station (part of the shopping centre). The A15 then passes through the Westgate shopping area and the city's courts before reaching a roundabout where the dual carriageway part of the road ends.\n\n=== City Centre to Norman Cross===\nThe A15 moves out of Peterborough heading southwards as a single carriageway road going past Peterborough United Football Ground. After some traffic light junctions the A15 goes under the A1139 before coming to a roundabout for a business estate. Then the A15 quickly comes to a second roundabout with the A1260 near to [[Serpentine Green]]. Then the A15 moves into open countryside before touching the outermost part of [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]] where it meets the B1091. The A15 again moves into countryside before reaching the A1(M) at a major junction at [[Norman Cross]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1139.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Eye===\nThe A1139 starts as a single carriageway road at a minor roundabout with the A47 at Eye. After a second small roundabout the road passes though some housing before meeting the A15 on a major roundabout near Paston.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"white\" style=\"color: #black\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Eye'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Leicester]], [[A47 road|A47]]\n|Start\n||[[Wisbech]], [[King's Lynn]] [[A47 road|A47]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|[[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]],<br>Peterborough Road\n|}\n\n=== Frank Perkins Parkway===\n[[Image:Frank Perkins Parkway (A1139), Peterborough - geograph.org.uk - 84269.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Frank Perkins Parkway heading towards [[Newark, Cambridgeshire|Newark]] ]]\nThe [[Frank Perkins (engineer)|Frank Perkins]] Parkway is named after Frank Perkins, local founder of [[Perkins Engines]] and is the main Eastern Bypass for Peterborough. The parkway has access to the Perkins Engines site. The Parkway heads south as a major dual carriageway from a major roundabout with the A15 near Eye and quickly passes its first junction, which is restricted to southbound traffic and the Perkins Factory before reaching to Junction 5 which is a major inlet for city bound traffic. The road then passes over the [[River Nene]] and quickly reaches junction 4 where it meets the A605, which runs parallel to junction 3a and the new Stanground bypass out of Peterborough and the old A605, now the B1092. The Frank Perkins Parkway also becomes the Fletton Parkway here.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Frank Perkins Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Westbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Eastbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Sleaford]], [[A15 road|A15]] <br>\n|J8\n|[[Parnwell, Cambridgeshire|Parnwell]], Parnwell Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Newark, Oxney Road\n|J7\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|\n|J6\n|[[Perkins Engines|Perkins Engines Access]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], Boongate\n|J5\n|Newark, Boongate\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|J4\n|[[Stanground]], [[A605 road|A605]]\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Fletton Parkway===\nFletton Parkway comprises the entire southern bypass of Peterborough and terminates westbound at the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]. The Fletton Parkway officially starts at junction 4 as a major dual carriageway before which it is named the Frank Perkins Parkway due to them being constructed at different times. The later construction of junction 3A, an access road for the Kingston Park distribution centres large IKEA depot and the new A605 Stanground Bypass, meant a major re-design of junction 4 and a new single carriageway road running parallel with the Fletton Parkway from junctions 3A to 4 providing the only link from junction 4 to the Fletton Parkway.  This follows the closure to traffic of the original junction 4 on slip road and removal of the off slip road on safety grounds. At the same time the original on slip road to the Frank Perkins Parkway which actually joined the Fletton Parkway was closed and a new direct on slip road constructed to the north of junction 4.  The dual carriageway quickly passes over the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] before reaching the grade separated junction (3) with the A1260 which links up with the A15 and the A47. The on slip road then forms a third lane and it moves very quickly to junction two, which is a local access road to the Orton and Hampton townships, before reaching its final junction (1) with the Orton Parkway where it reverts to two lanes before the on slip road again forms a third lane. . The Fletton Parkway then meets the A1, the A1(M) and the A605 at Junction 17.\nWhen first opened in 1976 the Fletton Parkway went from the A1 at Haddon to junction 3 where it joined Peterborough's western and northern bypass roads, the Nene Parkway, Soke Parkway and Paston Parkway.  A single carriageway road, Phorpres Way, running parallel to the future course of the Fletton Parkway providing a link to the A15.  Around 1979 when the eastern bypass, the Frank Perkins Parkway, was completed the Fletton Parkway was extended to junction 4 to join it and complete the ring road\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"00703C\" style=\"color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | '''A1139 \u2013 Fletton Parkway'''\n|-\n!scope=col|Northbound Exits\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col|Southbound Exits\n|- align=\"center\"\n|Ikea Distribution Centre, Junction 4 access <br>\n|J3A\n|[[Whittlesey]], [[A605 road|A605]], [[Kingston Park Distribution Centre]],\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|City Centre]], [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Bretton]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 Nene Parkway]]\n|J3\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]], [[A1260 road (England)|A1260 The Serpentine]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Malborne]], Malborne Way<br>[[The Ortons|Orton Goldhay]], Goldway Way\n|J2\n|[[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], Natures Way\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[The Ortons|Orton Centre]], [[A1139 road (England)|A1139 Orton Parkway]]\n|J1\n|[[Great Haddon]], [[Roxhill Distribution Centre]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Northampton]], [[A605 road|A605]]<br>[[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]\n|Terminus\n|[[Huntingdon]], London, [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]]\n|}\n\n=== Orton Parkway===\nThe Orton Parkway is a short minor dual carriageway, that is officially classed as the A1139, although it is not part of the main road itself. There is one small roundabout which provides local access to Orton Goldhay, [[Orton Southgate]] and [[Orton Brimbles]]. The road also helps to carry traffic to events at the nearby [[East of England Showground]].\n\n[[Image:UK road A1179.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Longthorpe Parkway and Thorpe Road===\nThe A1179 is a short major road that is half dual carriageway and half single carriageway. It runs from the A1260 to the A15 near [[Queensgate shopping centre, United Kingdom|Queensgate shopping centre]], passing over a metal arch bridge over the East Coast main line just before its eastern end.\n\n[[Image:UK road A1260.PNG|130px]]\n\n=== Nene Parkway===\nThe A1260 is a major road that serves the western side of Peterborough. The road is dual-carriageway from its southern terminus with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] at [[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]] to its northern terminus with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] at [[Longthorpe]]. The road is also known as the \"Nene Parkway\" and serves as major route from getting from the southern end of Peterborough to the Northern end without having to travel into the centre of the city via the [[A15 road (England)|A15]]. The road itself starts at Hampton at a small roundabout with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] where after it goes past [[Serpentine Green]] at another roundabout before it very quickly heads to a major junction where its meets the A1139 (Fletton Parkway).  After that junction the road takes on the form of a major dual-carriageway with its own grade separated junctions where it meets the [[A605]] on a restricted junction before passing over the River Nene before meeting the A1179 (Longthorpe Parkway) on another junction. After that junction the road quickly heads north before coming to a major junction with the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] where the road ends on a large roundabout with the A47 passing over on top. In 2008, the city council undertook improvements to the roundabout at the southern terminus of the parkway, increasing the southbound and eastbound approaches to three approach lanes and adding a third lane northbound on the roundabout for traffic using a newly constructed running-lane between junctions 1 and 2, where there are now three lanes northbound. Traffic lights have also been installed. Traffic signals are also planned on the roundabout at the northern terminus of the parkway with the A47 Soke Parkway.\n\n[[Image:UK road A47.svg|130px]]\n\n=== Thorney to Eye===\n\nThe A47 heads west to Peterborough from Wisbech. It bypasses Thorney along a minor dual carriageway. Eye is bypassed by a single carriageway where the A47 meets the [[A16 road (England)|A16]] and then the [[A1139 road|A1139]] at separate roundabouts. The A47 then becomes dual carriageway, passing a large rubbish tip to reach a major junction with the [[A15 road|A15]] at Paston.\n\n=== Soke Parkway (Longthorpe to Wansford)===\n[[Image:A47 at Ailsworth, Peterborough, looking west - geograph.org.uk - 208615.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[A47 road|A47]] Soke Parkway heading towards [[Wansford, Cambridgeshire|Wansford]] ]]\nThe Soke Parkway consists of the entire section of the A47 that runs through Peterborough.
