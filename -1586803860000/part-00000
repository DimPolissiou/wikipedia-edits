This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.<ref name=Swann>{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}</ref> These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.\n\nBy 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=RHSC/> To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).<ref name=Hicks>{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}</ref> While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.<ref name=McCreery>{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}</ref>\n\nIt took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.<ref name=hansard/> These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]\u2014''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''.

This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.<ref name=Swann>{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}</ref> These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.\n\nBy 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=RHSC/> To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).<ref name=Hicks>{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}</ref> While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.<ref name=McCreery>{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}</ref>\n\nIt took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.<ref name=hansard/> These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]\u2014''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''.

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase.

Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 30 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.

Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast.

One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details\u2014May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

Fu\u00dfball-Club K\u00f6ln 01/07 e. V.''', commonly known as simply '''1. FC K\u00f6ln''' or '''FC Cologne''' in English ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0 \u02c8k\u0153ln}}), is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Cologne]]. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs ''K\u00f6lner Ballspiel-Club 1901'' and ''SpVgg S\u00fclz 07''. K\u00f6ln gained promotion back to the [[Bundesliga]] in the [[2018-19 2. Bundesliga|2018\u201319 season]] after being relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] [[2017-18 Bundesliga|the previous season]]. The team won the first Bundesliga in 1963.\n\nThe club's nickname ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' (The [[Goat|Billy Goats]]) refers to the club's [[mascot]], a male goat named ''Hennes'' after the veteran FC player and (later) manager [[Hennes Weisweiler]]. The first ''Hennes'' was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a [[Cologne carnival]] joke. The current mascot is ''Hennes'' IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age.<ref>https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/fc-present-hennes-ix/</ref> Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is ''FC'' (often written as ''Effzeh''), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the [[Colognian language|dialect spoken around Cologne]], this is pronounced \"EF-tsay\",{{fix|text=Colognian IPA needed|date=October 2015}} in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0|}}). K\u00f6ln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history.\n\nLike many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC K\u00f6ln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like [[handball]], [[table tennis]] and [[gymnastics]]. 1. FC K\u00f6ln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/mitglieder-boom-dank-europa-fc-knackt-bald-die-100-000--27800598 | title = Mitglieder-Boom dank Europa FC knackt bald die 100.000! | language = de | trans-title=Member's boom thanks to Europa League FC will soon break the 100,000! | publisher = express.de | date = 16 June 2017 | accessdate = 12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/record-setting-members-meeting | title = Record-Setting Members' Meeting | publisher = fc.de | date = 26 September 2017 | accessdate = 27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Predecessor sides===\n[[File:Kolner BC.png|thumb|left|250px|Historical logos of predecessor side ''K\u00f6lner BC'']]K\u00f6lner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the [[gymnastics]] club FC Borussia K\u00f6ln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before [[World War I]] who took the [[Western German football championship|Westdeutsche championship]] in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the [[1912 German football championship|national finals]]. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost a 1\u20133 to [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SpVgg Sulz.png|thumb|right|100px|Historical logo of predecessor side ''SpVgg S\u00fclz'']] -->\nSpielvereinigung 1907 K\u00f6ln-S\u00fclz was established in 1907 as S\u00fclzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fu\u00dfball Club 1908 Hertha S\u00fclz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the [[1928 German football championship|national finals]] in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the [[Gauliga Mittelrhein]], one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s&nbsp;\u2013 including a divisional championship in 1939&nbsp;\u2013 but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the [[Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen]] and the [[Gauliga Moselland]], which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. S\u00fclz struggled until they were united with [[VfL K\u00f6ln 1899]] for the 1943\u201344 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/S\u00fclz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen title by a single point over SG D\u00fcren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.\n\n===A successful new club===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:FC K\u00f6ln Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of 1. FC K\u00f6ln league performance]]\nAfter the union of these two predecessor sides (1948), 1. FC K\u00f6ln began play in the tough [[Oberliga West (1947\u201363)|Oberliga West]] in the 1949\u201350 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the [[1953\u201354 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final 1\u20130 to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the [[1960 German football championship|national final]] against [[Hamburger SV]], where they went down to a 2\u20133 defeat. They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in [[1962 German football championship|1962]] and [[1963 German football championship|1963]]. They won the '62 match 4\u20130 over [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] resulting in entry to the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]] where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round K\u00f6ln visited [[Dundee F.C.]] of Scotland and lost 1\u20138, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4\u20130 they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final they lost 1\u20133 to [[Borussia Dortmund]].\n\n===Continuing success===\n[[File:Einweihung Carola-Williams-Park 05.jpg|thumb|Mascot Hennes VIII]]\nIn 1963, FC K\u00f6ln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. K\u00f6ln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga champion]] in the league's inaugural [[1963\u201364 Bundesliga|1963\u201364 season]]. As German champions, K\u00f6ln entered the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] where it met England's [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the quarter-final stage. After two 0\u20130 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2\u20132. As the [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]] had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, K\u00f6ln went out of the competition on the [[Coin toss|toss of a coin]]. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground. The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player when it signed [[Z\u00e9z\u00e9]] for a then club record fee of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 150,000.<ref name=\"Schnee\" >[http://www.weltfussball.de/news/_n1498951_/schnee-allergie-beim-samba-kicker/ Schnee-Allergie beim Samba-Kicker] {{in lang|de}} Weltfussball.de, published: 27 March 2015. Retrieved 28 March 2015.</ref> Domestically, K\u00f6ln recorded a second-place finish in the [[1964\u201365 Bundesliga]] season and won its first [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1967\u201368 DFB-Pokal|1967\u201368]].\n\nAt the start of the 1970s, K\u00f6ln reached three DFB-Pokal finals in four seasons, losing all three; to [[Kickers Offenbach]] in [[1969\u201370 DFB-Pokal|1970]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in [[1970\u201371 DFB-Pokal|1971]] and [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] in [[1972\u201373 DFB-Pokal|1973]]. The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in [[1972\u201373 Bundesliga|1973]] before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in [[1976\u201377 DFB-Pokal|1977]], beating [[Hertha BSC]] over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.\n\nIn 1977\u201378, FC K\u00f6ln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title, its third national title overall, and retaining the [[1977\u201378 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. This makes K\u00f6ln one of only four clubs to have won [[Double (association football)#Germany|the double]] in [[Double (association football)#Bundesliga era|the Bundesliga era]].\n\nK\u00f6ln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in [[1979\u201380 DFB-Pokal|1980]], before winning the competition for a fourth time in [[1982\u201383 DFB-Pokal|1983]]. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5\u20133 on aggregate to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in [[1988\u201389 Bundesliga|1988\u201389]] and [[1989\u201390 Bundesliga|1989\u201390]], and another DFB-Pokal final loss in [[1990\u201391 DFB-Pokal|1991]], marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC K\u00f6ln.\n\n===21st century: ups and downs===\nIn recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2002]], the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until [[Thomas Cichon]] found the back of the net again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2002/25/fckoeln-herthabsc/ | title = Das ersehnte Tor war zuwenig | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 2 March 2002 | accessdate = 10 December 2014}}</ref>\nIn the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC K\u00f6ln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance fell, and in [[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1998]] it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a \"[[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]]\", moving between the first and second divisions. It has returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the [[2004\u201305 2. Bundesliga|2004\u201305 season]] as [[2. Bundesliga]] champions after having been relegated the [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|season before]]. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine ''kicker'' as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.\n\nThis prediction came true when K\u00f6ln lost to [[Hamburger SV]] 1\u20130 in the third-to-last match of [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|the season]]. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was [[Lukas Podolski]] with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn late 2006, former coach [[Christoph Daum]] was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2.

Fu\u00dfball-Club K\u00f6ln 01/07 e. V.''', commonly known as simply '''1. FC K\u00f6ln''' or '''FC Cologne''' in English ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0 \u02c8k\u0153ln}}), is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Cologne]]. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs ''K\u00f6lner Ballspiel-Club 1901'' and ''SpVgg S\u00fclz 07''. K\u00f6ln gained promotion back to the [[Bundesliga]] in the [[2018-19 2. Bundesliga|2018\u201319 season]] after being relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] [[2017-18 Bundesliga|the previous season]]. The team won the first Bundesliga in 1963.\n\nThe club's nickname ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' (The [[Goat|Billy Goats]]) refers to the club's [[mascot]], a male goat named ''Hennes'' after the veteran FC player and (later) manager [[Hennes Weisweiler]]. The first ''Hennes'' was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a [[Cologne carnival]] joke. The current mascot is ''Hennes'' IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age.<ref>https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/fc-present-hennes-ix/</ref> Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is ''FC'' (often written as ''Effzeh''), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the [[Colognian language|dialect spoken around Cologne]], this is pronounced \"EF-tsay\",{{fix|text=Colognian IPA needed|date=October 2015}} in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0|}}). K\u00f6ln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history.\n\nLike many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC K\u00f6ln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like [[handball]], [[table tennis]] and [[gymnastics]]. 1. FC K\u00f6ln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/mitglieder-boom-dank-europa-fc-knackt-bald-die-100-000--27800598 | title = Mitglieder-Boom dank Europa FC knackt bald die 100.000! | language = de | trans-title=Member's boom thanks to Europa League FC will soon break the 100,000! | publisher = express.de | date = 16 June 2017 | accessdate = 12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/record-setting-members-meeting | title = Record-Setting Members' Meeting | publisher = fc.de | date = 26 September 2017 | accessdate = 27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Predecessor sides===\n[[File:Kolner BC.png|thumb|left|250px|Historical logos of predecessor side ''K\u00f6lner BC'']]K\u00f6lner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the [[gymnastics]] club FC Borussia K\u00f6ln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before [[World War I]] who took the [[Western German football championship|Westdeutsche championship]] in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the [[1912 German football championship|national finals]]. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost a 1\u20133 to [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SpVgg Sulz.png|thumb|right|100px|Historical logo of predecessor side ''SpVgg S\u00fclz'']] -->\nSpielvereinigung 1907 K\u00f6ln-S\u00fclz was established in 1907 as S\u00fclzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fu\u00dfball Club 1908 Hertha S\u00fclz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the [[1928 German football championship|national finals]] in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the [[Gauliga Mittelrhein]], one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s&nbsp;\u2013 including a divisional championship in 1939&nbsp;\u2013 but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the [[Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen]] and the [[Gauliga Moselland]], which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. S\u00fclz struggled until they were united with [[VfL K\u00f6ln 1899]] for the 1943\u201344 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/S\u00fclz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen title by a single point over SG D\u00fcren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.\n\n===A successful new club===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:FC K\u00f6ln Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of 1. FC K\u00f6ln league performance]]\nAfter the union of these two predecessor sides (1948), 1. FC K\u00f6ln began play in the tough [[Oberliga West (1947\u201363)|Oberliga West]] in the 1949\u201350 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the [[1953\u201354 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final 1\u20130 to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the [[1960 German football championship|national final]] against [[Hamburger SV]], where they went down to a 2\u20133 defeat. They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in [[1962 German football championship|1962]] and [[1963 German football championship|1963]]. They won the '62 match 4\u20130 over [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] resulting in entry to the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]] where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round K\u00f6ln visited [[Dundee F.C.]] of Scotland and lost 1\u20138, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4\u20130 they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final they lost 1\u20133 to [[Borussia Dortmund]].\n\n===Continuing success===\n[[File:Einweihung Carola-Williams-Park 05.jpg|thumb|Mascot Hennes VIII]]\nIn 1963, FC K\u00f6ln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. K\u00f6ln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga champion]] in the league's inaugural [[1963\u201364 Bundesliga|1963\u201364 season]]. As German champions, K\u00f6ln entered the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] where it met England's [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the quarter-final stage. After two 0\u20130 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2\u20132. As the [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]] had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, K\u00f6ln went out of the competition on the [[Coin toss|toss of a coin]]. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground.

The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in [[1972\u201373 Bundesliga|1973]] before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in [[1976\u201377 DFB-Pokal|1977]], beating [[Hertha BSC]] over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.\n\nIn 1977\u201378, FC K\u00f6ln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title, its third national title overall, and retaining the [[1977\u201378 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. This makes K\u00f6ln one of only four clubs to have won [[Double (association football)#Germany|the double]] in [[Double (association football)#Bundesliga era|the Bundesliga era]].\n\nK\u00f6ln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in [[1979\u201380 DFB-Pokal|1980]], before winning the competition for a fourth time in [[1982\u201383 DFB-Pokal|1983]]. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5\u20133 on aggregate to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in [[1988\u201389 Bundesliga|1988\u201389]] and [[1989\u201390 Bundesliga|1989\u201390]], and another DFB-Pokal final loss in [[1990\u201391 DFB-Pokal|1991]], marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC K\u00f6ln.\n\n===21st century: ups and downs===\nIn recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2002]], the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until [[Thomas Cichon]] found the back of the net again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2002/25/fckoeln-herthabsc/ | title = Das ersehnte Tor war zuwenig | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 2 March 2002 | accessdate = 10 December 2014}}</ref>\nIn the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC K\u00f6ln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance fell, and in [[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1998]] it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a \"[[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]]\", moving between the first and second divisions. It has returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the [[2004\u201305 2. Bundesliga|2004\u201305 season]] as [[2. Bundesliga]] champions after having been relegated the [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|season before]]. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine ''kicker'' as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.\n\nThis prediction came true when K\u00f6ln lost to [[Hamburger SV]] 1\u20130 in the third-to-last match of [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|the season]]. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was [[Lukas Podolski]] with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn late 2006, former coach [[Christoph Daum]] was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2. Bundesliga club and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008. After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008\u201309, Daum left K\u00f6ln for his former club [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]]. K\u00f6ln's former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the [[2009\u201310 Bundesliga|2009\u201310 season]].\n\nAfter a poor run of form in the [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]], recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, K\u00f6ln replaced coach [[Zvonimir Soldo]] with [[Frank Schaefer]]. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of K\u00f6ln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] and recent [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] coach [[St\u00e5le Solbakken]] replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Schaefer and former K\u00f6ln player [[Dirk Lottner]] replaced Solbakken.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2011/05/14/2486732/koln-confirm-stale-solbakken-as-new-coach-for-next-season/ |title=K\u00f6ln confirm Stale Solbakken as new coach for next season |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref> The club, however, was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 17th place, having accumulated \u20ac33m debt, and \u20ac11m [[equity (finance)|negative equity]].<ref name=dept2017>[http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/1--fc-koeln-wehrle-schafft-das-finanz-wunder--hier-die-mega-zahlen-26913860 1.

It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]], [[Army of the Potomac]], from July 1861 to July 1865. It was a member of the [[Vermont Brigade]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde (1831-1918) of the 3rd Vermont Infantry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Breed Noyes Hyde of the 3rd Vermont Infantry]]\nIn July 1861, the [[United States Congress]] authorized President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to call out 500,000 men, to serve for three years unless sooner discharged. The 3rd Vermont Infantry was the second of the three years regiments from the state placed in the field as a result of this call. It was organized from militia companies from [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury (Wells River)]], [[Charleston, Vermont|Charleston]], [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]], [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St.Johnsbury]], [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], [[Guildhall, Vermont|Guidhall]], and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] and [[Calais, Vermont|Calais]].\n\nGovernor [[Erastus Fairbanks]]' first choices to command the regiment were Colonel [[John W. Phelps]], soon to relinquish his command of the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], Captain [[Truman Seymour]], 4th U.S. Artillery, a native Vermonter who had been present at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and Captain A. V. Colburn, U.S. Army, who later became Assistant Adjutant General of the [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]]. Phelps, however, was serving as commandant of the post at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and the offers to Seymour and Colburn were declined.\n\nThe regiment rendezvoused at St. Johnsbury, on the ground of the [[Caledonia County]] Agricultural Society at \"Camp Baxter,\" named in honor of Adjutant and Inspector General [[H. Henry Baxter]]. The regiment mustered into United States service on July 16, 1861, and departed for [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 24, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Breed N. Hyde]]. At [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the regiment's commander, Colonel [[William Farrar Smith]], joined them.\n\nThe regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 1861, and on July 27, marched up the Potomac to the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]], where they built \"[[Fort Lyon (Virginia)|Camp Lyon]].\" They joined at that site the [[6th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th Maine Infantry]], [[Mott's Battery]] and a company of cavalry. By August 12, the [[2nd Vermont Infantry]] and the [[33rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|33rd New York Infantry]] had joined them. \n\nMajor [[Walter W. Cochran]], of [[Bellows Falls]], resigned his commission on August 6 due to a severe attack of fever and ague. Captain [[Wheelock G. Veazey]], of Company A, replaced him. On August 13, Colonel Smith was appointed [[brigadier general]] of volunteers, and Hyde replaced him, now as a full colonel. Veazey was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain [[Thomas O. Seaver]], of Company F, was promoted to major. \n\n[[File:William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel).jpg|thumb|Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]] of Groton, Vt., better known as [[The Sleeping Sentinel]].]]\nIt was also here that Private [[William Scott (The Sleeping Sentinel)|William Scott]], known to history as [[the Sleeping Sentinel]], was found asleep at his post on August 31, court-martialed, and sentenced to be executed.  President Lincoln heard about the case, pardoned Scott, and returned him to his unit. William Scott was actually standing before a firing squad when the death sentence and pardon were both read, however no one had told him that he had been pardoned prior to being sent to the firing squad.  Scott later was killed in action at the [[Battle of Lee's Mills]].\n\nOn September 3, the units crossed the Chain Bridge, and occupied \"Camp Advance,\" {{convert|1|mi}} in advance of the bridge.  On September 9, Private Scott was scheduled to be executed, but during the proceedings, after the death sentence had been read, a pardon was read, sparing his life. In 1997, the original court-martial and pardon papers were discovered, and authenticated, bringing to an end the controversy over whether President Lincoln had personally signed the pardon, which it turned out he did.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/10/news/asleep-at-his-post-to-be-shot.html]</ref> Scott served faithfully with his regiment until the [[Battle at Lee's Mills]], where he was mortally wounded, and was buried in the [[Colonial National Historical Park|national cemetery at Yorktown]].\n\nOn September 11, the regiment participated in a reconnaissance to and beyond [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], where it engaged Confederate skirmishers. Returning to the camp, the regiment came under fire from Rosser's battery. A shell fell within the ranks of Company C, killing Private Amos Meserve, mortally wounding William H. Colburn, and injuring five others. On September 25, the regiment participated in another reconnaissance to Lewinsville, but suffered no casualties. Quartermaster [[Redfield Proctor]] resigned from the regiment on this date to accept appointment as Major of the [[5th Vermont Infantry]].\n\nDuring the next two weeks, the 4th and 5th Vermont regiments joined Smith's division. On October 9, the Vermont regiments moved to Camp Griffin, about four miles from Chain Bridge. Here, on October 24, the [[6th Vermont Infantry]] arrived, completing the initial organization of the \"Old [[Vermont Brigade]].\" \n\nThe history of the regiment from this point on is essentially that of the [[Vermont Brigade]].\n\nThe original members of the regiment, who did not reenlist, were mustered out of the service on July 27, 1864. Veterans and recruits were consolidated into six companies, July 25, 1864. One year recruits and others whose term of service was due to expire prior to October 1, 1865, were mustered out on June 19, 1865. The remaining officers and men mustered out of service on July 11.\n\n==Medal of Honor==\n\nSix members of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\n* Alexander M. Beattie, Captain, Co.

He also cited several differences between Kosovo and Abkhazia as the reasons why Abkhazia should not be granted recognition. In Kosovo the ethnic cleansing was carried out by Serbs \u2013 the opponents of secession; In Abkhazia it was committed by the secessionists. While the right of return of refugees to Kosovo was a precondition for self-determination, in Abkhazia the self-determination is linked with the refusal to allow the return of internally displaced people. Abkhaz separatists rejected several peace plans proposed by Georgia, the [[United Nations]], and [[Germany]]; while in Kosovo it was Serbia that rejected peace efforts. After the war, Kosovo was ruled by U.N. administration; while Abkhazia denies international organizations entry.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/09/16/abkhazias_independence_farce |title=Abkhazia's Independence Farce |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen F. Jones]] argued that while South Ossetia was seeking for union with Russia, the political realities of the South Caucasus made this an unlikely prospect. In the 2012 presidential elections, [[Alla Dzhioyeva]], an opposition representative had victory snatched from her by the South Ossetian Supreme Court. This illustrated the region\u2019s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a not a real state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia does not have the functions of a state to provide for its citizens. There is little popular support for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/stephen-f-jones/south-ossetia%E2%80%99s-unwanted-independence |title=South Ossetia's unwanted independence |date=10 June 2014 |publisher=openDemocracy}}</ref>\n\n=== Other events ===\nAbkhazia said it would not take part in the \"Geneva Talks on Security and Stability in the Caucasus\" in June 2010 because of concerns over the objectivity of the co-chairmen who were representatives of the UN, the EU, and OSCE. A spokesman said \"Our proposals are being ignored, discussions on the non-renewal of war are being procrastinated, instead secondary questions are being discussed. Thereupon we feel the co-chairmen have no real proposals, and we want to give them time till September to prepare a document, concerning security, and acceptable for all sides. The Geneva discussions are necessary, and it is normal that each party voices its position, but the mediators must be neutral and non-biased.

After the war, Kosovo was ruled by U.N. administration; while Abkhazia denies international organizations entry.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/09/16/abkhazias_independence_farce |title=Abkhazia's Independence Farce |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen F. Jones]] argued that while South Ossetia was seeking for union with Russia, the political realities of the South Caucasus made this an unlikely prospect. In the 2012 presidential elections, [[Alla Dzhioyeva]], an opposition representative had victory snatched from her by the South Ossetian Supreme Court. This illustrated the region\u2019s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a not a real state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia does not have the functions of a state to provide for its citizens. There is little popular support for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/stephen-f-jones/south-ossetia%E2%80%99s-unwanted-independence |title=South Ossetia's unwanted independence |date=10 June 2014 |publisher=openDemocracy}}</ref>\n\n=== Other events ===\nAbkhazia said it would not take part in the \"Geneva Talks on Security and Stability in the Caucasus\" in June 2010 because of concerns over the objectivity of the co-chairmen who were representatives of the UN, the EU, and OSCE. A spokesman said \"Our proposals are being ignored, discussions on the non-renewal of war are being procrastinated, instead secondary questions are being discussed. Thereupon we feel the co-chairmen have no real proposals, and we want to give them time till September to prepare a document, concerning security, and acceptable for all sides. The Geneva discussions are necessary, and it is normal that each party voices its position, but the mediators must be neutral and non-biased. But the mediators fail to conduct discussions in a constructive impartial manner.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abkhaziagov.org/en/news/detail.php?ID%3D32028 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630014134/http://www.abkhaziagov.org/en/news/detail.php?ID=32028 |archivedate=30 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Positions taken by states ==\n[[File:Abkhazia and South Ossetia recognition.svg|thumb|center|750px|A world map, showing the status of international recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia independence by nation:{{legend|#FF0000|Abkhazia and South Ossetia}} {{legend|#008800|States that recognise both Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent}} {{legend|#52C0FF|States that recognise Abkhazia as independent}} {{legend|#E6EA40|States that recognise South Ossetia as independent}} {{legend|#C0C0C0|States that do not recognise either.}}]]\n\n=== States formally recognising Abkhazia or South Ossetia as independent ===\n\n==== UN member states ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100% align=center\n! !! width=175px | [[Sovereign state|State]] !!

Bradley is unhappy with her initial wardrobe and camera tests, so she challenges the copy Mia is providing her, and dispenses with the clothing chosen for her by Alex.

This move would bring the total number of sports to 27, one less than the requirement of 28 for the 2020 Olympics program, thus leaving a single vacancy that the IOC would seek to fill from a shortlist containing seven unrepresented sports as well as the sport that had been dropped from the 2012 Olympics program.\n\nOn 12 February 2013, IOC leaders voted to drop [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] from the \"core\" program for the 2020 Games; this was a surprising decision to news outlets given that wrestling is from the [[ancient Olympic Games]] and was included in the original program for the modern Games. ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|title=Wrestling, IOC make right moves in getting sport back on 2020 Olympics program|last=Hamilton|first=Tracee|date=8 September 2013|work=Washington Post|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143725/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|title=Olympics Moves to Drop Wrestling in 2020|last=Longman|first=Jer\u00e9|date=12 February 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621150844/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=bbc-nowrestling>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|title=Wrestling to be dropped from 2020 Olympic Games|work=BBC Sport|date=12 February 2013 |access-date=26 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701064236/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\" />\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: [[baseball]]/[[softball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[wrestling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |title=Baseball/softball, squash and wrestling make cut for IOC Session vote in Buenos Aires |date=29 May 2013 |website=Olympic.org |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607170846/https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |archive-date=7 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The other five sports were rejected at this point: [[karate]], [[roller sport]]s, [[sport climbing]], [[wakeboarding]], and [[wushu (sport)|wushu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|title=Wrestling, baseball/softball and squash shortlisted by IOC for 2020 as five fail to make cut|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124611/http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> On 8&nbsp;September 2013, at the [[125th IOC Session]], wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and [[2024 Summer Olympics|2024]].<!--but as a non-\"core\" sport this time--> Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|title=Wrestling added to Olympic program for 2020 and 2024 Games|publisher=[[IOC]]|date=8 September 2013|access-date=8 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911122207/http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|archive-date=11 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnder new IOC policies that shift the Games to use an \"event-based\" program rather than a \"sport-based\" program, the host organizing committee can now also propose the addition of sports to the program.

As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared [[Russian athletes at the 2020 Summer Olympics|Russian athletes]] to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"[[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]]\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|title=Russia banned from Tokyo Olympics and football World Cup|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=9 December 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209155622/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|archive-date=9 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598|title=Russia banned for four years to include 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup|work=BBC Sport|date=9 December 2019|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211171354/https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598 |archive-date=11 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |title=WADA lawyer defends lack of blanket ban on Russia |date=13 December 2019 |access-date=17 December 2019 |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |work=[[The Japan Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214162048/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |archive-date=14 December 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Russia later filed an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) against the WADA decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |title=Russia Confirms It Will Appeal 4-Year Olympic Ban |date=27 December 2019 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227213853/https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |archive-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2020|03|12|df=}}, the following 153 [[National Olympic Committee]]s have qualified (other than through universality places in athletics and swimming, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Eighty percent of the battle is communications.\" He championed a new program called Community Builders, created without appropriation by Congress, for 800 new HUD employees with computers to be paid as much as $100,000. In a June 16, 1999, speech, Cuomo declared that one purpose of the program was to fight against HUD's abolition. In August 1999, Community Builders distributed a letter to community groups to fight against proposed tax cuts. One HUD official declared that Community Builders were seen as \"Democratic [[ward heeler]]s who act as a pipeline between Democratic city officials, party leaders, and the administration and the [[Democratic National Committee]].\"\n\nIn 1998, Clinton-appointed HUD inspector general Susan Gaffney testified to a Senate committee that she was the victim of \"'escalating' attacks on her office by Cuomo and 'his key aides,' including cooked-up charges of racism, insubordination, malfeasance, and general dirty-dealing.\" In 1999, Gaffney's office concluded that \"most (15 out of 19) Community Builders' goals were activities rather than actual accomplishments.\" and that Cuomo's initiatives \"had a crippling effect on many of HUD's ongoing operations.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=James | last=Bovard | authorlink=James Bovard | year= 2000 | title= Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse Of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years | publisher= St. Martin's Press | location= New York | id=0-312-23082-6 | pages= 182\u2013184}}</ref>  Gaffney retired in May 2001, shortly after the department reached a $490,000 settlement with a black employee who had accused her of racial discrimination in passing him over for a promotion.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |agency=''[[Washington Post]]'' |date=May 6, 2001 |title=HUD's Inspector General Retiring After Racial-Bias Suit Settlement |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2001-05-06-0105060155-story.html |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=Deerfield Beach, FL}}</ref>\n\nPrior to Cuomo's tenure, HUD was routinely included on the General Accounting Office's biannual watch list of government programs whose poor management made them prone to fraud.<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite news |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |date=August 11, 2010 |title=The Making of Andrew Cuomo |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/magazine/15Cuomo-t.html |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |location=New York, NY |url-access=subscription |page=30}}</ref> During his time in office, two of HUD's four main departments were removed from the GAO list.<ref name=\"Making\"/> In addition, the department cut 15 percent of its staff as part of a Cuomo initiative to streamline its operations.<ref name=\"Making\"/>\n\n== 2002 New York gubernatorial election ==\n{{see also|2002 New York gubernatorial election}}\nCuomo first ran for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York in 2002.
