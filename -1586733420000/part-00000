As a comedian, he is best known both for ''[[Good News Week]]'' and for his role as a member of the musical comedy group the [[Doug Anthony All Stars]], which disbanded in 1994 but reformed in 2014; he has also performed individually and as a part of [[GUD (band)|GUD]]. He has frequently appeared at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and taken part in its two major televised productions, the Comedy Festival Gala and the Great Debate. He has also hosted two other [[ABC Television|ABC]] programs and briefly featured on [[Triple J]] as a morning radio presenter between 1996 and 1997. He hosted ''Good News Week'' until 2012, and has since pursued his painting career, and given a series of concerts featuring self-penned songs of a more serious nature.<ref name=locke>Locke, Anna: [http://www.australianstage.com.au/201208195707/features/perth/paul-mcdermott.html Paul McDermott in Paul Sings], ''Australian Stage'', 20 August 2012.</ref>\n\nMcDermott is a published author, having released several books both in collaboration with the Doug Anthony All Stars and individually.
