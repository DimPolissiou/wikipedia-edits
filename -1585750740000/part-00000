By these, tithes assigned to local churches at [[Llanfihangel Crucorney]], [[Llanddewi Rhydderch]], [[Llanelen]], [[Llanddewi Skirrid]], [[Bryngwyn]] and [[Llanwenarth]] and belonging previously to the Benedictine priory were now given over to the new school. In addition a much richer prize, the tithes of [[Badgeworth]] in [[Gloucestershire]] which had previously belonged to [[Usk]] priory were given over to [[Abergavenny]]'s use. Finally the priory chapel of St. Mary's was to become the new parish church of Abergavenny and so the redundant church of St. John's could be used to house the new school.<ref name=\"VCH277\">Nelmes (1992), p. 3</ref>\n\nThe monies available from these tithes were to be put into trust controlled by \"the bailliffs and commonality\", the forerunners of the [[Town Council]]. It was to provide a [[Free Grammar School]] where [[Latin grammar]] was taught. The new grammar school was named after its benefactor [[Henry VIII]] who also appointed its first headmaster, Richard Oldsworthy. The school when it opened had 26 pupils, all boys aged between 7 and 14.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\n=== The connection with Jesus College, Oxford 1664\u20131887 ===\nThe first century of the school's life was uneventful and change only came as a result of financial mismanagement by the local trustees who had leased out the Badgeworth lands for an undervalued rent: when the 99-year lease came to an end in 1664 it passed to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], who in return provided not only an equal rent but a Fellowship and Scholarship to the college. This began the close connection between the school and the college which not only provided a home for many of its ablest pupils, but also provided the school with its headmasters.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\nAn Act of Parliament in 1760 reorganised the school's governance. Henceforth Jesus College, which had finally gained control of the Gloucester tithes, was responsible for paying the headmaster and his assistant. The Act did have some effect as the old school building was pulled down and replaced on site with the religious tower and fine Georgian master's house which still stands today. By the time of the headmastership of the Reverend William Morgan (1765\u201375) the school was flourishing with some 70-80 boys.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\">Nelmes (1992), p. 4</ref>\n\nChange began in the 1870s. The Headmaster, James Webber, reorganised the curriculum, teaching classics, maths, drawing, French, writing, divinity and arithmetic. He built two new classrooms within the confines of St. John's. By 1878, 73 pupils were being taught by three masters. By 1887 the charity commissioners had prepared a scheme to create a second grade commercial school, on a new site, and it was this proposition that resulted in the severing of the centuries-old links between the school and Jesus College.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\"/>\n\n=== A century of reorganisation 1891\u20131972 ===\nThe first attempt at reorganisation was the 1891 scheme which proposed the creation of a 200 pupil school on a 9-acre site on Pen-y-pound. Building of the school was delayed by many problems and was not completed until 1898 at a cost of \u00a36,945. The school at this time was supposed to be a grammar school taking pupils from all over North Monmouthshire with a curriculum of [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[French language|French]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Algebra]], [[Trigonometry]] and [[Chemistry]].<ref name=\"Nelmes5\">Nelmes (1992), p. 5</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s there was new building with three classrooms, a gym and a library. The Old Boys' Association was founded at a meeting on 7 November 1923 and was soon thriving, with branches of the Abergavenny Society in both [[London]] and [[Aberystwyth]]. By 1930 the school had 150 pupils. The new sciences of Physics and Biology were introduced in the period and the increased importance of metalwork and woodwork  led to the building of a handicrafts room.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nFollowing Butler's Education Act of 1944, [[Monmouthshire County Council]] put forward three options for Abergavenny: boys and girls grammar schools and a secondary modern school; a co-educational grammar school and a secondary modern school or a multilateral school. All three options were to be tried over the next 25 years.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nHarry Newcombe retired as headmaster in 1954. He had managed to gain the school a good reputation as a classical grammar school. The Local Education Authority issued a Statutory Notice on 21 September 1954 to set up a multilateral school of 850, the first stage of which would be the amalgamation of the Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools. Between 1954 and 1956 plans were laid by the authority for an enlarged mixed grammar school and finally provided for a school of 510 pupils with a 60 pupil sixth form.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\">Nelmes (1992), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe new school on the Old Hereford Road site was to be the first phase of the multilateral school, the present Upper school. It was to have an assembly hall, a gym and three floors of classrooms and practical rooms. Building was only begun in 1960 and so the school was not opened until 1963. It was to be made up of a total of 448 pupils from [[King Henry VIII Grammar School|King Henry VIII Boys Grammar School]], the Girls' Intermediate High School, St. John's Private school and the Convent school.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\"/>\n\nThe transition from mixed grammar to comprehensive school was carried out under the headmaster, Russell Edwards. This involved the building of a new school  adjoining the grammar school on the Pen-y-pound site. It also involved the incorporation of Grofield Secondary Modern School which had been established in 1947. Until the new building was completed in 1972 this required the juggling of both staff and pupils between the different sites. The new comprehensive kept the name of its predecessor. The old grammar school became the Upper School while the new building became the Lower School.<ref name=\"Nelmes 1992, p. 7\">Nelmes (1992), p. 7</ref>\n\n=== Recent History 1972\u2013 ===\nThe school with a planned population of 850 pupils when conceived in the 1940s had a peak population of 1825 pupils in 1983.  In 1983 as part of the International Year of Communications the school participated in a satellite quiz with Parramatta High School in New South Wales, Australia, which was celebrating its 70th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramatta-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/documents/31068011/31075365/Eighth%20Decade.pdf|title=A Brief History of Parramatta High School 1980 - 1990|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe school saw a sharp decline in numbers over the course of the 1980s, with 1200 pupils in 1990. Pupil numbers have remained broadly consistent over the following two decades.<ref name=\"Nelmes 1992, p. 7\"/>\n\n== School houses ==\nThe school originally had two houses Oppidan and Rustican, from the Latin for Town and Country. As the school grew, a new house structure was created based on four of [[Henry VIII]]'s wives: Aragon ([[Catherine of Aragon]]), Howard ([[Catherine Howard]]), Parr ([[Catherine Parr]]) and Seymour ([[Jane Seymour]]). These houses continue to compete at the annual [[Eisteddfod]]au and at sporting occasions.\n\n== Headmasters and head teachers ==\nThe known heads at the school since its founding are as follows:<ref>Nelmes (1992), p. 8</ref>\n\n*1542 Richard Oldsworthy\n*c.1626 Morgan Lewis\n*c.1631 Morris Hughes\n*1643-1661 Henry Vaughan\n*1661-1662 John Cragge\n*1662-1663 Thomas Franklyn\n*1663 Nicholas Billingsley\n*1670-1674 Richard Lucas\n*1674-1684 Henry Rogers\n*1702-1712 Morgan Lewis\n*1713-1716 Thomas Watkins\n*1716-1724 William Parry\n*1724-1732 William Thomas\n*1765-1775 William Morgan\n*1775-1786 Edmund Sandford\n*1786-1795 John George\n*1795-1800 Charles Powell\n*1800-1805 John Hughes\n*1805-1806 John Llewellyn\n*c.1821 Thomas Williams\n*1821-1823 Charles Hand\n*1823-1828 Aaron Rogers\n*1828-1832 Jenkin Hughes\n*1833-1834 James Jones\n*1834-1835 James Gabb\n*1835-1876 Henry Peake\n*1876-1898 James Webber\n*1898-1919 Headland Sifton\n*1919-1954 Harry Newcombe\n*1954-1960 Thomas Edwards\n*1960-1962 Harold Sharpe\n*1962-1968 Gilmour Isaac\n*1968 Leonard Porter\n*1969-1985 Russell Edwards\n*c.1985 Derek Fisher\n*c.1995 M Brierly \n*2002-2009 Gareth Barker\n*2009- 2013 Nicholas Oaten\n*2013-2014 Yvonne Jones\n*2014- Elspeth Lewis\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n*[[David Lewis (lawyer)|David Lewis]] (1520-1584), the first Principal of [[Jesus College, Oxford]].\n*[[William Wroth]] (1576-1641), puritan and founder of the first [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Independent]] church in Wales.\n*[[David Lewis (Jesuit)|St. David Lewis]] (1616-1679), a Jesuit who was canonised in the Roman church in 1970.\n*[[William Jones (1755-1821)|William Jones]] (1755-1821), evangelical clergyman.\n*[[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]] (1918-2013), mathematician.\n*[[Raymond Williams]] (1921-1988), [[Marxism|Marxist]] critic.\n*[[John Osmond]] (b.1946), former director of the [[Institute of Welsh Affairs]].\n*[[List of musicians at Welsh cathedrals|Graham John Elliott]] (b. 1947), organist of St Asaph Cathedral and master of the music of Chelmsford Cathedral.\n*[[Penelope Fillon]] (b. 1956), wife of former Prime Minister of France, [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]].\n*[[Owen Sheers]] (b. 1974), poet.\n*[[Matthew Jay]] (1978-2003), musician.\n*[[Oliver Thornton]] (b. 1979), actor.\n*[[Becky James]] (b. 1991), cyclist.\n\n== Welsh government school banding ==\nWhen the Welsh government started grouping schools into five bands in 2011, the school was placed in Band 3, assessed on its performance in the academic year 2010-11.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-16504199|title=BBC reveals school banding scores}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2012 assessment this had fallen to Band 5. The year's figures brought the Government's banding system under severe criticism from teaching unions and opposition political parties. The results were described as being based on \"arbitrary and misleading\" figures and \"not credible\", \"crude\" and \"vague and confusing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20765907|title=Wales school banding is a failure, teaching unions claim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20772793|title=School banding: Welsh government school scores revealed}}</ref>\n\nThe school remained in Band 5 in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2013-12-12/banding-find-out-where-your-school-ranks/|title=Banding: Find out where your school ranks|last=|first=|date=12 December 2013|website=itv.com|publisher=|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 2015, the Welsh Government replaced the former number-based banding system with a more colourful approach. The school was rated 'amber', meaning \"in need of improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-31022924|title=School ratings: Amber|last=|first=|date=29 January 2015|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an assessment of 'adequate' by [[Estyn]] in 2015, Elspeth Lewis, headteacher, was quoted in the South Wales Argos saying, \"The report accurately reflects the current position of the school. But there has been a relentless focus on standards, teaching and learning and leadership over the past 18 months. As a school we have an accurate picture of where we are and are committed to further improving in each key area.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/11782354.School___s_priority_is_how_to_improve/|title=School\u2019s priority is how to improve - says head teacher of King Henry VIII Comprehensive in Abergavenny|last=Skelton|first=Katharine|date=10 February 2015|website=southwalesargus.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Motto ==\nThe school is associated with two separate mottos. For many centuries the school's motto had been 'that we shall be of service' (Latin: Ut Prosim), but it was decided that, for the sake of change, a new motto should be created. A brave new motto was found which encouraged reverence for then History teacher, Mr. Nelmes, and commanded the hugging of the off-green space towers which newly adorned the school's buildings.

By these, tithes assigned to local churches at [[Llanfihangel Crucorney]], [[Llanddewi Rhydderch]], [[Llanelen]], [[Llanddewi Skirrid]], [[Bryngwyn]] and [[Llanwenarth]] and belonging previously to the Benedictine priory were now given over to the new school. In addition a much richer prize, the tithes of [[Badgeworth]] in [[Gloucestershire]] which had previously belonged to [[Usk]] priory were given over to [[Abergavenny]]'s use. Finally the priory chapel of St. Mary's was to become the new parish church of Abergavenny and so the redundant church of St. John's could be used to house the new school.<ref name=\"VCH277\">Nelmes (1992), p. 3</ref>\n\nThe monies available from these tithes were to be put into trust controlled by \"the bailliffs and commonality\", the forerunners of the [[Town Council]]. It was to provide a [[Free Grammar School]] where [[Latin grammar]] was taught. The new grammar school was named after its benefactor [[Henry VIII]] who also appointed its first headmaster, Richard Oldsworthy. The school when it opened had 26 pupils, all boys aged between 7 and 14.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\n=== The connection with Jesus College, Oxford 1664\u20131887 ===\nThe first century of the school's life was uneventful and change only came as a result of financial mismanagement by the local trustees who had leased out the Badgeworth lands for an undervalued rent: when the 99-year lease came to an end in 1664 it passed to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], who in return provided not only an equal rent but a Fellowship and Scholarship to the college. This began the close connection between the school and the college which not only provided a home for many of its ablest pupils, but also provided the school with its headmasters.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\nAn Act of Parliament in 1760 reorganised the school's governance. Henceforth Jesus College, which had finally gained control of the Gloucester tithes, was responsible for paying the headmaster and his assistant. The Act did have some effect as the old school building was pulled down and replaced on site with the religious tower and fine Georgian master's house which still stands today. By the time of the headmastership of the Reverend William Morgan (1765\u201375) the school was flourishing with some 70-80 boys.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\">Nelmes (1992), p. 4</ref>\n\nChange began in the 1870s. The Headmaster, James Webber, reorganised the curriculum, teaching classics, maths, drawing, French, writing, divinity and arithmetic. He built two new classrooms within the confines of St. John's. By 1878, 73 pupils were being taught by three masters. By 1887 the charity commissioners had prepared a scheme to create a second grade commercial school, on a new site, and it was this proposition that resulted in the severing of the centuries-old links between the school and Jesus College.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\"/>\n\n=== A century of reorganisation 1891\u20131972 ===\nThe first attempt at reorganisation was the 1891 scheme which proposed the creation of a 200 pupil school on a 9-acre site on Pen-y-pound. Building of the school was delayed by many problems and was not completed until 1898 at a cost of \u00a36,945. The school at this time was supposed to be a grammar school taking pupils from all over North Monmouthshire with a curriculum of [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[French language|French]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Algebra]], [[Trigonometry]] and [[Chemistry]].<ref name=\"Nelmes5\">Nelmes (1992), p. 5</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s there was new building with three classrooms, a gym and a library. The Old Boys' Association was founded at a meeting on 7 November 1923 and was soon thriving, with branches of the Abergavenny Society in both [[London]] and [[Aberystwyth]]. By 1930 the school had 150 pupils. The new sciences of Physics and Biology were introduced in the period and the increased importance of metalwork and woodwork  led to the building of a handicrafts room.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nFollowing Butler's Education Act of 1944, [[Monmouthshire County Council]] put forward three options for Abergavenny: boys and girls grammar schools and a secondary modern school; a co-educational grammar school and a secondary modern school or a multilateral school. All three options were to be tried over the next 25 years.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nHarry Newcombe retired as headmaster in 1954. He had managed to gain the school a good reputation as a classical grammar school. The Local Education Authority issued a Statutory Notice on 21 September 1954 to set up a multilateral school of 850, the first stage of which would be the amalgamation of the Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools. Between 1954 and 1956 plans were laid by the authority for an enlarged mixed grammar school and finally provided for a school of 510 pupils with a 60 pupil sixth form.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\">Nelmes (1992), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe new school on the Old Hereford Road site was to be the first phase of the multilateral school, the present Upper school. It was to have an assembly hall, a gym and three floors of classrooms and practical rooms. Building was only begun in 1960 and so the school was not opened until 1963. It was to be made up of a total of 448 pupils from [[King Henry VIII Grammar School|King Henry VIII Boys Grammar School]], the Girls' Intermediate High School, St. John's Private school and the Convent school.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\"/>\n\nThe transition from mixed grammar to comprehensive school was carried out under the headmaster, Russell Edwards. This involved the building of a new school  adjoining the grammar school on the Pen-y-pound site. It also involved the incorporation of Grofield Secondary Modern School which had been established in 1947. Until the new building was completed in 1972 this required the juggling of both staff and pupils between the different sites. The new comprehensive kept the name of its predecessor. The old grammar school became the Upper School while the new building became the Lower School.<ref name=\"Nelmes 1992, p. 7\">Nelmes (1992), p. 7</ref>\n\n=== Recent History 1972\u2013 ===\nThe school with a planned population of 850 pupils when conceived in the 1940s had a peak population of 1825 pupils in 1983.  In 1983 as part of the International Year of Communications the school participated in a satellite quiz with Parramatta High School in New South Wales, Australia, which was celebrating its 70th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramatta-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/documents/31068011/31075365/Eighth%20Decade.pdf|title=A Brief History of Parramatta High School 1980 - 1990|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe school saw a sharp decline in numbers over the course of the 1980s, with 1200 pupils in 1990. Pupil numbers have remained broadly consistent over the following two decades.<ref name=\"Nelmes 1992, p. 7\"/>\n\n== School houses ==\nThe school originally had two houses Oppidan and Rustican, from the Latin for Town and Country. As the school grew, a new house structure was created based on four of [[Henry VIII]]'s wives: Aragon ([[Catherine of Aragon]]), Howard ([[Catherine Howard]]), Parr ([[Catherine Parr]]) and Seymour ([[Jane Seymour]]). These houses continue to compete at the annual [[Eisteddfod]]au and at sporting occasions.\n\n== Headmasters and head teachers ==\nThe known heads at the school since its founding are as follows:<ref>Nelmes (1992), p. 8</ref>\n\n*1542 Richard Oldsworthy\n*c.1626 Morgan Lewis\n*c.1631 Morris Hughes\n*1643-1661 Henry Vaughan\n*1661-1662 John Cragge\n*1662-1663 Thomas Franklyn\n*1663 Nicholas Billingsley\n*1670-1674 Richard Lucas\n*1674-1684 Henry Rogers\n*1702-1712 Morgan Lewis\n*1713-1716 Thomas Watkins\n*1716-1724 William Parry\n*1724-1732 William Thomas\n*1765-1775 William Morgan\n*1775-1786 Edmund Sandford\n*1786-1795 John George\n*1795-1800 Charles Powell\n*1800-1805 John Hughes\n*1805-1806 John Llewellyn\n*c.1821 Thomas Williams\n*1821-1823 Charles Hand\n*1823-1828 Aaron Rogers\n*1828-1832 Jenkin Hughes\n*1833-1834 James Jones\n*1834-1835 James Gabb\n*1835-1876 Henry Peake\n*1876-1898 James Webber\n*1898-1919 Headland Sifton\n*1919-1954 Harry Newcombe\n*1954-1960 Thomas Edwards\n*1960-1962 Harold Sharpe\n*1962-1968 Gilmour Isaac\n*1968 Leonard Porter\n*1969-1985 Russell Edwards\n*c.1985 Derek Fisher\n*c.1995 M Brierly \n*2002-2009 Gareth Barker\n*2009- 2013 Nicholas Oaten\n*2013-2014 Yvonne Jones\n*2014- Elspeth Lewis\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n*[[David Lewis (lawyer)|David Lewis]] (1520-1584), the first Principal of [[Jesus College, Oxford]].\n*[[William Wroth]] (1576-1641), puritan and founder of the first [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Independent]] church in Wales.\n*[[David Lewis (Jesuit)|St. David Lewis]] (1616-1679), a Jesuit who was canonised in the Roman church in 1970.\n*[[William Jones (1755-1821)|William Jones]] (1755-1821), evangelical clergyman.\n*[[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]] (1918-2013), mathematician.\n*[[Raymond Williams]] (1921-1988), [[Marxism|Marxist]] critic.\n*[[John Osmond]] (b.1946), former director of the [[Institute of Welsh Affairs]].\n*[[List of musicians at Welsh cathedrals|Graham John Elliott]] (b. 1947), organist of St Asaph Cathedral and master of the music of Chelmsford Cathedral.\n*[[Penelope Fillon]] (b. 1956), wife of former Prime Minister of France, [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]].\n*[[Owen Sheers]] (b. 1974), poet.\n*[[Matthew Jay]] (1978-2003), musician.\n*[[Oliver Thornton]] (b. 1979), actor.\n*[[Becky James]] (b. 1991), cyclist.\n\n== Welsh government school banding ==\nWhen the Welsh government started grouping schools into five bands in 2011, the school was placed in Band 3, assessed on its performance in the academic year 2010-11.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-16504199|title=BBC reveals school banding scores}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2012 assessment this had fallen to Band 5. The year's figures brought the Government's banding system under severe criticism from teaching unions and opposition political parties. The results were described as being based on \"arbitrary and misleading\" figures and \"not credible\", \"crude\" and \"vague and confusing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20765907|title=Wales school banding is a failure, teaching unions claim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20772793|title=School banding: Welsh government school scores revealed}}</ref>\n\nThe school remained in Band 5 in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2013-12-12/banding-find-out-where-your-school-ranks/|title=Banding: Find out where your school ranks|last=|first=|date=12 December 2013|website=itv.com|publisher=|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 2015, the Welsh Government replaced the former number-based banding system with a more colourful approach. The school was rated 'amber', meaning \"in need of improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-31022924|title=School ratings: Amber|last=|first=|date=29 January 2015|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an assessment of 'adequate' by [[Estyn]] in 2015, Elspeth Lewis, headteacher, was quoted in the South Wales Argos saying, \"The report accurately reflects the current position of the school. But there has been a relentless focus on standards, teaching and learning and leadership over the past 18 months. As a school we have an accurate picture of where we are and are committed to further improving in each key area.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/11782354.School___s_priority_is_how_to_improve/|title=School\u2019s priority is how to improve - says head teacher of King Henry VIII Comprehensive in Abergavenny|last=Skelton|first=Katharine|date=10 February 2015|website=southwalesargus.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Motto ==\nThe school is associated with two separate mottos. For many centuries the school's motto had been 'that we shall be of service' (Latin: Ut Prosim), but it was decided that, for the sake of change, a new motto should be created. A brave new motto was found which encouraged reverence for then History teacher, Mr. Nelmes, and commanded the hugging of the off-green space towers which newly adorned the school's buildings. That motto is \"Respecting tradition, embracing the future\".\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.kinghenryviiischool.org.uk/ Official Website]\n*[http://www.schooladmissions.co.uk/uk/King-Henry-VIII-School_6668.html School Admissions]\n*[http://www.estyn.gov.uk/inspection_reports/KingHenryVIII_Sec_05.pdf Estyn report on King Henry from 2005]\n*[http://www.estyn.gov.uk/english/provider/6794064/ Estyn report on King Henry from 2011]\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-16504199 BBC news report on Welsh Government School Bandings]\n\n== References ==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Nelmes|first=G.V.|authorlink=G.V.

Therefore, they came to be known as \"Moriyas\", literally, \"belonging to the place of peacocks\". According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (\"Moriya-city\"), which was so called, because it was built with the \"bricks coloured like peacocks' necks\".{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=14}}\n\nThe dynasty's connection to the peacocks, as mentioned in the Buddhist and Jain traditions, seems to be corroborated by archaeological evidence. For example, peacock figures are found on the [[Lauria Nandangarh#Pillar of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar at Nandangarh]] and several sculptures on the Great Stupa of [[Sanchi]]. Based on this evidence, modern scholars theorize that the peacock may have been the dynasty's emblem.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=15}}\n\nSome later authors, such as Dhundiraja (a commentator on the ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'') and an annotator of the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',state that the word \"Maurya\" is derived from Mura, the name of the wife of a Nanda king and the mother (or grandmother) of the first Maurya king. However, the Puranas themselves make no mention of Mura and do not talk of any relation between the Nanda and the Maurya dynasties.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=140}} Dhundiraja's derivation of the word seems to be his own invention: according to the Sanskrit rules, the derivative of the feminine name Mura ([[IAST]]: Mur\u0101) would be \"Maureya\"; the term \"Maurya\" can only be derived from the masculine \"Mura\".{{sfn|R.

On one hand, a number of ancient Indian accounts, such as the drama ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' (''Signet ring of Rakshasa'' \u2013 ''Rakshasa'' was the prime minister of Magadha) by [[Vishakhadatta]], describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the Nanda family. A kshatriya clan known as the Mauryas are referred to in the earliest [[Buddhist texts]], [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]. However, any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence. Chandragupta first emerges in Greek accounts as \"Sandrokottos\". As a young man he is said to have met Alexander.<ref>:\"Androcottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth.\" Plutarch 62-3 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&layout=&loc=62.1 Plutarch 62-3]</ref> He is also said to have met the Nanda king, angered him, and made a narrow escape.<ref>:\"He was of humble Indian to a change of rule.\" Justin XV.4.15 \"Fuit hic humili quidem genere natus, sed ad regni potestatem maiestate numinis inpulsus.

A battle was announced and the Magadhan army was drawn from the city to a distant battlefield to engage with Maurya's forces. Maurya's general and spies meanwhile bribed the corrupt general of Nanda. He also managed to create an atmosphere of civil war in the kingdom, which culminated in the death of the heir to the throne. Chanakya managed to win over popular sentiment. Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha.

As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (262\u2013261&nbsp;BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Ashoka used Kalinga to project power over a large region by building a fortification there and securing it as a possession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|last=Allchin|first=F.R.|last2=Erdosy|first2=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|location=Cambridge|pages=306}}</ref> Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of [[Buddhism]], and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAshoka implemented principles of ''[[ahimsa]]'' by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40&nbsp;years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as [[Afghanistan]] and as far south as Andhra ([[Nellore District]]), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and one in both Greek and [[Aramaic]]. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, [[Kambojas]], and [[Gandhara]]s as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world at the time such as ''Amtiyoko'' ([[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]), ''Tulamaya'' ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]), ''Amtikini'' ([[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]]), ''Maka'' ([[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]]) and ''Alikasudaro'' ([[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \"600 yojanas away\" (a yojanas being about 7&nbsp;miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000&nbsp;miles).<ref>[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, translation S. Dhammika.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nAshoka was followed for 50&nbsp;years by a succession of weaker kings. He was succeeded by [[Dasharatha Maurya]], who was Ashoka's grandson. None of Ashoka's sons could ascend the throne after him. Mahendra, his first born, was on to spread [[Buddhism]] in the world. [[Kunala|Kunala Maurya]] was blind hence couldn't ascend the throne and Tivala, son of Kaurwaki, died even earlier than Ashoka. Another son, Jalauka, does not have much story behind him.\n\nThe empire lost many territories under Dasharatha, which were later reconquered by [[Samprati]], Kunala's son. Post Samprati, the Mauryas slowly lost many territories. In 180 BCE, [[Brihadratha Maurya]], was killed by his general [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] in a military parade without any heir. Hence, the great Maurya empire finally ended, giving rise to the [[Shunga Empire]].\n\n====Shunga coup (185&nbsp;BCE)====\nBuddhist records such as the [[Ashokavadana]] write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for [[Buddhists]],<ref>According to the [[Ashokavadana]]</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Sir John Marshall]],<ref>Sir John Marshall, \"A Guide to Sanchi\", Eastern Book House, 1990, {{ISBN|81-85204-32-2}}, pg.38</ref> Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]<ref>E. Lamotte: History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958)</ref> and [[Romila Thapar]],<ref>A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref> among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\n\n====Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180&nbsp;BCE)====\n{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the [[Khyber Pass]] unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180&nbsp;BCE, forming the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, [[Menander I|Menander]], became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of [[Sialkot]]. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]s, [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]s are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed [[Indo-Scythians]], brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70&nbsp;BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at [[Pataliputra]]. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are [[Tosali]] (in the east), [[Ujjain]] (in the west), [[Suvarnagiri]] (in the south), and [[Taxila]] (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the ''Kumara'' (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The ''kumara'' was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his ''Mantriparishad'' (Council of Ministers).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]]: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade.

The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the ''Arthashastra''. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The [[Khyber Pass]], on the modern boundary of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the [[Malay peninsula]] into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to [[corporation]]s. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204000202/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 |date=4 February 2016 }} [[University of Michigan]].</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|align=center colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Maurya Empire coinage'''\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.jpg|Hoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\nFile:MauryanCoin.JPG|Silver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.jpg|Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan Empire.

Chandragupta was a disciple of the Jain monk [[Bhadrabahu|Acharya Bhadrabahu]].

Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the [[Kalinga War]], he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] and daughter [[Sanghamitta]] to [[Sri Lanka]], whose king [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Tissa]] was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to [[West Asia]], [[Greece]] and [[South East Asia]], and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]], and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[North Asia]] including [[Siberia]]. Ashoka helped convene the [[Buddhist Councils|Third Buddhist Council]] of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46</ref>\n\n==Architectural remains==\n{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Sanchi Stupa|Mauryan art}}\n[[File:Barabar Caves 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Mauryan architecture in the [[Barabar Caves]].

Excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace, which is thought to have been an group of several buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about {{formatnum:{{#expr:9.75-2.74 round 0}}}} meters high. According to the eyewitness account of [[Megasthenes]], the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p23</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}} Kau\u1e6dilya's [[Arthashastra]] also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[stupa]], 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side.

The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture.  Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several [[stupas]], which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Bodhgaya]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]]. The most widespread examples of Mauryan architecture are the [[Ashoka pillar]]s and carved edicts of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p22</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe peacock was a dynastic symbol of Mauryans, as depicted by Ashoka's pillars at Nandangarh and Sanchi Stupa.{{sfn|R.

For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also [[War elephants|battle-elephants]]; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of [[Alexander]]'s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests''.<ref name=\"IWH4\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|On the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The Office of the Chief Elephant Forester should with the help of guards protect the elephants in any terrain. The slaying of an elephant is punishable by death.|[[Arthashastra]]}}\n\nThe Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers for skins. Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or ''aranyaca'' to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.<ref name=\"IWH5\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 8.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} to advocate [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king's example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:<ref name=\"IWH5\"/>\n{{quote|Our king killed very few animals.|[[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict on Fifth Pillar]]}}\n\nHowever, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.<ref name=\"IWH5\"/>\n\n==Contacts with the Hellenistic world==\n[[File:MauryanRingstone.JPG|thumb|Mauryan ringstone, with standing goddess.

In the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edicts of Ashoka]], some of them inscribed in Greek, Ashoka states that the Greeks within his dominion were converted to Buddhism:\n:<blockquote>\"Here in the king's dominion among the [[Yona|Greeks]], the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhras]] and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].\" [[Edicts of Ashoka|(Rock Edict Number 13]])</blockquote>[[File:Ashoka Rock Edicts Shahbazgarhi by Nisar.JPG|thumb|An Edict of Ashoka in Shahbazbarhi, KPK, Pakistan.]]<blockquote>\"Now, in times past (officers) called [[Mahamatras]] of morality did not exist before. Mahdmatras of morality were appointed by me (when I had been) anointed thirteen years. These are occupied with all sects in establishing morality, in promoting morality, and for the welfare and happiness of those who are devoted to morality (even) among the [[Yona|Greeks]], [[Kambojas]] and [[Gandharas]], and whatever other western borderers (of mine there are).\" ([[Major Rock Edicts|Rock Edict Number 5]])</blockquote>\n\n[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kandahar Edict of Ashoka]], a bilingual edict ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by king Ashoka, from [[Kandahar]]. [[Kabul]] Museum. (Click image for translation).]]\nFragments of Edict 13 have been found in Greek, and a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic, has been discovered in [[Kandahar]]. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word [[Eusebeia]] (\"[[Piety]]\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \"[[Dharma]]\" of his other Edicts written in [[Prakrit]]:{{npsn|date=August 2016}}\n:\"Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (''\u03b5\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1'', [[Eusebeia]]) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting. And if some (were) intemperate, they have ceased from their intemperance as was in their power; and obedient to their father and mother and to the elders, in opposition to the past also in the future, by so acting on every occasion, they will live better and more happily\".

[[Antiochos III]], the [[Seleucid]] king, after having made peace with [[Euthydemus II|Euthydemus]] in [[Bactria]], went to India in 206&nbsp;BCE and is said to have renewed his friendship with the Indian king there:\n\n\"He (Antiochus) crossed the Caucasus and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him\".

Therefore, they came to be known as \"Moriyas\", literally, \"belonging to the place of peacocks\". According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (\"Moriya-city\"), which was so called, because it was built with the \"bricks coloured like peacocks' necks\".{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=14}}\n\nThe dynasty's connection to the peacocks, as mentioned in the Buddhist and Jain traditions, seems to be corroborated by archaeological evidence. For example, peacock figures are found on the [[Lauria Nandangarh#Pillar of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar at Nandangarh]] and several sculptures on the Great Stupa of [[Sanchi]]. Based on this evidence, modern scholars theorize that the peacock may have been the dynasty's emblem.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=15}}\n\nSome later authors, such as Dhundiraja (a commentator on the ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'') and an annotator of the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',state that the word \"Maurya\" is derived from Mura, the name of the wife of a Nanda king and the mother (or grandmother) of the first Maurya king. However, the Puranas themselves make no mention of Mura and do not talk of any relation between the Nanda and the Maurya dynasties.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=140}} Dhundiraja's derivation of the word seems to be his own invention: according to the Sanskrit rules, the derivative of the feminine name Mura ([[IAST]]: Mur\u0101) would be \"Maureya\"; the term \"Maurya\" can only be derived from the masculine \"Mura\".{{sfn|R.

On one hand, a number of ancient Indian accounts, such as the drama ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' (''Signet ring of Rakshasa'' \u2013 ''Rakshasa'' was the prime minister of Magadha) by [[Vishakhadatta]], describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the Nanda family. A kshatriya clan known as the Mauryas are referred to in the earliest [[Buddhist texts]], [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]. However, any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence. Chandragupta first emerges in Greek accounts as \"Sandrokottos\". As a young man he is said to have met Alexander.<ref>:\"Androcottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth.\" Plutarch 62-3 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&layout=&loc=62.1 Plutarch 62-3]</ref> He is also said to have met the Nanda king, angered him, and made a narrow escape.<ref>:\"He was of humble Indian to a change of rule.\" Justin XV.4.15 \"Fuit hic humili quidem genere natus, sed ad regni potestatem maiestate numinis inpulsus.

A battle was announced and the Magadhan army was drawn from the city to a distant battlefield to engage with Maurya's forces. Maurya's general and spies meanwhile bribed the corrupt general of Nanda. He also managed to create an atmosphere of civil war in the kingdom, which culminated in the death of the heir to the throne. Chanakya managed to win over popular sentiment. Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha.

As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (262\u2013261&nbsp;BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Ashoka used Kalinga to project power over a large region by building a fortification there and securing it as a possession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|last=Allchin|first=F.R.|last2=Erdosy|first2=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|location=Cambridge|pages=306}}</ref> Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of [[Buddhism]], and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAshoka implemented principles of ''[[ahimsa]]'' by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40&nbsp;years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as [[Afghanistan]] and as far south as Andhra ([[Nellore District]]), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and one in both Greek and [[Aramaic]]. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, [[Kambojas]], and [[Gandhara]]s as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world at the time such as ''Amtiyoko'' ([[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]), ''Tulamaya'' ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]), ''Amtikini'' ([[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]]), ''Maka'' ([[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]]) and ''Alikasudaro'' ([[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \"600 yojanas away\" (a yojanas being about 7&nbsp;miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000&nbsp;miles).<ref>[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, translation S. Dhammika.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nAshoka was followed for 50&nbsp;years by a succession of weaker kings. He was succeeded by [[Dasharatha Maurya]], who was Ashoka's grandson. None of Ashoka's sons could ascend the throne after him. Mahendra, his first born, was on to spread [[Buddhism]] in the world. [[Kunala|Kunala Maurya]] was blind hence couldn't ascend the throne and Tivala, son of Kaurwaki, died even earlier than Ashoka. Another son, Jalauka, does not have much story behind him.\n\nThe empire lost many territories under Dasharatha, which were later reconquered by [[Samprati]], Kunala's son. Post Samprati, the Mauryas slowly lost many territories. In 180 BCE, [[Brihadratha Maurya]], was killed by his general [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] in a military parade without any heir. Hence, the great Maurya empire finally ended, giving rise to the [[Shunga Empire]].\n\n====Shunga coup (185&nbsp;BCE)====\nBuddhist records such as the [[Ashokavadana]] write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for [[Buddhists]],<ref>According to the [[Ashokavadana]]</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Sir John Marshall]],<ref>Sir John Marshall, \"A Guide to Sanchi\", Eastern Book House, 1990, {{ISBN|81-85204-32-2}}, pg.38</ref> Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]<ref>E. Lamotte: History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958)</ref> and [[Romila Thapar]],<ref>A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref> among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\n\n====Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180&nbsp;BCE)====\n{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the [[Khyber Pass]] unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180&nbsp;BCE, forming the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, [[Menander I|Menander]], became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of [[Sialkot]]. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]s, [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]s are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed [[Indo-Scythians]], brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70&nbsp;BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at [[Pataliputra]]. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are [[Tosali]] (in the east), [[Ujjain]] (in the west), [[Suvarnagiri]] (in the south), and [[Taxila]] (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the ''Kumara'' (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The ''kumara'' was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his ''Mantriparishad'' (Council of Ministers).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]]: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade.

The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the ''Arthashastra''. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The [[Khyber Pass]], on the modern boundary of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the [[Malay peninsula]] into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to [[corporation]]s. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204000202/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 |date=4 February 2016 }} [[University of Michigan]].</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|align=center colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Maurya Empire coinage'''\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.jpg|Hoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\nFile:MauryanCoin.JPG|Silver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.jpg|Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan Empire.

Chandragupta was a disciple of the Jain monk [[Bhadrabahu|Acharya Bhadrabahu]].

Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the [[Kalinga War]], he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] and daughter [[Sanghamitta]] to [[Sri Lanka]], whose king [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Tissa]] was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to [[West Asia]], [[Greece]] and [[South East Asia]], and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]], and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[North Asia]] including [[Siberia]]. Ashoka helped convene the [[Buddhist Councils|Third Buddhist Council]] of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46</ref>\n\n==Architectural remains==\n{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Sanchi Stupa|Mauryan art}}\n[[File:Barabar Caves 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Mauryan architecture in the [[Barabar Caves]].

Excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace, which is thought to have been an group of several buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about {{formatnum:{{#expr:9.75-2.74 round 0}}}} meters high. According to the eyewitness account of [[Megasthenes]], the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p23</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}} Kau\u1e6dilya's [[Arthashastra]] also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[stupa]], 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side.

The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture.  Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several [[stupas]], which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Bodhgaya]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]]. The most widespread examples of Mauryan architecture are the [[Ashoka pillar]]s and carved edicts of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p22</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe peacock was a dynastic symbol of Mauryans, as depicted by Ashoka's pillars at Nandangarh and Sanchi Stupa.{{sfn|R.

For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also [[War elephants|battle-elephants]]; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of [[Alexander]]'s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests''.<ref name=\"IWH4\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|On the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The Office of the Chief Elephant Forester should with the help of guards protect the elephants in any terrain. The slaying of an elephant is punishable by death.|[[Arthashastra]]}}\n\nThe Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers for skins. Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or ''aranyaca'' to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.<ref name=\"IWH5\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 8.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} to advocate [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king's example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:<ref name=\"IWH5\"/>\n{{quote|Our king killed very few animals.|[[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict on Fifth Pillar]]}}\n\nHowever, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.<ref name=\"IWH5\"/>\n\n==Contacts with the Hellenistic world==\n[[File:MauryanRingstone.JPG|thumb|Mauryan ringstone, with standing goddess.

It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word [[Eusebeia]] (\"[[Piety]]\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \"[[Dharma]]\" of his other Edicts written in [[Prakrit]]:{{npsn|date=August 2016}}\n:\"Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (''\u03b5\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1'', [[Eusebeia]]) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting.

{"title_page": "Memory conformity", "text_new": "The present study examined whether the degree to which participants engage in '''memory conformity''', which occurs when a person alters their memory report of an event to be consistent with another person, can be predicted by their levels of interrogative suggestibility (IS), which is the degree to which people are susceptible to altering their memory reports during questioning. Memory conformity was introduced by having participant and confederate pairs study words and then complete a social recognition test where they took turns to make judgements to the same items. When the participants responded after the confederate, they tended to conform to confederate's judgements regardless of whether the confederate had made a correct or incorrect response. IS was measured using the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale 2. This scale allows separate measures of Yield, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to altering their memory reports of events as a result of leading questions, and Shift, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to changing responses to questions when placed under pressure to do so. Only Yield was a significant predictor of memory conformity.\nSocial contamination of false memory can be exemplified in prominent in situations involving social interactions, such as [[eyewitness testimony]].<ref name=\"Valentine\">{{cite journal|last=Valentine|first=Tim|author2=Maras, Katie|year=2011|title=The effect of cross-examination on the accuracy of adult eyewitness testimony|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=554\u2013561|doi=10.1002/acp.1768}}</ref><ref name=Gabbert /><ref name=Luus /> Research on memory conformity has revealed that such [[suggestibility]] and errors with source monitoring has far reaching consequences, with important legal and social implications.

These sources tend to be one's own experience with others and the world, or their own imagination and dreams. Specific and vivid details within each of these helps determine which of the possibilities is the most probable source. For one\u2019s outer experience, these details usually involve the setting and events that occurred around that time. These are then contrasted with other events that have occurred in the past to judge what the source could have been. Personal, concrete experiences are often more vivid and have more detail than imagined experiences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampinen|first=James Michael|title=Memory 101|last2=Beike|first2=Denise R.|date=November 2014|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-0924-8|location=New York, NY|doi=10.1891/9780826109255}}</ref> Noticing the difference between details and vivid details can help to determine whether a piece of information came from experience or the imagination.\n\nSource monitoring has a relationship with the frontal lobe of the brain, which is the region of the brain that uses judgment to make decisions.

There are not enough differences to permit a strong enough distinction between the two. This can lead to false attributions when working in relation to sources.

Some photos contained images of an accomplice, while others did not. Immediately after seeing these photographs, participants were asked about the presence of an accomplice in the photographs, as well as their level of confidence in their reports. Initial reports were highly accurate, but after being placed in pairs where each person had seen a slightly different photograph, this pattern changed.

In almost every case, the less confident person in the pair accepted the more confident person's memory as the correct one.<ref name=Wright />\n\nInternal confidence at the time of memory encoding also affects general social confidence levels. An individual's reliance on another person's memory is constantly changing as the initial encoder takes into account the conditions under which he/she first perceived the event, as well as the conditions (or believed conditions) under which another individual perceived that event.<ref name=\"Allan and Midjord\" /> One study showed that levels of memory conformity between individuals varied based on confidence in the comparative quality of initial viewing conditions.

The presence of dissenters works to decrease the overall group certainty and group unity, which decreases social conformity among group members, thus increasing individual internal reliance.<ref name=Walther/> Research suggests that the clarity of a participant's recollection of a memory plays a role in within-group recollection: as clarity and internal confidence increase, the pressure to conform to the group decreases.

Memory conformity was introduced by having participant and confederate pairs study words and then complete a social recognition test where they took turns to make judgements to the same items. When the participants responded after the confederate, they tended to conform to confederate's judgements regardless of whether the confederate had made a correct or incorrect response. IS was measured using the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale 2. This scale allows separate measures of Yield, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to altering their memory reports of events as a result of leading questions, and Shift, which is a measure of how susceptible people are to changing responses to questions when placed under pressure to do so. Only Yield was a significant predictor of memory conformity.\nSocial contamination of false memory can be exemplified in prominent in situations involving social interactions, such as [[eyewitness testimony]].<ref name=\"Valentine\">{{cite journal|last=Valentine|first=Tim|author2=Maras, Katie|year=2011|title=The effect of cross-examination on the accuracy of adult eyewitness testimony|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=554\u2013561|doi=10.1002/acp.1768}}</ref><ref name=Gabbert /><ref name=Luus /> Research on memory conformity has revealed that such [[suggestibility]] and errors with source monitoring has far reaching consequences, with important legal and social implications.

The witnesses discussed the scene with each other while in the room, contrary to what they were told to do. The specific descriptions the witnesses gave about the perpetrator upon leaving the room were influenced by each other, causing the police to collect false information about the perpetrator while initially searching for him or her. The perpetrator, [[Mijailo Mijailovic]], was caught on camera and did not match the descriptions that the eyewitnesses gave.

These sources tend to be one's own experience with others and the world, or their own imagination and dreams. Specific and vivid details within each of these helps determine which of the possibilities is the most probable source. For one\u2019s outer experience, these details usually involve the setting and events that occurred around that time. These are then contrasted with other events that have occurred in the past to judge what the source could have been. Personal, concrete experiences are often more vivid and have more detail than imagined experiences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampinen|first=James Michael|title=Memory 101|last2=Beike|first2=Denise R.|date=November 2014|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-0924-8|location=New York, NY|doi=10.1891/9780826109255}}</ref> Noticing the difference between details and vivid details can help to determine whether a piece of information came from experience or the imagination.\n\nSource monitoring has a relationship with the frontal lobe of the brain, which is the region of the brain that uses judgment to make decisions. The hippocampal region of the brain, involved with memory, is highly used when retrieving information from external events.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hallucinations in psychoses and affective disorders : a clinical and biological approach|others=Brambilla, Paolo,, Mauri, Massimo Carlo,, Altamura, Alfredo Carlo|isbn=978-3-319-75124-5|location=Cham|oclc=1052566803}}</ref> After having recalled a memory or piece of information with the help of the hippocampus, the brain uses its judgment abilities within the prefrontal cortex to determine whether it was received by a specific source or another.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brainerd, Charles J.|title=The science of false memory|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Reyna, Valerie F., 1955-|isbn=978-0-19-803504-6|location=New York|oclc=61341505}}</ref>\n\n'''Source monitoring errors''' is another mechanism underlying memory conformity. A source-monitoring error can lead to an incorrect internal attribution of a memory (the belief that a memory was made from first-hand experience), when in reality that information had an external source (someone else relayed the information).<ref name=\"Revlin\">{{cite book|title=Human Cognition : Theory and Practice.|last=Revlin|first=Russell|publisher=Worth Pub|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7167-5667-5|location=New York, NY|pages=185\u2013186}}</ref> When a piece of information or a memory of an event has similar qualities to that of another, it is possible that the information is confused and stored incorrectly. There are not enough differences to permit a strong enough distinction between the two. This can lead to false attributions when working in relation to sources. For example, when two men were speaking in a previous situation, it may be more difficult to recall which of them presented a specific piece of information when compared to one man and one woman speaking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the psychology of aging|others=Schaie, K.

Some photos contained images of an accomplice, while others did not. Immediately after seeing these photographs, participants were asked about the presence of an accomplice in the photographs, as well as their level of confidence in their reports. Initial reports were highly accurate, but after being placed in pairs where each person had seen a slightly different photograph, this pattern changed. Seventy-five percent of the pairs exhibited memory conformity, with one half of the dyad conforming to the other. In almost every case, the less confident person in the pair accepted the more confident person's memory as the correct one.<ref name=Wright />\n\nInternal confidence at the time of memory encoding also affects general social confidence levels. An individual's reliance on another person's memory is constantly changing as the initial encoder takes into account the conditions under which he/she first perceived the event, as well as the conditions (or believed conditions) under which another individual perceived that event.<ref name=\"Allan and Midjord\" /> One study showed that levels of memory conformity between individuals varied based on confidence in the comparative quality of initial viewing conditions.

The presence of dissenters works to decrease the overall group certainty and group unity, which decreases social conformity among group members, thus increasing individual internal reliance.<ref name=Walther/> Research suggests that the clarity of a participant's recollection of a memory plays a role in within-group recollection: as clarity and internal confidence increase, the pressure to conform to the group decreases. The same research goes on to show that false reports from confederates within a group influence participants more heavily when they are not confident in the accuracy of their memories than when they are internally confident in the accuracy of their memories.<ref name=Walther />\n\n===Social anxiety===\n\nResearchers report [[social anxiety]] as having two significant components: fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. It has been suggested that people with a fear of negative evaluation are more likely to be influenced by their peers, while those with a tendency for social avoidance are less likely to be influenced by their peers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = D.B. | last2 = London | first2 = K | last3 = Waechter | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Social anxiety moderates memory conformity in adolescents | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 7| pages = 1034\u20131045 | doi=10.1002/acp.1604}}</ref> The individuals concerned with negative evaluation are more likely to comply, as disagreeing with their peers is seen as having a higher cost than the cost of being wrong.

R., Rattner, A., & Sagarina, E. (1996). ''Convicted but innocent: Wrongful conviction and public policy.''  London: Sage.</ref>  Eyewitnesses can encounter post-event information after witnessing a crime.  Post-event information comes in three basic types, the first of which is due to the impact that a biased or [[leading question]] can have on altering an eyewitness's memory of the event.<ref name=\"Loftus 1975\">{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth F|title=Leading questions and the eyewitness report|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1975|volume=7|issue=4|pages=560\u2013572|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(75)90023-7}}</ref> The second type occurs when the eyewitness is retold the events that they witnessed.<ref name=\"Wright and Stroud\">{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Daniel B.|author2=Stroud, Joanne N.|title=Memory quality and misinformation for peripheral and central objects|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=1998|volume=3|issue=2|pages=273\u2013286|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8333.1998.tb00366.x}}</ref> False information included within the retelling is often incorporated into the eyewitness's memories, thus altering their perception of the events that occurred. The third type of post-event information originates from conversations with others.  Recent research has shown that there is a critical period for eyewitnesses that occurs before they get to report their side of the story.<ref name=\"Schwartz and Wright\">{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Shari L.|author2=Wright, Daniel B.|title=Memory Conformity for New and Old Items with Immediate and Delayed Testing|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|volume=26|issue=4|pages=508\u2013515|doi=10.1002/acp.2820}}</ref>  During this time, they are most susceptible to outside influences contaminating their version of the events.\n\nThe effects of witness discussion on memory are even more enhanced when the witnesses know each other well. People are more likely to believe information, regardless of whether it is true or false, when it comes from someone they know\u2014say, a friend or significant other.<ref name=\"Gabbert Court Review2\"/>  Such a person could be viewed with more credibility than a stranger for a variety of reasons, including a greater trust and familiarity in the relationship.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite journal|last=French|first=Lauren|author2=Garry, Maryanne|author3=Mori, Kazuo|year=2008|title=You say tomato? Collaborative remembering leads to more false memories for intimate couples than for strangers|journal=Memory|volume=16|issue=3|pages=262\u2013273|doi=10.1080/09658210701801491|pmid=18324551}}</ref>  This kind of pattern falls under a larger trend that the perceived credibility of the person providing external information has significant influence over memory conformity.<ref name=Horry />\n\nThe way in which witnesses retrieve memory is also an important factor in the likelihood of an individual expressing memory conformity. Studies have shown that when participants were asked to discuss their memories of a violent crime video in terms of their emotions, they had higher levels of subjectivity and major errors in free recall.<ref name=Marsh>{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=Elizabeth J.|author2=Tversky, Barbara |author3=Hutson, Michael |title=How eyewitnesses talk about events: implications for memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=531\u2013544|doi=10.1002/acp.1095}}</ref>\n\nOne of [[The Seven Sins of Memory|the seven sins of memory]] is suggestibility. Interaction with other people changes the pool of information that one has about an event and can sway one's thoughts on how the event actually unfolded.<ref name=Wright />  This suggestibility seems to be the most common way in which post-event information distortion occurs in a legal setting because often, witnesses cannot be prevented from talking to one another. That said, there are multiple factors that affect the potential for suggestibility in a witness. More accurate memories are also less susceptible to memory conformity than less accurate ones.<ref name=\"Wright and Villalba\" />  This finding is important for legal situations because it may be logically deduced that a witness with a more accurate memory of the event in question will be less likely to change his or her story after discussing it with other witnesses, and someone with a less accurate recollection could be more prone to conform.<ref name=\"Wright and Villalba\" />\n\n===Everyday implications===\nFalse [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical memories]] can also occur over time.  In a recent study, 43% of subjects remembered a childhood event that they never actually experienced.<ref name=\"Wade, K. 2005\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wade | first1 = K. | last2 = Garry | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Strategies for verifying false autobiographical memories | url = | journal = The American Journal of Psychology | volume = 118 | issue = 4| pages = 587\u2013602 | pmid = 16402747 }}</ref>  These naturally occurring autobiographical memories can span a large temporal range, from recent events to childhood memories.  These memories also contain weak perceptual detail, which makes them similar to real childhood memories and thus more believable to the person.<ref name=\"Wade, K. 2005\"/>\n\nFirst-born children are also more likely than their later-born siblings to dominate a discussion and encounter conformity errors.<ref name=Becker>{{cite journal|last=Becker|first=Selwyn W.|author2=Lerner, Melvin J. |author3=Carroll, Jean |title=Conformity as a function of birth order and type of group pressure: A verification|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1966|volume=3|issue=2|pages=242\u2013244|doi=10.1037/h0022894|pmid=5903534}}</ref> In one study, later-born children were more influenced if they had reason to believe that the information given to them was more valid then the information they themselves possessed.  First-born children were relatively unaffected by informational value and were more influenced by their motivation to either go along with or to resist the expectations of the majority.<ref name=\"Becker\"/>\n\nDiscussion of memory conformity is also particularly relevant in today's age of mass advertisement. Research suggests that our predisposition to trust the judgment of a group can be affected by political campaigns and advertising, and even work to alter personal beliefs.<ref name=\"Edelson and sharot\">{{cite journal|last=Edelson|first=M.|author2=Sharot, T. |author3=Dolan, R.

The same work has shown that individuals can outwardly conform by seeming to support a group's beliefs or decisions (public conformity), but without the private conformity and the subsequent neurological changes.<ref name=\"Edelson and sharot\" />\n\n===Potential benefits===\n\nAnalyses of memory conformity typically focus entirely on its negative consequences, such as witness memory distortion; however, there are some benefits to memory conformity. In fact, some psychologists posit that memory conformity more often results in positive outcomes than negative ones.<ref name=\"Wright and Villalba\">{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Daniel B.|author2=Villalba, Daniella K.|title=Memory conformity affects inaccurate memories more than accurate memories|journal=Memory|year=2012|volume=20|issue=3|pages=254\u2013265|doi=10.1080/09658211.2012.654798|pmid=22364195}}</ref>   When an individual is not confident in the information he or she alone possesses (high subjective uncertainty), reverting to external sources for help usually has no greater potential for an inaccurate memory report than sticking with the original, shaky memory.

[[Bharat Electronics]] (BEL) will implement this order in 2009.\n\n==Ships of the class==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Pennant \n!Homeport\n!Launched\n!Commissioned\n!Status\n|-\n| {{INS|Deepak|A50|6}} || A50  || [[Karwar]] || 12 February 2010 || 21 January 2011<ref name=\"toi2\" /> || Commissioned\n|-\n| {{INS|Shakti|A57|6}} || A57 || [[Visakhapatnam]] || 11 October 2010 || 1 October 2011<ref>[http://www.fincantieri.it/cms/data/browse/news/000381.aspx Shakti for Indian Navy launched at Sestri Ponenete (Genova)]</ref> || Commissioned \n|}\n\nOn 12 February 2010, the first ship of the class {{INS|Deepak|A50|6}} was launched.
