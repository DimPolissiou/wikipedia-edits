Smith]], John E. Hazzard, [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] and [[Jerome Kern]], and additional music by Henry Kailimai. The story was based on the [[farce]] ''Over Night'' by Bartholomae.<ref>Green and Green, p. 23</ref> The [[Farce|farcical]] plot concerns three couples and a sex-crazed voice teacher who board a [[Hudson River]] Day Line boat in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], New York. Chaos ensues when two of the couples cross paths and accidentally trade partners.

Cohan]]'s shows, the [[operettas]] of [[Victor Herbert]], and the spectacular [[revue]]s of [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].  But as Cohan's and Herbert's creative output waned, new creative talent was being nurtured on Broadway, including Jerome Kern, [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Sigmund Romberg]].  Kern began by revising British musicals to suit American audiences, adding songs that \"have a timeless, distinctly American sound that redefined the Broadway showtune.\"<ref name=Kenrick>[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]].

Kern and Bolton's first Princess Theatre musical was ''Nobody's Home'' (1915), an adaptation of a London show called ''Mr. Popple of Ippleton''.  ''Very Good Eddie'' was their second.<ref name=Kenrick/>\n\nThis was followed by an even bigger hit in 1917, ''[[Oh, Boy! (musical)|Oh, Boy!]]'' and several others, all featuring modern American settings and simple scene changes (one set for each act) to more aptly suit the small theatre, eschewing operetta traditions of foreign locales and elaborate scenery.<ref name=Bloom/> In ''Very Good Eddie'', guests have names like Gay Anne Giddy, Fullern A.

Alterations were made and many songs were added for the 1975 revival version.\n\n=== Act I ===\nThe [[Hudson River]] Day Line boat \"The Catskill\" is under way on a summer day (\u201cWe\u2019re on Our Way\u201d). The boat stops for fifteen minutes at [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]], New York. Dick Rivers comes aboard and tells Victoria Lake and the girls that he has fallen in love with Elsie Lilly, the star pupil of the great voice teacher Madame [[Dynamics (music)|Matroppo]] (\u201cThe Same Old Game\u201d). To be alone with Elsie, he persuades Madame Matroppo to let him interview her pupil for a magazine article. Elsie is not easily wooed. She tells Dick that she used to be engaged to a man named Eddie. She has heard that Dick is always in love with the next girl he meets (\u201cSome Sort of Somebody\u201d).\n\nAfter some arguing, newlyweds Eddie and Georgina Kettle board the boat. Eddie is much smaller than Georgina and she treats him like an infant. Georgina asks Eddie if he has been in love before her, and he says he used to have an affair with a girl named Elsie. Then two other honeymooners, Percy and Elsie Darling enter. In this relationship, Percy belittles Elsie. As the couples run into each other, Eddie and Percy turn out to be college friends. The couples rejoice (\u201cIsn't it Great to Be Married\u201d).\n\nGeorgina and Percy get off the boat and leave Eddie and Elsie Darling behind. Georgina has to find Eddie's missing luggage, and Percy needs to send a telegram. The boat suddenly leaves, and Eddie and Elsie have no idea what to do without their partners. They decide to get off at the next stop and attempt to make their way back to their partners. When they decide to eat, they realize they don't have any money. Eddie sees his acquaintance Dick Rivers and decides to ask him for some money. Eddie pretends that Elsie Darling is his bride so that Dick will give him 20 dollars as a honeymoon gift. Dick tells him about his newfound love, Elsie Lilly and that she is on the boat as well. He does not realize that Eddie and Elsie Lilly are old lovers. Dick leaves, and Eddie and Elsie Darling sit down to eat. Elsie encourages Eddie to have a martini, and he immediately feels drunk. Dick returns with Madama Matroppo and introduces her to the \"newlyweds\". Eddie orders champagne for everyone as they celebrate (\u201cWedding Bells Are Calling Me\u201d).\n\n=== Act II ===\nAt the Rip Van Winkle Inn, it is evening (\u201cOn the Beach of Li-Li-Wee\u201d). Eddie and Elsie Darling realize that there is no return boat or train until the next day. They get two separate rooms at the Inn. Eddie must use Percy's luggage since he left his own suitcase back in Poughkeepsie. He spills rice out of Percy's suitcase, and the drunken desk clerk thinks that the pair are married. This means they must register as husband and wife. Elsie convinces Eddie that he must destroy the register, since it could be used as evidence to request a divorce. Madame Matroppo enters and informs Eddie that Elsie Lilly and Dick are also staying at the Inn. The clerk guides Eddie and Elsie Darling to their rooms. Dick enters and expresses his confusion about Eddie's behavior towards his \u201cwife\u201d to Madame Matroppo (\u201cIf I Find the Girl\u201d). Eddie leaves his room and secretly spills ink on the register to cover his name. Madame Matroppo is looking for her French admirer when she runs into the clerk who expresses his love for her (\u201cThe Triangle\u201d). Eddie invites Elsie Darling for dinner downstairs, but she declines. Eddie meets Madame Matroppo at dinner but she refuses to sit with him and says he must go upstairs to dine with his \"wife\". Eddie laments his size and his low status (\u201cWhen Your Collar Is No. 13 and Your Shoes No. 3\u201d).\n\nDick finally runs into Elsie Lilly and confesses his love for her. She tells him she doesn't want to settle down, but he tells her that he doesn't want to either (\u201cOld Boy Neutral\u201d). Georgina and Percy arrive at the Inn but they can't be sure whether Eddie and Elsie Darling are guests because the register is ruined. It is late so they decide to stay at the Inn as well. To the surprise of the clerk they also get two separate rooms. Georgina learns that Percy's wife is named Elsie and comes to the unsettling conclusion that she must be the same Elsie that Eddie loved long ago. Unhappily they both go to bed. Meanwhile, Elsie Darling knocks on Eddie's door because she is afraid a mouse is in her room. He comforts her and tells her to be brave (\u201cBabes in the Wood\u201d).\n\nThe next morning Elsie Lilly finds out that Dick got her red roses all the way from New York. Victoria Lake and her girls sing (\u201cThe Fashion Show\u201d). Dick meets Percy and Georgina and informs them that the \"newlyweds\" Eddie and Elsie Darling are at the Inn. He tells them how they had cocktails on the boat; Percy and Georgina are shocked and angry. The clerk informs Madame Matroppo that he has to sing in a minute, and he needs a last minute voice lesson. She decides to hypnotize him, and he tells her he used to be a cashier in a police station. He fantasizes about money and having someone to share it with (\u201cI\u2019d Like to Have a Million in the Bank\u201d).\n\nEddie bought a few left over roses from Dick and knocks on Elsie Darling's door to give them to her. She starts crying when she sees him in Percy's pajamas. Elsie Lilly and Dick enter and once again he confesses his love for her. This time she accepts it (\u201cHolding Roses\u201d). Eddie tells Elsie Darling that Madame Matroppo is suspicious of their \u201cmarriage\u201d so they decide to speak very lovingly to each other in the hope that she can hear them. Unfortunately, Percy and Georgina hear them and angrily confront them. But Eddie and Elsie Darling have learned how to handle themselves. Eddie explains the facts, and both of them finally stand up to their partners. Eddie orders Georgina to sit down, and she does. The delighted clerk shouts admiringly, \"Very Good, Eddie!\u201d (\u201cFinale\u201d).\n\n== Productions ==\nProduced by [[Elisabeth Marbury]] and [[F. Ray Comstock]], the original Broadway production opened on December 23, 1915 at the Princess Theatre.  In May 1916, it moved to the [[Casino Theatre (New York, New York)|Casino Theatre]], and in September it transferred to the 39th Street Theatre, returning to the Princess Theatre to end its run on October 14, 1916, after a total of 341 performances.

He travels to America to operate one of his father's businesses.  During the ensuing 24 years, Mizzi marries one of Rudolph's friends, and the couple has converted the inn into their private residence.  After this period, when Rudolph returns to Vienna, and not knowing what has happened, he hopes to find Mizzi at the inn, to rekindle their love just as it had been so long ago, and to return to pre-war days.  When he arrives at the inn, he sees that it looks just as he remembered it.  He imagines that he has travelled back in time and embraces a woman who looks as Mizzi did in their youth.  She turns out to be Mizzi's daughter, Gaby.  Mizzi admits that she has arranged matters in this fashion so that Rudolph will accept reality; the past is the past.

Talking Points Memo.</ref>\n===Rick Santorum's endorsements===\nNotably, former PA Sen. Rick Santorum gained a disproportionately high number of endorsements (when compared to his pre-Iowa polling in the single digits) in the run up to and including the NH Primary.  At one point Santorum led the entire field of GOP candidates in total number of endorsements (until the entrance of Romney and Perry), and finished with more endorsees than even Huntsman who finished third in the race. This was due in large part to the efforts of Santorum's State Co-chairs: Rep. Dan Tamburello, a current member of the NH House of Representatives from Londonderry who spearheaded the effort, Hon. Bill Cahill, a former Governor's Councilor and member of the NH House, and Claira Monier, a notable Republican party activist who was instrumental in Reagan's NH victory in 1980. Sen Santorum's national campaign manager was by Mike Biundo, who was the architect of former Manchester mayor Frank Guinta's surprising 2010 primary upset for the NH 1st Congressional district; Guinta went on to win the NH-1 district in November 2010 in a decisive victory over Democrat Carol-Shea Porter, who never conceded the race.

Talking Points Memo.</ref>\n===Rick Santorum's endorsements===\nNotably, former PA Sen. Rick Santorum gained a disproportionately high number of endorsements (when compared to his pre-Iowa polling in the single digits) in the run up to and including the NH Primary.  At one point Santorum led the entire field of GOP candidates in total number of endorsements (until the entrance of Romney and Perry), and finished with more endorsees than even Huntsman who finished third in the race. This was due in large part to the efforts of Santorum's State Co-chairs: Rep. Dan Tamburello, a current member of the NH House of Representatives from Londonderry who spearheaded the effort, Hon. Bill Cahill, a former Governor's Councilor and member of the NH House, and Claira Monier, a notable Republican party activist who was instrumental in Reagan's NH victory in 1980. Sen Santorum's national campaign manager was by Mike Biundo, who was the architect of former Manchester mayor Frank Guinta's surprising 2010 primary upset for the NH 1st Congressional district; Guinta went on to win the NH-1 district in November 2010 in a decisive victory over Democrat Carol-Shea Porter, who never conceded the race. Other notable endorsements for the Senator included Sen. Jim Luther, Sen. Fenton Groen, former candidate for Governor Karen Testerman, Rep Susan DeLemus, and NH Tea-Party luminary Jerry DeLemus. Testerman and the DeLemus' endorsed Rick after having defected from the Bachmann camp.\n\n==Polling==\n{{main|Statewide opinion polling for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012#New Hampshire (January 10)}}\n\n==Result==\n{{further|Results of the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; font-size:12px; text-align:right; float:none; clear:none;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e9e9e9;\"\n! colspan=\"6\"| New Hampshire Republican primary, February 10, 2012 - certified result<ref name=\"New Hampshire Secretary of State - Votes\">{{cite web|title=New Hampshire Secretary of State 2012 Presidential Primary Election Results|url=http://www.sos.nh.gov/presprim2012/RepSummaryPres.htm|accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#eeeeee;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:170px; vertical-align:middle;\"| Candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:70px; vertical-align:middle;\"| Votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:70px; vertical-align:middle;\"| Percentage\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"width:145px;\"| Projected delegate count\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#eeeeee;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"|<small>[[Associated Press|AP]]</small><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/primaries/newhampshire | work=USA Today | title=2012 Election: Primaries}}</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"|<small>[[CNN]]</small><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/state/nh |work=CNN |title=Iowa Results |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303100515/http://edition.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/state/nh |archivedate=March 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"|<small>[[The Green Papers|GP]]</small><ref>[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P12/NH-R]</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|'''[[Mitt Romney]]'''\n| 97,591\n| 39.28%\n| 8\n| 8\n| 7\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Ron Paul]]\n| 56,872\n| 22.89%\n| 3\n| 3\n| 3\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]]\n| 41,964\n| 16.89%\n| 1\n| 0\n| 2\n|- \n| align=\"left\"|[[Rick Santorum]]\n| 23,432\n| 9.43%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Newt Gingrich]]\n| 23,421\n| 9.43%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Rick Perry]]\n| 1,764\n| 0.71%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Buddy Roemer]]\n| 950\n| 0.38%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Michele Bachmann]] <small>(withdrawn)</small>\n| 350\n| 0.14%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Fred Karger]]\n| 345\n| 0.14%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Barack Obama]] <small>(write-in)</small>\n| 285\n| 0.11%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Kevin Rubash\n| 250\n| 0.10%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Gary Johnson]] <small>(withdrawn)</small>\n| 181\n| 0.07%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Herman Cain]] <small>(withdrawn)</small>\n| 161\n| 0.06%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Jeff Lawman\n| 119\n| 0.05%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Chris Hill\n| 108\n| 0.04%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Benjamin Linn\n| 83\n| 0.03%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Michael Meehan\n| 54\n| 0.02%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Keith Drummond\n| 42\n| 0.02%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Rickey Story\n| 42\n| 0.02%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Bear Betzler\n| 29\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Joe Robinson\n| 25\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Stewart Greenleaf\n| 24\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Donald Trump]] <small>(write-in)</small>\n| 24\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Sarah Palin]] <small>(write-in)</small>\n| 23\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| [[Mark Callahan]]\n| 20\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Andy Martin\n| 19\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Linden Swift\n| 18\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Tim Brewer\n| 15\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| Vern Wuensche\n| 15\n| 0.01%\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|- \n| align=\"left\"| L.

After serving briefly as commandant of students at the [[Danville Military Academy]] in [[Danville, Virginia]], Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February, 1902. In the years after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class.  In 1916 Marshall was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[J. Franklin Bell]], the commander of the [[Department of the West|Western Department]]. After the United States entered [[World War I]], Marshall served with Bell while Bell commanded the [[Department of the East]]. He was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations including the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].\n\nAfter the war, Marshall became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[John J. Pershing]], who was then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]]. Marshall later served on the Army staff, commanded the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, and was an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]]. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] from 1936 to 1938, and received promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff, and later became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff. When Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] retired in 1939, Marshall became acting Chief of Staff, and then Chief of Staff, a position he held until the war's end in 1945.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to [[five-star rank]] as [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]]. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Churchill and other Allied leaders, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall its [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943.

As [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] at the start of the [[Korean War]], Marshall worked to restore the military's confidence and morale at the end of its post-World War II demobilization and then its initial buildup for combat in Korea and operations during the [[Cold War]].

In 1927, as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], he was appointed assistant commandant of the [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], where he initiated major changes to modernize command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]].

''Infantry in Battle'' is still used as an officer's training manual in the Infantry Officer's Course and was the training manual for most of the infantry officers and leaders of World War II.\n\nFrom June 1932 to June 1933, Marshall was the commanding officer of the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. From July 1933 to October 1933 he was commander of [[Fort Moultrie]], [[South Carolina]] and District I of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], and he was promoted to colonel in September 1933.  He was senior instructor and chief of staff for the Illinois National Guard's [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd Division]] from November 1933 to August 1936.\n\nMarshall commanded the 5th Brigade of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] in [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver,]] Washington from 1936 to 1938, and was promoted to brigadier general in October 1936. In addition to obtaining a long-sought and significant troop command, traditionally viewed as an indispensable step to the pinnacle of the US Army, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. As post commander Marshall made a concerted effort to cultivate relations with the city of Portland and to enhance the image of the US Army in the region. With the CCC, he initiated a series of measures to improve the morale of the participants and to make the experience beneficial in their later life. He started a newspaper for the CCC region that proved a vehicle to promote CCC successes, and he initiated a variety of programs that developed their skills and improved their health. Marshall's inspections of the CCC camps gave him and his wife Katherine the chance to enjoy the beauty of the American northwest and made that assignment what he called \"the most instructive service I ever had, and the most interesting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecmarshall.org|title=Home|website=www.georgecmarshall.org|access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a conference at the White House at which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort, lacking forethought with regard to logistical support or training. With all other attendees voicing support of the plan, Marshall was the only person to voice his disagreement. Marshall also spoke in favor of a large ground army although Roosevelt had said a large air force would be a greater deterrent to enemies than a large army.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=26}} Despite other's belief then that he had ended his career, this action resulted in his being nominated by Franklin Roosevelt to be the Army Chief of Staff as his personal choice. Marshall was then only 34th in seniority and outranked by 21 major-generals and 11 brigadier-generals; but he was the fifth-ranking officer under an unwritten rule that the chief of staff should be able to serve a four-year term before reaching 64.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=27}} \n\nUpon the retirement of General [[Malin Craig]] on July 1, 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff. Marshall was promoted to [[General (United States)|general]] and sworn in as chief of staff on September 1, 1939, the same day the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] launched its [[invasion of Poland]].<ref>[http://www.georgecmarshall.org/Meet-General-Marshall/Early-Career George C.

Marshall saw Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] and they went to see Roosevelt together; Marshall emphasized the supreme importance of getting the full amount and told Roosevelt \"you have got to do something and you\u2019ve got to do it today\".

Though he had never actually led troops in combat, Marshall was a skilled organizer with a talent for inspiring other officers.<ref>Bland, Larry I., ''George C.

With the exception of airborne forces, Marshall approved McNair's concept of an abbreviated training schedule for men entering Army land forces training, particularly in regard to basic infantry skills, weapons proficiency, and combat tactics.<ref>[[Stephen Ambrose|Ambrose, Stephen]], ''[[Citizen Soldiers: The U.S. Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany June 7, 1944 \u2013 May 7, 1945]]'', New York: [[Simon & Schuster]] (1997), pp. 271\u201384</ref><ref>Keast, William R.

He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Krueger and Clark.  A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as \"one of the best\" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, \"I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.\"  Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Both men would come to regret that decision, as Fredendall was the leader of U.S. Army forces at the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Planned invasion of Europe===\n[[File:Infantry in battle cover.gif|thumb|Cover to the book ''Infantry in Battle'', the World War II officer's guide to infantry combat operations. Marshall directed production of the book, which is still used as a reference today.]]\nDuring World War II, Marshall was instrumental in preparing the U.S. Army and [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] for the invasion of the European continent. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.\n\nIt was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the states. He told Marshall, \"I didn't feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington.\"<ref name=d>{{cite book|last=Buell|first=Thomas B.|author2=John H. Bradley|title=The Second World War: Europe and the Mediterranean|page=258}}</ref>  When rumors circulated that the top job would go to Marshall, many critics viewed the transfer as a demotion for Marshall, since he would leave his position as Chief of Staff of the Army and lose his seat on the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pogue|first1=Forrest C.|title=The Supreme Commander|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Supreme/USA-E-Supreme-1.html|website=ibiblio.org|publisher=OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF MILITARY HISTORY|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 1944, Marshall became the first American Army general to be promoted to [[five-star rank]], the newly created [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]] \u2013 the American equivalent rank to [[field marshal]]. He was the second American to be promoted to a five-star rank, as [[William Daniel Leahy|William Leahy]] was promoted to [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] the previous day.\n\nThroughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943. Marshall resigned his post of chief of staff on November 10, 1945, but did not retire, as regulations stipulate that Generals of the Army remain on active duty for life.  He was succeeded as Army chief of staff by General of the Army [[Dwight Eisenhower]].<ref name=\"wedemeyer\"/>\n\n==Analysis of Pearl Harbor intelligence failure==\nAfter World War II ended, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]] received testimony on the intelligence failure. It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delay in sending General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall's lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including Marshall.<ref>Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.), Part 39, pp. 144\u201345.</ref><ref>Conclusions and Recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.) pp. 252, 265</ref>\n\nA secret report into the Army's role, the [[Clausen Report]] was authorized by Secretary [[Henry L.

Mao promised Marshall the Communists would give up armed revolution, embrace the old enemies, and build a democracy in China. Marshall hoped for a coalition government, and toasted their common future.

Marshall felt that if the state of Israel was declared that a war would break out in the Middle East (which it did in 1948 one day after Israel declared independence). Marshall saw recognizing the Jewish state as a political move to gain Jewish support in the upcoming election, in which Truman was expected to lose to Dewey. He told President Truman in May 1948, \"If you (recognize the state of Israel) and if I were to vote in the election, I would vote against you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=376&PID=0&IID=2203|title=President Truman's Decision to Recognize Israel|accessdate=2009-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306101503/http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=376&PID=0&IID=2203|archive-date=2012-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0591/9105017.htm|title=Truman Adviser Recalls May 14, 1948 US Decision to Recognize Israel|date=May\u2013June 1991|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|page=17|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hst/h.htm|title=Recognition of Israel|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=The Truman Library}}</ref>  However, Marshall refused to vote in any election as a matter of principle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Uldrich|first1=Jack|title=Soldier, Statesman, Peacemaker: Leadership Lessons from George C.

Marshall.jpg|thumb|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall sits for a portrait in 1950.]]\nWhen the early months of the [[Korean War]] showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary [[Louis A. Johnson]] and named Marshall as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in September 1950.  The appointment required a congressional waiver because the [[National Security Act of 1947]] prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post.  This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired, but remain officially on active duty even after their active service has concluded. General Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver, with Defense Secretary [[James Mattis]] being the second to receive it.  Marshall's main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale while rebuilding the armed forces following their post-World War II demobilization.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Thomas Edgar Stephens - George C. Marshall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Marshall portrait by [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (c. 1949)]]\nMarshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the [[Cold War]] in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including [[Robert A. Lovett]] as his deputy and [[Anna M. Rosenberg]], former head of the [[War Manpower Commission]], as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nMarshall participated in the post-[[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landing]] discussion that led to authorizing [[Douglas MacArthur]] to conduct operations in North Korea.  A secret \"eyes only\" signal from Marshall to MacArthur on September 29, 1950 declared the Truman administration's commitment: \"We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Culture of War: The History of US Military Force from World War II to Operation Enduring Freedon|last=Lewis|first=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415890199|location=|page=104}}</ref> At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to [[United Nations]] votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.\n\nFollowing Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China's increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease\u2013fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China's eyes, leading to demands for future concessions. In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines.  When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.\n\n====Relief of General MacArthur====\n{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}\nIncreasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.\n\nHarriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause \"the biggest fight of your administration.\" At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \"military point of view,\" suggesting that \"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\"\n\nMarshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that \"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=2&titleid=188&tldate=1951-04-06&collectionid=firem&PageID=1&groupid=3416 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | title = Diary entries, 6\u20137, April 1951, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S. Truman Library and Museum}}</ref> (The Joint Chiefs would later insist that they had only \"concurred\" with the relief, not \"recommended\" it.)\n\nOn April 11, 1951, President Truman directed transmittal of an order to MacArthur, issued over Bradley's signature, relieving MacArthur of his assignment in Korea and directing him to turn over command to [[Matthew Ridgway]]. In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Later life==\nMarshall retired in September 1951 to his home, [[George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor|Dodona Manor]], in [[Leesburg, Virginia]] to tend to his gardens and continue his passion for horseback riding. He was head of the American delegation at [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.  He also served as Chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] from 1949 to 1959.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:George Marshall Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Grave site of George Marshall at Arlington National Cemetery]]\nMarshall died at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959 at the age of 78. Although he was entitled to an Official Funeral, Marshall preferred simplicity, so received a Special Military Funeral after lying in state at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] for 21 hours, guarded by representatives from all the U.S. armed services, as well as a VMI cadet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch19.htm|title=Chapter 19 - The Last Salute|website=history.army.mil}}</ref> President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-mast, and was among the invited guests at the funeral service at the [[Fort Myer]] Old Post Chapel; other dignitaries included former President Truman,  Secretary of State [[Christian Herter|Christian A. Herter]], former Secretary of State Dean G. Acheson, W. Averell Harriman and Generals Omar N. Bradley, [[Alfred M. Gruenther]] and General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]]. His parish priest, Rev. Franklin Moss Jr. from St. James Episcopal Church  in Leesburg, Virginia conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon Rev. Luther Miller. Following a 19-gun salute, Marshall was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], in a place he had picked, in Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife, Elizabeth Carter Coles (1875\u20131927) and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849\u20131929); his second wife, Katherine Tupper Brown Marshall (1882\u20131978) would later join them.\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nMarshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army.  In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall \"Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/digital-archive/editorial-note-on-becoming-general-liggettos-aide/ |title=1-070, Editorial Note on Becoming General Liggett's Aide, February 1915 |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C. Marshall Foundation |access-date=July 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Lieutenant Colonel [[Johnson Hagood (general)|Johnson Hagood]] completed a written evaluation of Marshall's performance in which he called Marshall a military genius. Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote \"Yes, but I would prefer to serve ''under his command''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Puryear |first=Edgar F.

In recent years, the cooperation required between former European adversaries as part of the Marshall Plan has been recognized as one of the earliest factors that led to formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and eventually the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/marshall/the-marshall-plan/history-marshall-plan/ |title=History of the Marshall Plan |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C.

Truman]] was asked which American he thought had made the greatest contribution of the preceding thirty years.

After serving briefly as commandant of students at the [[Danville Military Academy]] in [[Danville, Virginia]], Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February, 1902. In the years after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class.  In 1916 Marshall was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[J. Franklin Bell]], the commander of the [[Department of the West|Western Department]]. After the United States entered [[World War I]], Marshall served with Bell while Bell commanded the [[Department of the East]]. He was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations including the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].\n\nAfter the war, Marshall became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[John J. Pershing]], who was then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]]. Marshall later served on the Army staff, commanded the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, and was an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]]. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] from 1936 to 1938, and received promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff, and later became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff. When Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] retired in 1939, Marshall became acting Chief of Staff, and then Chief of Staff, a position he held until the war's end in 1945.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to [[five-star rank]] as [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]]. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Churchill and other Allied leaders, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall its [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943.

In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a conference at the White House at which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort, lacking forethought with regard to logistical support or training. With all other attendees voicing support of the plan, Marshall was the only person to voice his disagreement. Marshall also spoke in favor of a large ground army although Roosevelt had said a large air force would be a greater deterrent to enemies than a large army.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=26}} Despite other's belief then that he had ended his career, this action resulted in his being nominated by Franklin Roosevelt to be the Army Chief of Staff as his personal choice. Marshall was then only 34th in seniority and outranked by 21 major-generals and 11 brigadier-generals; but he was the fifth-ranking officer under an unwritten rule that the chief of staff should be able to serve a four-year term before reaching 64.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=27}} \n\nUpon the retirement of General [[Malin Craig]] on July 1, 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff. Marshall was promoted to [[General (United States)|general]] and sworn in as chief of staff on September 1, 1939, the same day the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] launched its [[invasion of Poland]].<ref>[http://www.georgecmarshall.org/Meet-General-Marshall/Early-Career George C.

Marshall saw Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] and they went to see Roosevelt together; Marshall emphasized the supreme importance of getting the full amount and told Roosevelt \"you have got to do something and you\u2019ve got to do it today\".

Though he had never actually led troops in combat, Marshall was a skilled organizer with a talent for inspiring other officers.<ref>Bland, Larry I., ''George C.

He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Krueger and Clark.  A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as \"one of the best\" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, \"I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.\"  Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Both men would come to regret that decision, as Fredendall was the leader of U.S. Army forces at the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Planned invasion of Europe===\n[[File:Infantry in battle cover.gif|thumb|Cover to the book ''Infantry in Battle'', the World War II officer's guide to infantry combat operations. Marshall directed production of the book, which is still used as a reference today.]]\nDuring World War II, Marshall was instrumental in preparing the U.S. Army and [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] for the invasion of the European continent. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.\n\nIt was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the states. He told Marshall, \"I didn't feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington.\"<ref name=d>{{cite book|last=Buell|first=Thomas B.|author2=John H.

He was the second American to be promoted to a five-star rank, as [[William Daniel Leahy|William Leahy]] was promoted to [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] the previous day.\n\nThroughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943. Marshall resigned his post of chief of staff on November 10, 1945, but did not retire, as regulations stipulate that Generals of the Army remain on active duty for life.  He was succeeded as Army chief of staff by General of the Army [[Dwight Eisenhower]].<ref name=\"wedemeyer\"/>\n\n==Analysis of Pearl Harbor intelligence failure==\nAfter World War II ended, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]] received testimony on the intelligence failure. It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delay in sending General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall's lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including Marshall.<ref>Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.), Part 39, pp. 144\u201345.</ref><ref>Conclusions and Recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.) pp. 252, 265</ref>\n\nA secret report into the Army's role, the [[Clausen Report]] was authorized by Secretary [[Henry L.

Mao promised Marshall the Communists would give up armed revolution, embrace the old enemies, and build a democracy in China. Marshall hoped for a coalition government, and toasted their common future.

Marshall felt that if the state of Israel was declared that a war would break out in the Middle East (which it did in 1948 one day after Israel declared independence). Marshall saw recognizing the Jewish state as a political move to gain Jewish support in the upcoming election, in which Truman was expected to lose to Dewey.

Marshall.jpg|thumb|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall sits for a portrait in 1950.]]\nWhen the early months of the [[Korean War]] showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary [[Louis A. Johnson]] and named Marshall as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in September 1950.  The appointment required a congressional waiver because the [[National Security Act of 1947]] prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post.  This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired, but remain officially on active duty even after their active service has concluded. General Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver, with Defense Secretary [[James Mattis]] being the second to receive it.  Marshall's main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale while rebuilding the armed forces following their post-World War II demobilization.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Thomas Edgar Stephens - George C. Marshall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Marshall portrait by [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (c. 1949)]]\nMarshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the [[Cold War]] in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including [[Robert A. Lovett]] as his deputy and [[Anna M. Rosenberg]], former head of the [[War Manpower Commission]], as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nMarshall participated in the post-[[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landing]] discussion that led to authorizing [[Douglas MacArthur]] to conduct operations in North Korea.  A secret \"eyes only\" signal from Marshall to MacArthur on September 29, 1950 declared the Truman administration's commitment: \"We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Culture of War: The History of US Military Force from World War II to Operation Enduring Freedon|last=Lewis|first=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415890199|location=|page=104}}</ref> At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to [[United Nations]] votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.\n\nFollowing Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China's increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease\u2013fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China's eyes, leading to demands for future concessions. In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines.  When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.\n\n====Relief of General MacArthur====\n{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}\nIncreasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.\n\nHarriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause \"the biggest fight of your administration.\" At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \"military point of view,\" suggesting that \"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\"\n\nMarshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that \"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=2&titleid=188&tldate=1951-04-06&collectionid=firem&PageID=1&groupid=3416 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | title = Diary entries, 6\u20137, April 1951, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S.

In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Later life==\nMarshall retired in September 1951 to his home, [[George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor|Dodona Manor]], in [[Leesburg, Virginia]] to tend to his gardens and continue his passion for horseback riding. He was head of the American delegation at [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.  He also served as Chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] from 1949 to 1959.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:George Marshall Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Grave site of George Marshall at Arlington National Cemetery]]\nMarshall died at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959 at the age of 78. Although he was entitled to an Official Funeral, Marshall preferred simplicity, so received a Special Military Funeral after lying in state at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] for 21 hours, guarded by representatives from all the U.S. armed services, as well as a VMI cadet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch19.htm|title=Chapter 19 - The Last Salute|website=history.army.mil}}</ref> President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-mast, and was among the invited guests at the funeral service at the [[Fort Myer]] Old Post Chapel; other dignitaries included former President Truman,  Secretary of State [[Christian Herter|Christian A.

Franklin Moss Jr. from St. James Episcopal Church  in Leesburg, Virginia conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon Rev. Luther Miller. Following a 19-gun salute, Marshall was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], in a place he had picked, in Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife, Elizabeth Carter Coles (1875\u20131927) and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849\u20131929); his second wife, Katherine Tupper Brown Marshall (1882\u20131978) would later join them.\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nMarshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army.  In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall \"Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/digital-archive/editorial-note-on-becoming-general-liggettos-aide/ |title=1-070, Editorial Note on Becoming General Liggett's Aide, February 1915 |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C.

Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote \"Yes, but I would prefer to serve ''under his command''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Puryear |first=Edgar F.

Written by [[Sidney Gilliat]] and [[Frank Launder]], based on the novel ''Report on a Fugitive'' by [[Gordon Wellesley]], the film is about an inventor and his daughter who are kidnapped by the [[Gestapo]] after the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] march into Prague in the prelude to the [[Second World War]]. A [[Secret Intelligence Service|British secret service]] agent follows them, disguised as a senior German army officer pretending to woo the daughter over to the Nazi cause.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=Night Train to Munich (1940) |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/35261/Night-Train-to-Munich/overview |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German forces take over Czechoslovakia]] in March 1939, Axel Bomasch ([[James Harcourt]]), a Czechoslovak scientist working on a new type of armour-plating, is flown to [[UK|Britain]]. Bomasch's daughter, Anna ([[Margaret Lockwood]]), is arrested before she can reach the airport and sent to a [[concentration camp]], where she is interrogated by [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] who are after her father. Anna refuses to cooperate. Soon she is befriended by a fellow prisoner named Karl Marsen ([[Paul Henreid]]), who says he is a teacher imprisoned for his political views. Together they are able to escape and make their way to London. Anna does not know that Marsen is in fact a [[Gestapo]] agent assigned to gain her trust and locate her father.\n\nFollowing Marsen's suggestion, Anna places a cryptic newspaper advertisement to let her father know she is in the country. Soon after, she gets an anonymous phone call with instructions to go to the town of Brightbourne. There, Anna contacts Dickie Randall ([[Rex Harrison]]), a British intelligence officer working undercover as an entertainer named Gus Bennett. Randall takes Anna to her father, who is now working for the [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Dartford]] naval base. Anna argues with Randall over her attempt to post a letter to Marsen (with an informative [[postmark]]). It does not matter, as Dr. John Fredericks ([[Felix Aylmer]]), Marsen's undercover superior in London, had tailed her to Brightbourne.\n\nSoon after, Marsen arranges the kidnapping of Anna and her father, and brings them back to Germany by [[U-boat]]. Their captors threaten to put her in a concentration camp if Bomasch refuses to work for the Nazis. Meanwhile, Randall's proposal to rescue the Bomasches is (unofficially) accepted. He travels to Berlin and infiltrates the building where the Bomasches are being held, posing as Major Ulrich Herzog of the Corps of Engineers. He dupes Captain Prada and Admiral Hassinger into believing he was Anna's lover years ago and can persuade her to get her father to co-operate. Randall spends the night with Anna in her hotel room to maintain the pretense. When the Bomasches are ordered sent to Munich, he plans to accompany them and arrange their escape. However, Marsen shows up just as they are about to leave the hotel; he has been assigned to escort them to Munich.\n\nRandall's situation is further complicated at the [[railway station]], where he is recognised by a former classmate named [[Caldicott and Charters|Caldicott]] ([[Naunton Wayne]]), who is leaving Germany with his friend [[Caldicott and Charters|Charters]] ([[Basil Radford]]). Randall denies knowing Caldicott, but Marsen's suspicions are aroused. When the train makes an unscheduled stop (brought to a halt by a railway station guard played by [[Irene Handl]] in an early uncredited bit part) to take on troops, as war has just been declared between Britain and Germany, Marsen takes the opportunity to telephone his headquarters to have Herzog investigated. When Marsen's superiors call back to confirm there is no Major Herzog, Charters, attempting to use another telephone, overhears that Randall will be arrested when they reach Munich.\n\nThe two Englishmen barely manage to reboard the train before it leaves. Caldicott slips a warning to Randall, who is thus prepared when Marsen pulls out a gun as they near Munich. Charters and Caldicott overpower first the two guards, then Marsen. After swapping uniforms with Marsen, Randall commandeers a car. They speed up a mountain road, with Marsen and his men in hot pursuit. They reach an [[aerial tramway]]; at the other end is neutral [[Switzerland]]. Randall manages to shoot all of their pursuers except Marsen, while Anna and the others escape on the tram. Randall then boards the other tram and exchanges shots with Marsen. Marsen reverses the direction of Randall's tram, but he manages to jump to the other tram as it passes. When he hits Marsen in the leg, the latter is either unable, or unwilling, to reach the controls and stop Randall from reaching safety. Randall and Anna embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Margaret Lockwood]] as Anna Bomasch\n* [[Rex Harrison]] as Gus Bennett / \"Dickie Randall\"\n* [[Paul Henreid]] as Capt.

It had a hemispherical cross-flow cylinder head with valves inclined from the vertical; originally at 30&nbsp;degrees (inlet) and 45&nbsp;degrees (exhaust) and later standardised to 45 degrees for both inlet and exhaust.\n\n[[File:Jaguar XK6 engine 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jaguar XK6 engine|XK engine]] in an [[Jaguar E-Type|E-Type]]]]\n\nAs fuel [[octane]] ratings were relatively low from 1948 onwards, three piston configuration were offered: domed (high octane), flat (medium octane), and dished (low octane).\n\nThe main designer, [[William Heynes|William \"Bill\" Heynes]], assisted by [[Walter Hassan|Walter \"Wally\" Hassan]], was determined to develop the Twin [[Overhead camshaft|OHC]] unit. Bill Lyons agreed over misgivings from Hassan. It was risky to take what had previously been considered a racing or low-volume and cantankerous engine needing constant fettling and apply it to reasonable volume production saloon cars.\n\nThe subsequent engine (in various versions) was the mainstay powerplant of Jaguar, used in the XK 120, Mk VII Saloon, Mk I and II Saloons and XK 140 and 150. It was also employed in the E Type, itself a development from the race winning and Le Mans conquering C and D Type Sports Racing cars refined as the short-lived XKSS, a road-legal D-Type.\n\nFew engine types have demonstrated such ubiquity and longevity: Jaguar used the Twin OHC ''XK Engine'', as it came to be known, in the Jaguar XJ6 saloon from 1969 through 1992, and employed in a J60 variant as the power plant in such diverse vehicles as the British Army's [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)]] family of vehicles, as well as the [[Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle]], the [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret Scout Car]], and the Stonefield four-wheel-drive all-terrain lorry. Properly maintained, the standard production XK Engine would achieve 200,000 miles of useful life.\n\nTwo of the proudest moments in Jaguar's long history in motor sport involved winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hours race]], firstly in 1951 and again in 1953. Victory at the 1955 Le Mans was overshadowed by it being the occasion of [[1955 Le Mans disaster|the worst motorsport accident in history]]. Later in the hands of the Scottish racing team Ecurie Ecosse two more wins were added in 1956 and 1957.\n\nIn spite of such a performance orientation, it was always Lyons' intention to build the business by producing world-class sporting saloons in larger numbers than the sports car market could support. Jaguar secured financial stability and a reputation for excellence with a series of elegantly styled luxury saloons that included the 3-litre and 3\u00bd litre cars, the Mark VII, VIII, and IX, the compact Mark I and 2, and the XJ6 and XJ12. All were deemed very good values, with comfortable rides, good handling, high performance, and great style.\n\nCombined with the trend-setting XK 120, XK 140, and XK 150 series of sports car, and nonpareil E-Type,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Jaguar's elan as a prestige motorcar manufacturer had few rivals. The company's post-War achievements are remarkable, considering both the shortages that drove Britain (the [[Ministry of Supply]] still allocated raw materials) and the state of metallurgical development of the era.\n\n===Daimler===\nIn 1950, Jaguar agreed to lease from the Ministry of Supply the Daimler Shadow 2 factory in [[Browns Lane plant|Browns Lane]], Allesley, Coventry, which at the time was being used by [[Daimler Company|The Daimler Company Limited]] and moved to the new site from Foleshill over the next 12 months.<ref name=LyonsBio>'Sir William Lyons \u2013 The Official Biography', Philip Porter & Paul Skilleter, page 120 onwards</ref> Jaguar purchased Daimler \u2013 not to be confused with [[Daimler-Benz]] or [[Daimler AG]]\u2014in 1960 from [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]].

The model has been in production since 1968 with the first generation being the last Jaguar car to have creative input by the company's founder, [[William Lyons|Sir William Lyons]], although this is disputed as some Jaguar historians claim that the second generation XJ \u2013 the [[Jaguar XJ40|XJ40]] series  \u2013 was the last car which Lyons had influenced.  The XJ40 originally launched in 1986 and went through two major revamps in 1994 ([[Jaguar X300|X300]]) and 1997 ([[Jaguar X308|X308]]) for a total production run of 17 years.  In early 2003, the third generation XJ \u2013 the [[Jaguar X350|X350]] \u2013 arrived in showrooms and while the car's exterior and interior styling were traditional in appearance, the car was completely re-engineered. Its styling attracted much criticism from many motoring journalists who claimed that the car looked old-fashioned and barely more modern than its predecessor, many even citing that the 'Lyons line' had been lost in the translation from XJ40 into X350 XJ, even though beneath the shell lay a highly advanced aluminium construction that put the XJ very near the top of its class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series/ |title=Jaguar XJ Series |publisher=Autocars.co.uk |accessdate=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709094043/http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series |archive-date=9 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nJaguar responded to the criticism with the introduction of the fourth generation XJ, launched in 2009.

It had a hemispherical cross-flow cylinder head with valves inclined from the vertical; originally at 30&nbsp;degrees (inlet) and 45&nbsp;degrees (exhaust) and later standardised to 45 degrees for both inlet and exhaust.\n\n[[File:Jaguar XK6 engine 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jaguar XK6 engine|XK engine]] in an [[Jaguar E-Type|E-Type]]]]\n\nAs fuel [[octane]] ratings were relatively low from 1948 onwards, three piston configuration were offered: domed (high octane), flat (medium octane), and dished (low octane).\n\nThe main designer, [[William Heynes|William \"Bill\" Heynes]], assisted by [[Walter Hassan|Walter \"Wally\" Hassan]], was determined to develop the Twin [[Overhead camshaft|OHC]] unit. Bill Lyons agreed over misgivings from Hassan. It was risky to take what had previously been considered a racing or low-volume and cantankerous engine needing constant fettling and apply it to reasonable volume production saloon cars.\n\nThe subsequent engine (in various versions) was the mainstay powerplant of Jaguar, used in the XK 120, Mk VII Saloon, Mk I and II Saloons and XK 140 and 150. It was also employed in the E Type, itself a development from the race winning and Le Mans conquering C and D Type Sports Racing cars refined as the short-lived XKSS, a road-legal D-Type.\n\nFew engine types have demonstrated such ubiquity and longevity: Jaguar used the Twin OHC ''XK Engine'', as it came to be known, in the Jaguar XJ6 saloon from 1969 through 1992, and employed in a J60 variant as the power plant in such diverse vehicles as the British Army's [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)]] family of vehicles, as well as the [[Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle]], the [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret Scout Car]], and the Stonefield four-wheel-drive all-terrain lorry. Properly maintained, the standard production XK Engine would achieve 200,000 miles of useful life.\n\nTwo of the proudest moments in Jaguar's long history in motor sport involved winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hours race]], firstly in 1951 and again in 1953. Victory at the 1955 Le Mans was overshadowed by it being the occasion of [[1955 Le Mans disaster|the worst motorsport accident in history]]. Later in the hands of the Scottish racing team Ecurie Ecosse two more wins were added in 1956 and 1957.\n\nIn spite of such a performance orientation, it was always Lyons' intention to build the business by producing world-class sporting saloons in larger numbers than the sports car market could support. Jaguar secured financial stability and a reputation for excellence with a series of elegantly styled luxury saloons that included the 3-litre and 3\u00bd litre cars, the Mark VII, VIII, and IX, the compact Mark I and 2, and the XJ6 and XJ12. All were deemed very good values, with comfortable rides, good handling, high performance, and great style.\n\nCombined with the trend-setting XK 120, XK 140, and XK 150 series of sports car, and nonpareil E-Type,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Jaguar's elan as a prestige motorcar manufacturer had few rivals. The company's post-War achievements are remarkable, considering both the shortages that drove Britain (the [[Ministry of Supply]] still allocated raw materials) and the state of metallurgical development of the era.\n\n===Daimler===\nIn 1950, Jaguar agreed to lease from the Ministry of Supply the Daimler Shadow 2 factory in [[Browns Lane plant|Browns Lane]], Allesley, Coventry, which at the time was being used by [[Daimler Company|The Daimler Company Limited]] and moved to the new site from Foleshill over the next 12 months.<ref name=LyonsBio>'Sir William Lyons \u2013 The Official Biography', Philip Porter & Paul Skilleter, page 120 onwards</ref> Jaguar purchased Daimler \u2013 not to be confused with [[Daimler-Benz]] or [[Daimler AG]]\u2014in 1960 from [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]].

The decision to offload the site to Jaguar came as Peugeot discontinued the [[Talbot]] brand for passenger cars.

The XJ40 originally launched in 1986 and went through two major revamps in 1994 ([[Jaguar X300|X300]]) and 1997 ([[Jaguar X308|X308]]) for a total production run of 17 years.  In early 2003, the third generation XJ \u2013 the [[Jaguar X350|X350]] \u2013 arrived in showrooms and while the car's exterior and interior styling were traditional in appearance, the car was completely re-engineered. Its styling attracted much criticism from many motoring journalists who claimed that the car looked old-fashioned and barely more modern than its predecessor, many even citing that the 'Lyons line' had been lost in the translation from XJ40 into X350 XJ, even though beneath the shell lay a highly advanced aluminium construction that put the XJ very near the top of its class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series/ |title=Jaguar XJ Series |publisher=Autocars.co.uk |accessdate=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709094043/http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series |archive-date=9 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nJaguar responded to the criticism with the introduction of the fourth generation XJ, launched in 2009.

The XK100 4-cylinder 2-Litre version had broken records in Belgium travelling at 177&nbsp;mph.  This XK engine had been designed at night during the war when they would be on fire watch in the factory. After several attempts a final design was achieved. That is until owner William Lyons said \"make it quieter\".\n\nThe sportscar bearing its prefix X had originally been intended as a short production model of about 200 vehicles.

The manager of the racing team during this period, [[Lofty England]], later became CEO of Jaguar in the early 1970s. Although the prototype [[Jaguar XJ13|XJ13]] was built in the mid-1960s it was never raced, and the famous race was then left for many years.\n\nIn 1982, a successful relationship with [[Tom Walkinshaw]]'s [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing|TWR]] team commenced with the [[Jaguar XJ-S|XJ-S]] competing in the [[European Touring Car Championship]], which it won in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double loss for motor sport|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/f1/double-loss-for-motor-sport/|work=Motor Sport|accessdate=21 April 2014|date=16 December 2010}}</ref> In 1985, the TWR XJ-S won the [[1985 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst 1000]] race. In the mid-1980s TWR started designing and preparing Jaguar V12-engined [[Group C]] cars for [[World Sports Prototype Championship]] races. The team started winning regularly from 1987, and won Le Mans in 1988 and 1990 with the [[Jaguar XJR Sportscars|XJR]] series sports cars. The [[Jaguar XJR-14]] was the last of the XJRs to win, taking the 1991 [[World Sportscar Championship]].\n\nIn the 1999, Ford decided that Jaguar would be the corporation's [[Formula One]] entry. Ford bought out the [[Milton Keynes]]-based [[Stewart Grand Prix]] team and rebranded it as [[Jaguar Racing]] for the 2000 season. The Jaguar F1 program was not a success however, achieving only two podium finishes in five seasons of competition between {{F1|2000}} and {{F1|2004}}. At the end of 2004, with costs mounting and Ford's profits dwindling, the F1 team was seen as an unneeded expense and was sold to [[Red Bull]] energy drinks owner [[Dietrich Mateschitz]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Bull snaps up Jaguar F1 team|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4012381.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=21 April 2014|date=15 November 2004}}</ref> and it became [[Red Bull Racing]].\n\nOn 15 December 2015, it was announced that Jaguar would return to motorsport for the third season of [[Formula E]].\n\nOn 15 June 2018, Jaguar Vector Racing broke the world speed record for an electric battery powered boat.

In 2011, Jaguar presented the exhibition series \"Shadows\", which involved the installation of Szczesny's shadow sculptures in Sankt-Moritz, on Sylt and in Saint-Tropez. In 2012, a large number of sculptures, ceramics and paintings were shown in Frankfurt (and mainly in Frankfurt's Palmengarten).\n\nAs part of the collaboration with Szczesny, Jaguar has released the \"Jaguar Art Collection\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Jaguar Cars}}\n* {{official|jaguar.com|Jaguar official website}}\n* [http://www.jaguarheritage.com/ Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust website]\n\n{{Jaguar vehicles timeline (classic)}}\n{{Jaguar vehicles timeline (modern)}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{Jaguar Land Rover}}\n{{Tata Motors}}\n{{British Leyland}}\n{{Automotive industry in the United Kingdom}}\n{{British Car Industry}}\n{{Ford Motor Company}}\n{{British Royal Warrant holders}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1935]]\n[[Category:British brands]]\n[[Category:Car brands]]\n[[Category:Jaguar Cars| ]]\n[[Category:Jaguar vehicles| ]]\n", "name_user": "Chirag Varna", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Cars"}
