However, \"[i]t is ... possible ... that an early European visitor, whose knowledge of [Kiswahili] was not extensive, changed ''mlima'' to ''kilima'' by analogy with the two [[Chaga languages|Wachagga]] names: ''Kibo'' and ''Kimawenzi''.\"<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/> A different approach is to assume that the kileman part of Kilimanjaro comes from the Kichagga ''kileme'', which means that which defeats, or ''kilelema'', which means that which has become difficult or impossible.

The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} -->\nA legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands.

The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} -->\nA legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands.

In general, technical support provide help regarding specific problems with a product or service, rather than providing training, provision or customization of product, or other support services. Most companies offer technical support for the services or products they sell, either included in the cost or for an additional fee. Technical support may be delivered over by [[Telephone|phone]], [[e-mail]], [[live support software]] on a [[website]], or other tool where users can log an incident. Larger organizations frequently have internal technical support available to their staff for computer-related problems. The Internet can also be a good source for freely available tech support, where [[power user|experienced users]] help users find solutions to their problems.{{citation needed lead|date=February 2015}} In addition, some fee-based service companies charge for premium technical support services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4387525.stm |title=Technical support for the neighbours |accessdate=2008-03-06  | work=BBC News | date=2005-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Coverage of support==\nTechnical support may be delivered by different technologies depending on the situation. For example, direct questions can be addressed using telephone calls, SMS, Online chat, Support Forums, E-mail or Fax; basic software problems can be addressed over the telephone or, increasingly, by using remote access repair services; while more complicated problems with hardware may need to be dealt with in person.\n\n==Categories of technical support==\n\n===Call in===\nThis type of technical support has been very common in the services industry.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} It is also known as \"Time and Materials\" (T&M) IT support.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The customer pays for the materials (hard drive, memory, computer, digital devices, etc.) and also pays the technician based on the pre-negotiated rate when a problem occurs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Block hours===\nBlock hours allow the client to purchase a number of hours upfront at an agreed price. While it is commonly used to offer a reduced hourly rate, it can also simply be a standard non-reduced rate, or represent a minimum fee charged to a client before providing service.{{Original research inline|date=January 2015}} The premise behind this type of support is that the customer has purchased a fixed number of hours to use either per month or year. This allows them the flexibility to use the hours as they please without doing the paperwork and the hassle of paying multiple bills.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Managed services===\n[[Managed services]] means a company will receive a list of well-defined services on an ongoing basis, with well-defined \"response and resolution times\" for a fixed rate or a flat fee. This can include things like 24/7 monitoring of servers, 24/7 [[help desk]] support for daily computer issues, and on-site visits by a [[technician]] when issues cannot be resolved remotely.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some companies also offer additional services like [[project management]], backup and disaster recovery, and vendor management in the monthly price. The companies that offer this type of tech support are known as [[Managed services#Managed services provider|managed services providers]].\n\n===Crowdsourced technical support===\nMany companies and organizations provide [[Internet forum|discussion boards]] for users of their products to interact; such forums allow companies to reduce their support costs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/04/using-online-forums.html|work=[[Inc.

These are huge databases of step-by-step solutions, however if you visit the support sites for big brands the solutions are more often for their products alone. Another method of getting technical support that's gained popularity is to follow troubleshooting steps shown in a support video.\n\n==Outsourcing technical support==\nWith the increasing use of technology in modern times, there is a growing requirement to provide technical support. Many organizations locate their technical support departments or call centers in countries or regions with lower costs. [[Dell]] was amongst the first companies to outsource their technical support and customer service departments to India in 2001.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4853511/ns/business-forbes_com/t/dell-moves-outsourced-jobs-back-us-shores/#.VYQJmPmqqko Dell moves outsourced jobs back to U.S. shores]</ref>  There has also been a growth in companies specializing in providing technical support to other organizations.

The number of levels a business uses to organize their technical support group is dependent on a business' needs regarding their ability to sufficiently serve their customers or users. The reason for providing a multi-tiered support system instead of one general support group is to provide the best possible service in the most efficient possible manner. Success of the organizational structure is dependent on the technicians' understanding of their level of responsibility and commitments, their customer response time commitments, and when to appropriately escalate an issue and to which level.<ref name=walker>{{cite book | last= Walker| first =Gary |  title= IT Problem Management (Harris Kern\u2019s Enterprise Computing Institute Series) | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | location=Upper Saddle River | year = 2001 | pages=85\u2013113| isbn=0-13-030770-X |id=[[Google Book Search]]}}</ref> A common support structure revolves around a three-tiered technical support system.\n\n===Tier 0===\nTier 0 (or self-help) is in the form of \"wikis\", chatbots, digital virtual assistants, or FAQs that allow for users to access and resolve information on their own rather than have to contact a local Helpdesk or Service Desk for resolution.\n\n===Tier 1===\nTier I (or Level 1, abbreviated as T1 or L1) is the initial support level responsible for basic customer issues.

With the user's permission, the technician can take control of the user's mouse and keyboard inputs, transfer various diagnostic and repair applications to the user's desktop, run scans, install antivirus programs, etc. If the remote service permits it, the technician can even reboot the [[Personal computer|PC]] and reconnect remotely to continue his/her work without the user's assistance.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nCommon repairs available with online computer support providers are [[computer virus]] and [[spyware]] removal, computer optimization, [[Windows Registry]] repair, [[device driver]] issues, [[World Wide Web|Web]]-related issues, and Windows security updates.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nNormally, only software can be \"repaired\" remotely. A computer with a broken hardware component (such as a [[motherboard]] or [[hard disk]]) can, in some cases, be diagnosed and worked around but must be repaired or replaced on-site. On high-available or redundant systems the failure of a component doesn't necessarily render the whole system unusable, because an equivalent stand-by component can be remotely activated to take the faulty component's place. However an eventual on-site replacement is still required in such scenarios because the failure of the backup component will render the system unusable.\n\n==Scams==\n{{main|Technical support scam}}\n\nA common scam typically involves a [[cold caller]] claiming to be from a technical support department of a company like [[Microsoft]]. Such cold calls are often made from [[call center]]s based in [[India]] to users in [[List of countries by English-speaking population|English-speaking countries]], although increasingly these scams operate within the same country. The scammer will instruct the user to download a [[remote desktop]] program and once connected, use [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] techniques that typically involve [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] components to persuade the victim that they need to pay in order for the computer to be fixed and then proceeds to steal money from the victim's credit card.<ref>{{cite news|last = Arthur|first = Charles|title = Virus phone scam being run from call centres in India|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/phone-scam-india-call-centres|accessdate = 31 March 2014|newspaper = Guardian|date = 18 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Technical Support}}\n[[Category:Help desk]]\n[[Category:Outsourcing]]\n[[Category:Customer service]]\n[[Category:Remote desktop]]\n[[Category:Collaboration]]\n[[Category:Groupware]]\n", "name_user": "Jburns0311", "label": "safe", "comment": "Link to API wiki", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support"}

As Lowell's population grew, it acquired land from neighboring towns, and diversified into a full-fledged urban center. Many of the men who composed the labor force for constructing the canals and factories had immigrated from [[Ireland]], escaping the poverty and [[Irish Potato Famine|Potato Famines]] of the 1830s and 1840s. The mill workers, young single women called [[Mill Girls]], generally came from the farm families of New England.\n[[File:Saint Anne's Episcopal Church; Lowell, MA; south (front) side; 2011-08-20.JPG|thumbnail|right|Saint Anne's Episcopal Church, built 1824]]\n\nBy the 1850s, Lowell had the largest industrial complex in the United States. The textile industry wove cotton produced in the South. In 1860, there were more cotton spindles in Lowell than in all eleven states combined that would form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].<ref>Stephen J. Goldfarb, \"A Note on Limits to Growth of the Cotton-Textile Industry in the Old South,\" ''Journal of Southern History'', 48, (1982), 545.</ref> Yet the city did not simply finish raw materials produced in the American South, but rather became involved in the South in another way, too. Many of the coarse cottons produced in Lowell eventually returned to the South to clothe enslaved people, and, according to historian Sven Beckert, \"'Lowell' became the generic term slaves used to describe coarse cottons.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Empire of Cotton: a Global History|last = Beckert|first = Sven|publisher = Knopf|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref> The city continued to thrive as a major industrial center during the 19th century, attracting more migrant workers and immigrants to its mills. Next were the [[Catholic Germans]], followed by a large influx of [[French Canadians]] during the 1870s and 1880s. Later waves of immigrants came to work in Lowell and settled in ethnic neighborhoods, with the city's population reaching almost 50% foreign-born by 1900.<ref name=\"Yankee\">[http://www.yankeemagazine.com/issues/2009-11/features/lowell-timeline/1 Marion, Paul, \"Timeline of Lowell History From 1600s to 2009\"], ''[[Yankee Magazine|Yankee]]'' magazine, November 2009.</ref>  By the time [[World War I]] broke out in Europe, the city had reached its economic and population peak of over 110,000 people.\n\nThe Mill Cities' manufacturing base declined as companies began to relocate to [[Southern United States|the South]] in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Yankee\" /> The city fell into hard times, and was even referred to as a \"depressed industrial desert\" by ''Harper's Magazine'' in 1931, as the Great Depression worsened. At this time, more than one-third of its population was \"on relief\", as only three of its major textile corporations remained active.<ref name=\"Yankee\" /> Several years later, the mills were reactivated, making [[parachute]]s and other military necessities for the [[World War II]] effort. However, this economic boost was short-lived and the post-war years saw the last textile plants close.\n[[File:Abandoned mill in Lowell.jpg|thumbnail|left|Mills sat abandoned after industry left the city in the early twentieth century.]]\n\n== Zoning, development and the Massachusetts Miracle ==\nIn the 1970s, Lowell became part of the [[Massachusetts Miracle]], being the headquarters of [[Wang Laboratories]]. At the same time, Lowell became home to thousands of new immigrants, many from [[Cambodia]], following the [[genocide]] at the hands of the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The city continued to rebound, but this time, focusing more on culture. The former mill district along the river was partially restored and became part of the [[Lowell National Historical Park]], founded in the late 1970s.[[File:Lowell Park HQ.jpg|thumbnail|left|Former mill agent's house]]\n\nAlthough Wang went bankrupt in 1992, the city continued its cultural focus by hosting the nation's largest free folk festival, the [[Lowell Folk Festival]], as well as many other cultural events. This effort began to attract other companies and families back to the urban center. Additional historic manufacturing and commercial buildings were [[adaptive reuse|adapted]] as residential units and office space. By the 1990s, Lowell had built a new ballpark and arena, which became home to two minor league sports teams, the [[Lowell Devils]] and [[Lowell Spinners]]. The city also began to have a larger student population. The [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] and [[Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Community College]] expanded their programs and enrollment. During the period of time when Lowell was part of the Massachusetts Miracle, the Lowell City Development Authority created a Comprehensive Master Plan which included recommendations for zoning adaptations within the city. The city's original zoning code was adopted in 1926 and was significantly revised in 1966 and 2004, with changes included to respond to concerns about overdevelopment.<ref>City of Lowell Master Plan Update: Existing Conditions Report, Department of Planning and Development, December 2011, 3.0 Land-Use pg 31</ref>\n\nIn 2002, in lieu of updating the Comprehensive Master Plan, more broad changes were recommended so that the land use and development would be consistent with the current master plan. The most significant revision to the 1966 zoning code is the adoption of an inclusion of a [[transect-based zoning code]] and some aspects of a [[form-based code]] style of zoning that emphasizes urban design elements as a means to ensure that infill development will respect the character of the neighborhood or district in question. By 2004, the recommended zoning changes were unanimously adopted by the City Council and despite numerous changes to the 2004 Zoning Code, it remains the basic framework for resolving zoning issues in Lowell to this day.<ref>City of Lowell Master Plan Update: Existing Conditions Report, Department of Planning and Development, December 2011, 3.0 Land-Use pg 32</ref>\n[[File:Pawtucket Canal at Central St looking west, Lowell MA.jpg|thumbnail|right|Pawtucket Canal]]\n\nThe [[Hamilton Canal District]] (HCD) is the first district in Lowell in which regulation and development is defined by Form-Based Code (HCD-FBC) and legislated by its own guiding framework consistent to the HCD Master Plan.<ref>Hamilton Canal District Form-Based Code Zoning Section, City of Lowell Zoning Section 10.3, February 2009 pg 4</ref> The HCD is a major redevelopment project that comprises 13-acres of vacant, underutilized land in downtown Lowell abutting former industrial mills.

The [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]], a mile-long set of rapids with a total drop in elevation of 32 feet, ends where the two rivers meet. At the top of the falls is the Pawtucket Dam, designed to turn the upper Merrimack into a [[millpond]], diverted through Lowell's extensive canal system.\n\nThe Merrimack, which flows southerly from [[Franklin, New Hampshire]] to Lowell, makes a northeasterly turn there before emptying into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], approximately 40 miles downriver from Lowell. It is believed that in prior ages, the Merrimack continued south from Lowell to empty into the ocean somewhere near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The glacial deposits that redirected the flow of the river left the [[drumlin]]s that dot the city, most notably, Fort Hill in the Belvidere neighborhood. Other large hills in Lowell include Lynde Hill, also in Belvidere, and Christian Hill, in the easternmost part of Centralville at the [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]] town line.\n\nThe Concord, or Musketaquid (its original name), forms from the confluence of the [[Assabet River|Assabet]] and [[Sudbury River|Sudbury]] rivers at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. This river flows north into the city, and the area around the confluence with the Merrimack was known as Wamesit. Like the Merrimack, the Concord, although a much smaller river, has many waterfalls and rapids that served as power sources for early industrial purposes, some well before the founding of Lowell. Immediately after the Concord joins the Merrimack, the Merrimack descends another ten feet in Hunt's Falls.\n\nThere is a ninety-degree bend in the Merrimack partway down the Pawtucket Falls. At this point, the river briefly widens and shallows. Here, [[Beaver Brook (Merrimack River)|Beaver Brook]] enters from the north, separating the City's two northern neighborhoods, [[Pawtucketville]] and Centralville. Entering the Concord River from the southwest is River Meadow, or Hale's Brook. This brook flows largely in a man-made channel, as the [[Lowell Connector]] was built along it. Both of these minor streams have limited industrial histories as well.\n\nThe bordering towns (clockwise from north) are [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]], [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]], [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], and [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]]. The border with Billerica is a point in the middle{{fact|date=March 2020}} of the Concord River where Lowell and Billerica meet Tewksbury and Chelmsford.\n\nThe ten communities designated part of the Lowell Metropolitan area by the 2000 US Census are [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]], [[Dunstable, Massachusetts|Dunstable]], [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], Lowell, [[Pepperell, Massachusetts|Pepperell]], [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]], [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]], and [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]], and [[Pelham, New Hampshire|Pelham, NH]].

Christian Hill is the section of Centralville east of Bridge Street.\n\nThe '''Highlands''', ZIP Code 01851, is the most populated neighborhood, with almost a quarter of the city residing here. It is located in the southwestern section of the city, bordered to the east by the Lowell Connector and to the north by the railroad. Lowellians further distinguish the sections of the Highlands as the Upper Highlands and the Lower Highlands, the latter being the area closer to downtown. Middlesex Village, Tyler Park, and Drum Hill are in this ZIP Code. The Upper Highlands also includes the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|University of Massachusetts Lowell, South Campus]] (Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, Health Sciences & Education).\n\n'''Downtown''', '''Belvidere''', '''Back Central''', and '''South Lowell''' make up the 01852 ZIP Code, and are the southeastern sections of the city (south of the [[Merrimack River]] and southeast of the Lowell Connector). Belvidere is the mostly residential area south of the Merrimack River, east of the Concord River, and north of the Lowell and Lawrence railroad. [[Belvidere Hill Historic District]] runs along Fairmount Street. Lower Belvidere is the section west of Nesmith Street. [[Rogers Fort Hill Park Historic District]], [[Lowell Cemetery]], and [[Shedd Park (Lowell, Massachusetts)|Shedd Park]] are this side of town.Back Central is an urban area south of downtown, toward the mouth of River Meadow Brook. South Lowell is the area south of the railroad and east of the Concord River. Other neighborhoods in this ZIP Code are Ayers City, Bleachery, Chapel Hill, the Grove, Oaklands, Riverside Park, Swede Village, and Wigginville.  Although the use of the names of these smaller neighborhoods has been in decline in the past decades, there has been recently a reemergence of their use.  Downtown Lowell includes the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|UMass Lowell]] East Campus which consists of university housing, recreation facilities, research and the [[Tsongas Center|university's sports arena]], as well as the [[Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Community College]]. \n\n'''Pawtucketville''', the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]], North Campus; and the '''Acre''' make up the 01854 ZIP Code.  The Northwestern portion of the city includes the neighborhood where [[Jack Kerouac]] resided around the area of University Avenue (previously known as Moody Street). The North Campus of [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|UMass Lowell]] (Colleges of Engineering, Sciences and Business) is in Pawtucketville near the Lowell General Hospital. The older parts of the neighborhood are around University Avenue and [[Mammoth Road]], whereas the newer parts are around Varnum Avenue. Middle and elementary schools for this area include Wang Middle School, Pawtucketville Memorial, McAvinnue Elementary School, and private school Ste Jeanne d'Arc. Pawtucketville is the official entrance to the [[Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State Forest|Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsborough State Forest]], the site of an historic Native American tribe, and in the age of the Industrial Revolution was a prominent source of granite used in canals and factory foundations.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/ldtf.htm Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State Forest]</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|1830|6474\n|1840|20796\n|1850|33383\n|1860|36827\n|1870|40928\n|1880|59475\n|1890|77696\n|1900|94969\n|1910|106294\n|1920|112759\n|1930|100234\n|1940|101389\n|1950|97249\n|1960|92107\n|1970|94239\n|1980|92418\n|1990|103439\n|2000|105167\n|2010|106519\n|2018|111670\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* = population estimate.  {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}<ref name=\"1950_Census_Urban_populations_since_1790\">{{cite journal |title=1950 Census of Population|volume=1: Number of Inhabitants|at=Section 6, Pages 21-7 through 21-09, Massachusetts Table 4.

The city became known as the cradle of the [[American Industrial Revolution]], due to a large [[Lowell mills|series of textile mills]] and factories. Many of the Lowell's historic manufacturing sites were later preserved by the [[National Park Service]] to create [[Lowell National Historical Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/lowe/index.htm|title=Lowell National Historical Park |website=www.nps.gov |publisher= U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=}}</ref> During the [[Cambodian genocide]], the city took in an influx of refugees, leading to a [[Cambodia Town]] and America's second-largest [[Cambodian-American]] population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/06/08/monument-lowell-cambodian-community-past-and-its-progress/4YcAuLibteDmMoVyJqaMqM/story.html|title=Monument in Lowell the Cambodian community\u2019s past and its progress - The Boston Globe|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLowell is home to two [[higher education|institutions of higher education]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Merrimack and Concord.jpg|thumb|left|The Massachusetts Mill at the confluence of the [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] and [[Concord River|Concord]] Rivers; across the Cox Bridge are the Boott Mills; in the upper left is the historic Lowell Sun building with its iconic sign on top.]]\n\n{{Main|History of Lowell, Massachusetts|Timeline of Lowell, Massachusetts}}\nFounded in the 1820s as a planned [[manufacturing]] center for [[textile]]s, Lowell is located along the rapids of the [[Merrimack River]], 25 miles northwest of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in what was once the farming community of East [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]].

As Lowell's population grew, it acquired land from neighboring towns, and diversified into a full-fledged urban center. Many of the men who composed the labor force for constructing the canals and factories had immigrated from [[Ireland]], escaping the poverty and [[Irish Potato Famine|Potato Famines]] of the 1830s and 1840s. The mill workers, young single women called [[Mill Girls]], generally came from the farm families of New England.\n[[File:Saint Anne's Episcopal Church; Lowell, MA; south (front) side; 2011-08-20.JPG|thumbnail|right|Saint Anne's Episcopal Church, built 1824]]\n\nBy the 1850s, Lowell had the largest industrial complex in the United States. The textile industry wove cotton produced in the South. In 1860, there were more cotton spindles in Lowell than in all eleven states combined that would form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].<ref>Stephen J. Goldfarb, \"A Note on Limits to Growth of the Cotton-Textile Industry in the Old South,\" ''Journal of Southern History'', 48, (1982), 545.</ref> Yet the city did not simply finish raw materials produced in the American South, but rather became involved in the South in another way, too. Many of the coarse cottons produced in Lowell eventually returned to the South to clothe enslaved people, and, according to historian Sven Beckert, \"'Lowell' became the generic term slaves used to describe coarse cottons.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Empire of Cotton: a Global History|last = Beckert|first = Sven|publisher = Knopf|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref> The city continued to thrive as a major industrial center during the 19th century, attracting more migrant workers and immigrants to its mills. Next were the [[Catholic Germans]], followed by a large influx of [[French Canadians]] during the 1870s and 1880s. Later waves of immigrants came to work in Lowell and settled in ethnic neighborhoods, with the city's population reaching almost 50% foreign-born by 1900.<ref name=\"Yankee\">[http://www.yankeemagazine.com/issues/2009-11/features/lowell-timeline/1 Marion, Paul, \"Timeline of Lowell History From 1600s to 2009\"], ''[[Yankee Magazine|Yankee]]'' magazine, November 2009.</ref>  By the time [[World War I]] broke out in Europe, the city had reached its economic and population peak of over 110,000 people.\n\nThe Mill Cities' manufacturing base declined as companies began to relocate to [[Southern United States|the South]] in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Yankee\" /> The city fell into hard times, and was even referred to as a \"depressed industrial desert\" by ''Harper's Magazine'' in 1931, as the Great Depression worsened. At this time, more than one-third of its population was \"on relief\", as only three of its major textile corporations remained active.<ref name=\"Yankee\" /> Several years later, the mills were reactivated, making [[parachute]]s and other military necessities for the [[World War II]] effort. However, this economic boost was short-lived and the post-war years saw the last textile plants close.\n[[File:Abandoned mill in Lowell.jpg|thumbnail|left|Mills sat abandoned after industry left the city in the early twentieth century.]]\n\n== Zoning, development and the Massachusetts Miracle ==\nIn the 1970s, Lowell became part of the [[Massachusetts Miracle]], being the headquarters of [[Wang Laboratories]]. At the same time, Lowell became home to thousands of new immigrants, many from [[Cambodia]], following the [[genocide]] at the hands of the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The city continued to rebound, but this time, focusing more on culture. The former mill district along the river was partially restored and became part of the [[Lowell National Historical Park]], founded in the late 1970s.[[File:Lowell Park HQ.jpg|thumbnail|left|Former mill agent's house]]\n\nAlthough Wang went bankrupt in 1992, the city continued its cultural focus by hosting the nation's largest free folk festival, the [[Lowell Folk Festival]], as well as many other cultural events. This effort began to attract other companies and families back to the urban center. Additional historic manufacturing and commercial buildings were [[adaptive reuse|adapted]] as residential units and office space. By the 1990s, Lowell had built a new ballpark and arena, which became home to two minor league sports teams, the [[Lowell Devils]] and [[Lowell Spinners]]. The city also began to have a larger student population. The [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] and [[Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Community College]] expanded their programs and enrollment. During the period of time when Lowell was part of the Massachusetts Miracle, the Lowell City Development Authority created a Comprehensive Master Plan which included recommendations for zoning adaptations within the city. The city's original zoning code was adopted in 1926 and was significantly revised in 1966 and 2004, with changes included to respond to concerns about overdevelopment.<ref>City of Lowell Master Plan Update: Existing Conditions Report, Department of Planning and Development, December 2011, 3.0 Land-Use pg 31</ref>\n\nIn 2002, in lieu of updating the Comprehensive Master Plan, more broad changes were recommended so that the land use and development would be consistent with the current master plan. The most significant revision to the 1966 zoning code is the adoption of an inclusion of a [[transect-based zoning code]] and some aspects of a [[form-based code]] style of zoning that emphasizes urban design elements as a means to ensure that infill development will respect the character of the neighborhood or district in question.

The [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]], a mile-long set of rapids with a total drop in elevation of 32 feet, ends where the two rivers meet. At the top of the falls is the Pawtucket Dam, designed to turn the upper Merrimack into a [[millpond]], diverted through Lowell's extensive canal system.\n\nThe Merrimack, which flows southerly from [[Franklin, New Hampshire]] to Lowell, makes a northeasterly turn there before emptying into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], approximately 40 miles downriver from Lowell. It is believed that in prior ages, the Merrimack continued south from Lowell to empty into the ocean somewhere near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The glacial deposits that redirected the flow of the river left the [[drumlin]]s that dot the city, most notably, Fort Hill in the Belvidere neighborhood. Other large hills in Lowell include Lynde Hill, also in Belvidere, and Christian Hill, in the easternmost part of Centralville at the [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]] town line.\n\nThe Concord, or Musketaquid (its original name), forms from the confluence of the [[Assabet River|Assabet]] and [[Sudbury River|Sudbury]] rivers at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. This river flows north into the city, and the area around the confluence with the Merrimack was known as Wamesit. Like the Merrimack, the Concord, although a much smaller river, has many waterfalls and rapids that served as power sources for early industrial purposes, some well before the founding of Lowell. Immediately after the Concord joins the Merrimack, the Merrimack descends another ten feet in Hunt's Falls.\n\nThere is a ninety-degree bend in the Merrimack partway down the Pawtucket Falls. At this point, the river briefly widens and shallows. Here, [[Beaver Brook (Merrimack River)|Beaver Brook]] enters from the north, separating the City's two northern neighborhoods, [[Pawtucketville]] and Centralville. Entering the Concord River from the southwest is River Meadow, or Hale's Brook. This brook flows largely in a man-made channel, as the [[Lowell Connector]] was built along it. Both of these minor streams have limited industrial histories as well.\n\nThe bordering towns (clockwise from north) are [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]], [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]], [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], and [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]]. The border with Billerica is a point in the middle{{fact|date=March 2020}} of the Concord River where Lowell and Billerica meet Tewksbury and Chelmsford.\n\nThe ten communities designated part of the Lowell Metropolitan area by the 2000 US Census are [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]], [[Dunstable, Massachusetts|Dunstable]], [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], Lowell, [[Pepperell, Massachusetts|Pepperell]], [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]], [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]], and [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]], and [[Pelham, New Hampshire|Pelham, NH]].

Christian Hill is the section of Centralville east of Bridge Street.\n\nThe '''Highlands''', ZIP Code 01851, is the most populated neighborhood, with almost a quarter of the city residing here. It is located in the southwestern section of the city, bordered to the east by the Lowell Connector and to the north by the railroad. Lowellians further distinguish the sections of the Highlands as the Upper Highlands and the Lower Highlands, the latter being the area closer to downtown. Middlesex Village, Tyler Park, and Drum Hill are in this ZIP Code. The Upper Highlands also includes the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|University of Massachusetts Lowell, South Campus]] (Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, Health Sciences & Education).\n\n'''Downtown''', '''Belvidere''', '''Back Central''', and '''South Lowell''' make up the 01852 ZIP Code, and are the southeastern sections of the city (south of the [[Merrimack River]] and southeast of the Lowell Connector). Belvidere is the mostly residential area south of the Merrimack River, east of the Concord River, and north of the Lowell and Lawrence railroad. [[Belvidere Hill Historic District]] runs along Fairmount Street. Lower Belvidere is the section west of Nesmith Street. [[Rogers Fort Hill Park Historic District]], [[Lowell Cemetery]], and [[Shedd Park (Lowell, Massachusetts)|Shedd Park]] are this side of town.Back Central is an urban area south of downtown, toward the mouth of River Meadow Brook. South Lowell is the area south of the railroad and east of the Concord River. Other neighborhoods in this ZIP Code are Ayers City, Bleachery, Chapel Hill, the Grove, Oaklands, Riverside Park, Swede Village, and Wigginville.  Although the use of the names of these smaller neighborhoods has been in decline in the past decades, there has been recently a reemergence of their use.  Downtown Lowell includes the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|UMass Lowell]] East Campus which consists of university housing, recreation facilities, research and the [[Tsongas Center|university's sports arena]], as well as the [[Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Community College]]. \n\n'''Pawtucketville''', the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]], North Campus; and the '''Acre''' make up the 01854 ZIP Code.  The Northwestern portion of the city includes the neighborhood where [[Jack Kerouac]] resided around the area of University Avenue (previously known as Moody Street). The North Campus of [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|UMass Lowell]] (Colleges of Engineering, Sciences and Business) is in Pawtucketville near the Lowell General Hospital. The older parts of the neighborhood are around University Avenue and [[Mammoth Road]], whereas the newer parts are around Varnum Avenue. Middle and elementary schools for this area include Wang Middle School, Pawtucketville Memorial, McAvinnue Elementary School, and private school Ste Jeanne d'Arc. Pawtucketville is the official entrance to the [[Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State Forest|Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsborough State Forest]], the site of an historic Native American tribe, and in the age of the Industrial Revolution was a prominent source of granite used in canals and factory foundations.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/ldtf.htm Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State Forest]</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|1830|6474\n|1840|20796\n|1850|33383\n|1860|36827\n|1870|40928\n|1880|59475\n|1890|77696\n|1900|94969\n|1910|106294\n|1920|112759\n|1930|100234\n|1940|101389\n|1950|97249\n|1960|92107\n|1970|94239\n|1980|92418\n|1990|103439\n|2000|105167\n|2010|106519\n|2018|111670\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* = population estimate.  {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}<ref name=\"1950_Census_Urban_populations_since_1790\">{{cite journal |title=1950 Census of Population|volume=1: Number of Inhabitants|at=Section 6, Pages 21-7 through 21-09, Massachusetts Table 4.

However, their sound has expanded to include [[psychedelic rock]] and [[progressive rock]] elements. The band broke up in 2000 amid creative differences, but reunited in late 2003, releasing the acclaimed album ''[[Black Brick Road]]''. They released their eighth studio album, ''[[Illwill (album)|Illwill]]'', in April 2011. In 2014 they released their first live album, ''[[By the Black Sea (album)|By the Black Sea]]''.\n\n== History ==\n===Early years===\nLake of Tears was founded in the early 1990s by Daniel Brennare, Jonas Eriksson, [[Mikael Larsson]] and [[Johan Oudhuis]].  Their first album, entitled ''[[Greater Art]]'', was released through the record label [[Black Mark Production]] in 1994. The album is [[doom metal]] featuring coarse, ragged vocals and crushing guitars. The band would subsequently steer away from such a directly categorized style, only revisiting it on their 2011 release ''[[Illwill (album)|Illwill]]''.\n\nLake of Tears wowed critics and fans alike with their second recording, ''[[Headstones (album)|Headstones]]'', released in 1995. The music underwent important changes, expanding on the riff-base of [[doom metal]] to achieve a more melodic and melancholic sound. The lyrics also explored new territory, intensely mournful and psychedelic fantasy imagery enhancing the album's heavy, autumnal soundscapes.\n\n[[Image:AX Lake of Tears ProRock-02.jpg|thumb|right|Lake of Tears during ProRock-2009 festival<br />LTR: Fredrik Jordanius, Johan Oudhuis, Daniel Brennare]]\n[[Image:AX Lake of Tears ProRock-03.jpg|thumb|right|Lake of Tears during ProRock-2009 festival<br />LTR: Mikael Larsson, Johan Oudhuis, Daniel Brennare]]\n[[Image:Brennare LoT ProRock.jpg|thumb|right|Daniel Brennare at ProRock 2009 festival]]\n[[Image:Larsson LoT ProRock.jpg|thumb|right|Mikael Larsson at ProRock 2009 festival]]\n\n===Mid-career success: A Crimson Cosmos===\n1997 brought the release of the band's most popular studio effort until then, ''[[A Crimson Cosmos]]''.  If ''[[Headstones (album)|Headstones]]'' had been a revision of their earlier sound, ''A Crimson Cosmos'' was a complete rebirth, being a hypnotically melodic album.  The release's closing track, \"[[A Crimson Cosmos (song)|A Crimson Cosmos]]\", reflected a marked influence by [[Progressive rock|progressive]]/[[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] luminaries [[Pink Floyd]], while other tracks, such as [[Lady Rosenred]] and [[Raistlin and the Rose]] reflected popular fantasy themes.  Rhythm guitarist Jonas Eriksson had left the band before the release, being replaced by guitarist [[Ulrik Lindblom]]. After recording ''A Crimson Cosmos'' and touring with Lake of Tears until 1999, he also left the band and had to be substituted by [[Magnus Sahlgren]], who played as lead guitarist, but only as a guest artist. Although he played on ''[[Forever Autumn (album)|Forever Autumn]]'' and every subsequent Lake of Tears album, often composing the majority of lead guitar riffs, Sahlgren was only formally accepted as a band member following the release of 2004's ''[[Black Brick Road]]''.\n\nLake of Tears' 1999 album, ''[[Forever Autumn (album)|Forever Autumn]]'', did not follow the trend settled by ''Headstones'' and ''A Crimson Cosmos'', resulting an intensely quiet and introspective album. Keyboardist [[Christian Saarinen]] was briefly included as an official band member, adding an extra layer to the band's sound. Fantasy imagery was rife and the album's overall effect was sedate and sorrowful.\n\n===The breakup===\nBecause of personal and creative differences, but also (and perhaps more-so) because of the lack of attention the band received from their label, the band went their separate ways shortly after the release of ''Forever Autumn'', though they were still contractually bound to deliver one more album for [[Black Mark Production]]. This being the case, Brennare and Sahlgren retreated to the studio to record ''[[The Neonai]]'', an [[electronica]]-influenced album relying on drum machines and uncharacteristically slick production values. The resulting album was released in 2002, and featured some of the band's most inspired songwriting and memorable melodies, regardless of the hasty manner in which it was composed and recorded.\n\n===The reunion and recent activity===\nIn 2003 the band reunited out of boredom, participating in several jams.  They were quick to realize that the brief hiatus had reinvigorated their collective spirits, and began to tentatively compose the material eventually released on their 2004 endeavor, ''[[Black Brick Road]]''.  Feeling that [[Black Mark Production]] had failed to market them appropriately, Lake of Tears began shopping for a new record label, and eventually settled on [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]].  The subsequent release of ''Black Brick Road'' found the band exploring fresh concepts -the majority of the songs are highly abstract in nature, focusing on emotional states and dream- like imagery over specific nods to fantasy fiction and narrative structure.  Following the album's release, [[Magnus Sahlgren]] was finally accepted as a member of the band, making his almost five years association official.\n\nLake of Tears released their 7th studio album ''[[Moons and Mushrooms]]'' on April 26, 2007. The album featured a heavier approach to the guitar-work, unlike ''Black Brick Road'' whose melodies were primarily conceived via keyboard experimentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalfan.ro/articol.php?sectiune=2&id_doc=1898&lng=2 |title=LAKE OF TEARS: ... of moons and mushrooms |language=ro |website=Metalfan.ro |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref> The music was created directly in the rehearsal room, a new approach for the band. [[Moons and Mushrooms]] has a harder rock sound, though Brennare's lyrics continued to lean towards the melancholic and conceptual. \n\nA new album titled ''[[Illwill (album)|Illwill]]'' was released on April 29, 2011.

However, their sound has expanded to include [[psychedelic rock]] and [[progressive rock]] elements. The band broke up in 2000 amid creative differences, but reunited in late 2003, releasing the acclaimed album ''[[Black Brick Road]]''. They released their eighth studio album, ''[[Illwill (album)|Illwill]]'', in April 2011. In 2014 they released their first live album, ''[[By the Black Sea (album)|By the Black Sea]]''.\n\n== History ==\n===Early years===\nLake of Tears was founded in the early 1990s by Daniel Brennare, Jonas Eriksson, [[Mikael Larsson]] and [[Johan Oudhuis]].  Their first album, entitled ''[[Greater Art]]'', was released through the record label [[Black Mark Production]] in 1994. The album is [[doom metal]] featuring coarse, ragged vocals and crushing guitars. The band would subsequently steer away from such a directly categorized style, only revisiting it on their 2011 release ''[[Illwill (album)|Illwill]]''.\n\nLake of Tears wowed critics and fans alike with their second recording, ''[[Headstones (album)|Headstones]]'', released in 1995. The music underwent important changes, expanding on the riff-base of [[doom metal]] to achieve a more melodic and melancholic sound. The lyrics also explored new territory, intensely mournful and psychedelic fantasy imagery enhancing the album's heavy, autumnal soundscapes.\n\n[[Image:AX Lake of Tears ProRock-02.jpg|thumb|right|Lake of Tears during ProRock-2009 festival<br />LTR: Fredrik Jordanius, Johan Oudhuis, Daniel Brennare]]\n[[Image:AX Lake of Tears ProRock-03.jpg|thumb|right|Lake of Tears during ProRock-2009 festival<br />LTR: Mikael Larsson, Johan Oudhuis, Daniel Brennare]]\n[[Image:Brennare LoT ProRock.jpg|thumb|right|Daniel Brennare at ProRock 2009 festival]]\n[[Image:Larsson LoT ProRock.jpg|thumb|right|Mikael Larsson at ProRock 2009 festival]]\n\n===Mid-career success: A Crimson Cosmos===\n1997 brought the release of the band's most popular studio effort until then, ''[[A Crimson Cosmos]]''.  If ''[[Headstones (album)|Headstones]]'' had been a revision of their earlier sound, ''A Crimson Cosmos'' was a complete rebirth, being a hypnotically melodic album.  The release's closing track, \"[[A Crimson Cosmos (song)|A Crimson Cosmos]]\", reflected a marked influence by [[Progressive rock|progressive]]/[[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] luminaries [[Pink Floyd]], while other tracks, such as [[Lady Rosenred]] and [[Raistlin and the Rose]] reflected popular fantasy themes.  Rhythm guitarist Jonas Eriksson had left the band before the release, being replaced by guitarist [[Ulrik Lindblom]]. After recording ''A Crimson Cosmos'' and touring with Lake of Tears until 1999, he also left the band and had to be substituted by [[Magnus Sahlgren]], who played as lead guitarist, but only as a guest artist. Although he played on ''[[Forever Autumn (album)|Forever Autumn]]'' and every subsequent Lake of Tears album, often composing the majority of lead guitar riffs, Sahlgren was only formally accepted as a band member following the release of 2004's ''[[Black Brick Road]]''.\n\nLake of Tears' 1999 album, ''[[Forever Autumn (album)|Forever Autumn]]'', did not follow the trend settled by ''Headstones'' and ''A Crimson Cosmos'', resulting an intensely quiet and introspective album. Keyboardist [[Christian Saarinen]] was briefly included as an official band member, adding an extra layer to the band's sound. Fantasy imagery was rife and the album's overall effect was sedate and sorrowful.\n\n===The breakup===\nBecause of personal and creative differences, but also (and perhaps more-so) because of the lack of attention the band received from their label, the band went their separate ways shortly after the release of ''Forever Autumn'', though they were still contractually bound to deliver one more album for [[Black Mark Production]]. This being the case, Brennare and Sahlgren retreated to the studio to record ''[[The Neonai]]'', an [[electronica]]-influenced album relying on drum machines and uncharacteristically slick production values. The resulting album was released in 2002, and featured some of the band's most inspired songwriting and memorable melodies, regardless of the hasty manner in which it was composed and recorded.\n\n===The reunion and recent activity===\nIn 2003 the band reunited out of boredom, participating in several jams.  They were quick to realize that the brief hiatus had reinvigorated their collective spirits, and began to tentatively compose the material eventually released on their 2004 endeavor, ''[[Black Brick Road]]''.  Feeling that [[Black Mark Production]] had failed to market them appropriately, Lake of Tears began shopping for a new record label, and eventually settled on [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]].  The subsequent release of ''Black Brick Road'' found the band exploring fresh concepts -the majority of the songs are highly abstract in nature, focusing on emotional states and dream- like imagery over specific nods to fantasy fiction and narrative structure.  Following the album's release, [[Magnus Sahlgren]] was finally accepted as a member of the band, making his almost five years association official.\n\nLake of Tears released their 7th studio album ''[[Moons and Mushrooms]]'' on April 26, 2007. The album featured a heavier approach to the guitar-work, unlike ''Black Brick Road'' whose melodies were primarily conceived via keyboard experimentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalfan.ro/articol.php?sectiune=2&id_doc=1898&lng=2 |title=LAKE OF TEARS: ... of moons and mushrooms |language={{in lang|ro}} |website=Metalfan.ro |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref> The music was created directly in the rehearsal room, a new approach for the band. [[Moons and Mushrooms]] has a harder rock sound, though Brennare's lyrics continued to lean towards the melancholic and conceptual. \n\nA new album titled ''[[Illwill (album)|Illwill]]'' was released on April 29, 2011. It features an even heavier, darker approach, eschewing the band's typical evocation of mournful themes in favor of bleak and disturbing imagery.\n\nLake of Tears released their first-ever live album on January 31, 2014. The album is titled \"By the Black Sea,\" and includes a full concert with 16 songs recorded earlier this year in Bucharest, Romania.
