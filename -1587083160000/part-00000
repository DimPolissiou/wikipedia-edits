It is the third [[List of North American light rail systems by ridership|busiest light-rail system in North America]]. The network is concentrated primarily in [[Downtown Toronto]] and in proximity to the city's [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]]. Much of the streetcar route network dates from the 19th century. Most of Toronto's streetcar routes operate on street trackage shared with vehicular traffic, and streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses.\n\nToronto's streetcars provide most of the downtown core's surface transit service. Four of the TTC's five most heavily used surface routes are streetcar routes. In 2016, ridership on the streetcar system totalled almost 65{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"apta\" />\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Transit Commission}}\n\n===Early history (1861\u20131945)===\n[[File:Toronto Street Railway Co. horse-car 145 on King street. View from Church street.jpg|thumb|left|Horse-drawn [[Toronto Street Railway]] streetcars, 1890. By 1894, horse-drawn streetcars were replaced by electric streetcars.]]\n\nIn 1861, the [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] issued a thirty-year transit franchise (Resolution 14, By-law 353) for a [[horsecar|horse-drawn]] [[Tram|street railway]], after the [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] had become heavily loaded. Alexander Easton's [[Toronto Street Railway]] (TSR) opened the first street railway line in Canada on September 11, 1861, operating from [[Yorkville Town Hall]] to the [[St. Lawrence Market South|St. Lawrence Market]]. At the end of the TSR franchise, the City government ran the railway for eight months but ended up granting a new thirty-year franchise to the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) in 1891. The TRC was the first operator of horseless streetcars in Toronto. The first electric car ran on August 15, 1892, and the last horse car ran on August 31, 1894, to meet franchise requirements.\n\nThere came to be problems with interpretation of the franchise terms for the City. By 1912, the city limits had extended significantly, with the annexation of communities to the north (1912: [[North Toronto]]) and the east (1908: [[East Toronto|Town of East Toronto]]) and the west (1909: the City of West Toronto\u2014[[The Junction]]). After many attempts to force the TRC to serve these areas, the City created its own street railway operation, the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] to do so, and built several routes. Repeated court battles forced the TRC to build new cars, but they were of old design. When the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created, combining the city-operated [[Toronto Civic Railways]] lines into its new network.\n\nThe TTC began in 1921 as solely a streetcar operation, with the bulk of the routes acquired from the private TRC and merged with the publicly operated Toronto Civic Railways. In 1923, the TTC took over the Lambton, Davenport and Weston routes of the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] (TSR) and integrated them into the streetcar system.<!-- REFs are in referenced article -->\n\n[[File:Township of York, opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremonies for the [[Rogers Road streetcar line|Roger Road line]], in [[York, Toronto|York]], 1924. The TTC was contracted to operate streetcars in the township.]]\n\nIn 1925, routes were operated on behalf of the [[York, Toronto|Township of York]] (as Township of York Railway), but the TTC was contracted to operate them. One of these routes was the former TSR Weston route.\n\nIn 1927, the TTC became the operator of three [[Interurban|radial]] lines of the former [[Toronto and York Radial Railway]]. The TTC connected these lines to the streetcar system in order to share equipment and facilities, such as carhouses, but the radials had their own separate management within the TTC's Radial Department. The last TTC-operated radial ([[North Yonge Railways]]) closed in 1948.<!-- REFs are in referenced articles -->\n\n===Plans for abandonment (1945\u20131989)<span id=\"Abandonment plans (1945\u20131989)\"></span>===\nAfter the [[World War II|Second World War]], many cities across North America and Europe<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Alvaro |last2=Fernandes |first2=Ruben |title=Urban public transport in Europe: Technology diffusion and market organisation |journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice |date=February 2012 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=269\u2013284 |doi=10.1016/j.tra.2011.09.002}}</ref> began to eliminate their streetcar systems in favour of buses. During the 1950s, the TTC continued to invest in streetcars and the TTC took advantage of [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|other cities' streetcar removals]] by purchasing extra PCC cars from [[Cleveland]], Birmingham, Kansas City, and Cincinnati.\n[[File:Trolley bus 1965 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Streetcar and [[trolleybus]] routes/tracks in October 1965. In the next year, plans were announced to eliminate the streetcar system.]]\nIn 1966, the TTC announced plans to eliminate all streetcar routes by 1980. Streetcars were considered out of date, and their elimination in almost all other cities made it hard to buy new vehicles and maintain the existing ones. Metro Toronto chair [[William Allen (Canadian politician)|William Allen]] claimed in 1966 that \"streetcars are as obsolete as the horse and buggy\".<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Bragg |title=Our Streetcars are Near the End of the Line |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=November 13, 1967 |page=7}}</ref> Many streetcars were removed from service when [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] opened in February 1966.\n\nThe plan to abolish the streetcar system was strongly opposed by many people in the city, and a group named \"Streetcars for Toronto\" was formed to work against the plan. The group was led by Professor Andrew Biemiller and transit advocate [[Steve Munro]]. It had the support of city councillors [[William Kilbourn]] and Paul Pickett, and urban advocate [[Jane Jacobs]]. Streetcars for Toronto presented the TTC board with a report that found retaining the streetcar fleet would, in the long run, be cheaper than converting to buses. This combined with a strong public preference for streetcars over buses changed the decision of the TTC board.<ref name=\"RailwayAge2017-04-05\" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Craig |last=Cal |url=http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |title=Streetcars for Toronto \u2013 35th Anniversary |work=Spacing |date=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128071525/http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |archivedate=November 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe busiest north\u2013south and east\u2013west routes were replaced respectively by the Yonge\u2013University and the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line, and the northernmost streetcar lines, including the North Yonge and Oakwood routes, were replaced by [[Trolleybus|trolley buses]] (and later by diesel buses). Two lines that operated north of [[St. Clair Avenue]] were abandoned for other reasons.

It also continued to rebuild and maintain the existing fleet of [[Presidents' Conference Committee (Toronto streetcar)|PCC]] (Presidents' Conference Committee) streetcars until they were no longer roadworthy.\n\nWhen [[Kipling station]] opened in 1980 as the new western terminus of Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth, it had provision for a future streetcar or LRT platform opposite the bus platforms.

However, as that line was being built, the Province of Ontario persuaded the TTC to switch to using a new technology called the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro#Toronto|Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] (now Bombardier Innovia Metro) by promising to pay for any cost overruns (which eventually amounted to over $100{{nbsp}}million). Thus, the Scarborough RT (now [[Line 3 Scarborough]]) was born, and streetcar service did not return to Scarborough, instead stopping at the boundary.<ref name=\"TT-5002\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Toronto's Subway And The Scarborough RT |work=Transit Toronto |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017 |quote=Why was the Kennedy RT station renovated so soon after it was built?}}</ref>\n\n===Second period of expansion (1989\u20132000)===\n[[File:CLRVs on Spadina.jpg|thumb|left|A streetcar operating on route [[510 Spadina]]. Streetcar service on [[Spadina Avenue]] was reintroduced in 1990.]]\nThe TTC returned to building new streetcar routes in 1989. The first new line was route 604 Harbourfront, starting from [[Union station (TTC)|Union station]], travelling underneath Bay Street and rising to a dedicated centre median on [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queen's Quay]] (along the edge of [[Lake Ontario]]) to the foot of [[Spadina Avenue]]. This route was lengthened northward along Spadina Avenue in 1997, continuing to travel in a dedicated right-of-way in the centre of the street, and ending in an underground terminal at [[Spadina station]]. At this time, the route was renamed [[510 Spadina]] to fit with the numbering scheme of the other streetcar routes. This new streetcar service replaced the former route 77 Spadina bus, and since 1997 has provided the main north\u2013south transit service through [[Chinatown, Toronto|Toronto's Chinatown]] and the western boundary of [[University of Toronto]]'s main campus. The tracks along Queen's Quay were extended to Bathurst Street in 2000 to connect to the existing [[511 Bathurst|Bathurst route]], providing for a new [[509 Harbourfront]] route from Union Station to the refurbished [[Exhibition Loop]] at the [[Exhibition Place|Exhibition grounds]], where the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] is held.\n\n===21st century (2001\u2013present)===\nBy 2003, two-thirds of the city's streetcar tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10 to 15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed rail clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.<ref name=\"SteveMunro2009-10-25\">{{cite news |url=http://stevemunro.ca/2009/10/25/streetcar-track-replacement-plan-2010-2014/ |title=Streetcar Track Replacement Plan 2010\u20132014 |publisher=Steve Munro |first=Steve |last=Munro |author-link=Steve Munro |date=October 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M2003-07-14\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/state-of-tracks-forces-streetcars-to-crawl/article22394719/ |title=State of tracks forces streetcars to crawl |work=The Globe and Mail |first=Gay |last=Abbate |date=July 14, 2003 |accessdate=July 14, 2003}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Streetcar arrives at Keele from Gunns Loop.JPG|thumb|A streetcar operating on a [[reserved track]] on route [[512 St. Clair]].

When the CLRVs were introduced, the TTC assigned route numbers in the 500 series.

The other exception to the 500 series numbering was the Harbourfront LRT streetcar. When introduced in 1990, this route was numbered 604, which was intended to group it with the old numbering scheme for [[Toronto subway|Toronto subway routes]]. In 1996, the TTC overhauled its rapid transit route numbers and stopped trying to market the Harbourfront route as \"rapid transit\". The number was changed to 510. The tracks were later extended in two directions to form the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront routes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transittoronto.org/streetcar/4107.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |title=Route 509 \u2013 The New Harbourfront Streetcar |accessdate=July 21, 2007 |date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDuring times when streetcar service on all or a portion of a route has been replaced temporarily by buses (e.g., for track reconstruction, major fire, special event, heavy snowfall, lack of available streetcars, disaster), the replacement bus service is typically identified by the same route number as the corresponding streetcar line.\n\n===Subway connections===\n[[File:Main Street TTC and streetcar.JPG|thumb|left|A streetcar at {{ttcs|Main Street}} station's streetcar connection. A number of [[Toronto subway]] stations provide connections to streetcars.]]\nThere are underground connections between streetcars and the [[Toronto subway|subway]] at {{ttcs|St. Clair West}}, Spadina, and Union stations, and streetcars enter {{ttcs|St. Clair}}, {{ttcs|Dundas West}}, {{ttcs|Bathurst}}, {{ttcs|Broadview}}, and {{ttcs|Main Street}} stations at street level. At the eight downtown stations, excepting Union, from {{ttcs|Queen's Park}} to {{ttcs|College}} on Line 1 Yonge\u2013University, streetcars stop on the street outside the station entrances. Union station serves as the hub for both the TTC and the GO train system.\n\n===Dedicated rights-of-way and transit malls===\nThe majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, generally reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system, a system that dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, newer trackage has largely been established within dedicated [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]], in order to allow streetcars to operate with fewer disruptions due to delays caused by automobile traffic. Most of the system's dedicated rights-of-way operate within the median of existing streets, separated from general traffic by raised curbs and controlled by specialized traffic signals at intersections. [[501 Queen|Queen streetcars]] have operated on such a right-of-way along [[the Queensway]] between Humber and Sunnyside loops since 1957. Since the 1990s, dedicated rights-of-way have been opened downtown along [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay]], [[Spadina Avenue]], [[St. Clair Avenue]] West, and Fleet Street.\n[[File:CLRVs 4049 and 4090 Eastbound on King.jpg|thumb|The majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system.]]\nShort sections of the track also operate in a tunnel (to connect with Spadina, Union, and St. Clair West subway stations). The most significant section of underground streetcar trackage is a tunnel underneath Bay Street connecting Queens Quay with Union Station; this section, which is approximately {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, includes one [[Queens Quay station|intermediate underground station]] at Bay Street and Queens Quay.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, the TTC reinstated a separated right-of-way \u2014 removed between 1928 and 1935<ref>[http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4110.shtml Route 512 \u2013 The St Clair Streetcar]</ref> \u2014 on St. Clair Avenue, for the entire [[512 St. Clair]] route. A court decision obtained by local merchants in October 2005 had brought construction to a halt and put the project in doubt; the judicial panel then recused themselves, and the delay for a new decision adversely affected the construction schedule. A new judicial panel decided in February 2006 in favour of the city, and construction resumed in mid-2006. One-third of the St. Clair right-of-way was completed by the end of 2006 and streetcars began using it on February 18, 2007. The portion finished was from [[St. Clair station]] (Yonge Street) to [[Vaughan Road]]. The second phase started construction in mid-2007 from Dufferin Street to Caledonia Road. Service resumed using the second and third phases on December 20, 2009 extending streetcar service from St. Clair to Earlscourt Loop located just south and west of Lansdowne Avenue. The fourth and final phase from Earlscourt Loop to Gunns Loop (just west of Keele Street) is completed and full streetcar service over the entire route was finally restored on June 30, 2010.<ref>http://www3.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Construction/St_Clair_Avenue_West_Transit_Improvements_Project_-_Phase_4.jsp</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/ttc/article/830736--finally-st-clair-streetcar-fully-restored |location=Toronto |work=The Star |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |title=Finally, St. Clair streetcar fully restored |date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Queens Quay & York Street - bollards & signage.jpg|thumb|Route [[509 Harbourfront]] is a TTC streetcar route that features dedicated right-of-way lanes.]]\n\nBetween September 2007 and March 2008, the tracks on Fleet Street between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] and the [[Exhibition Loop]] were converted to a dedicated right-of-way and opened for the [[511 Bathurst]] and the [[509 Harbourfront|509 Harbourfront streetcars]]. Streetcar track and overhead power line were also installed at the Fleet loop, which is located at the [[Queen's Wharf Lighthouse]].<ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2007/09/03-fleet_stre.shtml</ref><ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml</ref>\n\nThe [[Distillery Loop and Cherry Street branch|eastern portion]] of the 504A King route runs on a side-of-street right-of-way.

Although not a dedicated right-of-way, the transit mall achieves the goal of preventing road traffic from impeding streetcar service. Road traffic is discouraged from using the mall by being forced to leave the mall via a right turn at most signalized intersections.<ref name=\"TheStar-2017-12-12\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2017/12/12/king-st-pilot-project-moving-streetcar-riders-quicker-city-says.html |title=King St. pilot project moving streetcar riders quicker, city says |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=David |last=Rider |date=December 12, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref> This project has since been extended and made permanent under the name King Street Transit Priority Corridor.<ref>https://globalnews.ca/news/4759182/king-street-pilot-project-extended/</ref>\n\n=== Track switches ===\nAt every facing switch, a \"stop, check, go\" process is used as part of a passenger safety procedure.

Because the CLRV/ALRV streetcars required extra maintenance, only 170 of the 200 CLRVs and ALRVs could be put into service. This shortage led to the replacement of streetcars by buses on some routes, which in turn led to a reduction of service on some bus routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2017-01-09\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-12-11\" />\n\nTo address the streetcar shortage, as well as construction projects, the TTC has used bus substitution at various times on several streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-10-22\" /> The first bus substitution due to the streetcar shortage occurred for the [[502 Downtowner]] route on October 11, 2016.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-01-14\" />\n\nOn February 19, 2018, the TTC replaced the CLRV streetcars on routes [[505 Dundas]] and [[506 Carlton]] with buses and reassigned those streetcars to other routes, such as [[504 King]] and [[511 Bathurst]], to handle crowding from increased ridership. Ridership on the 504 King increased by 25 percent after the implementation of the [[King Street Transit Priority Corridor]] through downtown King Street.<ref name=\"G&M-2018-01-11\" /><ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" />\n\nThe streetcar fleet capacity had not grown for almost three decades after the CLRVs and ALRVs were added. After delivery of the last of the initial 204 Flexity cars ordered, the TTC planned to purchase another 60 cars; however, the TTC estimated that would only satisfy demand until 2023 instead of 2027 as originally planned. Bombardier may end up being the chosen supplier for additional Flexity cars solely because, if the TTC went with another supplier, a prototype modified for Toronto's track characteristics would not be ready until 2023, with first delivery in 2024 or 2025.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-06-06\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/06/05/bombardier-has-inside-track-for-ttcs-next-streetcar-order.html |title=Bombardier has inside track for TTC's next streetcar order |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=June 6, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Electrical pickup==\n{{see also|Trolley pole|Pantograph (transport)}}\n[[File:CLRV Trolley Pole.jpg|thumb|left|Older streetcar models used by the TTC, like the ALRVs and CLRVs, receive their electricity by [[trolley pole]].]]\nThe older CLRV and ALRV streetcars have only a trolley pole. New Flexity Outlook streetcars are delivered with both a pantograph as well as a trolley pole. All streetcars in service had been using the trolley pole until September 12, 2017, when 509 Harbourfront became the first route to use the pantograph.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2017-09-12\" />\n\nWith the introduction of the new Flexity streetcars, the TTC plans to convert the entire system to be pantograph-compatible. The new streetcars need 50% more electrical current than the older streetcars, and use of the trolley pole limits the amount of electricity the new cars can draw from the overhead wire, resulting in reduced performance. One consequence of trolley pole use on the Flexity streetcars is that air conditioning does not function in summer.<ref name=\"TTC-2013-06-24\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2013/June_24/Reports/New_Streetcar_Implem.pdf |title=New Streetcar Implementation Plan |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |pages=22 |quote=New cars draw over 50% more current than the old cars.

The overhead over the Fleet Street tracks was the first to be so converted. The new overhead uses different hangers so that pantographs do not strike supporting crosswires. It also uses a different [[Wire gauge|gauge of wire]] to handle the higher electrical demands of Flexity Outlook streetcars.<ref name=\"TT-Log-2008-09-29\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml |title=Streetcars Roll Along Fleet Street Tomorrow |work=Transit Toronto |first=Robert |last=Mackenzie |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Pantograph & trolley pole on Queens Quay West (4417&4433).jpg|thumb|The streetcar to the left uses a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while the one on the right uses a trolley pole. Conversion of the [[overhead wire]] to be compatible with pantographs began in 2008. Note that the one on the left has [[Wrap advertising|vinyl wrap for advertising]].]]\nDuring a rainy period in February 2018, the TTC received an incentive to expedite the conversion of the electrical overhead for pantograph use by the Flexity streetcars. On February 20, 2018, Flexity streetcars using trolley poles were pulling down some of the overhead. In Toronto, the tip of the trolley pole has a shoe with a carbon insert to collect current. The carbon insert also lowers the trolley shoe so that it does not strike hangers that are not yet pantograph-compatible. During wet weather, these carbon inserts wear out faster, needing replacement after a day or two for older streetcars. However, because the Flexity streetcars draw more current than older streetcars, their carbon inserts wore out faster in less than eight hours in the wet weather. (There was also an issue with the quality of carbon the TTC purchased.) With pantographs, this would be less of a problem as the pantograph blades have a larger contact area than a trolley shoe to absorb wear. Because of this incident, the TTC decided it should accelerate the conversion of overhead for pantograph use.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2018-02-22\">{{cite web |url=https://stevemunro.ca/2018/02/22/problems-with-trolley-shoes-on-flexity-cars/ |title=Problems With Trolley Shoes on Flexity Cars |publisher=[[Steve Munro]] |first=Steve |last=Munro |date=April 27, 2018 |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first three routes to operate with pantographs were [[509 Harbourfront]] on September 12, 2017, [[510 Spadina]] on May 14, 2018, and [[512 St. Clair]] on October 1, 2018.<ref name=\"TT-4506\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4506.shtml |title=The Toronto Flexity Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) |publisher=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=October 13, 2018 |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2018-02-22\" />\n\n==Winter operational issues==\n===Extreme cold weather===\nThe fleet of CLRV and ALRV streetcars experienced several operational issues during extreme cold temperatures during late 2013 and early 2014, late 2014 and early 2015, late 2017 and early 2018, and late 2018 and early 2019, as doors and [[Railway air brake|brakes]] failed as moisture in the pneumatic lines froze.

During such storms, the TTC applies anti-freeze to the overhead wire to prevent ice from interrupting electrical contact. In addition, the TTC attaches \"sliders\" to trolley poles on every fifth streetcar to knock ice off the overhead wire. The TTC places overhead crews on standby at various locations around the streetcar network to address problems of power loss or overhead wires coming down.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\" />\n\nThe anti-freeze used on the overheard wire is also applied to streetcar switches on the network. In addition, the TTC runs \"storm cars\" on all routes to prevent any ice build-up on switches that the anti-freeze could not prevent.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\" />\n\nThese measures are applied only during freezing rain. However, during the ice storm of April 14\u201316, 2018, the TTC also used bus substitution on portions of the streetcar network outside the downtown area in order to concentrate streetcars and emergency crews into a smaller area.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Route_diversions/Ice_Storm1.jsp |title=Service changes in the event of an ice storm |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416220533/https://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Route_diversions/Ice_Storm1.jsp |archivedate=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track gauge==\n{{See also2|[[Toronto subway#Track|Toronto subway track gauge]]}}\nThe tracks of Toronto's streetcars and subways are built to the unique [[track gauge]] of {{Track gauge|58.875in|lk=on}}, {{convert|2+3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wider than the usual {{Track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}, which [[Line 3 Scarborough]] uses.<ref name=\"TorontoStar2010-01-06\">\n{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/01/06/transit_city_measures_up_to_international_standard.html |title=Transit City measures up to international standard |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archivedate=September 30, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930021110/http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/01/06/transit_city_measures_up_to_international_standard.html |url-status=live |quote=\"TTC gauge is 'English carriage gauge' and was used in Toronto well before the TTC was formed,\" explains transit blogger Steve Munro. \"There were two purposes: One was to make it impossible for the steam railways to use city tracks and the other (alleged) was to allow carriages and wagons to drive on the tracks when roads were impassable due to mud.\"}}</ref> The unique gauge has remained to this day because the integrated nature of the streetcar network makes it impossible to replace the gauge on part of the network without closing the entire network, which would be unacceptable given the extent of the system and its importance to transportation in Toronto.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Though often colloquially called the Toronto gauge, according to [[Steve Munro]], TTC gauge is \"English carriage gauge\".\n\n{{quotation|That the gauge of the said railways shall be such that the ordinary vehicles now in use may travel on the said tracks, and that it shall and may be lawful to and for all and every person and persons whatsoever to travel upon and use the said tracks with their vehicles loaded or empty, when and so often as they may please, provided they do not impede or interfere with the cars of the party of the second part (Toronto Street Railway), running thereon, and subject at all times to the right of the said party of the second part, his executors, and administrators and assigns to keep the said tracks with his and their cars, when meeting or overtaking any other vehicle thereon.<ref name=\"TT-4002\">{{cite web |url=http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Toronto's Streetcars |work=Transit Toronto |date=3 January 2003 |access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>}}\nAs wagons were normally built at standard gauge, the streetcar rails were selected to be slightly wider, allowing the wagons to ride on the inside sections of the rail, and the streetcars on the outside. The [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] changed the gauge of their buses in 1861 to fit this gauge. At the time, track for horsecars was not our modern 'T' rail, but wide and flat, with a raised section on the outside of the rail.\n[[File:Toronto Streetcar Grand Junction.jpg|thumb|A [[grand union]] at a streetcar intersection]]\nAccording to the TTC, the City of Toronto feared that the street railway franchise operator, first in 1861, the [[Toronto Street Railway]], then in 1891, the [[Toronto Railway Company]], and in 1921, the TTC, would allow the operation of steam locomotives and freight trains [[street running|through city streets]], as was common practice in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (until the 1950s) and in many US cities, such as [[New York City]] and [[Syracuse, New York]].<ref name=\"TorontoStar2010-01-06\" />\n\nStandard gauge [[Track (rail transport)|tracks]] in the streets would have allowed this, but steam railway equipment could not follow the [[Minimum railway curve radius|abrupt curves]] in the streetcar network. Opposition to freight operation in city streets precluded interchange even with adjacent [[Toronto radial lines|radial lines]] even after the lines [[Track gauge conversion|changed]] to TTC gauge. Electric railway freight cars could negotiate street curves, but freight operations to downtown were still not allowed until the final few years of radial operation by the TTC.\n\nSome proposals for the city's subway system involved using streetcars in the tunnels, possibly having some routes run partially in tunnels and partially on city streets, so the [[Toronto subway]] was built using the same gauge as streetcars, although ultimately, streetcars were never used as part of the subway system.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nBesides the Toronto streetcar and subway systems, the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] uses the Toronto gauge of {{RailGauge|58.875in}} for its museum streetcar line.\n\n===Pre-TTC===\nBefore TTC ownership, however, the streetcar gauge was either {{RailGauge|58.75in}} or {{convert|4|ft|11|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}<!-- {{RailGauge|59in}} -->, depending on the historical source, instead of today's {{RailGauge|58.875in}}.\n\nAccording to Raymond L.

The junction was used by both the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] and the [[Toronto Railway Company]].\n\nHowever, Ken Heard, Consultant Museologist, Canadian Museums Association, was reported to say: \"One of the terms of these agreements was that the track gauge was to accommodate wagons. As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the rail. Wagon wheels naturally did not have a flange. They were made of wood, with an iron tire. Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed.\"<ref name=\"TT-4002\" /> In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said \"the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof\".<ref name=\"TRC-charter\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9kKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=toronto+railway+company+track+gauge&source=bl&ots=rnnt-eVs8_&sig=wR5iN4-FrEFQXr5NXJ7FiywWqys&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio4LKfr5TMAhUBPz4KHU5xBOMQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&q=toronto%20railway%20company%20track%20gauge&f=false |title=The charter of the Toronto Railway Company |publisher=City of Toronto |pages=21 |author=City solicitor |date=1892 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n[[Image:RoncyMaintBays.jpg|thumb|Maintenance tracks at [[Roncesvalles Carhouse]], one of four maintenance and storage facilities used by the streetcar network]]\n\n===Dedicated station===\n{{ttcs|Queens Quay}} is the one standalone underground station that does not connect to the subway.

streetcar system''' is a network of ten [[tram|streetcar]] routes in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, operated by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC). It is the third [[List of North American light rail systems by ridership|busiest light-rail system in North America]]. The network is concentrated primarily in [[Downtown Toronto]] and in proximity to the city's [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]]. Much of the streetcar route network dates from the 19th century. Most of Toronto's streetcar routes operate on street trackage shared with vehicular traffic, and streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses.\n\nToronto's streetcars provide most of the downtown core's surface transit service. Four of the TTC's five most heavily used surface routes are streetcar routes. In 2016, ridership on the streetcar system totalled almost 65{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"apta\" />\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Transit Commission}}\n\n===Early history (1861\u20131945)===\n[[File:Toronto Street Railway Co. horse-car 145 on King street. View from Church street.jpg|thumb|left|Horse-drawn [[Toronto Street Railway]] streetcars, 1890. By 1894, horse-drawn streetcars were replaced by electric streetcars.]]\n\nIn 1861, the [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] issued a thirty-year transit franchise (Resolution 14, By-law 353) for a [[horsecar|horse-drawn]] [[Tram|street railway]], after the [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] had become heavily loaded. Alexander Easton's [[Toronto Street Railway]] (TSR) opened the first street railway line in Canada on September 11, 1861, operating from [[Yorkville Town Hall]] to the [[St. Lawrence Market South|St. Lawrence Market]]. At the end of the TSR franchise, the City government ran the railway for eight months but ended up granting a new thirty-year franchise to the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (TRC) in 1891. The TRC was the first operator of horseless streetcars in Toronto. The first electric car ran on August 15, 1892, and the last horse car ran on August 31, 1894, to meet franchise requirements.\n\nThere came to be problems with interpretation of the franchise terms for the City. By 1912, the city limits had extended significantly, with the annexation of communities to the north (1912: [[North Toronto]]) and the east (1908: [[East Toronto|Town of East Toronto]]) and the west (1909: the City of West Toronto\u2014[[The Junction]]). After many attempts to force the TRC to serve these areas, the City created its own street railway operation, the [[Toronto Civic Railways]] to do so, and built several routes. Repeated court battles forced the TRC to build new cars, but they were of old design. When the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] was created, combining the city-operated [[Toronto Civic Railways]] lines into its new network.\n\nThe TTC began in 1921 as solely a streetcar operation, with the bulk of the routes acquired from the private TRC and merged with the publicly operated Toronto Civic Railways. In 1923, the TTC took over the Lambton, Davenport and Weston routes of the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] (TSR) and integrated them into the streetcar system.<!-- REFs are in referenced article -->\n\n[[File:Township of York, opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremonies for the [[Rogers Road streetcar line|Roger Road line]], in [[York, Toronto|York]], 1924. The TTC was contracted to operate streetcars in the township.]]\n\nIn 1925, routes were operated on behalf of the [[York, Toronto|Township of York]] (as Township of York Railway), but the TTC was contracted to operate them. One of these routes was the former TSR Weston route.\n\nIn 1927, the TTC became the operator of three [[Interurban|radial]] lines of the former [[Toronto and York Radial Railway]]. The TTC connected these lines to the streetcar system in order to share equipment and facilities, such as carhouses, but the radials had their own separate management within the TTC's Radial Department. The last TTC-operated radial ([[North Yonge Railways]]) closed in 1948.<!-- REFs are in referenced articles -->\n\n===Plans for abandonment (1945\u20131989)<span id=\"Abandonment plans (1945\u20131989)\"></span>===\nAfter the [[World War II|Second World War]], many cities across North America and Europe<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Alvaro |last2=Fernandes |first2=Ruben |title=Urban public transport in Europe: Technology diffusion and market organisation |journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice |date=February 2012 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=269\u2013284 |doi=10.1016/j.tra.2011.09.002}}</ref> began to eliminate their streetcar systems in favour of buses. During the 1950s, the TTC continued to invest in streetcars and the TTC took advantage of [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|other cities' streetcar removals]] by purchasing extra PCC cars from [[Cleveland]], Birmingham, Kansas City, and Cincinnati.\n[[File:Trolley bus 1965 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Streetcar and [[trolleybus]] routes/tracks in October 1965. In the next year, plans were announced to eliminate the streetcar system.]]\nIn 1966, the TTC announced plans to eliminate all streetcar routes by 1980. Streetcars were considered out of date, and their elimination in almost all other cities made it hard to buy new vehicles and maintain the existing ones. Metro Toronto chair [[William Allen (Canadian politician)|William Allen]] claimed in 1966 that \"streetcars are as obsolete as the horse and buggy\".<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Bragg |title=Our Streetcars are Near the End of the Line |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=November 13, 1967 |page=7}}</ref> Many streetcars were removed from service when [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] opened in February 1966.\n\nThe plan to abolish the streetcar system was strongly opposed by many people in the city, and a group named \"Streetcars for Toronto\" was formed to work against the plan. The group was led by Professor Andrew Biemiller and transit advocate [[Steve Munro]]. It had the support of city councillors [[William Kilbourn]] and Paul Pickett, and urban advocate [[Jane Jacobs]]. Streetcars for Toronto presented the TTC board with a report that found retaining the streetcar fleet would, in the long run, be cheaper than converting to buses. This combined with a strong public preference for streetcars over buses changed the decision of the TTC board.<ref name=\"RailwayAge2017-04-05\" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Craig |last=Cal |url=http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |title=Streetcars for Toronto \u2013 35th Anniversary |work=Spacing |date=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128071525/http://spacingtoronto.ca/2007/12/01/streetcars-for-toronto-35th-anniversary/ |archivedate=November 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe busiest north\u2013south and east\u2013west routes were replaced respectively by the Yonge\u2013University and the Bloor\u2013Danforth subway line, and the northernmost streetcar lines, including the North Yonge and Oakwood routes, were replaced by [[Trolleybus|trolley buses]] (and later by diesel buses).

It also continued to rebuild and maintain the existing fleet of [[Presidents' Conference Committee (Toronto streetcar)|PCC]] (Presidents' Conference Committee) streetcars until they were no longer roadworthy.\n\nWhen [[Kipling station]] opened in 1980 as the new western terminus of Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth, it had provision for a future streetcar or LRT platform opposite the bus platforms.

However, as that line was being built, the Province of Ontario persuaded the TTC to switch to using a new technology called the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro#Toronto|Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] (now Bombardier Innovia Metro) by promising to pay for any cost overruns (which eventually amounted to over $100{{nbsp}}million). Thus, the Scarborough RT (now [[Line 3 Scarborough]]) was born, and streetcar service did not return to Scarborough, instead stopping at the boundary.<ref name=\"TT-5002\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Toronto's Subway And The Scarborough RT |work=Transit Toronto |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017 |quote=Why was the Kennedy RT station renovated so soon after it was built?}}</ref>\n\n===Second period of expansion (1989\u20132000)===\n[[File:CLRVs on Spadina.jpg|thumb|left|A streetcar operating on route [[510 Spadina]]. Streetcar service on [[Spadina Avenue]] was reintroduced in 1990.]]\nThe TTC returned to building new streetcar routes in 1989. The first new line was route 604 Harbourfront, starting from [[Union station (TTC)|Union station]], travelling underneath Bay Street and rising to a dedicated centre median on [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queen's Quay]] (along the edge of [[Lake Ontario]]) to the foot of [[Spadina Avenue]]. This route was lengthened northward along Spadina Avenue in 1997, continuing to travel in a dedicated right-of-way in the centre of the street, and ending in an underground terminal at [[Spadina station]]. At this time, the route was renamed [[510 Spadina]] to fit with the numbering scheme of the other streetcar routes. This new streetcar service replaced the former route 77 Spadina bus, and since 1997 has provided the main north\u2013south transit service through [[Chinatown, Toronto|Toronto's Chinatown]] and the western boundary of [[University of Toronto]]'s main campus. The tracks along Queen's Quay were extended to Bathurst Street in 2000 to connect to the existing [[511 Bathurst|Bathurst route]], providing for a new [[509 Harbourfront]] route from Union Station to the refurbished [[Exhibition Loop]] at the [[Exhibition Place|Exhibition grounds]], where the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] is held.\n\n===21st century (2001\u2013present)===\nBy 2003, two-thirds of the city's streetcar tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10 to 15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed rail clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.<ref name=\"SteveMunro2009-10-25\">{{cite news |url=http://stevemunro.ca/2009/10/25/streetcar-track-replacement-plan-2010-2014/ |title=Streetcar Track Replacement Plan 2010\u20132014 |publisher=Steve Munro |first=Steve |last=Munro |author-link=Steve Munro |date=October 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M2003-07-14\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/state-of-tracks-forces-streetcars-to-crawl/article22394719/ |title=State of tracks forces streetcars to crawl |work=The Globe and Mail |first=Gay |last=Abbate |date=July 14, 2003 |accessdate=July 14, 2003}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Streetcar arrives at Keele from Gunns Loop.JPG|thumb|A streetcar operating on a [[reserved track]] on route [[512 St. Clair]].

CLRVs have a single front rollsign showing various combinations of route number and destination, while PCC streetcars showed a route identifier (route name until the 1980s and later route number) and destination on two separate front rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-4503\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4503.shtml |title=The Canadian Light Rail Vehicles (The CLRVs) |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=February 7, 2017 |accessdate=October 21, 2017 |quote=Some Torontonians also didn't like it when the streetcar route names like QUEEN and KING were removed from the front rollsigns, in favour of route numbers like 501 and 504, and some blamed the CLRV's single rollsign design for this change.}}</ref> The digital destination signs on the new Flexity Outlook streetcars show route number, route name and destination.<ref name=\"TT-4506a/\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4506.shtml |title=The Toronto Flexity Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=September 14, 2017 |accessdate=October 21, 2017 |quote=Photographer Patrick Duran captured this image of Flexity LRV #4416 operating in 501 QUEEN service eastbound at Queen and Bay on May 7, 2016.

The other exception to the 500 series numbering was the Harbourfront LRT streetcar. When introduced in 1990, this route was numbered 604, which was intended to group it with the old numbering scheme for [[Toronto subway|Toronto subway routes]]. In 1996, the TTC overhauled its rapid transit route numbers and stopped trying to market the Harbourfront route as \"rapid transit\". The number was changed to 510. The tracks were later extended in two directions to form the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront routes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transittoronto.org/streetcar/4107.shtml |work=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |title=Route 509 \u2013 The New Harbourfront Streetcar |accessdate=July 21, 2007 |date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDuring times when streetcar service on all or a portion of a route has been replaced temporarily by buses (e.g., for track reconstruction, major fire, special event, heavy snowfall, lack of available streetcars, disaster), the replacement bus service is typically identified by the same route number as the corresponding streetcar line.\n\n===Subway connections===\n[[File:Main Street TTC and streetcar.JPG|thumb|left|A streetcar at {{ttcs|Main Street}} station's streetcar connection. A number of [[Toronto subway]] stations provide connections to streetcars.]]\nThere are underground connections between streetcars and the [[Toronto subway|subway]] at {{ttcs|St. Clair West}}, Spadina, and Union stations, and streetcars enter {{ttcs|St. Clair}}, {{ttcs|Dundas West}}, {{ttcs|Bathurst}}, {{ttcs|Broadview}}, and {{ttcs|Main Street}} stations at street level. At the eight downtown stations, excepting Union, from {{ttcs|Queen's Park}} to {{ttcs|College}} on Line 1 Yonge\u2013University, streetcars stop on the street outside the station entrances. Union station serves as the hub for both the TTC and the GO train system.\n\n===Dedicated rights-of-way and transit malls===\nThe majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, generally reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system, a system that dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, newer trackage has largely been established within dedicated [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]], in order to allow streetcars to operate with fewer disruptions due to delays caused by automobile traffic. Most of the system's dedicated rights-of-way operate within the median of existing streets, separated from general traffic by raised curbs and controlled by specialized traffic signals at intersections. [[501 Queen|Queen streetcars]] have operated on such a right-of-way along [[the Queensway]] between Humber and Sunnyside loops since 1957. Since the 1990s, dedicated rights-of-way have been opened downtown along [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay]], [[Spadina Avenue]], [[St. Clair Avenue]] West, and Fleet Street.\n[[File:CLRVs 4049 and 4090 Eastbound on King.jpg|thumb|The majority of streetcar routes in Toronto operate in mixed traffic, reflecting the original track configurations of the streetcar system.]]\nShort sections of the track also operate in a tunnel (to connect with Spadina, Union, and St. Clair West subway stations). The most significant section of underground streetcar trackage is a tunnel underneath Bay Street connecting Queens Quay with Union Station; this section, which is approximately {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, includes one [[Queens Quay station|intermediate underground station]] at Bay Street and Queens Quay.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, the TTC reinstated a separated right-of-way \u2014 removed between 1928 and 1935<ref>[http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4110.shtml Route 512 \u2013 The St Clair Streetcar]</ref> \u2014 on St. Clair Avenue, for the entire [[512 St. Clair]] route. A court decision obtained by local merchants in October 2005 had brought construction to a halt and put the project in doubt; the judicial panel then recused themselves, and the delay for a new decision adversely affected the construction schedule. A new judicial panel decided in February 2006 in favour of the city, and construction resumed in mid-2006. One-third of the St. Clair right-of-way was completed by the end of 2006 and streetcars began using it on February 18, 2007. The portion finished was from [[St. Clair station]] (Yonge Street) to [[Vaughan Road]]. The second phase started construction in mid-2007 from Dufferin Street to Caledonia Road. Service resumed using the second and third phases on December 20, 2009 extending streetcar service from St. Clair to Earlscourt Loop located just south and west of Lansdowne Avenue. The fourth and final phase from Earlscourt Loop to Gunns Loop (just west of Keele Street) is completed and full streetcar service over the entire route was finally restored on June 30, 2010.<ref>http://www3.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Construction/St_Clair_Avenue_West_Transit_Improvements_Project_-_Phase_4.jsp</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/ttc/article/830736--finally-st-clair-streetcar-fully-restored |location=Toronto |work=The Star |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |title=Finally, St. Clair streetcar fully restored |date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Queens Quay & York Street - bollards & signage.jpg|thumb|Route [[509 Harbourfront]] is a TTC streetcar route that features dedicated right-of-way lanes.]]\n\nBetween September 2007 and March 2008, the tracks on Fleet Street between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] and the [[Exhibition Loop]] were converted to a dedicated right-of-way and opened for the [[511 Bathurst]] and the [[509 Harbourfront|509 Harbourfront streetcars]]. Streetcar track and overhead power line were also installed at the Fleet loop, which is located at the [[Queen's Wharf Lighthouse]].<ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2007/09/03-fleet_stre.shtml</ref><ref>https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml</ref>\n\nThe [[Distillery Loop and Cherry Street branch|eastern portion]] of the 504A King route runs on a side-of-street right-of-way.

Although not a dedicated right-of-way, the transit mall achieves the goal of preventing road traffic from impeding streetcar service. Road traffic is discouraged from using the mall by being forced to leave the mall via a right turn at most signalized intersections.<ref name=\"TheStar-2017-12-12\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2017/12/12/king-st-pilot-project-moving-streetcar-riders-quicker-city-says.html |title=King St. pilot project moving streetcar riders quicker, city says |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=David |last=Rider |date=December 12, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref> This project has since been extended and made permanent under the name King Street Transit Priority Corridor.<ref>https://globalnews.ca/news/4759182/king-street-pilot-project-extended/</ref>\n\n=== Track switches ===\nAt every facing switch, a \"stop, check, go\" process is used as part of a passenger safety procedure.

Because the CLRV/ALRV streetcars required extra maintenance, only 170 of the 200 CLRVs and ALRVs could be put into service. This shortage led to the replacement of streetcars by buses on some routes, which in turn led to a reduction of service on some bus routes.<ref name=\"TheStar-2017-01-09\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-12-11\" />\n\nTo address the streetcar shortage, as well as construction projects, the TTC has used bus substitution at various times on several streetcar routes.<ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2016-10-22\" /> The first bus substitution due to the streetcar shortage occurred for the [[502 Downtowner]] route on October 11, 2016.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-01-14\" />\n\nOn February 19, 2018, the TTC replaced the CLRV streetcars on routes [[505 Dundas]] and [[506 Carlton]] with buses and reassigned those streetcars to other routes, such as [[504 King]] and [[511 Bathurst]], to handle crowding from increased ridership. Ridership on the 504 King increased by 25 percent after the implementation of the [[King Street Transit Priority Corridor]] through downtown King Street.<ref name=\"G&M-2018-01-11\" /><ref name=\"TTC-Accessible-2018-01-14\" />\n\nThe streetcar fleet capacity had not grown for almost three decades after the CLRVs and ALRVs were added. After delivery of the last of the initial 204 Flexity cars ordered, the TTC planned to purchase another 60 cars; however, the TTC estimated that would only satisfy demand until 2023 instead of 2027 as originally planned. Bombardier may end up being the chosen supplier for additional Flexity cars solely because, if the TTC went with another supplier, a prototype modified for Toronto's track characteristics would not be ready until 2023, with first delivery in 2024 or 2025.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-06-06\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/06/05/bombardier-has-inside-track-for-ttcs-next-streetcar-order.html |title=Bombardier has inside track for TTC's next streetcar order |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ben |last=Spurr |date=June 6, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Electrical pickup==\n{{see also|Trolley pole|Pantograph (transport)}}\n[[File:CLRV Trolley Pole.jpg|thumb|left|Older streetcar models used by the TTC, like the ALRVs and CLRVs, receive their electricity by [[trolley pole]].]]\nThe older CLRV and ALRV streetcars have only a trolley pole. New Flexity Outlook streetcars are delivered with both a pantograph as well as a trolley pole. All streetcars in service had been using the trolley pole until September 12, 2017, when 509 Harbourfront became the first route to use the pantograph.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2017-09-12\" />\n\nWith the introduction of the new Flexity streetcars, the TTC plans to convert the entire system to be pantograph-compatible. The new streetcars need 50% more electrical current than the older streetcars, and use of the trolley pole limits the amount of electricity the new cars can draw from the overhead wire, resulting in reduced performance. One consequence of trolley pole use on the Flexity streetcars is that air conditioning does not function in summer.<ref name=\"TTC-2013-06-24\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2013/June_24/Reports/New_Streetcar_Implem.pdf |title=New Streetcar Implementation Plan |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 |pages=22 |quote=New cars draw over 50% more current than the old cars.

The overhead over the Fleet Street tracks was the first to be so converted. The new overhead uses different hangers so that pantographs do not strike supporting crosswires. It also uses a different [[Wire gauge|gauge of wire]] to handle the higher electrical demands of Flexity Outlook streetcars.<ref name=\"TT-Log-2008-09-29\">{{cite web |url=https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml |title=Streetcars Roll Along Fleet Street Tomorrow |work=Transit Toronto |first=Robert |last=Mackenzie |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Pantograph & trolley pole on Queens Quay West (4417&4433).jpg|thumb|The streetcar to the left uses a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while the one on the right uses a trolley pole. Conversion of the [[overhead wire]] to be compatible with pantographs began in 2008. Note that the one on the left has [[Wrap advertising|vinyl wrap for advertising]].]]\nDuring a rainy period in February 2018, the TTC received an incentive to expedite the conversion of the electrical overhead for pantograph use by the Flexity streetcars. On February 20, 2018, Flexity streetcars using trolley poles were pulling down some of the overhead. In Toronto, the tip of the trolley pole has a shoe with a carbon insert to collect current. The carbon insert also lowers the trolley shoe so that it does not strike hangers that are not yet pantograph-compatible. During wet weather, these carbon inserts wear out faster, needing replacement after a day or two for older streetcars. However, because the Flexity streetcars draw more current than older streetcars, their carbon inserts wore out faster in less than eight hours in the wet weather. (There was also an issue with the quality of carbon the TTC purchased.) With pantographs, this would be less of a problem as the pantograph blades have a larger contact area than a trolley shoe to absorb wear.

During such storms, the TTC applies anti-freeze to the overhead wire to prevent ice from interrupting electrical contact. In addition, the TTC attaches \"sliders\" to trolley poles on every fifth streetcar to knock ice off the overhead wire. The TTC places overhead crews on standby at various locations around the streetcar network to address problems of power loss or overhead wires coming down.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\" />\n\nThe anti-freeze used on the overheard wire is also applied to streetcar switches on the network. In addition, the TTC runs \"storm cars\" on all routes to prevent any ice build-up on switches that the anti-freeze could not prevent.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\" />\n\nThese measures are applied only during freezing rain. However, during the ice storm of April 14\u201316, 2018, the TTC also used bus substitution on portions of the streetcar network outside the downtown area in order to concentrate streetcars and emergency crews into a smaller area.<ref name=\"TTC-2018-04-16\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Route_diversions/Ice_Storm1.jsp |title=Service changes in the event of an ice storm |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416220533/https://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Route_diversions/Ice_Storm1.jsp |archivedate=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track gauge==\n{{See also2|[[Toronto subway#Track|Toronto subway track gauge]]}}\nThe tracks of Toronto's streetcars and subways are built to the unique [[track gauge]] of {{Track gauge|58.875in|lk=on}}, {{convert|2+3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wider than the usual {{Track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}, which [[Line 3 Scarborough]] uses.<ref name=\"TorontoStar2010-01-06\">\n{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/01/06/transit_city_measures_up_to_international_standard.html |title=Transit City measures up to international standard |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Tess |last=Kalinowski |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archivedate=September 30, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930021110/http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/01/06/transit_city_measures_up_to_international_standard.html |url-status=live |quote=\"TTC gauge is 'English carriage gauge' and was used in Toronto well before the TTC was formed,\" explains transit blogger Steve Munro. \"There were two purposes: One was to make it impossible for the steam railways to use city tracks and the other (alleged) was to allow carriages and wagons to drive on the tracks when roads were impassable due to mud.\"}}</ref> The unique gauge has remained to this day because the integrated nature of the streetcar network makes it impossible to replace the gauge on part of the network without closing the entire network, which would be unacceptable given the extent of the system and its importance to transportation in Toronto.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Though often colloquially called the Toronto gauge, according to [[Steve Munro]], TTC gauge is \"English carriage gauge\".\n\n{{quotation|That the gauge of the said railways shall be such that the ordinary vehicles now in use may travel on the said tracks, and that it shall and may be lawful to and for all and every person and persons whatsoever to travel upon and use the said tracks with their vehicles loaded or empty, when and so often as they may please, provided they do not impede or interfere with the cars of the party of the second part (Toronto Street Railway), running thereon, and subject at all times to the right of the said party of the second part, his executors, and administrators and assigns to keep the said tracks with his and their cars, when meeting or overtaking any other vehicle thereon.<ref name=\"TT-4002\">{{cite web |url=http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4002.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Toronto's Streetcars |work=Transit Toronto |date=3 January 2003 |access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>}}\nAs wagons were normally built at standard gauge, the streetcar rails were selected to be slightly wider, allowing the wagons to ride on the inside sections of the rail, and the streetcars on the outside. The [[Williams Omnibus Bus Line]] changed the gauge of their buses in 1861 to fit this gauge. At the time, track for horsecars was not our modern 'T' rail, but wide and flat, with a raised section on the outside of the rail.\n[[File:Toronto Streetcar Grand Junction.jpg|thumb|A [[grand union]] at a streetcar intersection.]]\nAccording to the TTC, the City of Toronto feared that the street railway franchise operator, first in 1861, the [[Toronto Street Railway]], then in 1891, the [[Toronto Railway Company]], and in 1921, the TTC, would allow the operation of steam locomotives and freight trains [[street running|through city streets]], as was common practice in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (until the 1950s) and in many US cities, such as [[New York City]] and [[Syracuse, New York]].<ref name=\"TorontoStar2010-01-06\" />\n\nStandard gauge [[Track (rail transport)|tracks]] in the streets would have allowed this, but steam railway equipment could not follow the [[Minimum railway curve radius|abrupt curves]] in the streetcar network. Opposition to freight operation in city streets precluded interchange even with adjacent [[Toronto radial lines|radial lines]] even after the lines [[Track gauge conversion|changed]] to TTC gauge. Electric railway freight cars could negotiate street curves, but freight operations to downtown were still not allowed until the final few years of radial operation by the TTC.\n\nSome proposals for the city's subway system involved using streetcars in the tunnels, possibly having some routes run partially in tunnels and partially on city streets, so the [[Toronto subway]] was built using the same gauge as streetcars, although ultimately, streetcars were never used as part of the subway system.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nBesides the Toronto streetcar and subway systems, the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] uses the Toronto gauge of {{RailGauge|58.875in}} for its museum streetcar line.\n\n===Pre-TTC===\nBefore TTC ownership, however, the streetcar gauge was either {{RailGauge|58.75in}} or {{convert|4|ft|11|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}<!-- {{RailGauge|59in}} -->, depending on the historical source, instead of today's {{RailGauge|58.875in}}.\n\nAccording to Raymond L.

As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the rail. Wagon wheels naturally did not have a flange. They were made of wood, with an iron tire. Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed.\"<ref name=\"TT-4002\" /> In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said \"the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof\".<ref name=\"TRC-charter\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9kKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=toronto+railway+company+track+gauge&source=bl&ots=rnnt-eVs8_&sig=wR5iN4-FrEFQXr5NXJ7FiywWqys&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio4LKfr5TMAhUBPz4KHU5xBOMQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&q=toronto%20railway%20company%20track%20gauge&f=false |title=The charter of the Toronto Railway Company |publisher=City of Toronto |pages=21 |author=City solicitor |date=1892 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n[[Image:RoncyMaintBays.jpg|thumb|Maintenance tracks at [[Roncesvalles Carhouse]], one of four maintenance and storage facilities used by the streetcar network]]\n\n===Dedicated station===\n{{ttcs|Queens Quay}} is the one standalone underground station that does not connect to the subway.

First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |website=United States Department of State |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197, translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155\u2013156, & 164\u2013169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903\u20131907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |website=United States Department of State |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197, translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155\u2013156, & 164\u2013169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903\u20131907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set \u2013 U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

This is what Martin Luserke, a popular novelist and educator, tried to do in an essay on work motivation published in 1919 as part of a series Praktischer Sozialismus (\u201ePractical Socialism\u201c) edited by the philosopher Karl Korsch. Like Ruckhaber, Luserke thought it wrong to make a distinction between mental and physical labour. This led him to call for a \u201esocialist\u201c ethic of work to replace the bourgeois-idealist one based on this distinction, which only helped to perpetuate the hierarchy of classes. Under socialism people of all walks of life would be taught to work for one another and to accept discipline in order to achieve common goals. Where Luserke chiefly differed from Ruckhaber is in his belief that intellectual work is hardly \u201ework\u201c at all, but rather intrinsically pleasurable activity and therefore in some sense its own reward. As a result, he was not particularly concerned with improving the remuneration of intellectuals or cutting back on their hours of work. But he did think that workers of the mind needed special conditions if they were to serve society effectively. To make their different treatment acceptable to the majority of workers whose days were spent in hard, routine, labour, it was necessary to adopt the principle of meritocracy: in Luserke's utopia, examinations would be used to select the few needed for intellectual tasks, and these individuals would then be given non-monetary privileges and rewards, including the opportunity to experience joy in work.)</ref> He was one of the leading figures of German [[progressive education]] and a precursor of [[outdoor education]].<ref>Herbert Giffei: ''Martin Luserke \u2013 Ein Wegbereiter der modernen Erlebnisp\u00e4dagogik'', in: Wegbereiter der modernen Erlebnisp\u00e4dagogik, Vol. 6, Klaus Neubauer Verlag, L\u00fcneburg 1987.</ref> As his distinguished achievement counts the integration of [[community theatre]] into school and [[youth work]].<ref>Mirona Stanescu: ''Vom Laientheater zur Theaterp\u00e4dagogik.

In his book Luserke opted for a socialist ethics of work which should follow common interests.<ref>Joan Campbell: ''Joy in Work, German Work: The National Debate, 1800\u20131945''. Princeton University Press 2014. {{ISBN|978-1400860371}}, pp. 126\u2013127. (Citation: \"It seemed essential to remind people, that the post-revolutionary society must also meet the needs of the nation's intellectuals. This is what Martin Luserke, a popular novelist and educator, tried to do in an essay on work motivation published in 1919 as part of a series Praktischer Sozialismus (\u201ePractical Socialism\u201c) edited by the philosopher Karl Korsch. Like Ruckhaber, Luserke thought it wrong to make a distinction between mental and physical labour. This led him to call for a \u201esocialist\u201c ethic of work to replace the bourgeois-idealist one based on this distinction, which only helped to perpetuate the hierarchy of classes. Under socialism people of all walks of life would be taught to work for one another and to accept discipline in order to achieve common goals. Where Luserke chiefly differed from Ruckhaber is in his belief that intellectual work is hardly \u201ework\u201c at all, but rather intrinsically pleasurable activity and therefore in some sense its own reward. As a result, he was not particularly concerned with improving the remuneration of intellectuals or cutting back on their hours of work. But he did think that workers of the mind needed special conditions if they were to serve society effectively. To make their different treatment acceptable to the majority of workers whose days were spent in hard, routine, labour, it was necessary to adopt the principle of meritocracy: in Luserke's utopia, examinations would be used to select the few needed for intellectual tasks, and these individuals would then be given non-monetary privileges and rewards, including the opportunity to experience joy in work.\")</ref>\n\nIn school pedagogical conflicts with Gustav Wyneken were persistent. Wyneken was part of several paedophile scandals and later got sentenced. Some other teachers also were paedophiles. Luserke, Rudolf Aeschlimann (1884\u20131961) and Dr. Paul Reiner (1886\u20131932) first formed a so-called [[triumvirate]] in opposition to Wyneken and his followers. It resulted not only in a polarization but in a development of factions which divided teachers, employees and pupils.

This is what Martin Luserke, a popular novelist and educator, tried to do in an essay on work motivation published in 1919 as part of a series Praktischer Sozialismus (\u201ePractical Socialism\u201c) edited by the philosopher Karl Korsch. Like Ruckhaber, Luserke thought it wrong to make a distinction between mental and physical labour. This led him to call for a \u201esocialist\u201c ethic of work to replace the bourgeois-idealist one based on this distinction, which only helped to perpetuate the hierarchy of classes. Under socialism people of all walks of life would be taught to work for one another and to accept discipline in order to achieve common goals. Where Luserke chiefly differed from Ruckhaber is in his belief that intellectual work is hardly \u201ework\u201c at all, but rather intrinsically pleasurable activity and therefore in some sense its own reward. As a result, he was not particularly concerned with improving the remuneration of intellectuals or cutting back on their hours of work. But he did think that workers of the mind needed special conditions if they were to serve society effectively. To make their different treatment acceptable to the majority of workers whose days were spent in hard, routine, labour, it was necessary to adopt the principle of meritocracy: in Luserke's utopia, examinations would be used to select the few needed for intellectual tasks, and these individuals would then be given non-monetary privileges and rewards, including the opportunity to experience joy in work.)</ref> He was one of the leading figures of German [[progressive education]] and a precursor of [[outdoor education]].<ref>Herbert Giffei: ''Martin Luserke \u2013 Ein Wegbereiter der modernen Erlebnisp\u00e4dagogik'', in: Wegbereiter der modernen Erlebnisp\u00e4dagogik, Vol. 6, Klaus Neubauer Verlag, L\u00fcneburg 1987.</ref> As his distinguished achievement counts the integration of [[community theatre]] into school and [[youth work]].<ref>Mirona Stanescu: ''Vom Laientheater zur Theaterp\u00e4dagogik.

But he did think that workers of the mind needed special conditions if they were to serve society effectively. To make their different treatment acceptable to the majority of workers whose days were spent in hard, routine, labour, it was necessary to adopt the principle of meritocracy: in Luserke's utopia, examinations would be used to select the few needed for intellectual tasks, and these individuals would then be given non-monetary privileges and rewards, including the opportunity to experience joy in work.\")</ref>\n\nIn school pedagogical conflicts with Gustav Wyneken were persistent. Wyneken was part of several paedophile scandals and later got sentenced. Some other teachers also were paedophiles. Luserke, Rudolf Aeschlimann (1884\u20131961) and Dr. Paul Reiner (1886\u20131932) first formed a so-called [[triumvirate]] in opposition to Wyneken and his followers. It resulted not only in a polarization but in a development of factions which divided teachers, employees and pupils. Luserke decided to found a new school \"at the border of the habitable world\".<ref>Prof. Dr. Dr. J\u00f6rg W.

He was also a member of the politically left-of-centre [[Wandervogel]] hiking movement.<ref name=ASlautNDB/>   Alexander Schwab received his doctorate from [[Heidelberg University]] in 1913.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   His doctoral dissertation was entitled \"The influence of consumption on the German furniture industry and production\" (''\"Der Einflu\u00df der Konsumtion auf M\u00f6belindustrie und M\u00f6belproduktion in Deutschland\"''), but when it was published two years later it was under the shorter title  \"M\u00f6belkonsumtion und M\u00f6belproduktion in Deutschland\".<ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\n=== Young intellectual ===\nFor a year following the award of his doctorate, during 1913/14, Schwab taught at the [[:de:Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf|Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf]], a progressive school that had been founded by the controversial education pioneer Gustav Wyneken in the countryside south of [[Erfurt]] in 1906.   Several historians describe Schwab during this period as one of the leading intellects of the influential [[German Youth Movement|Free German Youth]] movement.   In October 1913 he participated in the first ever [[:de:Erster Freideutscher Jugendtag|Free German Youth Day]] in the [[Hoher Mei\u00dfner]] hills north of [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]].<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>    In the months before the war he also involved himself in conceptualising and organising democratically elected [[AStA |\"General Student Committees\" (''\"Allgemeiner Studenten-Aussch\u00fcsse\"'')]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\nAround this time Schwab and some of his intellectual friends rented a large house in [[Jena]] and embarked on what was seen at the time as a remarkable experiment in cohabitation, whereby four unmarried young men and four unmarried young women all lived together in the one house.   On 8 May 1914 the unmarried status of two members of the cohabiting community ended when Alexander Schwab married Dr Hildegard  Felisch:  it was her twenty-fifth birthday.<ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\n=== War and ... political idealism ===\nAt the end of July 1914 [[World War I|war broke out]].   Alexander Schwab lost little time in volunteering for the army.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   He was very quickly rejected for military service, however, on account of a [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] (''\"Lungen-Blutsturz\"'').<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   He was instead sent to a desk job in the war supplies department.  Later he found himself working in [[Dresden]] at the [[:de:Zigarettenfabrik Jasmatzi|\"Jasmatzi\" cigarette factory]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\nDespite having volunteered for military service in 1914, by 1918 Alexander Schwab had joined the anti-war movement.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   He became friendly with the radical socialist educationalist [[Otto R\u00fchle]] (1874\u20131943) and with the young artist [[Conrad Felixm\u00fcller]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>   In 1917 Schwab joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party (''\"Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / USPD)]] which had broken away from the mainstream [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (''\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / SPD)]] following an intensification of internal party ructions over [[Burgfriedenspolitik|funding for the war]].<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   The next year he joined the [[Spartacus League]]:  he was numbered among the close friends of the movement's best-known founders, [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].<ref name=ASlautHDK/>\n\n=== Communist Workers' Party of Germany ===\nAt the end of the year the [[Communist Party of Germany]] emerged from the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]], founded formally at a three day conference in Berlin between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919.   Schwab found himself on the left wing of the Communist Party, collaborating closely with [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]] (1884\u20131950).   Beyond the world of party politics, directly following the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolutions of 1918/19]], he teamed up with the teacher Frieda Winckelmann (1873\u20131943) and others to set up a \"Free academy community for proletarians\" (''\"Freie Hochschulgemeinde f\u00fcr Proletarier\"'') from which emerged, in the first part of 1919, the \"Soviet school of the Greater Berlin labour movement\" (''\"R\u00e4teschule der Gro\u00df-Berliner Arbeiterschaft\"'').   Barely two years later the institution became insolvent and was taken over by the trades unions.<ref name=ASlautNDB/>   \n\nThe parties of the left were prone to fragment during this period, and in 1920 Alexander Schwab and his friend [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]] were founder members of the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|Communist Workers' Party (''\"Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\"'' / KAPD)]], becoming a leading ideological strategist of its Berlin group.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   In June/July 1921 he led the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|KAPD]] delegation to the [[3rd World Congress of the Comintern|third world congress]] of the [[Communist International|Communist International (Comintern)]], held in [[Moscow]].   He was sharply critical of [[Lenin|Comrade Lenin's]] political tactics in respect of western Europe:<ref name=ASlautHDK/>  the speeches he contributed were published in the congress minutes, using the cover name \"Sachs\" to identify him.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/><ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\n=== Progressive journalist ===\nAfter the Moscow congress there was a cooling in relations between Schwab's wing of the KAPD and the [[Comintern]] head quarters, based in Moscow.   Back in Germany his friend and political ally [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]] was removed from his position as head of a major group within the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|KAPD]] in 1922.  This was part of a more general reconfiguration of the party, and Alexander Schwab himself left the party later that year.   The party's two principal strands staggered on, increasingly divided between themselves, for a few more years, but Schwab now removed himself from direct engagement with party politics.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   He supported himself as a freelance journalist and author specialising in economics, and increasingly also in architecture.    Some of his output appeared under the pseudonym \"Albert Sigrist\".<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   Publications in which his contributions appeared most frequently included the [[Berliner Tageblatt]], the [[:de:Berliner B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung|Berliner B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung]] and Das Neue Berlin (newspapers).<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   From 1927 he was also writing on architecture for \"Die Form\", the journal of the [[Deutscher Werkbund|Deutscher Werkbund (''loosely: \"German Craft Association\"'')]].   According to one commentator these contributions marked him out as \"one of the most clear sighted writers on architecture of his time\".<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   \n\nFrom 1928 Schwab was also involved with the \"Social Sciences Association\" (''\"Sozialwissenschaftliche Vereinigung\"'' / SWV), according to at least one source as one if its founders.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   His contributions at its meetings became progressively more frequent over the next few years.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   Several of his more prominent friends and contacts at this time were architects, on what would generally have been seen as the progressive wing of the profession.   He teamed up with several, including [[Hugo H\u00e4ring]], [[Ludwig Hilberseimer]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and Martin M\u00e4chler to produce \"Das Buch vom Bauen\", a book which appeared in 1930 under the pseudonym \"Albert Sigrist\".<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   (Subsequent reprints have been published acknowledging Alexander Schwab's authorship on the cover.<ref name=BvB>{{cite book| title=Das Buch vom Bauen:  Wohnungsnot, neue Technik, neue Baukunst, St\u00e4dtebau|author1= Alexander Schwab| author2=erschienen 1930 unter d.

Schwab was dismissed from his job as a press spokesman under the provisions of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (''\"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\"'')]] enacted in April 1933.   The law is frequently cited as an antisemitic device, which it was, but it was also directed at eliminating political opposition from the public services, and Schwab's very public political record would have been repugnant to the Nazis.   That same month he was taken into \"protective custody\" by the [[Gestapo]] on account of suspected anti-state activities (''\"wegen des Verdachts staatsfeindlicher Umtriebe\"'').<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   Sources vary as to the duration of this initial period of detention, which seems to have last for approximately two<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/><ref name=ASlautNDB/> or six months.<ref name=ASlautHDK/><ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   One source indicates that his (relatively) early release resulted from the personal intervention of his father-in-law, Dr. Paul Felisch, with [[:de:Magnus von Levetzow|Magnus von Levetzow]], the Berlin police commissioner.   As a former senior naval official ([[:de:Admiralit\u00e4tsrat|Admiralit\u00e4tsrat]]), Paul Felisch was at this stage still not without influence within establishment circles.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>\n\nEven before [[Machtergreifung|1933]] Schwab had teamed up with old comrades from their [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|KAPD]] days to form the secretive [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer (''\"Red fighters\"'')]] operation, an apparently broadly based association drawing members from various groups on the political left, intended to prepare for \"underground opposition\" in the event of a Nazi take-over.   By its nature, details of the organisation are in short supply, but others involved in setting it up included [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]], [[Arthur Goldstein]] and [[Bernhard Reichenbach]].<ref name=RoKa>{{cite web|title=Die Roten K\u00e4mpfer|work=Zur  Geschichte  einer  linken   Widerstandsgruppe   |date=4 June 1959|url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1959_4_6_rothfels.pdf|publisher=Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte, M\u00fcnchen| accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nSchwab had been seriously considering emigration to [[Mexico]].   However, shortly after his release his wife Hildegard died, which some sources implicitly connect with his new determination to stay in Germany and engage in (illegal) political activity in opposition to the government.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   He joined with [[Franz Jung]] to launch \"Wirtschaftskorrespondenz\", a press agency with its focus on business news.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   It evidently filled a genuine niche in the market for this type of service, at one stage supplying regular economic news items to more than fifty newspapers, including [[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]], the mass circulation daily newspaper of the ruling [[Nazi Party]].<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   The agency provided him with an income.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   In the words of one source, Schwab and Jung also \"used [the agency] as a cover for [unspecified] underground political activity\".<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   \n\n=== Arrest, interrogation and trial ===\nIt is not entirely clear when Alexander Schwab took over the national leadership of the shadowy [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer (''\"Red fighters\"'')]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>   On at least one occasion, early in 1936 he crossed the border to [[Prague]] in order to arrange the production of a Rote K\u00e4mpfer news sheet.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   While in Prague he received warnings not to return to Germany.   He nevertheless returned to [[Berlin]] and, if he had not done so already, became the Rote K\u00e4mpfer national leader.  In the context of a wider round-up of the organisation's leadership, Alexander Schwab's office was surrounded by [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi paramilitaries]] on 17 November 1936 and he was arrested.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/> \n\nIn the interrogations that followed he was badly tortured.   At the session that took place on 21 November 1936 he was keen to take full responsibility for the [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer]] on his own shoulders.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/><ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   He was, in particularly, determined to minimise the culpability attaching to [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]], [[Franz Jung]] and, in particular, the younger members of the leadership team.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   It is one mark of his success that both Schr\u00f6der and Jung survived long enough to outlive the Nazi r\u00e9gime.   Jung, indeed, was released almost at once, and able to escape, via [[Prague]], to [[Budapest]].<ref name=FJlautHDK>{{cite web| url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=4532|title=Jung, Franz   * 26.11.1888, \u2020 21.1.1963|author1=[[Hermann Weber]]| author2=[[Andreas Herbst]]| work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a year of \"investigative detention\", six members of the [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer]] leadership, identified in the record as \"Schwab and comrades\" (''\"Schwab und Genossen\"''),<ref name=ASlautHDK/> faced trial before the \"second senate\" of the [[People's Court (Germany)|special \"People's Court\"]] in Berlin on 28, 29 and 30 October 1937.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   One of the defendants, [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]], later shared some memories of the trial.  The three judges did not appear to have backgrounds in the justice system.<ref name=RoKa/>   The third of them was a teacher who attempted to calculate a sentence for one of the defendants.  He appeared unaware of the requirement to take account of pre-trial detention already served, but then wanted to reduce the sentence because the man to be sentenced had done some teaching, which sounded to him like a mitigating factor.<ref name=RoKa/>   When it was Schr\u00f6der's own turn to testify he found himself talking about a public meeting at which he had talked about \"generational issues\" (''\"Generationsfrage \"'').   His testimony had to be paused while a colleague explained to the leading judge, \"he means, sort of, between young and old\" (''\"Er  meint,  so  zwischen  jung  und  alt.\"'').   The three judges were evidently unable to get their heads around the fact that despite the defendants obviously being communists, they were also self evidently fervently anti-Bolshevik.<ref name=RoKa/>   According to Schr\u00f6der's not necessarily completely unbiased memories, he himself had so impressed the court that they came close to releasing him without further ado on the grounds that he was evidently \"not entirely of sound mind\" (''\"nicht  ganz zurechnungsf\u00e4hig\"'').<ref name=RoKa/>   In the end  [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)| Schr\u00f6der]] received a four year prison term.

In October 1913 he participated in the first ever [[:de:Erster Freideutscher Jugendtag|Free German Youth Day]] in the [[Hoher Mei\u00dfner]] hills north of [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]].<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>    In the months before the war he also involved himself in conceptualising and organising democratically elected [[AStA |\"General Student Committees\" (''\"Allgemeiner Studenten-Aussch\u00fcsse\"'')]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\nAround this time Schwab and some of his intellectual friends rented a large house in [[Jena]] and embarked on what was seen at the time as a remarkable experiment in cohabitation, whereby four unmarried young men and four unmarried young women all lived together in the one house.   On 8 May 1914 the unmarried status of two members of the cohabiting community ended when Alexander Schwab married Dr Hildegard  Felisch:  it was her twenty-fifth birthday.<ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\n=== War and ... political idealism ===\nAt the end of July 1914 [[World War I|war broke out]].   Alexander Schwab lost little time in volunteering for the army.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   He was very quickly rejected for military service, however, on account of a [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] (''\"Lungen-Blutsturz\"'').<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   He was instead sent to a desk job in the war supplies department.  Later he found himself working in [[Dresden]] at the [[:de:Zigarettenfabrik Jasmatzi|\"Jasmatzi\" cigarette factory]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\nDespite having volunteered for military service in 1914, by 1918 Alexander Schwab had joined the anti-war movement.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   He became friendly with the radical socialist educationalist [[Otto R\u00fchle]] (1874\u20131943) and with the young artist [[Conrad Felixm\u00fcller]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>   In 1917 Schwab joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party (''\"Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / USPD)]] which had broken away from the mainstream [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (''\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / SPD)]] following an intensification of internal party ructions over [[Burgfriedenspolitik|funding for the war]].<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   The next year he joined the [[Spartacus League]]:  he was numbered among the close friends of the movement's best-known founders, [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].<ref name=ASlautHDK/>\n\n=== Communist Workers' Party of Germany ===\nAt the end of the year the [[Communist Party of Germany]] emerged from the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]], founded formally at a three day conference in Berlin between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919.   Schwab found himself on the left wing of the Communist Party, collaborating closely with [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]] (1884\u20131950).   Beyond the world of party politics, directly following the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolutions of 1918/19]], he teamed up with the teacher Frieda Winckelmann (1873\u20131943) and others to set up a \"Free academy community for proletarians\" (''\"Freie Hochschulgemeinde f\u00fcr Proletarier\"'') from which emerged, in the first part of 1919, the \"Soviet school of the Greater Berlin labour movement\" (''\"R\u00e4teschule der Gro\u00df-Berliner Arbeiterschaft\"'').   Barely two years later the institution became insolvent and was taken over by the trades unions.<ref name=ASlautNDB/>   \n\nThe parties of the left were prone to fragment during this period, and in 1920 Alexander Schwab and his friend [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]] were founder members of the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|Communist Workers' Party (''\"Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\"'' / KAPD)]], becoming a leading ideological strategist of its Berlin group.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   In June/July 1921 he led the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|KAPD]] delegation to the [[3rd World Congress of the Comintern|third world congress]] of the [[Communist International|Communist International (Comintern)]], held in [[Moscow]].   He was sharply critical of [[Lenin|Comrade Lenin's]] political tactics in respect of western Europe:<ref name=ASlautHDK/>  the speeches he contributed were published in the congress minutes, using the cover name \"Sachs\" to identify him.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/><ref name=ASlautNDB/>\n\n=== Progressive journalist ===\nAfter the Moscow congress there was a cooling in relations between Schwab's wing of the KAPD and the [[Comintern]] head quarters, based in Moscow.   Back in Germany his friend and political ally [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]] was removed from his position as head of a major group within the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|KAPD]] in 1922.  This was part of a more general reconfiguration of the party, and Alexander Schwab himself left the party later that year.   The party's two principal strands staggered on, increasingly divided between themselves, for a few more years, but Schwab now removed himself from direct engagement with party politics.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   He supported himself as a freelance journalist and author specialising in economics, and increasingly also in architecture.    Some of his output appeared under the pseudonym \"Albert Sigrist\".<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   Publications in which his contributions appeared most frequently included the [[Berliner Tageblatt]], the [[:de:Berliner B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung|Berliner B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung]] and Das Neue Berlin (newspapers).<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   From 1927 he was also writing on architecture for \"Die Form\", the journal of the [[Deutscher Werkbund|Deutscher Werkbund (''loosely: \"German Craft Association\"'')]].   According to one commentator these contributions marked him out as \"one of the most clear sighted writers on architecture of his time\".<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   \n\nFrom 1928 Schwab was also involved with the \"Social Sciences Association\" (''\"Sozialwissenschaftliche Vereinigung\"'' / SWV), according to at least one source as one if its founders.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   His contributions at its meetings became progressively more frequent over the next few years.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   Several of his more prominent friends and contacts at this time were architects, on what would generally have been seen as the progressive wing of the profession.   He teamed up with several, including [[Hugo H\u00e4ring]], [[Ludwig Hilberseimer]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and Martin M\u00e4chler to produce \"Das Buch vom Bauen\", a book which appeared in 1930 under the pseudonym \"Albert Sigrist\".<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   (Subsequent reprints have been published acknowledging Alexander Schwab's authorship on the cover.<ref name=BvB>{{cite book| title=Das Buch vom Bauen:  Wohnungsnot, neue Technik, neue Baukunst, St\u00e4dtebau|author1= Alexander Schwab| author2=erschienen 1930 unter d.

Schwab was dismissed from his job as a press spokesman under the provisions of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (''\"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\"'')]] enacted in April 1933.   The law is frequently cited as an antisemitic device, which it was, but it was also directed at eliminating political opposition from the public services, and Schwab's very public political record would have been repugnant to the Nazis.   That same month he was taken into \"protective custody\" by the [[Gestapo]] on account of suspected anti-state activities (''\"wegen des Verdachts staatsfeindlicher Umtriebe\"'').<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   Sources vary as to the duration of this initial period of detention, which seems to have last for approximately two<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/><ref name=ASlautNDB/> or six months.<ref name=ASlautHDK/><ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   One source indicates that his (relatively) early release resulted from the personal intervention of his father-in-law, Dr. Paul Felisch, with [[:de:Magnus von Levetzow|Magnus von Levetzow]], the Berlin police commissioner.   As a former senior naval official ([[:de:Admiralit\u00e4tsrat|Admiralit\u00e4tsrat]]), Paul Felisch was at this stage still not without influence within establishment circles.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>\n\nEven before [[Machtergreifung|1933]] Schwab had teamed up with old comrades from their [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany|KAPD]] days to form the secretive [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer (''\"Red fighters\"'')]] operation, an apparently broadly based association drawing members from various groups on the political left, intended to prepare for \"underground opposition\" in the event of a Nazi take-over.   By its nature, details of the organisation are in short supply, but others involved in setting it up included [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]], [[Arthur Goldstein]] and [[Bernhard Reichenbach]].<ref name=RoKa>{{cite web|title=Die Roten K\u00e4mpfer|work=Zur  Geschichte  einer  linken   Widerstandsgruppe   |date=4 June 1959|url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1959_4_6_rothfels.pdf|publisher=Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte, M\u00fcnchen| accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nSchwab had been seriously considering emigration to [[Mexico]].   However, shortly after his release his wife Hildegard died, which some sources implicitly connect with his new determination to stay in Germany and engage in (illegal) political activity in opposition to the government.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   He joined with [[Franz Jung]] to launch \"Wirtschaftskorrespondenz\", a press agency with its focus on business news.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   It evidently filled a genuine niche in the market for this type of service, at one stage supplying regular economic news items to more than fifty newspapers, including [[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]], the mass circulation daily newspaper of the ruling [[Nazi Party]].<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   The agency provided him with an income.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   In the words of one source, Schwab and Jung also \"used [the agency] as a cover for [unspecified] underground political activity\".<ref name=ASlautLibcom/>   \n\n=== Arrest, interrogation and trial ===\nIt is not entirely clear when Alexander Schwab took over the national leadership of the shadowy [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer (''\"Red fighters\"'')]].<ref name=ASlautNDB/>   On at least one occasion, early in 1936 he crossed the border to [[Prague]] in order to arrange the production of a Rote K\u00e4mpfer news sheet.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   While in Prague he received warnings not to return to Germany.   He nevertheless returned to [[Berlin]] and, if he had not done so already, became the Rote K\u00e4mpfer national leader.  In the context of a wider round-up of the organisation's leadership, Alexander Schwab's office was surrounded by [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi paramilitaries]] on 17 November 1936 and he was arrested.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/> \n\nIn the interrogations that followed he was badly tortured.   At the session that took place on 21 November 1936 he was keen to take full responsibility for the [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer]] on his own shoulders.<ref name=ASlautLibcom/><ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   He was, in particularly, determined to minimise the culpability attaching to [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]], [[Franz Jung]] and, in particular, the younger members of the leadership team.<ref name=ASlautHDK/>   It is one mark of his success that both Schr\u00f6der and Jung survived long enough to outlive the Nazi r\u00e9gime.   Jung, indeed, was released almost at once, and able to escape, via [[Prague]], to [[Budapest]].<ref name=FJlautHDK>{{cite web| url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=4532|title=Jung, Franz   * 26.11.1888, \u2020 21.1.1963|author1=[[Hermann Weber]]| author2=[[Andreas Herbst]]| work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten| publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a year of \"investigative detention\", six members of the [[:de:Rote K\u00e4mpfer|Rote K\u00e4mpfer]] leadership, identified in the record as \"Schwab and comrades\" (''\"Schwab und Genossen\"''),<ref name=ASlautHDK/> faced trial before the \"second senate\" of the [[People's Court (Germany)|special \"People's Court\"]] in Berlin on 28, 29 and 30 October 1937.<ref name=\"Schwab1973\"/>   One of the defendants, [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)|Karl Schr\u00f6der]], later shared some memories of the trial.  The three judges did not appear to have backgrounds in the justice system.<ref name=RoKa/>   The third of them was a teacher who attempted to calculate a sentence for one of the defendants.  He appeared unaware of the requirement to take account of pre-trial detention already served, but then wanted to reduce the sentence because the man to be sentenced had done some teaching, which sounded to him like a mitigating factor.<ref name=RoKa/>   When it was Schr\u00f6der's own turn to testify he found himself talking about a public meeting at which he had talked about \"generational issues\" (''\"Generationsfrage \"'').   His testimony had to be paused while a colleague explained to the leading judge, \"he means, sort of, between young and old\" (''\"Er  meint,  so  zwischen  jung  und  alt.\"'').   The three judges were evidently unable to get their heads around the fact that despite the defendants obviously being communists, they were also self evidently fervently anti-Bolshevik.<ref name=RoKa/>   According to Schr\u00f6der's not necessarily completely unbiased memories, he himself had so impressed the court that they came close to releasing him without further ado on the grounds that he was evidently \"not entirely of sound mind\" (''\"nicht  ganz zurechnungsf\u00e4hig\"'').<ref name=RoKa/>   In the end  [[Karl Schr\u00f6der (German politician)| Schr\u00f6der]] received a four year prison term.

A total of 600 R32s were built, numbered 3350\u20133949, though some cars were re-numbered. The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949); the former was paid by the city's capital budget and the latter was paid through a revenue bond. All were arranged as married pairs. The R32s were the first mass-produced [[stainless steel]] cars built for the New York City Subway. \n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964. Various modifications were made over the years to the R32 fleet. In the late 1980s, all of the R32 cars were rebuilt, with ten cars being rebuilt by [[General Electric]] and the remaining cars being rebuilt by [[Morrison Knudsen]]. As part of the refurbishment, the original rollsigns and express/local marker lights at the end of each car were replaced with flipdot signs. After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE. The [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]] replaced most of the R32s in the late 2000s, though about one-third of the original fleet remained, all being Phase I R32s. The remaining active cars are maintained at the [[207th Street Yard]]; however, they are expected to be retired in 2020 and replaced with the [[R179 (New York City Subway car)|R179]]s. Some retired R32 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system, including as museum exhibits or work cars.\n\n==Description==\nThe R32s are numbered 3350\u20133949, but some cars have been re-numbered outside of this range or to different numbers in this range. They were the first cars to introduce all-mylar route and destination rollsigns instead of the former cotton cloth or linen type rollsigns found on prior rail cars.\n\nThe R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/R-32_(Budd,_1964) |title=R-32 (Budd, 1964) |website=nycsubway.org |language=en |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The R32As were funded through the proceeds of a revenue bond, while the R32s were paid for out of the 1963\u20131964 New York City capital budget.

The next lowest bidder came in at $117,900 per car, which was for low-alloy steel cars. Budd low-balled the price to win the contract and introduce stainless steel equipment to the modern [[New York City Subway]] system, a plan that was met with limited success.<ref name=\":2\" /> NYCTA allowed a premium for subsequent stainless steel contracts, and all subsequent equipment was at least partly constructed of stainless steel. However, the Budd Company never benefited from the change, as they failed to win further contracts from the NYCTA, and the company has since halted production of railroad cars.\n\nThe R32 cars originally came with blue passenger doors and blue storm doors.

A total of 600 R32s were built, numbered 3350\u20133949, though some cars were re-numbered. The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949); the former was paid by the city's capital budget and the latter was paid through a revenue bond. All were arranged as married pairs. The R32s were the first mass-produced [[stainless steel]] cars built for the New York City Subway. \n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964. Various modifications were made over the years to the R32 fleet. In the late 1980s, all of the R32 cars were rebuilt, with ten cars being rebuilt by [[General Electric]] and the remaining cars being rebuilt by [[Morrison Knudsen]]. As part of the refurbishment, the original rollsigns and express/local marker lights at the end of each car were replaced with flipdot signs. After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE. The [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]] replaced most of the R32s in the late 2000s, though about one-third of the original fleet remained, all being Phase I R32s. The remaining active cars are maintained at the [[207th Street Yard]]; however, they are expected to be retired in 2020 and replaced with the [[R179 (New York City Subway car)|R179]]s. Some retired R32 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system, including as museum exhibits or work cars.\n\n==Description==\nThe R32s are numbered 3350\u20133949, but some cars have been re-numbered outside of this range or to different numbers in this range. They were the first cars to introduce all-mylar route and destination rollsigns instead of the former cotton cloth or linen type rollsigns found on prior rail cars.\n\nThe R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/R-32_(Budd,_1964) |title=R-32 (Budd, 1964) |website=nycsubway.org |language=en |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The R32As were funded through the proceeds of a revenue bond, while the R32s were paid for out of the 1963\u20131964 New York City capital budget.

At the time, this was the largest railcar order ever placed in the United States for subway cars. The cars were ordered for $68,820,000,<ref name=\":1\" /> of which half was provided by New York City and half through the sale of bonds by the New York City Transit Authority.<ref name=\":0\" /> Budd had bid on previous contracts with the NYCTA, but had never won a City contract for a production run of cars until the R32s, as Budd built only stainless-steel equipment and the TA refused to allow a differential in competitive bids for this higher-quality construction.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/06/26/archives/600-stainlesssteel-subway-cars-ordered-for-city-at-68-million.html |title=600 Stainless-Steel Subway Cars Ordered for City at 68 Million; Considered in Past |last=Perlmutter |first=Emanuel |date=June 26, 1963 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 27, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nBudd won the contract by offering the lowest bid of $114,700 per car. The next lowest bidder came in at $117,900 per car, which was for low-alloy steel cars. Budd low-balled the price to win the contract and introduce stainless steel equipment to the modern [[New York City Subway]] system, a plan that was met with limited success.<ref name=\":2\" /> NYCTA allowed a premium for subsequent stainless steel contracts, and all subsequent equipment was at least partly constructed of stainless steel. However, the Budd Company never benefited from the change, as they failed to win further contracts from the NYCTA, and the company has since halted production of railroad cars.\n\nThe R32 cars originally came with blue passenger doors and blue storm doors. The passenger doors of many cars were repainted silver from 1974, as the graffiti epidemic worsened.<ref name=\"nycs-19720209\">{{cite web|last=Testagrose|first=Joe|title=Image 4758|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?4758|website=nycsubway.org|accessdate=26 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226205418/https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?4758|archivedate=26 February 2020|date=9 February 1974|url-status=live}}</ref> However, some cars retained or regained blue passenger doors towards the start of the General Overhaul (GOH) program, which replaced all the doors with stainless steel versions.<ref name=\"nycs-19881102\">{{cite web|last=Barnes|first1=John|title=Image 108103|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?108103|website=nycsubway.org|accessdate=26 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226210458/https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?108103|archivedate=26 February 2020|date=2 November 1988|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn August 18, 1964, the NYCTA approved a modification to the 300 R32s already constructed.

The R32 Phase I cars (re-built by Morrison Knudsen) have WABCO Air Brake packages, GE Master Controllers, and Thermo King HVAC units. The R32 Phase II cars (also re-built by Morrison Knudsen) had NY Air Brake equipment, Westinghouse Master Controllers, and Stone Safety HVAC units. The ten prototype rebuild R32 GE cars differ from the Phase I and II cars as they were rebuilt to [[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]] specifications. They had experimental Sigma HVAC Units powered by A/C motors and solid state inverters, original traction motors rebuilt to 115 horsepower instead of the traditional 100 horsepower units, backlit ad signs, and different bulkhead designs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?2352 |title=Showing Image 2352 |work=nycsubway.org}}</ref> Since the cars were sent out to be overhauled based on how poorly they were performing (worst first), there are R32s and R32As rebuilt in both Phase I and Phase II configurations.
