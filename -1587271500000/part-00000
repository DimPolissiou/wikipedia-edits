He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them. He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* Marceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Jeremy O. Harris]] as Colby, a human familiar to Dantos the Cruel and Radinka the Brutal, two 400 year old vampires who appear to be children while Colby portrays as their father.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Council|Indeed every known member of the Vampiric Council has played an on-screen vampire before.<br />\nMentioned only: [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]] in ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' (2008\u20132012), [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]] in ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994).<br />\nIt is reported that Waititi denied [[Cate Blanchett]] council membership due to insufficient on-screen vampiric experience.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Jemaine Clement| subject-link=Jemaine Clement| subject2=Taika Waititi| subject-link2=Taika Waititi| subject3=Paul Simms| subject-link3=Paul Simms| interviewer=Clark Collis| title=What We Do in the Shadows producers discuss all-star episode| url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/| work=[[EW.com]]| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=2019-05-09| access-date=2019-06-10| quote=}}</ref>}}\n*[[Tilda Swinton]] as Tilda, the leader of the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Tilda|[[Tilda Swinton]] played a vampire lover in ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013).}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead, a member of the Council who just goes by her first name.{{efn|name=Evan|[[Evan Rachel Wood]] played [[List of True Blood characters#Supporting vampire characters|Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, in ''[[True Blood]]'' Seasons 2\u20134 (2009\u20132011).}}\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Danny, a Hispanic tattooed member of the Council.

One of the movies we really talked about a lot when we were conceiving the show was [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' where he went back to really doing as many effects as possible in camera and figuring out ways to do that. One of my favorite supernatural moments is completely in camera. It's where [[Beanie Feldstein]]'s character is walking along in the park and Nadja appears walking next to her. That was all just done completely the old fashioned way where Natasia was hiding behind a tree and the camera was tracking a long and at the right moment, she walked out from behind a tree. I think there's something about that old fashioned way that makes things more interesting than when you can tell it's digital and rubbery and fake looking\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-showrunner-interview/ |title='What We Do in the Shadows' Showrunner Teases Supernatural Orgies, 'Blade' Vampires, and More [Interview] |website=/Film |first=Fred |last=Topel |date=March 26, 2019 |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAmong the cinematographers D.J.

Our take, however, was that the Staten Island vampires have let their place go. The former glory is evident but now exists in a worn, faded and distressed state. Production designer Kate Bunch and I had a lot of conversations about striking the right balance between sumptuousness and neglect.

He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them. He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* Marceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Jeremy O. Harris]] as Colby, a human familiar to Dantos the Cruel and Radinka the Brutal, two 400 year old vampires who appear to be children while Colby portrays as their father.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Council|Indeed every known member of the Vampiric Council has played an on-screen vampire before.<br />\nMentioned only: [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]] in ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' (2008\u20132012), [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]] in ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994).<br />\nIt is reported that Waititi denied [[Cate Blanchett]] council membership due to insufficient on-screen vampiric experience.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Jemaine Clement| subject-link=Jemaine Clement| subject2=Taika Waititi| subject-link2=Taika Waititi| subject3=Paul Simms| subject-link3=Paul Simms| interviewer=Clark Collis| title=What We Do in the Shadows producers discuss all-star episode| url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/| work=[[EW.com]]| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=2019-05-09| access-date=2019-06-10| quote=}}</ref>}}\n*[[Tilda Swinton]] as Tilda, the leader of the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Tilda|[[Tilda Swinton]] played a vampire lover in ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013).}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead, a member of the Council who just goes by her first name.{{efn|name=Evan|[[Evan Rachel Wood]] played [[List of True Blood characters#Supporting vampire characters|Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, in ''[[True Blood]]'' Seasons 2\u20134 (2009\u20132011).}}\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Danny, a Hispanic tattooed member of the Council.

The series traces two long-prepared heists led by [[The Professor (Money Heist)|the Professor]] ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]), one on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]], and one on the [[Bank of Spain]]. The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe series was filmed in [[Madrid]], Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in Panama, Thailand and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an [[unreliable narrator]] for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman, [[Tokyo (Money Heist)|Tokyo]], ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received several awards including best drama series at the [[46th International Emmy Awards]], as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]],\" which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Premise ==\nSet in [[Madrid]], a mysterious man known as \"The Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose cities for code-names, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the [[Royal Mint (Spain)|Royal Mint of Spain]], and escaping with \u20ac2.4 billion. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events succeeding the initial heist, the group are forced out of hiding, and find themselves preparing for a second heist, this time on the [[Bank of Spain]], as they again deal with hostages and police forces.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a very small project in a simple way; we

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates on the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva.\" The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320) ===\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo, and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets. At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and the police catch Lisbon. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in a tent outside of the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to help them, and the Professor can establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manages to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda escapes, begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo can regain the trust of the group and rejoins them. Gand\u00eda shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and the holding of Lisbon to the public. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred to the Supreme Court. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang within the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda

The series traces two long-prepared heists led by [[The Professor (Money Heist)|the Professor]] ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]), one on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]], and one on the [[Bank of Spain]]. The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe series was filmed in [[Madrid]], Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in Panama, Thailand and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an [[unreliable narrator]] for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman, [[Tokyo (Money Heist)|Tokyo]], ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received several awards including best drama series at the [[46th International Emmy Awards]], as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]],\" which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Premise ==\nSet in [[Madrid]], a mysterious man known as \"The Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose cities for code-names, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the [[Royal Mint (Spain)|Royal Mint of Spain]], and escaping with \u20ac2.4 billion. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events succeeding the initial heist, the group are forced out of hiding, and find themselves preparing for a second heist, this time on the [[Bank of Spain]], as they again deal with hostages and police forces.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a very small project in a simple way; we

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates on the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva.\" The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320) ===\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo, and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets. At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and the police catch Lisbon. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in a tent outside of the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to help them, and the Professor can establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manages to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda escapes, begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo can regain the trust of the group and rejoins them. Gand\u00eda shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and the holding of Lisbon to the public. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred to the Supreme Court. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang within the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda
