{"title_page": "Laplace transform", "text_new": "{{redirect|\u2112|the Lagrangian|Lagrangian mechanics}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Laplace transform''' is an [[integral transform]] named after its inventor [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] ({{IPAc-en|l|\u0259|\u02c8|p|l|\u0251:|s}}).  It transforms a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time) to a function of a [[complex analysis|complex variable]] {{mvar|s}} ([[complex frequency]]). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.\n\n{{Gallery|width=265 | height=150 |lines=2 |align=right|File:Graph of e^t cos(10t).png|An example curve of e^t cos(10t) that is added together with similar curves to form a Laplace Transform.|File:Laplace animation of Cubic Polynomial.gif|Animation showing how adding together curves can approximate a function.}}\n\nThe Laplace transform is similar to the [[Fourier transform]].  While the Fourier transform of a function is a [[complex function]] of a ''real'' variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a ''complex variable''.  The Laplace transform is usually restricted to transformation of functions of {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}.  A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a [[holomorphic function]] of the variable {{math|''s''}}.  Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] is generally a [[well-behaved]] function.  Techniques of complex variables can also be used to  directly study Laplace transforms.  As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a power series representation.  This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the function.  This perspective has applications in [[probability theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable ''s'' (often frequency) and yields a function of a real variable ''t'' (often time).  Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a [[system]], the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|loc=\u00a78.1}}</ref>  So, for example, Laplace transformation from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] transforms differential equations into algebraic equations and [[convolution]] into multiplication.\n\nLaplace wrote extensively about the use of [[Generating function|generating functions]] in ''Essai philosophique sur les probabilit\u00e9s'' (1814) and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Probability theory : the logic of science|last=Jaynes, E.

The advantages of the Laplace transform had been emphasized by [[Gustav Doetsch]]<ref>{{citation |first=Gustav |last=Doetsch |title=Theorie und Anwendung der Laplacesche Transformation |location=Berlin |date=1937 |publisher=Springer |language=de |trans-title=Theory and Application of the Laplace Transform}} translation 1943</ref> to whom the name Laplace Transform is apparently due.  \n\nThe early history of methods having some similarity to Laplace transform is as follows. From 1744, [[Leonhard Euler]] investigated integrals of the form\n: <math> z = \\int X(x) e^{ax}\\, dx \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad z = \\int X(x) x^A \\, dx</math>\nas solutions of [[Laplace transform applied to differential equations|differential equations]] but did not pursue the matter very far.<ref>{{harvnb|Euler|1744}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1753}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1769}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] was an admirer of Euler and, in his work on integrating [[probability density function]]s, investigated expressions of the form\n: <math> \\int X(x) e^{- a x } a^x\\, dx,</math>\nwhich some modern historians have interpreted within modern Laplace transform theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Lagrange|1773}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness| 1997|p=260}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}\n\nThese types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplace's attention in 1782 where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|p=261}}</ref> However, in 1785, Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than just looking for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form\n: <math> \\int x^s \\varphi (x)\\, dx,</math>\nakin to a [[Mellin transform]], to transform the whole of a [[difference equation]], in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=261\u2013262}}</ref>\n\nLaplace also recognised that [[Joseph Fourier]]'s method of [[Fourier series]] for solving the [[diffusion equation]] could only apply to a limited region of space because those solutions were periodic. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=262&ndash;266}}</ref>\n\n== Formal definition ==\nThe Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) =\\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter\n: <math>s = \\sigma + i \\omega</math>, with real numbers {{math|''\u03c3''}} and {{math|''\u03c9''}}.\n\nAn alternate notation for the Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}</math> instead of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe meaning of the integral depends on types of functions of interest.  A necessary condition for existence of the integral is that {{math|''f''}} must be [[locally integrable]] on {{closed-open|0, \u221e}}.  For locally integrable functions that decay at infinity or are of [[exponential type]], the integral can be understood to be a (proper) [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, for many applications it is necessary to regard it as a [[conditionally convergent]] [[improper integral]] at {{math|\u221e}}.  Still more generally, the integral can be understood in a [[distribution (mathematics)|weak sense]], and this is dealt with below.\n\nOne can define the Laplace transform of a finite [[Borel measure]] {{math|''\u03bc''}} by the Lebesgue integral<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=\u00a7XIII.1}}</ref>\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{\\mu\\}(s) = \\int_{[0,\\infty)} e^{-st}\\, d\\mu(t).</math>\n\nAn important special case is where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a [[probability measure]], for example, the [[Dirac delta function]]. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a probability density function {{math|''f''}}.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{0^-}^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt,</math>\nwhere the lower limit of {{math|0<sup>\u2212</sup>}} is shorthand notation for\n: <math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0^+}\\int_{-\\varepsilon}^\\infty.</math>\n\nThis limit emphasizes that any point mass located at {{math|0}} is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform]].\n\n=== Bilateral Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Two-sided Laplace transform}}\n\nWhen one says \"the Laplace transform\" without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the ''bilateral Laplace transform'' or [[two-sided Laplace transform]] by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis.  If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the [[Heaviside step function]].\nThe bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:\n{{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a bilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nAn alternate notation for the bilateral Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{B}\\{f\\}</math> instead of <math>F</math>.\n\n=== Inverse Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Inverse Laplace transform}}\nTwo integrable functions have the same Laplace transform only if they differ on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. This means that, on the range of the transform, there is an inverse transform. In fact, besides integrable functions, the Laplace transform is a [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] mapping from one function space into another in many other function spaces as well, although there is usually no easy characterization of the range. Typical function spaces in which this is true include the spaces of bounded continuous functions, the space [[Lp space|{{math|''L''<sup>&infin;</sup>(0, &infin;)}}]], or more generally [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]] on {{open-open|0, &infin;}}.  The Laplace transform is also defined and injective for suitable spaces of tempered distributions.\n\nIn these cases, the image of the Laplace transform lives in a space of [[analytic function]]s in the [[#Region of convergence|region of convergence]].  The [[inverse Laplace transform]] is given by the following complex integral, which is known by various names (the '''Bromwich integral''', the '''Fourier\u2013Mellin integral''', and '''Mellin's inverse formula'''):\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F\\}(t) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\oint_{\\gamma - i T}^{\\gamma + i T} e^{st} F(s)\\, ds</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of {{math|''F''(''s'')}}. An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by [[Post's inversion formula]]. The limit here is interpreted in the [[weak-* topology#Weak-* topology|weak-* topology]].\n\nIn practice, it is typically more convenient to decompose a Laplace transform into known transforms of functions obtained from a table, and construct the inverse by inspection.\n\n=== Probability theory ===\nIn [[probability theory|pure]] and [[applied probability]], the Laplace transform is defined as an [[expected value]]. If {{math|''X''}} is a [[random variable]] with probability density function {{math|''f''}}, then the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} is given by the expectation\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\operatorname{E}\\! \\left[e^{-sX} \\right]\\! .</math>\n\nBy [[abuse of notation|convention]], this is referred to as the Laplace transform of the random variable {{math|''X''}} itself. Replacing {{math|''s''}} by {{math|\u2212''t''}} gives the [[moment generating function]] of {{math|''X''}}. The Laplace transform has applications throughout probability theory, including [[first passage time]]s of [[stochastic processes]] such as [[Markov chain]]s, and [[renewal theory]].\n\nOf particular use is the ability to recover the [[cumulative distribution function]] of a continuous random variable {{math|''X''}} by means of the Laplace transform as follows<ref>The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function.</ref>\n: <math>F_X(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right]\\right\\}\\! (x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\right\\}\\! (x).</math>\n\n== Region of convergence ==\nIf {{math|''f''}} is a locally integrable function (or more generally a Borel measure locally of bounded variation), then the Laplace transform {{math|''F''(''s'')}} of {{math|''f''}} converges provided that the limit\n: <math>\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_0^R f(t)e^{-st}\\,dt</math>\nexists.\n\nThe Laplace transform converges absolutely if the integral\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\left|f(t)e^{-st}\\right|\\,dt</math>\nexists (as a proper Lebesgue integral).  The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former instead of the latter sense.\n\nThe set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges absolutely is either of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}} or else {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 ''a''}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an [[extended real number|extended real constant]], {{math|\u2212\u221e \u2264 ''a'' \u2264 \u221e}}.  (This follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]].) The constant {{math|''a''}} is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of {{math|''f''(''t'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter II, \u00a71}}</ref> Analogously, the two-sided transform converges absolutely in a strip of the form  {{math|''a'' < Re(''s'') < ''b''}}, and possibly including the lines {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}} or {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''b''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72}}</ref>  The subset of values of {{math|''s''}} for which the Laplace transform converges absolutely is called the region of absolute convergence or the domain of absolute convergence.  In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the strip of absolute convergence. The Laplace transform is analytic in the region of absolute convergence: this is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem]] and [[Morera's theorem]]. \n\nSimilarly, the set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges (conditionally or absolutely) is known as the region of conditional convergence, or simply the '''region of convergence''' (ROC).  If the Laplace transform converges (conditionally) at {{math|1=''s'' = ''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, then it automatically converges for all {{math|''s''}} with {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}.  Therefore, the region of convergence is a half-plane of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}}, possibly including some points of the boundary line {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}}.\n\nIn the region of convergence {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}, the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} can be expressed by [[integration by parts|integrating by parts]] as the integral\n: <math>F(s) = (s-s_0)\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-s_0)t}\\beta(t)\\,dt,\\quad \\beta(u) = \\int_0^u e^{-s_0t}f(t)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThat is, in the region of convergence {{math|''F''(''s'')}} can effectively be expressed as the absolutely convergent Laplace transform of some other function.  In particular, it is analytic.\n\nThere are several [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s concerning the relationship between the decay properties of {{math|''f''}} and the properties of the Laplace transform within the region of convergence.\n\nIn engineering applications, a function corresponding to a [[LTI system|linear time-invariant (LTI) system]] is ''stable'' if every bounded input produces a bounded output.  This is equivalent to the absolute convergence of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function in the region {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 0}}.  As a result, LTI systems are stable provided the poles of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function have negative real part.\n\nThis ROC is used in knowing about the causality and stability of a system.\n\n== Properties and theorems ==\nThe Laplace transform has a number of properties that make it useful for analyzing linear [[dynamical system]]s. The most significant advantage is that [[derivative|differentiation]] becomes multiplication, and [[integral|integration]] becomes division, by  {{math|''s''}} (similarly to [[logarithm]]s changing multiplication of numbers to addition of their logarithms).\n\nBecause of this property, the Laplace variable {{math|''s''}} is also known as ''operator variable'' in the {{math|''L''}} domain: either ''derivative operator'' or (for {{math|''s''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}} ''integration operator''. The transform turns [[integral equation]]s and [[differential equation]]s to [[polynomial equation]]s, which are much easier to solve.  Once solved, use of the inverse Laplace transform reverts to the original domain.\n\nGiven the functions {{math|''f''(''t'')}} and {{math|''g''(''t'')}}, and their respective Laplace transforms {{math|''F''(''s'')}} and {{math|''G''(''s'')}},\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nf(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\},\\\\\ng(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe following '''table''' is a list of properties of unilateral Laplace transform:<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|pp=226&ndash;227}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" id=\"291017_tableid\"\n|+ Properties of the unilateral Laplace transform\n|-\n !\n !

Replacing summation over {{math|''n''}} with integration over  {{math|''t''}}, a continuous version of the power series becomes\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) x^t\\, dt</math>\nwhere the discrete function {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is replaced by the continuous one {{math|''f''(''t'')}}. \n\nChanging the base of the power from {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''e''}} gives\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) \\left(e^{\\ln{x}}\\right)^t\\, dt</math>\n\nFor this to converge for, say, all bounded functions {{math|''f''}}, it is necessary to require that {{math|ln ''x'' < 0}}.

This can be derived from the basic expression for a Laplace transform as follows:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt \\\\[6pt]\n                                  &= \\left[\\frac{f(t)e^{-st}}{-s} \\right]_{0^-}^\\infty -\n                                       \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-st}}{-s} f'(t) \\, dt\\quad \\text{(by parts)} \\\\[6pt]\n                                  &= \\left[-\\frac{f(0^+)}{-s}\\right] + \\frac 1 s \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f'(t)\\right\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nyielding\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s\\cdot\\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}-f(0^+), </math>\n\nand in the bilateral case,\n\n: <math> \\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\,dt  = s \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}. </math>\n\nThe general result\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{ f^{(n)}(t) \\right\\} = s^n \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} - s^{n - 1} f(0^+) - \\cdots - f^{(n - 1)}(0^+),</math>\n\nwhere <math>f^{(n)}</math> denotes the {{math|''n''}}<sup>th</sup> derivative of {{math|''f''}}, can then be established with an inductive argument.\n\n=== Evaluating integrals over the positive real axis ===\nA useful property of the Laplace transform is the following:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty f(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(s)\\cdot(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}g)(s)\\,ds </math>\n\nunder suitable assumptions on the behaviour of <math>f,g</math> in a right neighbourhood of <math>0</math> and on the decay rate of <math>f,g</math> in a left neighbourhood of <math>\\infty</math>. The above formula is a variation of integration by parts, with the operators \n<math>\\frac{d}{dx}</math> and <math>\\int \\,dx</math> being replaced by <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{L}^{-1}</math>. Let us prove the equivalent formulation:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty f(s)(\\mathcal{L}g)(s)\\,ds. </math>\n\nBy plugging in <math>(\\mathcal{L}f)(x)=\\int_0^\\infty f(s)e^{-sx}\\,ds</math> the left-hand side turns into:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty f(s)g(x) e^{-sx}\\,ds\\,dx, </math>\n\nbut assuming Fubini's theorem holds, by reversing the order of integration we get the wanted right-hand side.\n\n=== Relationship to other transforms ===\n\n==== Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform ====\nThe (unilateral) Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform of a function {{math|''g'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} is defined by the [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral]]\n\n: <math>\\{\\mathcal{L}^*g\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\, dg(t).</math>\n\nThe function {{math|''g''}} is assumed to be of [[bounded variation]].  If {{math|''g''}} is the [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}:\n\n: <math>g(x) = \\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>\n\nthen the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{math|''g''}} and the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} coincide.  In general, the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is the Laplace transform of the [[Stieltjes measure]] associated to {{math|''g''}}.  So in practice, the only distinction between the two transforms is that the Laplace transform is thought of as operating on the density function of the measure, whereas the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is thought of as operating on its [[cumulative distribution function]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|p=432}}</ref>\n\n==== Fourier transform ====\n{{Main|Fourier transform}}\nThe continuous Fourier transform is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with imaginary argument {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} or {{math|1=''s'' = 2''\u03c0fi''}}<ref>{{harvnb|Takacs|1953|p=93}}</ref> when the condition explained below is fulfilled, \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\widehat{f}(\\omega) &= \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}|_{s = i\\omega}  =  F(s)|_{s = i \\omega} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\omega t} f(t)\\,dt~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis definition of the Fourier transform requires a prefactor of {{math|1/(2''\u03c0'')}} on the reverse Fourier transform. This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the [[frequency spectrum]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or dynamical system.\n\nThe above relation is valid as stated if and only if the region of convergence (ROC) of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}} contains the imaginary axis,  {{math|1=''\u03c3'' = 0}}.\n\nFor example, the function {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = cos(''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>''t'')}} has a Laplace transform  {{math|1=''F''(''s'') =  ''s''/(''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)}} whose ROC is {{math|Re(''s'') > 0}}. As {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} is a pole of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, substituting  {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} in {{math|''F''(''s'')}} does not yield the Fourier transform of  {{math|''f''(''t'')''u''(''t'')}}, which is proportional to the [[Dirac delta-function]] {{math|''\u03b4''(''\u03c9'' \u2212 ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>)}}.\n\nHowever, a relation of the form\n: <math>\\lim_{\\sigma\\to 0^+} F(\\sigma+i\\omega) = \\widehat{f}(\\omega)</math>\nholds under much weaker conditions.  For instance, this holds for the above example provided that the limit is understood as a [[weak limit]] of measures (see [[vague topology]]).  General conditions relating the limit of the Laplace transform of a function on the boundary to the Fourier transform take the form of [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s.\n\n==== Mellin transform ====\n{{Main|Mellin transform}}\nThe Mellin transform and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables.\n\nIf in the Mellin transform\n: <math>G(s) = \\mathcal{M}\\{g(\\theta)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\theta^s g(\\theta) \\, \\frac{d\\theta} \\theta </math>\nwe set {{math|1=''\u03b8'' = ''e''<sup>\u2212''t''</sup>}} we get a two-sided Laplace transform.\n\n==== Z-transform ====\n{{Main|Z-transform}}\nThe unilateral or one-sided Z-transform is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of\n: <math> z \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} e^{sT} ,</math>\nwhere {{math|1=''T'' = 1/''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[Sampling theorem|sampling]] period (in units of time e.g., seconds) and  {{math|''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[sampling rate]] (in [[sample (signal)|samples per second]] or [[hertz]]).\n\nLet\n: <math> \\Delta_T(t) \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) </math>\nbe a sampling impulse train (also called a [[Dirac comb]]) and\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x_q(t) \\  &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  x(t) \\Delta_T(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) \\\\\n            &= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(n T) \\delta(t - n T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] \\delta(t - n T)\n\\end{align}</math>\nbe the sampled representation of the continuous-time {{math|''x''(''t'')}}\n: <math> x[n] \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}}  x(nT) ~.</math>\n\nThe Laplace transform of the sampled signal {{math|''x''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'') }} is\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  X_q(s) &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty x_q(t) e^{-s t} \\,dt \\\\\n         &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] e^{-n s T}~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is the precise definition of the unilateral Z-transform of the discrete function {{math|''x''[''n'']}}\n\n: <math> X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n} </math>\nwith the substitution of {{math|''z'' \u2192 e<sup>''sT''</sup>}}.\n\nComparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the unilateral Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal,\n: <math>X_q(s) =  X(z) \\Big|_{z=e^{sT}}.</math>\n\nThe similarity between the {{math|''Z''}} and Laplace transforms is expanded upon in the theory of [[time scale calculus]].\n\n==== Borel transform ====\nThe integral form of the [[Borel summation|Borel transform]]\n\n: <math>F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(z)e^{-sz}\\, dz</math>\n\nis a special case of the Laplace transform for {{math|''f''}} an [[entire function]] of exponential type, meaning that\n\n: <math>|f(z)|\\le Ae^{B|z|}</math>\n\nfor some constants {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.  The generalized Borel transform allows a different weighting function to be used, rather than the exponential function, to transform functions not of exponential type. [[Nachbin's theorem]] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Borel transform to be well defined.\n\n==== Fundamental relationships ====\nSince an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.\n\n== Table of selected Laplace transforms ==\n{{main article|List of Laplace transforms}}\n\nThe following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable.<ref>{{Citation |edition=3rd |page=455 |first1=K.

Circuit elements can be transformed into [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, very similar to [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] impedances.\n\nHere is a summary of equivalents:\n\n: [[File:S-Domain circuit equivalents.svg|alt={{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits|centre|frameless|400x400px|{{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits]]\n\nNote that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the {{math|''s''}}-domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the {{math|''s''}}-domain account for that.\n\nThe equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.\n\n== Examples and applications ==\n<!--A few worked examples are provided here to enable the reader to assess comprehension of the factual presentation.  Elaboration beyond the role of supporting factual comprehension belongs at [[v:|Wikiversity]] or [[b:|Wikibooks]].-->\n\nThe Laplace transform is used frequently in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]; the output of a [[linear time-invariant]] system can be calculated by convolving its unit impulse response with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the convolution into a multiplication; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see [[control theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform can also be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].  The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra.  The original differential equation can then be solved by applying the inverse Laplace transform.  The English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside first proposed a similar scheme, although without using the Laplace transform; and the resulting operational calculus is credited as the Heaviside calculus.\n\n=== Evaluating improper integrals ===\nLet <math>\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} = F(s)</math>, then (see the table above)\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{\\frac{f(t)} t \\right\\} = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp,</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)}{t}e^{-st}\\, dt = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>\n\nLetting {{math|''s'' \u2192 0}}, gives one the identity\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)} t \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>\n\nprovided that the interchange of limits can be justified. Even when the interchange cannot be justified the calculation can be suggestive. For example, with ''a''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''b'', proceeding formally one has\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\int_0^\\infty \\frac 1 t ( \\cos(at) - \\cos(bt) )\\, dt =\n  \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac p {p^2 + a^2} - \\frac{p}{p^2 + b^2}\\right)\\, dp \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac 1 2 \\left. \\ln\\frac{p^2 + a^2}{p^2 + b^2} \\right|_{p\\,:=\\,0}^\\infty = \\ln|b| - \\ln |a|.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe validity of this identity can be proved by other means. It is an example of a [[Frullani integral]].\n\nAnother example is [[Dirichlet integral]].\n\n=== Nuclear physics ===\nIn [[nuclear physics]], the following fundamental relationship governs [[radioactive decay]]: the number of radioactive atoms {{math|''N''}} in a sample of a radioactive [[isotope]] decays at a rate proportional to {{math|''N''}}.  This leads to the first order linear differential equation\n\n: <math>\\frac{dN}{dt} = -\\lambda N,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03bb''}} is the [[decay constant]]. The Laplace transform can be used to solve this equation.\n\nRearranging the equation to one side, we have\n\n: <math>\\frac{dN}{dt} + \\lambda N = 0.</math>\n\nNext, we take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation:\n\n: <math>\\left( s \\widetilde{N}(s) - N_0 \\right) + \\lambda \\widetilde{N}(s) = 0,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\widetilde{N}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{N(t)\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>N_0 = N(0).</math>\n\nSolving, we find\n\n: <math>\\widetilde{N}(s) = \\frac{N_0}{s + \\lambda}.</math>\n\nFinally, we take the inverse Laplace transform to find the general solution\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  N(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\{\\widetilde{N}(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{N_0}{s + \\lambda} \\right\\}\\\\\n       &= \\ N_0 e^{-\\lambda t},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich is indeed the correct form for radioactive decay.\n\n=== Complex impedance of a capacitor ===\nIn the theory of [[electrical circuit]]s, the current flow in a [[capacitor]] is proportional to the capacitance and rate of change in the electrical potential (in [[International System of Units|SI]] units). Symbolically, this is expressed by the differential equation\n\n: <math>i = C { dv \\over dt} ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''C''}} is the capacitance (in [[farad]]s) of the capacitor, {{math|1=''i'' = ''i''(''t'')}} is the [[electric current]] (in [[ampere]]s) through the capacitor as a function of time, and {{math|1=''v'' = ''v''(''t'')}} is the [[electrostatic potential|voltage]] (in [[volt]]s) across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain\n\n: <math>I(s) = C(s V(s) - V_0),</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  I(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ i(t) \\},\\\\\n  V(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>V_0 = v(t)\\Big|_{t=0}. \\, </math>\n\nSolving for {{math|''V''(''s'')}} we have\n\n: <math>V(s) = { I(s) \\over sC } + { V_0 \\over s }.</math>\n\nThe definition of the complex impedance {{math|''Z''}} (in [[ohm]]s) is the ratio of the complex voltage {{math|''V''}} divided by the complex current {{math|''I''}} while holding the initial state {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} at zero:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\left. { V(s) \\over I(s) } \\right|_{V_0 = 0}.</math>\n\nUsing this definition and the previous equation, we find:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\frac{1}{sC}, </math>\n\nwhich is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor. \nIn addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control theory.\n\n=== Partial fraction expansion ===\n<!-- [[Partial fractions in Laplace transforms]] redirect here -->\nConsider a linear time-invariant system with [[transfer function]]\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)}.</math>\n\nThe [[impulse response]] is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\}.</math>\n\nTo evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding {{math|''H''(''s'')}} using the method of partial fraction expansion,\n\n: <math>\\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)} = { P \\over s + \\alpha } + { R \\over s+\\beta }.</math>\n\nThe unknown constants {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s located at the corresponding poles of the transfer function. Each residue represents the relative contribution of that [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] to the transfer function's overall shape.\n\nBy the [[residue theorem]], the inverse Laplace transform depends only upon the poles and their residues. To find the residue {{math|''P''}}, we multiply both sides of the equation by {{math|''s'' + ''\u03b1''}} to get\n: <math>\\frac{1}{s + \\beta} = P  + { R (s + \\alpha) \\over s + \\beta }.</math>\n\nThen by letting {{math|1=''s'' = \u2212''\u03b1''}}, the contribution from {{math|''R''}} vanishes and all that is left is\n: <math>P = \\left.{1 \\over s+\\beta}\\right|_{s=-\\alpha} = {1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha}.</math>\n\nSimilarly, the residue {{math|''R''}} is given by\n: <math>R = \\left.{1 \\over s + \\alpha}\\right|_{s=-\\beta} = {1 \\over \\alpha - \\beta}.</math>\n\nNote that\n: <math>R = {-1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha} = - P</math>\nand so the substitution of {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''P''}} into the expanded expression for {{math|''H''(''s'')}} gives\n: <math>H(s)  = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\right) \\cdot \\left(  { 1 \\over s + \\alpha } - { 1  \\over s + \\beta }  \\right).</math>\n\nFinally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see ''Item'' #''3'' in the ''Table of Laplace Transforms'', above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of {{math|''H''(''s'')}} to obtain\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}\\right),</math>\nwhich is the impulse response of the system.\n\n;Convolution\nThe same result can be achieved using the [[Convolution theorem|convolution property]] as if the system is a series of filters with transfer functions of {{math|1/(''s'' + ''a'')}} and {{math|1/(''s'' + ''b'')}}. That is, the inverse of\n\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + a)(s + b)} = \\frac{1}{s+a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + b}</math>\n\nis\n\n: <math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s + a} \\right\\} * \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s + b} \\right\\} = e^{-at} * e^{-bt} = \\int_0^t e^{-ax}e^{-b(t - x)}\\, dx = \\frac{e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}}{b - a}.</math>\n\n=== Phase delay ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It transforms a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time) to a function of a [[complex analysis|complex variable]] {{mvar|s}} ([[complex frequency]]). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.\n\n{{Gallery|width=265 | height=150 |lines=2 |align=right|File:Graph of e^t cos(10t).png|An example curve of e^t cos(10t) that is added together with similar curves to form a Laplace Transform.|File:Laplace animation of Cubic Polynomial.gif|Animation showing how adding together curves can approximate a function.}}\n\nThe Laplace transform is similar to the [[Fourier transform]].  While the Fourier transform of a function is a [[complex function]] of a ''real'' variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a ''complex variable''.  The Laplace transform is usually restricted to transformation of functions of {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}.  A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a [[holomorphic function]] of the variable {{math|''s''}}.  Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] is generally a [[well-behaved]] function.  Techniques of complex variables can also be used to  directly study Laplace transforms.  As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a power series representation.  This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the function.  This perspective has applications in [[probability theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable ''s'' (often frequency) and yields a function of a real variable ''t'' (often time).  Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a [[system]], the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|loc=\u00a78.1}}</ref>  So, for example, Laplace transformation from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] transforms differential equations into algebraic equations and [[convolution]] into multiplication.\n\nLaplace wrote extensively about the use of [[Generating function|generating functions]] in ''Essai philosophique sur les probabilit\u00e9s'' (1814) and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Probability theory : the logic of science|last=Jaynes, E.

From 1744, [[Leonhard Euler]] investigated integrals of the form\n: <math> z = \\int X(x) e^{ax}\\, dx \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad z = \\int X(x) x^A \\, dx</math>\nas solutions of [[Laplace transform applied to differential equations|differential equations]] but did not pursue the matter very far.<ref>{{harvnb|Euler|1744}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1753}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1769}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] was an admirer of Euler and, in his work on integrating [[probability density function]]s, investigated expressions of the form\n: <math> \\int X(x) e^{- a x } a^x\\, dx,</math>\nwhich some modern historians have interpreted within modern Laplace transform theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Lagrange|1773}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness| 1997|p=260}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}\n\nThese types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplace's attention in 1782 where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|p=261}}</ref> However, in 1785, Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than just looking for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form\n: <math> \\int x^s \\varphi (x)\\, dx,</math>\nakin to a [[Mellin transform]], to transform the whole of a [[difference equation]], in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=261\u2013262}}</ref>\n\nLaplace also recognised that [[Joseph Fourier]]'s method of [[Fourier series]] for solving the [[diffusion equation]] could only apply to a limited region of space because those solutions were periodic. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=262&ndash;266}}</ref>\n\n== Formal definition ==\nThe Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) =\\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter\n: <math>s = \\sigma + i \\omega</math>, with real numbers {{math|''\u03c3''}} and {{math|''\u03c9''}}.\n\nAn alternate notation for the Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}</math> instead of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe meaning of the integral depends on types of functions of interest.  A necessary condition for existence of the integral is that {{math|''f''}} must be [[locally integrable]] on {{closed-open|0, \u221e}}.  For locally integrable functions that decay at infinity or are of [[exponential type]], the integral can be understood to be a (proper) [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, for many applications it is necessary to regard it as a [[conditionally convergent]] [[improper integral]] at {{math|\u221e}}.  Still more generally, the integral can be understood in a [[distribution (mathematics)|weak sense]], and this is dealt with below.\n\nOne can define the Laplace transform of a finite [[Borel measure]] {{math|''\u03bc''}} by the Lebesgue integral<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=\u00a7XIII.1}}</ref>\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{\\mu\\}(s) = \\int_{[0,\\infty)} e^{-st}\\, d\\mu(t).</math>\n\nAn important special case is where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a [[probability measure]], for example, the [[Dirac delta function]]. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a probability density function {{math|''f''}}.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{0^-}^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt,</math>\nwhere the lower limit of {{math|0<sup>\u2212</sup>}} is shorthand notation for\n: <math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0^+}\\int_{-\\varepsilon}^\\infty.</math>\n\nThis limit emphasizes that any point mass located at {{math|0}} is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform]].\n\n=== Bilateral Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Two-sided Laplace transform}}\n\nWhen one says \"the Laplace transform\" without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the ''bilateral Laplace transform'' or [[two-sided Laplace transform]] by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis.  If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the [[Heaviside step function]].\nThe bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:\n{{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a bilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nAn alternate notation for the bilateral Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{B}\\{f\\}</math> instead of <math>F</math>.\n\n=== Inverse Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Inverse Laplace transform}}\nTwo integrable functions have the same Laplace transform only if they differ on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. This means that, on the range of the transform, there is an inverse transform. In fact, besides integrable functions, the Laplace transform is a [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] mapping from one function space into another in many other function spaces as well, although there is usually no easy characterization of the range. Typical function spaces in which this is true include the spaces of bounded continuous functions, the space [[Lp space|{{math|''L''<sup>&infin;</sup>(0, &infin;)}}]], or more generally [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]] on {{open-open|0, &infin;}}.  The Laplace transform is also defined and injective for suitable spaces of tempered distributions.\n\nIn these cases, the image of the Laplace transform lives in a space of [[analytic function]]s in the [[#Region of convergence|region of convergence]].  The [[inverse Laplace transform]] is given by the following complex integral, which is known by various names (the '''Bromwich integral''', the '''Fourier\u2013Mellin integral''', and '''Mellin's inverse formula'''):\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F\\}(t) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\oint_{\\gamma - i T}^{\\gamma + i T} e^{st} F(s)\\, ds</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of {{math|''F''(''s'')}}. An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by [[Post's inversion formula]]. The limit here is interpreted in the [[weak-* topology#Weak-* topology|weak-* topology]].\n\nIn practice, it is typically more convenient to decompose a Laplace transform into known transforms of functions obtained from a table, and construct the inverse by inspection.\n\n=== Probability theory ===\nIn [[probability theory|pure]] and [[applied probability]], the Laplace transform is defined as an [[expected value]]. If {{math|''X''}} is a [[random variable]] with probability density function {{math|''f''}}, then the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} is given by the expectation\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\operatorname{E}\\! \\left[e^{-sX} \\right]\\! .</math>\n\nBy [[abuse of notation|convention]], this is referred to as the Laplace transform of the random variable {{math|''X''}} itself. Replacing {{math|''s''}} by {{math|\u2212''t''}} gives the [[moment generating function]] of {{math|''X''}}. The Laplace transform has applications throughout probability theory, including [[first passage time]]s of [[stochastic processes]] such as [[Markov chain]]s, and [[renewal theory]].\n\nOf particular use is the ability to recover the [[cumulative distribution function]] of a continuous random variable {{math|''X''}} by means of the Laplace transform as follows<ref>The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function.</ref>\n: <math>F_X(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right]\\right\\}\\! (x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\right\\}\\! (x).</math>\n\n== Region of convergence ==\nIf {{math|''f''}} is a locally integrable function (or more generally a Borel measure locally of bounded variation), then the Laplace transform {{math|''F''(''s'')}} of {{math|''f''}} converges provided that the limit\n: <math>\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_0^R f(t)e^{-st}\\,dt</math>\nexists.\n\nThe Laplace transform converges absolutely if the integral\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\left|f(t)e^{-st}\\right|\\,dt</math>\nexists (as a proper Lebesgue integral).  The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former instead of the latter sense.\n\nThe set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges absolutely is either of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}} or else {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 ''a''}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an [[extended real number|extended real constant]], {{math|\u2212\u221e \u2264 ''a'' \u2264 \u221e}}.  (This follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]].) The constant {{math|''a''}} is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of {{math|''f''(''t'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter II, \u00a71}}</ref> Analogously, the two-sided transform converges absolutely in a strip of the form  {{math|''a'' < Re(''s'') < ''b''}}, and possibly including the lines {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}} or {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''b''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72}}</ref>  The subset of values of {{math|''s''}} for which the Laplace transform converges absolutely is called the region of absolute convergence or the domain of absolute convergence.  In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the strip of absolute convergence. The Laplace transform is analytic in the region of absolute convergence: this is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem]] and [[Morera's theorem]]. \n\nSimilarly, the set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges (conditionally or absolutely) is known as the region of conditional convergence, or simply the '''region of convergence''' (ROC).  If the Laplace transform converges (conditionally) at {{math|1=''s'' = ''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, then it automatically converges for all {{math|''s''}} with {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}.  Therefore, the region of convergence is a half-plane of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}}, possibly including some points of the boundary line {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}}.\n\nIn the region of convergence {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}, the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} can be expressed by [[integration by parts|integrating by parts]] as the integral\n: <math>F(s) = (s-s_0)\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-s_0)t}\\beta(t)\\,dt,\\quad \\beta(u) = \\int_0^u e^{-s_0t}f(t)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThat is, in the region of convergence {{math|''F''(''s'')}} can effectively be expressed as the absolutely convergent Laplace transform of some other function.  In particular, it is analytic.\n\nThere are several [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s concerning the relationship between the decay properties of {{math|''f''}} and the properties of the Laplace transform within the region of convergence.\n\nIn engineering applications, a function corresponding to a [[LTI system|linear time-invariant (LTI) system]] is ''stable'' if every bounded input produces a bounded output.  This is equivalent to the absolute convergence of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function in the region {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 0}}.  As a result, LTI systems are stable provided the poles of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function have negative real part.\n\nThis ROC is used in knowing about the causality and stability of a system.\n\n== Properties and theorems ==\nThe Laplace transform has a number of properties that make it useful for analyzing linear [[dynamical system]]s. The most significant advantage is that [[derivative|differentiation]] becomes multiplication, and [[integral|integration]] becomes division, by  {{math|''s''}} (similarly to [[logarithm]]s changing multiplication of numbers to addition of their logarithms).\n\nBecause of this property, the Laplace variable {{math|''s''}} is also known as ''operator variable'' in the {{math|''L''}} domain: either ''derivative operator'' or (for {{math|''s''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}} ''integration operator''. The transform turns [[integral equation]]s and [[differential equation]]s to [[polynomial equation]]s, which are much easier to solve.  Once solved, use of the inverse Laplace transform reverts to the original domain.\n\nGiven the functions {{math|''f''(''t'')}} and {{math|''g''(''t'')}}, and their respective Laplace transforms {{math|''F''(''s'')}} and {{math|''G''(''s'')}},\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nf(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\},\\\\\ng(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe following '''table''' is a list of properties of unilateral Laplace transform:<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|pp=226&ndash;227}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" id=\"291017_tableid\"\n|+ Properties of the unilateral Laplace transform\n|-\n !\n !

Replacing summation over {{math|''n''}} with integration over  {{math|''t''}}, a continuous version of the power series becomes\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) x^t\\, dt</math>\nwhere the discrete function {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is replaced by the continuous one {{math|''f''(''t'')}}. \n\nChanging the base of the power from {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''e''}} gives\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) \\left(e^{\\ln{x}}\\right)^t\\, dt</math>\n\nFor this to converge for, say, all bounded functions {{math|''f''}}, it is necessary to require that {{math|ln ''x'' < 0}}. Making the substitution {{math|1=&minus;''s'' = ln ''x''}} gives just the Laplace transform:\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-st}\\, dt</math>\n\nIn other words, the Laplace transform is a continuous analog of a power series in which the discrete parameter {{math|''n''}} is replaced by the continuous parameter {{math|''t''}}, and {{math|''x''}} is replaced by {{math|''e''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>}}.\n\n=== Relation to moments ===\n{{main article|Moment generating function}}\nThe quantities\n:<math>\\mu_n = \\int_0^\\infty t^nf(t)\\, dt</math>\n\nare the ''moments'' of the function {{math|''f''}}.

Let us prove the equivalent formulation:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty f(s)(\\mathcal{L}g)(s)\\,ds. </math>\n\nBy plugging in <math>(\\mathcal{L}f)(x)=\\int_0^\\infty f(s)e^{-sx}\\,ds</math> the left-hand side turns into:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty f(s)g(x) e^{-sx}\\,ds\\,dx, </math>\n\nbut assuming Fubini's theorem holds, by reversing the order of integration we get the wanted right-hand side.\n\n=== Relationship to other transforms ===\n\n==== Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform ====\nThe (unilateral) Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform of a function {{math|''g'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} is defined by the [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral]]\n\n: <math>\\{\\mathcal{L}^*g\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\, dg(t).</math>\n\nThe function {{math|''g''}} is assumed to be of [[bounded variation]].  If {{math|''g''}} is the [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}:\n\n: <math>g(x) = \\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>\n\nthen the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{math|''g''}} and the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} coincide.  In general, the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is the Laplace transform of the [[Stieltjes measure]] associated to {{math|''g''}}.  So in practice, the only distinction between the two transforms is that the Laplace transform is thought of as operating on the density function of the measure, whereas the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is thought of as operating on its [[cumulative distribution function]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|p=432}}</ref>\n\n==== Fourier transform ====\n{{Main|Fourier transform}}\nThe continuous Fourier transform is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with imaginary argument {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} or {{math|1=''s'' = 2''\u03c0fi''}}<ref>{{harvnb|Takacs|1953|p=93}}</ref> when the condition explained below is fulfilled, \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\widehat{f}(\\omega) &= \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}|_{s = i\\omega}  =  F(s)|_{s = i \\omega} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\omega t} f(t)\\,dt~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis definition of the Fourier transform requires a prefactor of {{math|1/(2''\u03c0'')}} on the reverse Fourier transform. This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the [[frequency spectrum]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or dynamical system.\n\nThe above relation is valid as stated if and only if the region of convergence (ROC) of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}} contains the imaginary axis,  {{math|1=''\u03c3'' = 0}}.\n\nFor example, the function {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = cos(''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>''t'')}} has a Laplace transform  {{math|1=''F''(''s'') =  ''s''/(''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)}} whose ROC is {{math|Re(''s'') > 0}}. As {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} is a pole of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, substituting  {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} in {{math|''F''(''s'')}} does not yield the Fourier transform of  {{math|''f''(''t'')''u''(''t'')}}, which is proportional to the [[Dirac delta-function]] {{math|''\u03b4''(''\u03c9'' \u2212 ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>)}}.\n\nHowever, a relation of the form\n: <math>\\lim_{\\sigma\\to 0^+} F(\\sigma+i\\omega) = \\widehat{f}(\\omega)</math>\nholds under much weaker conditions.  For instance, this holds for the above example provided that the limit is understood as a [[weak limit]] of measures (see [[vague topology]]).  General conditions relating the limit of the Laplace transform of a function on the boundary to the Fourier transform take the form of [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s.\n\n==== Mellin transform ====\n{{Main|Mellin transform}}\nThe Mellin transform and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables.\n\nIf in the Mellin transform\n: <math>G(s) = \\mathcal{M}\\{g(\\theta)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\theta^s g(\\theta) \\, \\frac{d\\theta} \\theta </math>\nwe set {{math|1=''\u03b8'' = ''e''<sup>\u2212''t''</sup>}} we get a two-sided Laplace transform.\n\n==== Z-transform ====\n{{Main|Z-transform}}\nThe unilateral or one-sided Z-transform is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of\n: <math> z \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} e^{sT} ,</math>\nwhere {{math|1=''T'' = 1/''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[Sampling theorem|sampling]] period (in units of time e.g., seconds) and  {{math|''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[sampling rate]] (in [[sample (signal)|samples per second]] or [[hertz]]).\n\nLet\n: <math> \\Delta_T(t) \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) </math>\nbe a sampling impulse train (also called a [[Dirac comb]]) and\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x_q(t) \\  &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  x(t) \\Delta_T(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) \\\\\n            &= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(n T) \\delta(t - n T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] \\delta(t - n T)\n\\end{align}</math>\nbe the sampled representation of the continuous-time {{math|''x''(''t'')}}\n: <math> x[n] \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}}  x(nT) ~.</math>\n\nThe Laplace transform of the sampled signal {{math|''x''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'') }} is\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  X_q(s) &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty x_q(t) e^{-s t} \\,dt \\\\\n         &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] e^{-n s T}~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is the precise definition of the unilateral Z-transform of the discrete function {{math|''x''[''n'']}}\n\n: <math> X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n} </math>\nwith the substitution of {{math|''z'' \u2192 e<sup>''sT''</sup>}}.\n\nComparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the unilateral Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal,\n: <math>X_q(s) =  X(z) \\Big|_{z=e^{sT}}.</math>\n\nThe similarity between the {{math|''Z''}} and Laplace transforms is expanded upon in the theory of [[time scale calculus]].\n\n==== Borel transform ====\nThe integral form of the [[Borel summation|Borel transform]]\n\n: <math>F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(z)e^{-sz}\\, dz</math>\n\nis a special case of the Laplace transform for {{math|''f''}} an [[entire function]] of exponential type, meaning that\n\n: <math>|f(z)|\\le Ae^{B|z|}</math>\n\nfor some constants {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.  The generalized Borel transform allows a different weighting function to be used, rather than the exponential function, to transform functions not of exponential type. [[Nachbin's theorem]] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Borel transform to be well defined.\n\n==== Fundamental relationships ====\nSince an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.\n\n== Table of selected Laplace transforms ==\n{{main article|List of Laplace transforms}}\n\nThe following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable.<ref>{{Citation |edition=3rd |page=455 |first1=K.

Circuit elements can be transformed into [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, very similar to [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] impedances.\n\nHere is a summary of equivalents:\n\n: [[File:S-Domain circuit equivalents.svg|alt={{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits|centre|frameless|400x400px|{{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits]]\n\nNote that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the {{math|''s''}}-domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the {{math|''s''}}-domain account for that.\n\nThe equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.\n\n== Examples and applications ==\n<!--A few worked examples are provided here to enable the reader to assess comprehension of the factual presentation.  Elaboration beyond the role of supporting factual comprehension belongs at [[v:|Wikiversity]] or [[b:|Wikibooks]].-->\n\nThe Laplace transform is used frequently in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]; the output of a [[linear time-invariant]] system can be calculated by convolving its unit impulse response with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the convolution into a multiplication; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see [[control theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform can also be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].  The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra.  The original differential equation can then be solved by applying the inverse Laplace transform.  The English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside first proposed a similar scheme, although without using the Laplace transform; and the resulting operational calculus is credited as the Heaviside calculus.\n\n=== Evaluating improper integrals ===\nLet <math>\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} = F(s)</math>, then (see the table above)\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{\\frac{f(t)} t \\right\\} = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp,</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)}{t}e^{-st}\\, dt = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>\n\nLetting {{math|''s'' \u2192 0}}, gives one the identity\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)} t \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>\n\nprovided that the interchange of limits can be justified. Even when the interchange cannot be justified the calculation can be suggestive. For example, with ''a''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''b'', proceeding formally one has\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\int_0^\\infty \\frac 1 t ( \\cos(at) - \\cos(bt) )\\, dt =\n  \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac p {p^2 + a^2} - \\frac{p}{p^2 + b^2}\\right)\\, dp \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac 1 2 \\left. \\ln\\frac{p^2 + a^2}{p^2 + b^2} \\right|_{p\\,:=\\,0}^\\infty = \\ln|b| - \\ln |a|.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe validity of this identity can be proved by other means. It is an example of a [[Frullani integral]].\n\nAnother example is [[Dirichlet integral]].\n\n=== Nuclear physics ===\nIn [[nuclear physics]], the following fundamental relationship governs [[radioactive decay]]: the number of radioactive atoms {{math|''N''}} in a sample of a radioactive [[isotope]] decays at a rate proportional to {{math|''N''}}.  This leads to the first order linear differential equation\n\n: <math>\\frac{dN}{dt} = -\\lambda N,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03bb''}} is the [[decay constant]]. The Laplace transform can be used to solve this equation.\n\nRearranging the equation to one side, we have\n\n: <math>\\frac{dN}{dt} + \\lambda N = 0.</math>\n\nNext, we take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation:\n\n: <math>\\left( s \\widetilde{N}(s) - N_0 \\right) + \\lambda \\widetilde{N}(s) = 0,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\widetilde{N}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{N(t)\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>N_0 = N(0).</math>\n\nSolving, we find\n\n: <math>\\widetilde{N}(s) = \\frac{N_0}{s + \\lambda}.</math>\n\nFinally, we take the inverse Laplace transform to find the general solution\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  N(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\{\\widetilde{N}(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{N_0}{s + \\lambda} \\right\\}\\\\\n       &= \\ N_0 e^{-\\lambda t},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich is indeed the correct form for radioactive decay.\n\n=== Complex impedance of a capacitor ===\nIn the theory of [[electrical circuit]]s, the current flow in a [[capacitor]] is proportional to the capacitance and rate of change in the electrical potential (in [[International System of Units|SI]] units). Symbolically, this is expressed by the differential equation\n\n: <math>i = C { dv \\over dt} ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''C''}} is the capacitance (in [[farad]]s) of the capacitor, {{math|1=''i'' = ''i''(''t'')}} is the [[electric current]] (in [[ampere]]s) through the capacitor as a function of time, and {{math|1=''v'' = ''v''(''t'')}} is the [[electrostatic potential|voltage]] (in [[volt]]s) across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain\n\n: <math>I(s) = C(s V(s) - V_0),</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  I(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ i(t) \\},\\\\\n  V(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>V_0 = v(t)\\Big|_{t=0}. \\, </math>\n\nSolving for {{math|''V''(''s'')}} we have\n\n: <math>V(s) = { I(s) \\over sC } + { V_0 \\over s }.</math>\n\nThe definition of the complex impedance {{math|''Z''}} (in [[ohm]]s) is the ratio of the complex voltage {{math|''V''}} divided by the complex current {{math|''I''}} while holding the initial state {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} at zero:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\left. { V(s) \\over I(s) } \\right|_{V_0 = 0}.</math>\n\nUsing this definition and the previous equation, we find:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\frac{1}{sC}, </math>\n\nwhich is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor. \nIn addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control theory.\n\n=== Partial fraction expansion ===\n<!-- [[Partial fractions in Laplace transforms]] redirect here -->\nConsider a linear time-invariant system with [[transfer function]]\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)}.</math>\n\nThe [[impulse response]] is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\}.</math>\n\nTo evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding {{math|''H''(''s'')}} using the method of partial fraction expansion,\n\n: <math>\\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)} = { P \\over s + \\alpha } + { R \\over s+\\beta }.</math>\n\nThe unknown constants {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s located at the corresponding poles of the transfer function. Each residue represents the relative contribution of that [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] to the transfer function's overall shape.\n\nBy the [[residue theorem]], the inverse Laplace transform depends only upon the poles and their residues. To find the residue {{math|''P''}}, we multiply both sides of the equation by {{math|''s'' + ''\u03b1''}} to get\n: <math>\\frac{1}{s + \\beta} = P  + { R (s + \\alpha) \\over s + \\beta }.</math>\n\nThen by letting {{math|1=''s'' = \u2212''\u03b1''}}, the contribution from {{math|''R''}} vanishes and all that is left is\n: <math>P = \\left.{1 \\over s+\\beta}\\right|_{s=-\\alpha} = {1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha}.</math>\n\nSimilarly, the residue {{math|''R''}} is given by\n: <math>R = \\left.{1 \\over s + \\alpha}\\right|_{s=-\\beta} = {1 \\over \\alpha - \\beta}.</math>\n\nNote that\n: <math>R = {-1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha} = - P</math>\nand so the substitution of {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''P''}} into the expanded expression for {{math|''H''(''s'')}} gives\n: <math>H(s)  = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\right) \\cdot \\left(  { 1 \\over s + \\alpha } - { 1  \\over s + \\beta }  \\right).</math>\n\nFinally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see ''Item'' #''3'' in the ''Table of Laplace Transforms'', above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of {{math|''H''(''s'')}} to obtain\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}\\right),</math>\nwhich is the impulse response of the system.\n\n;Convolution\nThe same result can be achieved using the [[Convolution theorem|convolution property]] as if the system is a series of filters with transfer functions of {{math|1/(''s'' + ''a'')}} and {{math|1/(''s'' + ''b'')}}. That is, the inverse of\n\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + a)(s + b)} = \\frac{1}{s+a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + b}</math>\n\nis\n\n: <math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s + a} \\right\\} * \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s + b} \\right\\} = e^{-at} * e^{-bt} = \\int_0^t e^{-ax}e^{-b(t - x)}\\, dx = \\frac{e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}}{b - a}.</math>\n\n=== Phase delay ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

His father and mother originally worked in garment factories. His father was later employed by the labor union that represented garment workers, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU). Nussbaum grew up on the lower east side of Manhattan, home at the time to many immigrant families from Eastern Europe.\n\nHe attended neighborhood public schools. In 1951 he was admitted to [[Stuyvesant High School]], a specialized public high school in New York City which requires the passing of an entrance exam for admission.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/nyregion/dueling-fund-raising-campaigns-undercut-efforts-at-stuyvesant.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes+Topics%2FOrganizations%2FS%2FStuyvesant+High+School |title=Dueling Fund-Raising Campaigns Undercut Efforts at Stuyvesant |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=2003-05-05 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> He graduated in 1954, having been a member of the school's academic honor society, and an editor on the school's newspaper, the Stuyvesant Spectator.\n\nNussbaum then was accepted at Columbia College in New York. He was awarded scholarships by New York State and by Columbia which made it possible for him to attend Columbia. He joined the staff of the college daily newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator and, in his senior year, became its Editor-in-Chief. He was also elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. During the summer months he worked as a waiter at hotels in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania and the Catskill Mountains in New York to help pay for his education.\n\nIn 1958 Nussbaum graduated from Columbia and was admitted to [[Harvard Law School]]. After his first year in law school, on the basis of his academic record, he was selected to join the Harvard Law Review and was given a full tuition scholarship by the law school. In his senior year he became a Note Editor of the Law Review, succeeding future Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]].\n\nUpon completing law school in 1961, Nussbaum was awarded a Harvard University Sheldon Traveling Fellowship. This fellowship enabled him to travel around the world for a year visiting over 30 countries. On his return he served for six months on active duty in the United States Army and was a member of the Army Reserves for six years.\n\n==Early career==\n\nIn 1962 he was sworn in as an Assistant United States Attorney in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], in the office led by [[Robert Morgenthau]]. He was a federal prosecutor for over three years and tried a number of major criminal cases. These included convicting, after a four-month trial, five officials of a federal savings and loan association of perjury. The perjury was committed by the bank officers to cover up the diversion of over $250,000 from the savings and loan association to finance a political campaign for Congress being conducted by the president of the association. He also won a jury verdict convicting a prominent accountant and investor of bribing and conspiring (with other major investors) to bribe an internal revenue agent.\n\nIn 1966 Nussbaum joined the New York law firm, [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz]], one year after the firm was founded in January 1965 by Martin Lipton, Herbert Wachtell, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, four lawyers in their early 30's who in time became preeminent in the legal profession.  In 1966 the firm had less than 10 lawyers. Today it has over 250 lawyers and is one of the most successful corporate law firms in the United States. \n\nIn 1968, Nussbaum ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly. In a close contest, in a Democratic primary election in Brooklyn, New York, he lost to the incumbent assemblyman.\n\nIn 1970 Nussbaum managed Robert Morgenthau's campaign for Governor of the State of New York. He led a group of former Assistant United States Attorneys in conducting a statewide petition drive to place Morgenthau's name on the Democratic Party primary ballot for the party's nomination for Governor, opposing [[Arthur Goldberg]], the former Supreme Court Justice, who was the choice of the Democratic Party leaders.\n\nIn a short period of time well over 15,000 signatures of registered Democrats were collected in over 50 New York counties, with the requirement that there be at least 100 such valid signatures in each county. Many of the upstate counties in New York have few residents and even fewer registered democrats. This made the petition drive difficult. The petition drive, however, succeeded and Morgenthau began his primary race against Goldberg. A third political party, the Liberal Party, then decided to give its nomination to Goldberg. This decision (which would have had the effect of splitting the vote against the incumbent Governor if Morgenthau won the Democratic primary) made it virtually impossible for Morgenthau to defeat the incumbent Governor, Nelson Rockefeller, in the general election. Morgenthau therefore withdrew from the primary race. Goldberg ran as the Democratic/Liberal candidate against Rockefeller in the general election and was defeated.\n\nIn 1972, Nussbaum represented [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] who, in a surprise victory, had defeated senior U.S. Representative [[Emanuel Celler]], who at the time was chairman of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], by a little over 600 votes in the Democratic primary election. Celler brought suit in a Brooklyn state court to set aside that victory. Nussbaum won that case, which was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, and Holtzman's election was upheld. As a result of that victory Peter Rodino, a senior congressman from New Jersey replaced Celler and became chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives which later successfully conducted the impeachment inquiry involving President Nixon.<ref name=BN10012011interview>{{cite interview |last=Nussbaum |first=Bernard |subjectlink=Bernard Nussbaum |interviewer=Timothy Naftali |title=An Oral History Interview with Bernard Nussbaum |work= Richard Nixon Oral History Project |publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum| location=Yorba Linda, California |date=October 1, 2011| url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/forresearchers/find/histories/nussbaum-2011-10-01.pdf| accessdate=January 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, during New York City's fiscal crises, Nussbaum represented the Comptroller of the City of New York. At the time the Comptroller, along with the Mayor and the City, were the subject of an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission into whether there was fraud in the sale of City securities. After a lengthy inquiry, during which numerous documents were produced and top city officials testified, there was no finding of any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile in private practice he also served as a member of the adjunct faculty of Columbia Law School, conducting a seminar in trial practice for third year law students.\n\n==Nixon impeachment inquiry==\n{{further|Impeachment process against Richard Nixon}}\n\nIn December 1973 Nussbaum left his law firm to serve as a senior member on the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee's]] [[impeachment]] inquiry staff, led by [[John Doar]], which conducted the [[Impeachment in the United States| impeachment investigation]] involving [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. Nussbaum participated in overseeing the fact gathering process. This included analyzing the White House tape recordings made by President Nixon, and interviewing significant witnesses such as John Dean, the President's former White House Counsel, John Mitchell, the former Attorney General in the Nixon administration, and Charles Colson, a former special assistant to the President. He played a role in presenting the results of the staff's inquiry to the House Judiciary Committee. In July 1974 the Committee, by a bi-partisan vote, voted to recommend to the House of Representatives that the President be impeached. Shortly thereafter, on August 9, 1974, President Nixon resigned. At the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry Nussbaum rejoined his law firm.<ref name=BN10012011interview/>\n\nWhile serving on the Judiciary Committee staff Nussbaum met and worked with Hillary Rodham, a recent law school graduate who was also a member of the staff. She introduced him to the man she would marry in 1975, Bill Clinton.\n\n==Counsel to President Clinton==\n\nIn 1993 Nussbaum again left his law firm, when he was appointed Counsel to the President of the United States.<ref>Bernstein, ''A Woman in Charge'', p. 251.</ref> During his tenure as President [[Bill Clinton]]'s first White House Counsel he was involved in a number of major personnel and policy issues facing the administration. These included the appointment of [[Janet Reno]] as Attorney General, the recruitment of a new FBI director, and the selection of approximately 100 federal judges, most notably Judge [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nHe was also involved in handling the early stages of the Whitewater matter, an investigation into an unsuccessful Arkansas real estate investment made by the Clintons years earlier, and the investigation of the suicide of his deputy, Vincent Foster.<ref name=\"Bernstein 364-365\">Bernstein, ''A Woman in Charge'', pp. 364-365.</ref> Contrary to the advice of others on the White House staff, in the administration, and in Congress, Nussbaum strongly urged the President not to seek the appointment of an Independent Counsel with respect to these matters.<ref name=\"Bernstein 364-365\"/> He maintained there was no legal basis for such an appointment, as there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the President, either before or after he entered office. He warned the president that the institution of the Independent Counsel, which is responsible to no one, tends to become an uncontrolled, never ending effort to find wrongdoing even where none exists. He predicted that conservative judges would replace anyone who was appointed by the Attorney General with a choice more to their liking. He predicted the investigation would likely last as long as the President was in office and beyond. Consequently, he argued, despite media and congressional pressure, in addition to their being no legal basis, it also made no political sense to request such an appointment.\n\nThe President, nonetheless, in response to media and congressional pressure, decided to ask the Attorney General to appoint an Independent Counsel and she did. A few months later, as predicted by Nussbaum, three appellate judges replaced the Counsel appointed by the Attorney General and selected Kenneth Starr as the Independent Counsel. An investigation then took place which never resulted in criminal charges against the President, but lasted for over seven years, until after the end of the Clinton presidency. It did, however, result, based on subsequent personal conduct (involving a White House intern) separate from the  Whitewater mater,  in [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton being impeached]] by the House of Representatives in December 1998, He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate, but the Clinton impeachment proceeding subsequently effected future Presidential elections, first involving Vice President Al Gore and later Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn his memoir ''[[My Life (Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', published after he left office, President Clinton said the single biggest error he made as President was not listening to Nussbaum and, instead, requesting the appointment of an Independent Counsel. He wrote: \"It was the worst presidential decision I ever made, wrong on the facts, wrong on the law, wrong on the politics, wrong for the presidency, and the Constitution.\" (''My Life'', p.&nbsp; 574).\n\nReferring to media criticism of Nussbaum's advice, the President wrote \"there would have no investigation, subpoenas, or grand jury if I had listened to him and refused to give into the demands for an independent counsel to 'clear the air.' Bernie's real offense was that he thought I should abide by the rule of law and accepted standards of propriety, rather than the constantly shifting standards of the Whitewater media, which were designed to produce the very results they professed to deplore.\" [My Life, p. 587]. \n\nNussbaum resigned on March 5, 1994,<ref>{{cite web | title=Letter accepting the resignation of Bernard W. Nussbaum as counsel to the President | work=Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents | date=1994-03-14 | accessdate=2008-01-03 | publisher=encyclopedia.com | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-15324771.html | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204153201/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-15324771.html | archivedate=2008-02-04 }}</ref> as a result of the Whitewater controversy and the position he took regarding the appointment of an Independent Counsel. President Clinton later wrote: \"Bernie Nussbaum resigned in early March; he never got over my foolish decision to ask for an independent counsel, and he didn't want to be a source of further problems ... [he was an] able, honest public servant.\" (My Life, p. 586)  \n\nNussbaum returned to his law firm in late 1994 and resumed the private practice of law.\n\n==Later career==\nOver the years, as a senior litigation partner at the Wachtell Lipton firm, Nussbaum represented a wide range of clients including major corporate entities, law firms, law firm partners, government officials, political figures and the judiciary.\n\nWorking together with his firm's partners and associates, Nussbaum was the lead trial lawyer in numerous cases tried in various state and federal courts around the country, most notably a number of significant corporate cases won by his firm.\n\nThese included representing United Technologies Corporation in defeating an antitrust suit brought by the US Department of Justice and Carrier Corporation in a New York federal court which sought to prevent United from acquiring Carrier. He represented Hilton Corporation in a Nevada federal court and obtained an injunction preventing ITT corporation from blocking a take over effort. He won a judgment in Delaware Chancery Court on behalf of IBP Corporation ordering Tyson Foods to consummate a multi-billion merger between IBP and Tyson, which Tyson had agreed to but was seeking to avoid. In a South Carolina state court he defeated an effort by Jack Kent Cooke to take over Multimedia a local owned broadcast and newspaper enterprise.\n\nIn 2004 Nussbaum won a jury verdict in a New York federal court on behalf of the developer of the World Trade Center, Larry Silverstein, against a number of major insurance companies. After a trial lasting more than a month, the jury found that what occurred on September 11, 2001, when two towers were destroyed by two planes, was not a single event, as claimed by the insurance companies, but was, under the terms of the insurance agreements then in force, two separate events. This significantly increased the amount of insurance due and resulted in a multi-billion payment to the developer for the rebuilding of the Center.\n\nIn the course of his career, Nussbaum was asked to represent a number of major law firms (including Sullivan and Cromwell and Shearman and Sterling) in law suits brought against them or certain of their partners. There suits were resolved in favor of his law firm clients.\n\nHe represented a senior partner of the Simpson Thacher law firm who was charged with diverting fees owing to the firm. His client ultimately pleaded guilt and cooperated with law enforcement authorities. After lower court hearings and an appeal, a prison term which had been imposed was set aside and his client was not required to serve any time in prison.\n\nIn 1992, in a case which generated one of the most prominent legal ethics controversies of the decade, Nussbaum represented the leading law firm of Kaye Scholer. A government agency sued Kay Scholer charging it with improperly withholding damaging  information about its client, a large federal savings and loan association whose failure epitomized the savings and loan disaster in the early 1990s. The law firm vehemently denied it anything wrong in representing its client; it maintained it had an obligation to represent its client zealously and not to disclose information harmful to its client.\n\nAt the outset of the lawsuit the government froze all the assets of Kay Scholer. This freeze rapidly put the firm close to collapse. It made it virtually impossible to contest the government's action as the firm would likely not survive in the interim as clients and employees would depart. At this point Nussbaum was retained to represent Kaye Scholer. In less than a week a settlement was reached which did not require an admission of wrongdoing by the firm and provided for a monetary payment over time which was covered by insurance. This enabled the firm to continue as a respected and successful law firm.\n\nRecently, because judicial salaries in New York had been frozen for more than a decade (the legislature refused to raise judicial salaries unless its salaries were raised and the Governor refused to agree to  legislative salaries being raised), Nussbaum represented the Chief Judge of the State of New York and the Judiciary of the State, without fee, in successful constitutional litigation ultimately decided by the state's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that holding judicial salaries hostage to legislative salaries was unconstitutional. As a consequence, the Legislature and the Governor agreed to change the system for the compensation of judges. Decisions regarding judicial salaries are now made every four years by an independent commission rather than by the executive and legislative branches. And in recent years salaries of state court judges have been significantly increased to approximate the salaries of federal judges, which, before the lawsuit was brought, were considerably higher than state court judges. They are now roughly equal.\n\nOn January 28, 2011, Nussbaum sent a letter to President Obama stating that while serving as White House Counsel he extensively reviewed the Jonathan Pollard file.<ref name=jp>{{cite news|title='Keeping Pollard in jail is a miscarriage of justice\u2019|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Keeping-Pollard-in-jail-is-a-miscarriage-of-justice|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=6 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=letter>{{cite web|title=Text: Letter of Former WH Legal Counsel Bernard Nussbaum to Pres.

In 1993 he was awarded an honorary LL.D. from The George Washington University National Law Center. He has served as Vice President of the New York City Bar Association and as President of the Federal Bar Council, a Bar Association whose membership consists of lawyers and judges who practice primarily in federal courts within the Second Circuit. He is a Fellow of the American College of Trial lawyers, a select professional association of trial lawyers from the United States and Canada,\n\nNussbaum has been a member of a number of philanthropic boards of trustees, including Brandeis University and the Jewish Theological Seminary. He has served as a trustee of the Boys Brotherhood Republic (now part of the Henry Street Settlement), a self-governing youth club on the lower east side of Manhattan. Created in the 1930s, Nussbaum was a member of that club as a child.\n\nHe presently serves on the Board of Trustees of The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York which encompasses seven major hospitals in New York City and a highly regarded medical school. He is a member of the Board's audit committee and legal committee.\n\nNussbaum is also currently a member of a three-person Independent Review Board appointed in 2014 by the Brooklyn District Attorney. The board reviews decisions made by the district attorney's office as to whether certain individuals have been wrongly convicted of crimes. That process has resulted in a number of convictions being set aside and persons being released from prison.\n\nIn January 2006 his wife Toby, to whom he was married for 42 years, died of pancreatic cancer. They met in 1958 when she was an undergraduate at Brandeis University and he was a first year law student at Harvard. Throughout her adult life she was active in political, community and philanthropic affairs, particularly with non-profit organizations in the Jewish community.\n\nIn December 2008 Nussbaum married Nancy Kuhn, who had been a fundraiser for political and charitable organizations. Among other political races, she played an important role in raising funds, in New York State and elsewhere, for the Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale during the 1984 campaign. Nussbaum and Kuhn reside in Manhattan, Stamford, Connecticut, and Naples, Florida.\n\nHe has three children: a daughter, Emily Nussbaum (who is married to Clive Thompson and is on the staff of The New Yorker magazine; she was its television critic and won both the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism and the National Magazine Award for Columns and Commentary); two sons, Peter Nussbaum (married to Alexis Tannenbaum),  Frank Nussbaum (married to Carlye Adler) and a stepson, William Kuhn. He also has six grandchildren.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wlrk.com/BWNussbaum/ Bio page at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz]\n* [https://today.law.harvard.edu/role-counsel/ Profile in Harvard Law Bulletin]\n*{{C-SPAN|BernardNussbaum}}\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-legal}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[C.

In 1951 he was admitted to [[Stuyvesant High School]], a specialized public high school in New York City which requires the passing of an entrance exam for admission.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/nyregion/dueling-fund-raising-campaigns-undercut-efforts-at-stuyvesant.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes+Topics%2FOrganizations%2FS%2FStuyvesant+High+School |title=Dueling Fund-Raising Campaigns Undercut Efforts at Stuyvesant |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=2003-05-05 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> He graduated in 1954, having been a member of the school's academic honor society, and an editor on the school's newspaper, the Stuyvesant Spectator.\n\nNussbaum then was accepted at Columbia College in New York. He was awarded scholarships by New York State and by Columbia which made it possible for him to attend Columbia. He joined the staff of the college daily newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator and, in his senior year, became its Editor-in-Chief. He was also elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. During the summer months he worked as a waiter at hotels in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania and the Catskill Mountains in New York to help pay for his education.\n\nIn 1958 Nussbaum graduated from Columbia and was admitted to [[Harvard Law School]]. After his first year in law school, on the basis of his academic record, he was selected to join the Harvard Law Review and was given a full tuition scholarship by the law school. In his senior year he became a Note Editor of the Law Review, succeeding future Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]].\n\nUpon completing law school in 1961, Nussbaum was awarded a Harvard University Sheldon Traveling Fellowship. This fellowship enabled him to travel around the world for a year visiting over 30 countries. On his return he served for six months on active duty in the United States Army and was a member of the Army Reserves for six years.\n\n==Early career==\n\nIn 1962 he was sworn in as an Assistant United States Attorney in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], in the office led by [[Robert Morgenthau]]. He was a federal prosecutor for over three years and tried a number of major criminal cases. These included convicting, after a four-month trial, five officials of a federal savings and loan association of perjury. The perjury was committed by the bank officers to cover up the diversion of over $250,000 from the savings and loan association to finance a political campaign for Congress being conducted by the president of the association. He also won a jury verdict convicting a prominent accountant and investor of bribing and conspiring (with other major investors) to bribe an internal revenue agent.\n\nIn 1966 Nussbaum joined the New York law firm, [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz]], one year after the firm was founded in January 1965 by Martin Lipton, Herbert Wachtell, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, four lawyers in their early 30's who in time became preeminent in the legal profession.  In 1966 the firm had less than 10 lawyers. Today it has over 250 lawyers and is one of the most successful corporate law firms in the United States. \n\nIn 1968, Nussbaum ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly. In a close contest, in a Democratic primary election in Brooklyn, New York, he lost to the incumbent assemblyman.\n\nIn 1970 Nussbaum managed Robert Morgenthau's campaign for Governor of the State of New York. He led a group of former Assistant United States Attorneys in conducting a statewide petition drive to place Morgenthau's name on the Democratic Party primary ballot for the party's nomination for Governor, opposing [[Arthur Goldberg]], the former Supreme Court Justice, who was the choice of the Democratic Party leaders.\n\nIn a short period of time well over 15,000 signatures of registered Democrats were collected in over 50 New York counties, with the requirement that there be at least 100 such valid signatures in each county. Many of the upstate counties in New York have few residents and even fewer registered democrats. This made the petition drive difficult. The petition drive, however, succeeded and Morgenthau began his primary race against Goldberg. A third political party, the Liberal Party, then decided to give its nomination to Goldberg. This decision (which would have had the effect of splitting the vote against the incumbent Governor if Morgenthau won the Democratic primary) made it virtually impossible for Morgenthau to defeat the incumbent Governor, Nelson Rockefeller, in the general election. Morgenthau therefore withdrew from the primary race. Goldberg ran as the Democratic/Liberal candidate against Rockefeller in the general election and was defeated.\n\nIn 1972, Nussbaum represented [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] who, in a surprise victory, had defeated senior U.S. Representative [[Emanuel Celler]], who at the time was chairman of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], by a little over 600 votes in the Democratic primary election. Celler brought suit in a Brooklyn state court to set aside that victory. Nussbaum won that case, which was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, and Holtzman's election was upheld. As a result of that victory Peter Rodino, a senior congressman from New Jersey replaced Celler and became chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives which later successfully conducted the impeachment inquiry involving President Nixon.<ref name=BN10012011interview>{{cite interview |last=Nussbaum |first=Bernard |subjectlink=Bernard Nussbaum |interviewer=Timothy Naftali |title=An Oral History Interview with Bernard Nussbaum |work= Richard Nixon Oral History Project |publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum| location=Yorba Linda, California |date=October 1, 2011| url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/forresearchers/find/histories/nussbaum-2011-10-01.pdf| accessdate=January 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, during New York City's fiscal crises, Nussbaum represented the Comptroller of the City of New York. At the time the Comptroller, along with the Mayor and the City, were the subject of an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission into whether there was fraud in the sale of City securities. After a lengthy inquiry, during which numerous documents were produced and top city officials testified, there was no finding of any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile in private practice he also served as a member of the adjunct faculty of Columbia Law School, conducting a seminar in trial practice for third year law students.\n\n==Nixon impeachment inquiry==\n{{further|Impeachment process against Richard Nixon}}\n\nIn December 1973 Nussbaum left his law firm to serve as a senior member on the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee's]] [[impeachment]] inquiry staff, led by [[John Doar]], which conducted the [[Impeachment in the United States| impeachment investigation]] involving [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. Nussbaum participated in overseeing the fact gathering process. This included analyzing the White House tape recordings made by President Nixon, and interviewing significant witnesses such as John Dean, the President's former White House Counsel, John Mitchell, the former Attorney General in the Nixon administration, and Charles Colson, a former special assistant to the President. He played a role in presenting the results of the staff's inquiry to the House Judiciary Committee. In July 1974 the Committee, by a bi-partisan vote, voted to recommend to the House of Representatives that the President be impeached. Shortly thereafter, on August 9, 1974, President Nixon resigned. At the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry Nussbaum rejoined his law firm.<ref name=BN10012011interview/>\n\nWhile serving on the Judiciary Committee staff Nussbaum met and worked with Hillary Rodham, a recent law school graduate who was also a member of the staff. She introduced him to the man she would marry in 1975, Bill Clinton.\n\n==Counsel to President Clinton==\n\nIn 1993 Nussbaum again left his law firm, when he was appointed Counsel to the President of the United States.<ref>Bernstein, ''A Woman in Charge'', p. 251.</ref> During his tenure as President [[Bill Clinton]]'s first White House Counsel he was involved in a number of major personnel and policy issues facing the administration. These included the appointment of [[Janet Reno]] as Attorney General, the recruitment of a new FBI director, and the selection of approximately 100 federal judges, most notably Judge [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nHe was also involved in handling the early stages of the Whitewater matter, an investigation into an unsuccessful Arkansas real estate investment made by the Clintons years earlier, and the investigation of the suicide of his deputy, Vincent Foster.<ref name=\"Bernstein 364-365\">Bernstein, ''A Woman in Charge'', pp. 364-365.</ref> Contrary to the advice of others on the White House staff, in the administration, and in Congress, Nussbaum strongly urged the President not to seek the appointment of an Independent Counsel with respect to these matters.<ref name=\"Bernstein 364-365\"/> He maintained there was no legal basis for such an appointment, as there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the President, either before or after he entered office. He warned the president that the institution of the Independent Counsel, which is responsible to no one, tends to become an uncontrolled, never ending effort to find wrongdoing even where none exists. He predicted that conservative judges would replace anyone who was appointed by the Attorney General with a choice more to their liking. He predicted the investigation would likely last as long as the President was in office and beyond. Consequently, he argued, despite media and congressional pressure, in addition to their being no legal basis, it also made no political sense to request such an appointment.\n\nThe President, nonetheless, in response to media and congressional pressure, decided to ask the Attorney General to appoint an Independent Counsel and she did. A few months later, as predicted by Nussbaum, three appellate judges replaced the Counsel appointed by the Attorney General and selected Kenneth Starr as the Independent Counsel. An investigation then took place which never resulted in criminal charges against the President, but lasted for over seven years, until after the end of the Clinton presidency. It did, however, result, based on subsequent personal conduct (involving a White House intern) separate from the  Whitewater mater,  in [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton being impeached]] by the House of Representatives in December 1998, He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate, but the Clinton impeachment proceeding subsequently effected future Presidential elections, first involving Vice President Al Gore and later Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn his memoir ''[[My Life (Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', published after he left office, President Clinton said the single biggest error he made as President was not listening to Nussbaum and, instead, requesting the appointment of an Independent Counsel. He wrote: \"It was the worst presidential decision I ever made, wrong on the facts, wrong on the law, wrong on the politics, wrong for the presidency, and the Constitution.\" (''My Life'', p.&nbsp; 574).\n\nReferring to media criticism of Nussbaum's advice, the President wrote \"there would have no investigation, subpoenas, or grand jury if I had listened to him and refused to give into the demands for an independent counsel to 'clear the air.' Bernie's real offense was that he thought I should abide by the rule of law and accepted standards of propriety, rather than the constantly shifting standards of the Whitewater media, which were designed to produce the very results they professed to deplore.\" [My Life, p. 587]. \n\nNussbaum resigned on March 5, 1994,<ref>{{cite web | title=Letter accepting the resignation of Bernard W. Nussbaum as counsel to the President | work=Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents | date=1994-03-14 | accessdate=2008-01-03 | publisher=encyclopedia.com | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-15324771.html | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204153201/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-15324771.html | archivedate=2008-02-04 }}</ref> as a result of the Whitewater controversy and the position he took regarding the appointment of an Independent Counsel. President Clinton later wrote: \"Bernie Nussbaum resigned in early March; he never got over my foolish decision to ask for an independent counsel, and he didn't want to be a source of further problems ... [he was an] able, honest public servant.\" (My Life, p. 586)  \n\nNussbaum returned to his law firm in late 1994 and resumed the private practice of law.\n\n==Later career==\nOver the years, as a senior litigation partner at the Wachtell Lipton firm, Nussbaum represented a wide range of clients including major corporate entities, law firms, law firm partners, government officials, political figures and the judiciary.\n\nWorking together with his firm's partners and associates, Nussbaum was the lead trial lawyer in numerous cases tried in various state and federal courts around the country, most notably a number of significant corporate cases won by his firm.\n\nThese included representing United Technologies Corporation in defeating an antitrust suit brought by the US Department of Justice and Carrier Corporation in a New York federal court which sought to prevent United from acquiring Carrier. He represented Hilton Corporation in a Nevada federal court and obtained an injunction preventing ITT corporation from blocking a take over effort. He won a judgment in Delaware Chancery Court on behalf of IBP Corporation ordering Tyson Foods to consummate a multi-billion merger between IBP and Tyson, which Tyson had agreed to but was seeking to avoid. In a South Carolina state court he defeated an effort by Jack Kent Cooke to take over Multimedia a local owned broadcast and newspaper enterprise.\n\nIn 2004 Nussbaum won a jury verdict in a New York federal court on behalf of the developer of the World Trade Center, Larry Silverstein, against a number of major insurance companies. After a trial lasting more than a month, the jury found that what occurred on September 11, 2001, when two towers were destroyed by two planes, was not a single event, as claimed by the insurance companies, but was, under the terms of the insurance agreements then in force, two separate events. This significantly increased the amount of insurance due and resulted in a multi-billion payment to the developer for the rebuilding of the Center.\n\nIn the course of his career, Nussbaum was asked to represent a number of major law firms (including Sullivan and Cromwell and Shearman and Sterling) in law suits brought against them or certain of their partners. There suits were resolved in favor of his law firm clients.\n\nHe represented a senior partner of the Simpson Thacher law firm who was charged with diverting fees owing to the firm. His client ultimately pleaded guilt and cooperated with law enforcement authorities. After lower court hearings and an appeal, a prison term which had been imposed was set aside and his client was not required to serve any time in prison.\n\nIn 1992, in a case which generated one of the most prominent legal ethics controversies of the decade, Nussbaum represented the leading law firm of Kaye Scholer. A government agency sued Kay Scholer charging it with improperly withholding damaging  information about its client, a large federal savings and loan association whose failure epitomized the savings and loan disaster in the early 1990's. The law firm vehemently denied it anything wrong in representing its client; it maintained it had an obligation to represent its client zealously and not to disclose information harmful to its client.\n\nAt the outset of the lawsuit the government froze all the assets of Kay Scholer. This freeze rapidly put the firm close to collapse. It made it virtually impossible to contest the government's action as the firm would likely not survive in the interim as clients and employees would depart. At this point Nussbaum was retained to represent Kaye Scholer. In less than a week a settlement was reached which did not require an admission of wrongdoing by the firm and provided for a monetary payment over time which was covered by insurance. This enabled the firm to continue as a respected and successful law firm.\n\nRecently, because judicial salaries in New York had been frozen for more than a decade (the legislature refused to raise judicial salaries unless its salaries were raised and the Governor refused to agree to  legislative salaries being raised), Nussbaum represented the Chief Judge of the State of New York and the Judiciary of the State, without fee, in successful constitutional litigation ultimately decided by the state's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that holding judicial salaries hostage to legislative salaries was unconstitutional. As a consequence, the Legislature and the Governor agreed to change the system for the compensation of judges. Decisions regarding judicial salaries are now made every four years by an independent commission rather than by the executive and legislative branches. And in recent years salaries of state court judges have been significantly increased to approximate the salaries of federal judges, which, before the lawsuit was brought, were considerably higher than state court judges. They are now roughly equal.\n\nOn January 28, 2011, Nussbaum sent a letter to President Obama stating that while serving as White House Counsel he extensively reviewed the Jonathan Pollard file.<ref name=jp>{{cite news|title='Keeping Pollard in jail is a miscarriage of justice\u2019|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Keeping-Pollard-in-jail-is-a-miscarriage-of-justice|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=6 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=letter>{{cite web|title=Text: Letter of Former WH Legal Counsel Bernard Nussbaum to Pres.

In 1993 he was awarded an honorary LL.D. from The George Washington University National Law Center. He has served as Vice President of the New York City Bar Association and as President of the Federal Bar Council, a Bar Association whose membership consists of lawyers and judges who practice primarily in federal courts within the Second Circuit. He is a Fellow of the American College of Trial lawyers, a select professional association of trial lawyers from the United States and Canada,\n\nNussbaum has been a member of a number of philanthropic boards of trustees, including Brandeis University and the Jewish Theological Seminary. He has served as a trustee of the Boys Brotherhood Republic (now part of the Henry Street Settlement), a self-governing youth club on the lower east side of Manhattan. Created in the 1930s, Nussbaum was a member of that club as a child.\n\nHe presently serves on the Board of Trustees of The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York which encompasses seven major hospitals in New York City and a highly regarded medical school. He is a member of the Board's audit committee and legal committee.\n\nNussbaum is also currently a member of a three-person Independent Review Board appointed in 2014 by the Brooklyn District Attorney. The board reviews decisions made by the district attorney's office as to whether certain individuals have been wrongly convicted of crimes. That process has resulted in a number of convictions being set aside and persons being released from prison.\n\nIn January 2006 his wife Toby, to whom he was married for 42 years, died of pancreatic cancer. They met in 1958 when she was an undergraduate at Brandeis University and he was a first year law student at Harvard. Throughout her adult life she was active in political, community and philanthropic affairs, particularly with non-profit organizations in the Jewish community.\n\nIn December 2008 Nussbaum married Nancy Kuhn, who had been a fundraiser for political and charitable organizations. Among other political races, she played an important role in raising funds, in New York State and elsewhere, for the Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale during the 1984 campaign. Nussbaum and Kuhn reside in Manhattan, Stamford, Connecticut, and Naples, Florida.\n\nHe has three children: a daughter, Emily Nussbaum (who is married to Clive Thompson and is on the staff of The New Yorker magazine; she was its television critic and won both the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism and the National Magazine Award for Columns and Commentary); two sons, Peter Nussbaum (married to Alexis Tannenbaum),  Frank Nussbaum (married to Carlye Adler) and a stepson, William Kuhn. He also has six grandchildren.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wlrk.com/BWNussbaum/ Bio page at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz]\n* [https://today.law.harvard.edu/role-counsel/ Profile in Harvard Law Bulletin]\n*{{C-SPAN|BernardNussbaum}}\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-legal}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[C.

Each song in the project was researched, organized, and rerecorded with the help of veteran traditional musicians around the country and of the Japanese [[audio engineer]], Hiroshi Iguchi. The project was made up of seven categories, namely: ''Maha Gita (Classical Music)'', ''Kar La Paw (Traditional Contemporary Music)'', ''Thabin Gita (Dramatic Music)'', ''Myanmar Hsaing (Traditional Ensemble)'', ''Kyay Let Gita (Folk Music)'', ''Nat Chin (Spiritual Music)'', and ''Let Swam Pya (Instrumental Solos)''. The project was planned to release into nine volumes. In 2018, '''Gita Yadana''' was launched, and the very first volume of the project was released on both international and local streaming sites like Spotify, MMN and JOOX.<ref name=\"treasures\" /> Until the end of 2019, six volumes under the name '''Gita Yadana''' had been released.\n\nBeing a teacher and a musician, Diramore never hesitates to share knowledge of music every chance he gets.

Therefore, the project was broadened into a collection of 1,000 Myanmar Traditional songs and renamed as '''Gita Yadana'''.<ref name=\"treasures\">{{Cite web|title =gitayadana-reviving-forgotten-treasures|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/gitayadana-reviving-forgotten-treasures.html/}}</ref> The aim of this project is to build a massive interactive archive where a thousand of old and rare Myanmar Traditional songs with [[high-resolution audio]] can be easily observed. Each song in the project was researched, organized, and rerecorded with the help of veteran traditional musicians around the country and of the Japanese [[audio engineer]], Hiroshi Iguchi. The project was made up of seven categories, namely: ''Maha Gita (Classical Music)'', ''Kar La Paw (Traditional Contemporary Music)'', ''Thabin Gita (Dramatic Music)'', ''Myanmar Hsaing (Traditional Ensemble)'', ''Kyay Let Gita (Folk Music)'', ''Nat Chin (Spiritual Music)'', and ''Let Swam Pya (Instrumental Solos)''. The project was planned to release into nine volumes. In 2018, '''Gita Yadana''' was launched, and the very first volume of the project was released on both international and local streaming sites like Spotify, MMN and JOOX.<ref name=\"treasures\" /> Until the end of 2019, six volumes under the name '''Gita Yadana''' had been released.\n\nBeing a teacher and a musician, Diramore never hesitates to share knowledge of music every chance he gets. He used to make contributions to numerous local workshops, seminars, and classes of government agencies as well as private schools like ILBC, Yangon Music School, MMDC, etc.<ref name=\"mizzima\" /> On the one hand, Diramore is currently performing his duties as a Prorector at [[National University of Arts and Culture, Mandalay]].

Vladimir Presnyakov became the first Russian artist to receive the \"Golden Key\" prize in Monte Carlo (Monaco) as an artist whose recordings were sold in Russia in the largest circulation. In the early 1990's, the artist formed the \"Captain\" and with a new program \"Farewell to Childhood\" successfully performed in Moscow, as well as in the cities of near and far abroad.<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nIn 1991, Presnyakov released a double album \"Love\". In 1994, the album \"Castle from the Rain\" was released, which was a huge success: the songs \"Stewardess by the name of Jeanne\", \"Girlfriend Masha\" were hits. In 1995, at the studio \"Union\" three collections of Presnyakov's best songs came out at once: \"Zurbagan\", \"Wanderer\" and \"Jeanne\". The new concert program \"Castle from the Rain\" was introduced in 1995 and was awarded the \"Zvezda\" award in the nomination \"Show of the Year at Concert Venues of Russia\". In 1996, Presnyakov's album \"Saliva\" was released, in 1998 the disk \"Live Collection\" appeared, in 2001 - the album \"The Open Door\".<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nApproximately until the mid-nineties Presnyakov was consistently among the ten most popular Russian performers.\n\nIn 2002 Vladimir Presnyakov took part in the [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] reality show ''[[Last Hero]]'' and became its winner.<ref name=\"ria\"/> In the same year the new album \"Love on AUDIO\" was released.

Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nPLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired [[relay logic]] systems. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.\n\nA PLC is an example of a \"hard\" [[Real-time computing|real-time]] system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.\n\n==Invention and early development==\nPLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the USA and were designed to replace relay logic systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of [[Relay|relays]], [[Cam timer|cam timers]], [[Drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencers]], and dedicated closed-loop controllers. \n\nThe hard-wired nature made it difficult for design engineers to alter the process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. If even one wire were out of place, or one relay failed, the whole system would become faulty. Often times technicians would spend hours troubleshooting by examining the schematics and comparing them to existing wiring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.controlsystemsandautomation.com/learn/plc/plc-programming-basics-i/|title=PLC Programming Basics Part I|date=2019-07-23|website=Control Systems & Automation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} These early computers required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe PLC was developed with several advantages over earlier designs. It tolerated the industrial environment better than computers and was more reliable, compact and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily extensible with additional I/O modules, while relay systems required complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. Comparing to a computer, PLC in a rack format can be more easily extended with additional I/O in the form of I/O cards. With simple programming language focused on logic and switching operations it was more user-friendly than computers using [[General-purpose programming language|general-purpose programming languages]].

As programming terminals evolved, it became more common for ladder logic to be used, because it was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels. Newer formats, such as state logic and Function Block (which is similar to the way logic is depicted when using digital integrated logic circuits) exist, but they are still{{When|date=February 2020}} not as popular as ladder logic. A primary reason for this is that PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.{{Fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nUp to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming [[Computer terminal|terminals]], which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs.<ref name=\"EERef162\" /> Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain [[ASCII art|ASCII]] character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on [[Cassette tape cartridge|cassette tape cartridges]]. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used [[non-volatile]] [[magnetic core memory]].\n\n== Architecture ==\nRegular programmable logic controller consists of:\n\n* a processor unit (CPU) which interprets inputs, executes the control program stored in memory and sends output signals,\n* a power supply unit which converts AC voltage to DC,\n* a memory unit storing data from inputs and program to be executed by the processor,\n* an input and output interfaces, where the controller receives and sends data from/to external devices,\n* a communications interface to receive and transmit data on communication networks from/to remote PLCs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=7}}</ref>\n\nPLCs require programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nModern PLCs generally contain a [[real-time operating system]], such as [[OS-9]] or [[VxWorks]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Discrete (digital) and analog signals===\n[[Digital signal|Discrete (digital) signals]] behave as binary switches, yielding simply an On or Off signal (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, [[limit switch]]es, and [[photoelectric sensor]]s are examples of devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]], where a specific range is designated as ''On'' and another as ''Off''. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing ''On'', values below 2VDC representing ''Off'', and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only digital I/O.\n\nAnalog signals are like volume controls, with a range of values between zero and full-scale. These are typically interpreted as integer values (counts) by the PLC, with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. As PLCs typically use 16-bit signed binary processors, the integer values are limited between -32,768 and +32,767. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. Analog signals can use [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]] with a magnitude proportional to the value of the process signal. For example, an analog 0 to 10&nbsp;V or [[4-20 mA]] input would be [[analog-to-digital converter|converted]] into an integer value of 0 to 32767.  The programming inside the PLC will use a SCL or scaling function to take this 0-32767 value and transpose it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.  Proper integration will also include filter times to reduce noise as well as high and low limits to report faults.\n\n[[Current loop|Current inputs]] are less sensitive to electrical noise (e.g. from welders or electric motor starts) than voltage inputs.  Distance from the device and the controller is also a concern as the maximum travelling distance of a good quality 0-10V signal is very short compared to the 4-20mA signal.  The 4-20mA signal can also report if the wire is disconnected along the path as it would return a 0mA signal and a fault can be reported.\n\n===Timers and counters===\n\nThe main function of a timer is to keep an output on for a specific length of time.  A good example of this is a garage light, where you want power to be cut off after 2 minutes so as to give someone time to go into the house. The three different types of timers that are commonly used are a Delay-OFF, a Delay-ON, and a Delay-ON-Retentive. A Delay-OFF timer activates immediately when turned on, and will start counting down from a programmed time before cutting off once the enabling input is off. A Delay-ON timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, counts up to a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is turned off. A Delay-ON-Retentive timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, retains the accumulated value even if the (ladder-logic) rung goes false, and can be reset only by a RESET command.  Visible details for the rest of the program to use could include:\n\n*EN - ENable signal, indicated the timer has been enabled and can start timing, or if completed keep the DoNe status on.\n*PRE - PREset time, requested time value to be run before the timer is DoNe.  Could be in a TIME format (t#1h35m12s) or in seconds format (3500 = 3.5s)\n*ACC - ACCumulated time, how long the timer has been timing.  Same number formats as the PREset value.\n*DN - DoNe signal, indicates the timer has elapsed the preset value\n*TT - Timer Timing signal, indicates the timer is actively timing.  This is not on once the timer is done\n\nCounters are primarily used for counting items such as cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck.  There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset.  Down counters count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.<ref>Yanik, P. (2017, April 11). Timers and Counters. Cullowhee, NC, United States of America.</ref>\n\n===Redundancy===\nSome special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted down time. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system which is fault-tolerant and capable of handling the process with faulty modules. In such cases to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to hardware configuration for preventing total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure.  Other redundancy scenarios  could be related to safety critical processes, for example large hydraulic presses could require that both PLCs turn on an output before the press can come down in case one output does not turn off properly.\n\n==Programming==\n[[File:Automate industriel WAGO pour un syst\u00e8me de monitoring en industrie pharmaceutique.jpg|thumb|Industrial controller for a monitoring system in the pharmaceutical industry]]\nProgrammable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without programming background. For this reason, graphical programming language called [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LD, LAD) was first developed which resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays. It was adopted by many manufacturers and later standardized in the [[IEC 61131-3]] control systems programming standard. {{As of|2015|}}, it is still widely used, thanks to its simplicity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|}}, the majority of PLC systems adhere to the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that defines 2 textual programming languages: [[Structured text|Structured Text]] (ST; similar to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) and [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL); as well as 3 graphical languages: [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]], [[Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) and [[Sequential function chart|Sequential Function Chart]] (SFC).<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Keller, William L Jr. ''Grafcet, A Functional Chart for Sequential Processes'', 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1984, p. 71-96.</ref> [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL) was deprecated in the third edition of the standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plcopen.org/status-iec-61131-3-standard|title=Status IEC 61131-3 standard|last=|first=|date=2018-07-19|website=PLCopen|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nModern PLCs can be programmed in a variety of ways, from the relay-derived ladder logic to programming languages such as specially adapted dialects of [[BASIC]] and [[C (programming language)|C]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nWhile the fundamental concepts of PLC programming are common to all manufacturers, differences in I/O addressing, memory organization, and instruction sets mean that PLC programs are never perfectly interchangeable between different makers. Even within the same product line of a single manufacturer, different models may not be directly compatible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nPLC programs are typically written in a special software on a [[personal computer]], then downloaded to the PLC directly or over a network. The program is stored in the PLC either in non-volatile [[flash memory]] or battery-backed-up [[RAM]]. In some programmable controllers, the program is transferred from a personal computer to the PLC through a programming board which writes the program into a removable chip, such as [[EPROM]]. The software can upload the PLC program, for backup and restoration purposes.<!--Often, a single PLC can be programmed to replace thousands of [[Relay|relays]].<ref name=\"Bolton09\" />-->Generally, the software provides functions for debugging and troubleshooting the PLC software, for example, by highlighting portions of the logic to show current status during operation or via simulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Simulation===\nIn order to properly understand the operation of a PLC, it is necessary to spend considerable time [[Computer programming|programming]], testing and [[debugging]] PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software such as PLCLogix can save time in the design of automated control applications and can also increase the level of safety associated with equipment since many \"what if\" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=Sally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHYlTBxqrM8C&pg=PA553|title=Advances in Computer Science, Environment, Ecoinformatics, and Education, Part III: International Conference, CSEE 2011, Wuhan, China, August 21-22, 2011.

A ladder diagram is a method of drawing control circuits which pre-dates PLCs. The ladder diagram resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.\n\nAs an example, say a facility needs to store water in a tank. The water is drawn from the tank by another system, as needed, and our example system must manage the water level in the tank by controlling the valve that refills the tank. Shown are:\n\n*Two inputs (from the low and high level switches) represented by contacts of the float switches\n*An output to the fill valve, labelled as the fill valve which it controls\n*An \"internal\" contact, representing the output signal to the fill valve which is created in the program.\n*A logical control scheme created by the interconnection of these items in software\n\nIn ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a \"normally open\" contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic \"true\" signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the PLC program that \"read\" or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be \"opposite\" or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.\n\nIn the example, the physical state of the float switch contacts must be considered when choosing \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from [[float switch]]es (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (normally closed) open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above the physical location of the switch.\n\nWhen the water level is below both switches, the float switch physical contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal \"Fill Valve\" contact latches the circuit so that even when the \"Low Level\" contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as the water level remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the \"High Level\" switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; this is an example of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.\n<pre style=\"width: 95%;\">\n\n| (N.C. physical   (N.C. physical                             |\n|   Switch)          Switch)                                  |\n|   Low Level       High Level                Fill Valve      |\n|------[ ]------|------[ ]----------------------(OUT)---------|\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|   Fill Valve  |                                             |\n|------[ ]------|                                             |\n|                                                             |\n|                                                             |\n</pre>\n\nA complete program may contain thousands of rungs, evaluated in sequence. Typically the PLC processor will alternately scan all its inputs and update outputs, then evaluate the ladder logic; input changes during a program scan will not be effective until the next I/O update. A complete program scan may take only a few milliseconds, much faster than changes in the controlled process.\n\nProgrammable controllers vary in their capabilities for a \"rung\" of a ladder diagram. Some only allow a single output bit. There are typically limits to the number of series contacts in line, and the number of branches that can be used. Each element of the rung is evaluated sequentially. If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal (in multi-branched rungs) to affect the output.\n\n==Functionality==\n[[Image:PLC Control Panel.png|thumbnail|350|Control panel with PLC (grey elements in the center). The unit consists of separate elements, from left to right; [[power supply]], controller, [[relay]] units for in- and output]]\n[[File:Control-panel-plc.jpg|thumb|Control panel with a PLC user interface for [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] regulation.]]\nThe main difference from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive [[input/output]] (I/O) to connect the PLC to [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as [[limit switch]]es, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or [[machine vision]] systems.<ref>Harms, Toni M. & Kinner, Russell H. P.E., ''Enhancing PLC Performance with Vision Systems''. 18th Annual ESD/HMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 387-399.</ref> PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, [[electric motor]]s, [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] cylinders, magnetic [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, or [[analog signal|analog]] outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external [[I/O module]]s attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.\n\nThe functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, [[process control]], [[distributed control system]]s, and [[computer network|networking]]. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to [[desktop computer]]s. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Basic functions===\n\nThe most basic function of a programmable controller is to emulate the functions of electro-mechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of \"examine if on\" instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electro-mechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a \"rung\" of a \"ladder diagram \", and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic.  Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one \"rung\" of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an \"internal coil\" with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs.  Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.\n\nSome PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic.  This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which in a sufficiently complex circuit may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts.  The elimination of these \"sneak paths\" is either a bug or a feature, depending on programming style.\n\nMore advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variable internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.\n\n=== Communication ===\nPLCs use built-in ports, such as [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], or [[RS-422]] to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming software, [[SCADA]], [[User interface|HMI]]). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like [[Modbus]], or [[EtherNet/IP]]. Many of these protocols are vendor specific.\n\nPLCs used in larger I/O systems may have [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to co-ordinate over the communication link. These communication links are also often used for [[User interface|HMI]] devices such as keypads or [[Personal computer|PC]]-type workstations.\n\nFormerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.\n\n===User interface===\n{{See also|User interface|List of human-computer interaction topics}}\nPLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A [[SCADA#Human-machine interface|human-machine interface]] (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.\n\n===System scale===\nA small PLC will have a fixed number of connections built in for inputs and outputs. Typically, expansions are available if the base model has insufficient I/O.\n\nModular PLCs have a chassis (also called a rack) into which are placed modules with different functions. The processor and selection of I/O modules are customized for the particular application. Several racks can be administered by a single processor, and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants.  Options are also available to mount I/O points directly to the machine and utilize quick disconnecting cables to sensors and valves, saving time for wiring and replacing components.\n\n==Process of a scan cycle==\n\nThere are 5 main steps in a scan cycle:\n\n# Reading inputs\n# Executing the program\n# Processing communication requests\n# Executing CPU diagnostics\n# Writing outputs\n\nA PLC program generally loops i.e. executes repeatedly, as long as the controlled system is running. At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the \"I/O Image Table\", which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs.<ref>Maher, Michael J. ''Real-Time Control and Communications''. 18th Annual ESD/SMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 431-436.</ref> Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times (on the order of 100 ms) may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.\n\nAs PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.<ref>Kinner, Russell H., P.E. ''Designing Programmable Controller Application Programs Using More than One Designer''. 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1985, p. 97-110.</ref> This enhanced programming could be used to save scan time for high-speed processes; for example, parts of the program used only for setting up the machine could be segregated from those parts required to operate at higher speed. Newer PLCs now have the option to run the logic program synchronously with the IO scanning. This means that IO is updated in the background and the logic reads and writes values as required during the logic scanning.\n\nSpecial-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with [[rotary encoder|shaft encoder]]s, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution on the PLC.\n\n==Security==\nPrior to the discovery of the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]] in June 2010, security of PLCs received little attention. Modern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in similar way as desktop operating systems, like [[Microsoft Windows]]. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/plc-security-risk-controller-operating-systems |title=PLC Security Risk: Controller Operating Systems - Tofino Industrial Security Solution|website=www.tofinosecurity.com  |date=May 2011 |author=Byres}}</ref> {{As of|2011||since=y}}, this concerns grow as networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment connecting the previously separate plant floor networks and office networks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=15}}</ref>\n\n== Safety PLC ==\nIn recent years \"safety\" PLCs have started to become popular, either as standalone models or as functionality and safety-rated hardware added to existing controller architectures ([[Allen-Bradley]] Guardlogix, [[Siemens]] F-series etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types as being suitable for use in safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired [[Safety relay|safety relays]]. For example, a safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with [[Trapped key interlocking|trapped-key access]], or perhaps to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stops, light screens, and so forth. The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.\n\n==PLC compared with other control systems==\n[[File:BMA Automation Allen Bradley PLC 3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|PLC installed in a control panel]]\n[[File:Control-panel.jpg|thumb|Control center with a PLC for a [[Regenerative thermal oxidiser|RTO]].]]\nPLCs are well adapted to a range of [[automation]] tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a \"generic\" solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nProgrammable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that [[G-code]] (involving a [[CNC]] machine) can be used to instruct machine movements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vosough and Vosough|date=November 2011|title=PLC and its Applications|url=http://www.ijmse.org/Volume2/Issue8/paper9.pdf|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Engineering|volume=2|pages=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n=== Cam timers ===\nFor high volume or very simple fixed automation tasks, different techniques are used. For example, a cheap consumer [[dishwasher]] would be controlled by an electromechanical [[cam timer]] costing only a few dollars in production quantities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Microcontrollers ===\nA [[microcontroller]]-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units will be produced and so the development cost (design of power supplies, input/output hardware, and necessary testing and certification) can be spread over many sales, and where the end-user would not need to alter the control. Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.<ref name=\"McMillan992\">Gregory K. McMillan, Douglas M. Considine (ed), ''Process/Industrial Instruments and Controls Handbook Fifth Edition'', McGraw-Hill, 1999 {{ISBN|0-07-012582-1}} Section 3 ''Controllers''</ref>\n\n=== Single-board computers ===\nVery complex process control, such as used in the chemical industry, may require algorithms and performance beyond the capability of even high-performance PLCs. Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. [[Single-board computer|Single-board computers]] using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. \"Soft PLCs\" running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.<ref name=\"McMillan992\" />\n\nThe rising popularity of [[Single-board computer|single board computers]] has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally [[Closed platform|closed platforms]], but some newer PLCs (e.g. ctrlX from [[Bosch Rexroth]], PFC200 from [[WAGO Kontakttechnik|Wago]], PLCnext from [[Phoenix Contact]], and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an [[open platform]].\n\n=== PID Controllers ===\nPLCs may include logic for single-variable feedback analog control loop, a [[PID controller]]. A PID loop could be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process, for example. Historically PLCs were usually configured with only a few analog control loops; where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, a [[distributed control system]] (DCS) would instead be used. As PLCs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has been blurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Programmable logic relays (PLR)===\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}In more recent years,{{When|date=February 2020}} small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two [[orders of magnitude]] less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.\n\nA variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the [[remote terminal unit]] or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedised PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically [[SCADA]]) or in some modern systems, \"The Cloud\". Unlike factory automation using high speed [[Ethernet]], communications links to remote sites are often radio based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial control systems]]\n* [[Industrial safety systems]]\n* [[PLC technician]]\n* [[1-bit architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bolton|first=William|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=sDqnBQAAQBAJ|title=Programmable Logic Controllers|publisher=Newnes|year=2015|isbn=9780081003534|edition=6th, revised|location=|ref=harv|via=Google Books}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daniel Kandray, ''Programmable Automation Technologies'', Industrial Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-8311-3346-7}}, Chapter 8 ''Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers''\n* Tom Mejer Antonsen, 2018 \"PLC Controls with Structured Text (ST)\", {{ISBN|978-87-4300-241-3}},  {{ISBN|978-87-4300-242-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=2012-09-08 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-20}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://plccompare.com/embedded-plc-guide/ A simple guide to Embedded PLCs]\n\n{{Commons category|Programmable logic controller}}\n{{Wikiversity|Programmable logic controller (basics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Programmable Logic Controller}}\n[[Category:Industrial automation]]\n[[Category:Industrial computing]]\n[[Category:Programmable logic controllers]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Siemens Simatic S7-416-3.jpg|thumb|upright|PLC system in a rack, left-to-right: power supply unit (PSU), CPU, interface module (IM) and communication processor (CP).]]\n{{Manufacturing}}\n\nA '''programmable logic controller''' ('''PLC''') or '''programmable controller''' is an industrial [[digital computer]] which has been [[Rugged computer|ruggedized]] and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as [[Assembly line|assembly lines]], or [[robotic]] devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming and process fault diagnosis.\n\nPLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of [[Input/output|inputs and outputs (I/O)]], in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and [[SCADA]] systems.\n\nThey can be designed for many arrangements of digital and analog I/O, extended temperature ranges, immunity to [[Noise (electronics)|electrical noise]], and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nPLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired [[relay logic]] systems. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.\n\nA PLC is an example of a \"hard\" [[Real-time computing|real-time]] system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.\n\n==Invention and early development==\nPLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the USA and were designed to replace relay logic systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of [[Relay|relays]], [[Cam timer|cam timers]], [[Drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencers]], and dedicated closed-loop controllers. \n\nThe hard-wired nature made it difficult for design engineers to alter the process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. If even one wire were out of place, or one relay failed, the whole system would become faulty. Often times technicians would spend hours troubleshooting by examining the schematics and comparing them to existing wiring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.controlsystemsandautomation.com/learn/plc/plc-programming-basics-i/|title=PLC Programming Basics Part I|date=2019-07-23|website=Control Systems & Automation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} These early computers required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe PLC was developed with several advantages over earlier designs. It tolerated the industrial environment better than computers and was more reliable, compact and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily extensible with additional I/O modules, while relay systems required complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. Comparing to a computer, PLC in a rack format can be more easily extended with additional I/O in the form of I/O cards.

As programming terminals evolved, it became more common for ladder logic to be used, because it was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels. Newer formats, such as state logic and Function Block (which is similar to the way logic is depicted when using digital integrated logic circuits) exist, but they are still{{When|date=February 2020}} not as popular as ladder logic. A primary reason for this is that PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.{{Fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nUp to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming [[Computer terminal|terminals]], which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs.<ref name=\"EERef162\" /> Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain [[ASCII art|ASCII]] character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on [[Cassette tape cartridge|cassette tape cartridges]]. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used [[non-volatile]] [[magnetic core memory]].\n\n== Architecture ==\nRegular programmable logic controller consists of:\n\n* a processor unit (CPU) which interprets inputs, executes the control program stored in memory and sends output signals,\n* a power supply unit which converts AC voltage to DC,\n* a memory unit storing data from inputs and program to be executed by the processor,\n* an input and output interfaces, where the controller receives and sends data from/to external devices,\n* a communications interface to receive and transmit data on communication networks from/to remote PLCs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=7}}</ref>\n\nPLCs require programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nModern PLCs generally contain a [[real-time operating system]], such as [[OS-9]] or [[VxWorks]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Discrete (digital) and analog signals===\n[[Digital signal|Discrete (digital) signals]] behave as binary switches, yielding simply an On or Off signal (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, [[limit switch]]es, and [[photoelectric sensor]]s are examples of devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]], where a specific range is designated as ''On'' and another as ''Off''. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing ''On'', values below 2VDC representing ''Off'', and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only digital I/O.\n\nAnalog signals are like volume controls, with a range of values between zero and full-scale. These are typically interpreted as integer values (counts) by the PLC, with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. As PLCs typically use 16-bit signed binary processors, the integer values are limited between -32,768 and +32,767. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. Analog signals can use [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]] with a magnitude proportional to the value of the process signal. For example, an analog 0 to 10&nbsp;V or [[4-20 mA]] input would be [[analog-to-digital converter|converted]] into an integer value of 0 to 32767.  The programming inside the PLC will use a SCL or scaling function to take this 0-32767 value and transpose it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.  Proper integration will also include filter times to reduce noise as well as high and low limits to report faults.\n\n[[Current loop|Current inputs]] are less sensitive to electrical noise (e.g. from welders or electric motor starts) than voltage inputs.  Distance from the device and the controller is also a concern as the maximum travelling distance of a good quality 0-10V signal is very short compared to the 4-20mA signal.  The 4-20mA signal can also report if the wire is disconnected along the path as it would return a 0mA signal and a fault can be reported.\n\n===Timers and counters===\n\nThe main function of a timer is to keep an output on for a specific length of time.  A good example of this is a garage light, where you want power to be cut off after 2 minutes so as to give someone time to go into the house. The three different types of timers that are commonly used are a Delay-OFF, a Delay-ON, and a Delay-ON-Retentive. A Delay-OFF timer activates immediately when turned on, and will start counting down from a programmed time before cutting off once the enabling input is off. A Delay-ON timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, counts up to a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is turned off. A Delay-ON-Retentive timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, retains the accumulated value even if the (ladder-logic) rung goes false, and can be reset only by a RESET command.  Visible details for the rest of the program to use could include:\n\n*EN - ENable signal, indicated the timer has been enabled and can start timing, or if completed keep the DoNe status on.\n*PRE - PREset time, requested time value to be run before the timer is DoNe.  Could be in a TIME format (t#1h35m12s) or in seconds format (3500 = 3.5s)\n*ACC - ACCumulated time, how long the timer has been timing.  Same number formats as the PREset value.\n*DN - DoNe signal, indicates the timer has elapsed the preset value\n*TT - Timer Timing signal, indicates the timer is actively timing.  This is not on once the timer is done\n\nCounters are primarily used for counting items such as cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck.  There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset.  Down counters count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.<ref>Yanik, P. (2017, April 11). Timers and Counters. Cullowhee, NC, United States of America.</ref>\n\n===Redundancy===\nSome special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted down time. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system which is fault-tolerant and capable of handling the process with faulty modules. In such cases to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to hardware configuration for preventing total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure.  Other redundancy scenarios  could be related to safety critical processes, for example large hydraulic presses could require that both PLCs turn on an output before the press can come down in case one output does not turn off properly.\n\n==Programming==\n[[File:Automate industriel WAGO pour un syst\u00e8me de monitoring en industrie pharmaceutique.jpg|thumb|Industrial controller for a monitoring system in the pharmaceutical industry]]\nProgrammable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without programming background.

The program is stored in the PLC either in non-volatile [[flash memory]] or battery-backed-up [[RAM]].

The software can upload the PLC program, for backup and restoration purposes.<!--Often, a single PLC can be programmed to replace thousands of [[Relay|relays]].<ref name=\"Bolton09\" />-->Generally, the software provides functions for debugging and troubleshooting the PLC software, for example, by highlighting portions of the logic to show current status during operation or via simulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Simulation===\nIn order to properly understand the operation of a PLC, it is necessary to spend considerable time [[Computer programming|programming]], testing and [[debugging]] PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software such as PLCLogix can save time in the design of automated control applications and can also increase the level of safety associated with equipment since many \"what if\" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=Sally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHYlTBxqrM8C&pg=PA553|title=Advances in Computer Science, Environment, Ecoinformatics, and Education, Part III: International Conference, CSEE 2011, Wuhan, China, August 21-22, 2011.

A ladder diagram is a method of drawing control circuits which pre-dates PLCs. The ladder diagram resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.\n\nAs an example, say a facility needs to store water in a tank. The water is drawn from the tank by another system, as needed, and our example system must manage the water level in the tank by controlling the valve that refills the tank. Shown are:\n\n*Two inputs (from the low and high level switches) represented by contacts of the float switches\n*An output to the fill valve, labelled as the fill valve which it controls\n*An \"internal\" contact, representing the output signal to the fill valve which is created in the program.\n*A logical control scheme created by the interconnection of these items in software\n\nIn ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a \"normally open\" contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic \"true\" signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the PLC program that \"read\" or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be \"opposite\" or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.\n\nIn the example, the physical state of the float switch contacts must be considered when choosing \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from [[float switch]]es (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (normally closed) open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above the physical location of the switch.\n\nWhen the water level is below both switches, the float switch physical contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal \"Fill Valve\" contact latches the circuit so that even when the \"Low Level\" contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as the water level remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the \"High Level\" switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; this is an example of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.\n<pre style=\"width: 95%;\">\n\n| (N.C. physical   (N.C. physical                             |\n|   Switch)          Switch)                                  |\n|   Low Level       High Level                Fill Valve      |\n|------[ ]------|------[ ]----------------------(OUT)---------|\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|   Fill Valve  |                                             |\n|------[ ]------|                                             |\n|                                                             |\n|                                                             |\n</pre>\n\nA complete program may contain thousands of rungs, evaluated in sequence. Typically the PLC processor will alternately scan all its inputs and update outputs, then evaluate the ladder logic; input changes during a program scan will not be effective until the next I/O update. A complete program scan may take only a few milliseconds, much faster than changes in the controlled process.\n\nProgrammable controllers vary in their capabilities for a \"rung\" of a ladder diagram. Some only allow a single output bit. There are typically limits to the number of series contacts in line, and the number of branches that can be used. Each element of the rung is evaluated sequentially. If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal (in multi-branched rungs) to affect the output.\n\n==Functionality==\n[[Image:PLC Control Panel.png|thumbnail|350|Control panel with PLC (grey elements in the center). The unit consists of separate elements, from left to right; [[power supply]], controller, [[relay]] units for in- and output]]\n[[File:Control-panel-plc.jpg|thumb|Control panel with a PLC user interface for [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] regulation.]]\nThe main difference from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive [[input/output]] (I/O) to connect the PLC to [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as [[limit switch]]es, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or [[machine vision]] systems.<ref>Harms, Toni M. & Kinner, Russell H. P.E., ''Enhancing PLC Performance with Vision Systems''. 18th Annual ESD/HMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 387-399.</ref> PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, [[electric motor]]s, [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] cylinders, magnetic [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, or [[analog signal|analog]] outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external [[I/O module]]s attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.\n\nThe functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, [[process control]], [[distributed control system]]s, and [[computer network|networking]]. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to [[desktop computer]]s. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Basic functions===\n\nThe most basic function of a programmable controller is to emulate the functions of electro-mechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of \"examine if on\" instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electro-mechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a \"rung\" of a \"ladder diagram \", and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic.  Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one \"rung\" of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an \"internal coil\" with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs.  Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.\n\nSome PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic.  This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which in a sufficiently complex circuit may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts.  The elimination of these \"sneak paths\" is either a bug or a feature, depending on programming style.\n\nMore advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variable internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.\n\n=== Communication ===\nPLCs use built-in ports, such as [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], or [[RS-422]] to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming software, [[SCADA]], [[User interface|HMI]]). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like [[Modbus]], or [[EtherNet/IP]]. Many of these protocols are vendor specific.\n\nPLCs used in larger I/O systems may have [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to co-ordinate over the communication link. These communication links are also often used for [[User interface|HMI]] devices such as keypads or [[Personal computer|PC]]-type workstations.\n\nFormerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.\n\n===User interface===\n{{See also|User interface|List of human-computer interaction topics}}\nPLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A [[SCADA#Human-machine interface|human-machine interface]] (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.\n\n===System scale===\nA small PLC will have a fixed number of connections built in for inputs and outputs. Typically, expansions are available if the base model has insufficient I/O.\n\nModular PLCs have a chassis (also called a rack) into which are placed modules with different functions. The processor and selection of I/O modules are customized for the particular application. Several racks can be administered by a single processor, and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants.  Options are also available to mount I/O points directly to the machine and utilize quick disconnecting cables to sensors and valves, saving time for wiring and replacing components.\n\n==Process of a scan cycle==\n\nThere are 5 main steps in a scan cycle:\n\n# Reading inputs\n# Executing the program\n# Processing communication requests\n# Executing CPU diagnostics\n# Writing outputs\n\nA PLC program generally loops i.e. executes repeatedly, as long as the controlled system is running. At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the \"I/O Image Table\", which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs.<ref>Maher, Michael J. ''Real-Time Control and Communications''. 18th Annual ESD/SMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 431-436.</ref> Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times (on the order of 100 ms) may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.\n\nAs PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.<ref>Kinner, Russell H., P.E. ''Designing Programmable Controller Application Programs Using More than One Designer''. 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1985, p. 97-110.</ref> This enhanced programming could be used to save scan time for high-speed processes; for example, parts of the program used only for setting up the machine could be segregated from those parts required to operate at higher speed. Newer PLCs now have the option to run the logic program synchronously with the IO scanning. This means that IO is updated in the background and the logic reads and writes values as required during the logic scanning.\n\nSpecial-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with [[rotary encoder|shaft encoder]]s, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution on the PLC.\n\n==Security==\nPrior to the discovery of the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]] in June 2010, security of PLCs received little attention. Modern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in similar way as desktop operating systems, like [[Microsoft Windows]]. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/plc-security-risk-controller-operating-systems |title=PLC Security Risk: Controller Operating Systems - Tofino Industrial Security Solution|website=www.tofinosecurity.com  |date=May 2011 |author=Byres}}</ref> {{As of|2011||since=y}}, this concerns grow as networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment connecting the previously separate plant floor networks and office networks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=15}}</ref>\n\n== Safety PLC ==\nIn recent years \"safety\" PLCs have started to become popular, either as standalone models or as functionality and safety-rated hardware added to existing controller architectures ([[Allen-Bradley]] Guardlogix, [[Siemens]] F-series etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types as being suitable for use in safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired [[Safety relay|safety relays]]. For example, a safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with [[Trapped key interlocking|trapped-key access]], or perhaps to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stops, light screens, and so forth. The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.\n\n==PLC compared with other control systems==\n[[File:BMA Automation Allen Bradley PLC 3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|PLC installed in a control panel]]\n[[File:Control-panel.jpg|thumb|Control center with a PLC for a [[Regenerative thermal oxidiser|RTO]].]]\nPLCs are well adapted to a range of [[automation]] tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a \"generic\" solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nProgrammable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that [[G-code]] (involving a [[CNC]] machine) can be used to instruct machine movements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vosough and Vosough|date=November 2011|title=PLC and its Applications|url=http://www.ijmse.org/Volume2/Issue8/paper9.pdf|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Engineering|volume=2|pages=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n=== Cam timers ===\nFor high volume or very simple fixed automation tasks, different techniques are used. For example, a cheap consumer [[dishwasher]] would be controlled by an electromechanical [[cam timer]] costing only a few dollars in production quantities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Microcontrollers ===\nA [[microcontroller]]-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units will be produced and so the development cost (design of power supplies, input/output hardware, and necessary testing and certification) can be spread over many sales, and where the end-user would not need to alter the control. Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.<ref name=\"McMillan992\">Gregory K. McMillan, Douglas M. Considine (ed), ''Process/Industrial Instruments and Controls Handbook Fifth Edition'', McGraw-Hill, 1999 {{ISBN|0-07-012582-1}} Section 3 ''Controllers''</ref>\n\n=== Single-board computers ===\nVery complex process control, such as used in the chemical industry, may require algorithms and performance beyond the capability of even high-performance PLCs. Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. [[Single-board computer|Single-board computers]] using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. \"Soft PLCs\" running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.<ref name=\"McMillan992\" />\n\nThe rising popularity of [[Single-board computer|single board computers]] has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally [[Closed platform|closed platforms]], but some newer PLCs (e.g. ctrlX from [[Bosch Rexroth]], PFC200 from [[WAGO Kontakttechnik|Wago]], PLCnext from [[Phoenix Contact]], and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an [[open platform]].\n\n=== PID Controllers ===\nPLCs may include logic for single-variable feedback analog control loop, a [[PID controller]]. A PID loop could be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process, for example. Historically PLCs were usually configured with only a few analog control loops; where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, a [[distributed control system]] (DCS) would instead be used. As PLCs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has been blurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Programmable logic relays (PLR)===\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}In more recent years,{{When|date=February 2020}} small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two [[orders of magnitude]] less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.\n\nA variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the [[remote terminal unit]] or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedised PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically [[SCADA]]) or in some modern systems, \"The Cloud\". Unlike factory automation using high speed [[Ethernet]], communications links to remote sites are often radio based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial control systems]]\n* [[Industrial safety systems]]\n* [[PLC technician]]\n* [[1-bit architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bolton|first=William|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=sDqnBQAAQBAJ|title=Programmable Logic Controllers|publisher=Newnes|year=2015|isbn=9780081003534|edition=6th, revised|location=|ref=harv|via=Google Books}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daniel Kandray, ''Programmable Automation Technologies'', Industrial Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-8311-3346-7}}, Chapter 8 ''Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers''\n* Tom Mejer Antonsen, 2018 \"PLC Controls with Structured Text (ST)\", {{ISBN|978-87-4300-241-3}},  {{ISBN|978-87-4300-242-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=2012-09-08 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-20}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://plccompare.com/embedded-plc-guide/ A simple guide to Embedded PLCs]\n\n{{Commons category|Programmable logic controller}}\n{{Wikiversity|Programmable logic controller (basics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Programmable Logic Controller}}\n[[Category:Industrial automation]]\n[[Category:Industrial computing]]\n[[Category:Programmable logic controllers]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4062:2397:a6bd:d80d:b7f7:4a4b:dd3d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller"}
