The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

Bay]] in northern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[California]]. It is named after the 18th-century [[Irish people|Irish]] bishop and philosopher [[George Berkeley]]. It borders the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to the south and the city of [[Albany, California|Albany]] and the [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] of [[Kensington, California|Kensington]] to the north. Its eastern border with [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] generally follows the ridge of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. The 2010 census recorded a population of 112,580.\n\nBerkeley is home to the oldest campus in the [[University of California]] system, the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], which is managed and operated by the University. It also has the [[Graduate Theological Union]], one of the largest religious studies institutions in the world. Berkeley is considered one of the most [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] cities in the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe site of today's City of Berkeley was the territory of the Chochenyo/Huchiun band of the [[Ohlone]] people when the first Europeans arrived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Golla|first=Victor|title=California Indian Languages|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-0-520-26667-4|page=380|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520266674}}</ref> Evidence of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations, which they used to grind acorns, and a [[shellmound]], now mostly leveled and covered up, along the shoreline of [[San Francisco Bay]] at the mouth of [[Strawberry Creek]]. Other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the [[Downtown Berkeley|downtown area]] during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.{{citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=see talk page}}\n\n[[File:Acorn pit at Indian Rock.jpg|thumb|left|100px|This pit in the surface of a rock at [[Indian Rock Park]] is typical of those used by [[Ohlone]] Indians to grind [[acorn]]s.]]\nThe first people of European descent (most of whom were of mixed race and born in America<ref>[https://anzasociety.org/the-spanish-myth/ \"The Spanish Myth\", Phil Valdez Jr., Anza Society International]</ref>) arrived with the [[De Anza Expedition]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Juan Bautista de Anza|url=http://www.borregospringschamber.com/juan_bautista_de_anza.html|publisher=Borrego Springs Chamber of Commerce|access-date=February 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725052027/http://www.borregospringschamber.com/juan_bautista_de_anza.html|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The De Anza Expedition led to establishment of the Spanish [[Presidio of San Francisco]] at the entrance to San Francisco Bay (the ''[[Golden Gate]])''. [[Luis Mar\u00eda Peralta|Luis Peralta]] was among the soldiers at the Presidio. For his services to the [[King of Spain]], he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of San Francisco Bay (the ''contra costa'', \"opposite shore\") for a ranch, including that portion that now comprises the City of Berkeley.\n\nLuis Peralta named his holding \"[[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]\". The primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides, but hunting and farming were also pursued. Eventually, Peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons. What is now Berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to Peralta's son [[Jos\u00e9 Domingo Peralta|Domingo]], with a little in the portion that went to another son, Vicente. No artifact survives of the Domingo or Vicente ranches, but their names survive in Berkeley street names (Vicente, Domingo, and Peralta). However, legal title to all land in the City of Berkeley remains based on the original Peralta land grant.\n\nThe Peraltas' Rancho San Antonio continued after [[Alta California]] passed from Spanish to Mexican sovereignty after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. However, the advent of U.S. sovereignty after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and especially, the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], saw the Peraltas' lands quickly encroached on by [[squatter]]s and diminished by dubious legal proceedings. The lands of the brothers Domingo and Vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes. The rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various American claimants (''See'' [[Kellersberger's Map]]).\n\nPolitically, the area that became Berkeley was initially part of a vast [[Contra Costa County]]. On March 25, 1853, Alameda County was created from a division of Contra Costa County, as well as from a small portion of [[Santa Clara County]]. The area that became Berkeley was then the northern part of the \"Oakland Township\" subdivision of Alameda County. During this period, \"Berkeley\" was mostly a mix of open land, farms, and ranches, with a small, though busy, wharf by the bay.\n\n[[File:Indian rock.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The city as seen from [[Indian Rock Park]] in the North Berkeley Hills. Berkeley is in the foreground, with the [[Berkeley Marina]] and [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Park]] just beyond.]]\n\n===Late 19th century===\nIn 1866, Oakland's private [[College of California]] looked for a new site. It settled on a location north of Oakland along the foot of the [[Berkeley Hills|Contra Costa Range]] (later called the Berkeley Hills) astride [[Strawberry Creek]], at an elevation about {{convert|500|ft}} above the bay, commanding a view of the Bay Area and the Pacific Ocean through the [[Golden Gate]].\n\nAccording to the ''Centennial Record of the University of California'', \"In 1866\u2026at [[Founders' Rock]], a group of College of California men watched two ships standing out to sea through the [[Golden Gate]]. One of them, [[Frederick Billings]], thought of the lines of the Anglo-Irish Anglican Bishop [[George Berkeley]], 'westward the course of empire takes its way,' and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish philosopher.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stadtman |editor-first=Verne |title=The Centennial Record of the University of California |publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] |year=1967 |page=114 |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00219&toc.depth=1&toc.id=div00219&brand=calisphere}}</ref> The philosopher's name is pronounced ''BARK-lee'', but the city's name, to accommodate [[American English]], is pronounced ''BERK-lee''.<ref>{{cite web |title=George Berkeley \u2013 Biography |publisher=[[European Graduate School]] |url=http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225225047/http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archivedate=February 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe College of California's ''College Homestead Association'' planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and they began a collaboration with the [[California|State of California]] that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public [[University of California]].\n\nAs construction began on the new site, more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus. At the same time, a settlement of residences, saloons, and various industries grew around the wharf area called \"[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]\". A [[horsecar]] ran from [[Temescal, Oakland, California|Temescal]] in Oakland to the university campus along what is now [[Telegraph Avenue]]. The first post office opened in 1872.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|601}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1870s, the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] reached its terminus in Oakland. In 1876, a branch line of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], was laid from a junction with the mainline called Shellmound (now a part of Emeryville) into what is now [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown Berkeley]]. That same year, the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into Oakland was re-routed, putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through Ocean View.\n\nThere was a strong prohibition movement in Berkeley at this time. In 1876, the state enacted the ''mile limit law'', which forbade sale or public consumption of alcohol within one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of the new University of California.<ref>Berkeley Gazette. 1900 April 9</ref> Then, in 1899 Berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone. Scientists, scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol.<ref>Berkeley 1900: Daily Life at the Turn of the Century, by Richard Schwartz. 2000. page 187</ref>\n\nOn April 1, 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the university campus, together with local farmers, were granted [[municipal corporation|incorporation]] by the State of California as the Town of Berkeley.<ref>[https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1877/1877_78.PDF#page=956 ''Statutes of California'', 1877-78, p.888]</ref> The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of [[Denis Kearney]]'s [[Workingman's Party]], who were particularly favored in the working class area of the former Ocean View, now called \"West Berkeley\". The area near the university became known for a time as \"East Berkeley\".\n\nDue to the influence of the university, the modern age came quickly to Berkeley. [[Electric light]]s and the telephone were in use by 1888. Electric [[streetcar]]s soon replaced the [[horsecar]]. A silent film of one of these early streetcars in Berkeley can be seen at the [[Library of Congress]] website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/00694420/|title=Trip to Berkeley, California, Lcmp003 M3a29754|publisher=Library of Congress}}<!-- https://www.loc.gov/collections/san-francisco-earthquake-and-fire-1897-to-1916/?q=lcmp003%20m3a29754 --></ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:Oakland 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Oakland and Berkeley area in 1917]]\n\nBerkeley's slow growth ended abruptly with the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906]]. The town and other parts of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] escaped serious damage, and thousands of refugees flowed across the Bay.  Among them were most of San Francisco's painters and sculptors, who between 1907 and 1911 created one of the largest art colonies west of Chicago.  Artist and critic [[Jennie V.

Around 640 structures burned before a late afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress, allowing firefighters to put it out.\n\nThe next big growth occurred with the advent of [[World War II]], when large numbers of people moved to the Bay Area to work in the many war industries, such as the immense [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in nearby [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]. One who moved out, but played a big role in the outcome of the War was U.C. Professor and Berkeley resident [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. During the war, an Army base, [[Camp Ashby]], was temporarily sited in Berkeley.\n\n[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Lawn Forum.

In the 1950s, [[McCarthyism]] induced the university to demand a loyalty oath from its professors, many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought. In 1960, a U.S. House committee ([[HUAC]]) came to San Francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the Bay Area. Their presence was met by protesters, including many from the university. Meanwhile, a number of U.C. students became active in the [[civil rights movement]]. Finally, in 1964, the university provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus. This protest became the [[Free Speech Movement]]. As the [[Vietnam War]] rapidly escalated in the ensuing years, so did student activism at the university, particularly that organized by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]].\n\n{{See also|1960s Berkeley protests}}\n\nBerkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes, civic unrest, and political upheaval that characterized the late 1960s.<ref>[http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/berkeley%20shattuck%20context%2005-28-2015.pdf \"Shattuck Avenue: Commercial Corridor Historic Context and Survey\"].

Retrieved October 5, 2017.</ref> In that period, Berkeley\u2014especially [[Telegraph Avenue]]\u2014became a focal point for the [[hippie]] movement, which spilled over the Bay from San Francisco. Many hippies were apolitical drop-outs, rather than students, but in the heady atmosphere of Berkeley in 1967\u20131969 there was considerable overlap between the hippie movement and the radical left. An iconic event in the Berkeley Sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of university property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called \"[[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]].\"\n\n[[File:People's-Park.jpg|thumbnail|left|People's Park with Unit 2 in the background]]\n\nThe battle over the disposition of People's Park resulted in a month-long occupation of Berkeley by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] on orders of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the end, the park remained undeveloped, and remains so today. A spin-off, ''People's Park Annex'', was established at the same time by activist citizens of Berkeley on a strip of land above the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] subway construction along Hearst Avenue northwest of the U.C. campus. The land had also been intended for development, but was turned over to the city by BART and is now [[Ohlone Park]].\n\nThe era of large public protest in Berkeley waned considerably with the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. While the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in Berkeley, it remains one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic cities in the United States.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\n====Housing and zoning changes====\n[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|Shattuck Avenue at Center Street in downtown Berkeley as seen in 1973]]\nThe Berkeley population declined in the 1970s, partly due to an exodus to the suburbs. Some moved because of the rising cost of living throughout the Bay Area, and others because of the decline and disappearance of many industries in West Berkeley.\n\nIncreasing enrollment at the university led to replacement of older buildings by large apartment buildings, especially in older parts of the city near the University and downtown.

An example of these efforts, to create and maintain space for those who cannot fight for themselves, lies in the movement to preserve People's Park as a place for the homeless population to call its own, instead of destroying it to make room for more student housing in the area.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Don|date=March 1995|title=The End of Public Space?People's Park, Definitions of the Public, and Democracy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01797.xa#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMTExL2ouMTQ2Ny04MzA2LjE5OTUudGIwMTc5Ny54YT9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=85|issue=1|pages=108\u2013133|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01797.xa#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMTExL2ouMTQ2Ny04MzA2LjE5OTUudGIwMTc5Ny54YT9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw|doi-broken-date=2020-03-10}}</ref> The efforts made by the community to create and maintain space for the homeless population in Berkeley did not stop there. With the history of homelessness and lack of affordable housing, there have been masses of organizations opening up with the sole mission to help this vulnerable population with not only housing assistance, but other symptoms that derive from homelessness. These organizations have stemmed from church groups, non-profits, even the UC. One of the many UC Berkeley student run programs that focuses on assisting the homeless is the [[Suitcase Clinic]]. The Suitcase Clinic was established in the late 1980s by undergraduate and graduate level students to provide direct medical services to the homeless and underrepresented population of Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinbach|first=Alan|title=The Berkeley Suitcase Clinic: Homeless Services by Undergraduate and Medical Student Team|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=76|issue=5|page=524|doi=10.1097/00001888-200105000-00058|pmid=11346565|year=2001}}</ref> Services provided by students have altered over the years to cater to the needs of the homeless population, and now include not only professional medical and dental support, but also health education, foot-washing, child care, a hot meal, and services that promote mental well-being.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.suitcaseclinic.org |title = The Suitcase Clinic &#124; Berkeley, CA}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBerkeley is located at {{Coord|37|52|18|N|122|16|29|W|type:city}} (37.871775, \u2212122.274603).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n[[File:BayareaUSGS.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite map of the San Francisco Bay Area from the U.S. Geological Survey]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]] the city's {{convert|17.7|sqmi}} area includes {{convert|10.5|sqmi}} of land and {{convert|7.2|sqmi}} (40.83%) water, most of it part of [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nBerkeley borders the cities of Albany, Oakland, and Emeryville and Contra Costa County, including unincorporated Kensington, as well as San Francisco Bay.\n\nBerkeley lies within telephone [[area code]] 510 (until September 2, 1991, Berkeley was part of the 415 telephone code that now covers only San Francisco and Marin counties<ref name=BerkeleyAreaCode>{{cite news|last=Fabisch|first=M.P.|title=Revised Date for Split of 415 (California) Numbering Plan Area|url=http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/old_pl/IL%2090-06-023.pdf|accessdate=June 1, 2011|newspaper=BellCore Letter|date=June 6, 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120756/http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/old_pl/IL%2090-06-023.pdf|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>), and the postal [[ZIP code]]s are 94701 through 94710, 94712, and 94720 for the [[University of California]] campus.<ref name=zip />\n\n===Geology===\nMost of Berkeley lies on a rolling sedimentary plain that rises gently from sea level to the base of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. East of the [[Hayward Fault]] along the base of the hills, elevation increases more rapidly. The highest peak along the ridge line above Berkeley is [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]], elevation {{convert|1754|ft}}. A number of small creeks run from the hills to the Bay through Berkeley: [[Cerrito Creek|Cerrito]], [[Codornices Creek|Codornices]], [[Schoolhouse Creek|Schoolhouse]] and [[Strawberry Creek|Strawberry]] Creeks are the principal streams. Most of these are largely [[culvert]]ed once they reach the plain west of the hills.\n\nThe Berkeley Hills are part of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]], and run in a northwest\u2013southeast alignment. Exposed in the Berkeley Hills are cherts and shales of the Claremont Formation (equivalent to the [[Monterey Formation]]), conglomerate and sandstone of the Orinda Formation and lava flows of the Moraga Volcanics. Of similar age to the Moraga Volcanics (extinct), within the Northbrae neighborhood of Berkeley, are outcroppings of erosion resistant rhyolite. These [[rhyolite]] formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences. [[Indian Rock Park]] in the northeastern part of Berkeley near the Arlington/Marin Circle features a large example.\n\n====Earthquakes====\nBerkeley is traversed by the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], a major branch of the [[San Andreas Fault]] to the west. No large earthquake has occurred on the Hayward Fault near Berkeley in historic times (except possibly in 1836), but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large temblors several times in the deeper past. The current assessment is that a Bay Area earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater within the next 30 years is likely, with the Hayward Fault having the highest likelihood among faults in the Bay Area of being the epicenter.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|title = 2008 Bay Area Earthquake Probabilities|accessdate = June 26, 2015|website = USGS|publisher = USGS|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150629012606/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|archive-date = June 29, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Moreover, like much of the Bay Area, Berkeley has many areas of some risk to [[soil liquefaction]], with the flat areas closer to the shore at low to high susceptibility.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|title = U.S. Geological Survey Liquefaction Hazard Maps|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = U.S. Geological Survey|publisher = USGS|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150219045641/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|archive-date = February 19, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1868 Hayward earthquake]] did occur on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1868/10/22/87584244.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 22, 1868 |title=Earthquake in San Francisco and Neighboring Places }}</ref> in the vicinity of today's city of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]]. This quake destroyed the county seat of Alameda County then located in [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] and it subsequently moved to Oakland. It was strongly felt in San Francisco, causing major damage.  It was regarded as the \"Great San Francisco earthquake\" prior to 1906. It produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in Berkeley, across the grounds of the new [[State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind]] then under construction, which was noted by one early University of California professor. Although no significant damage was reported to most of the few Berkeley buildings of the time, the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of Domingo Peralta in north Berkeley.<ref>Lawson, A. C. (ed.), ''The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906'', 1908, Reprinted 1969 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This is a comprehensive report on the 1906 earthquake, published by the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, and comprises two volumes and an atlas. It contains a discussion of the 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake and its effects, and includes a number of photos taken by Lawson himself of damage in Berkeley caused by the 1906 quake. The report is available from the USGS. {{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/1906calif/18april/references.php |title=1906 Earthquake \u2013 References |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov}}</ref>\n\nToday, evidence of the Hayward Fault's \"creeping\" is visible at various locations in Berkeley. Cracked roadways, sharp jogs in streams, and springs mark the fault's path. However, since it cuts across the base of the hills, the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity. Some of the slide activity itself, however, results from movement on the Hayward Fault.\n\nA notorious segment of the Hayward Fault runs lengthwise down the middle of [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon on the University of California campus.<ref>[https://haywardfaultucberkeley.pressbooks.com/chapter/the-california-memorial-stadium/ ''The Hayward Fault at the Campus of University of California, Berkeley: A Guide to a Brief Walking Tour'', Horst Rademacher, Pressbooks, 2017, Chapter 5]</ref> Photos and measurements<ref>[http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.htm]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> show the movement of the fault through the stadium.\n\n===Climate===\nBerkeley has a cool summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (type [[Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Csb]] in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), with dry summers and wet winters. Berkeley's location directly opposite the [[Golden Gate]] ensures that typical eastward [[San Francisco fog|fog]] flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0107/b.html |title=Jane Houston Jones.

SJAA Ephemeris July 2001 |publisher=Ephemeris.sjaa.net |date=July 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref> The summers are cooler than a typical Mediterranean climate thanks to [[upwelling]] ocean currents along the California coast. These help produce cool and foggy nights and mornings.\n\nWinter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature. Summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or fog, followed by sunny, warm days. The warmest and driest months are typically June through September, with the highest temperatures occurring in September. Mid-summer (July\u2013August) is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then.\n\nIn a year, there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of {{convert|90.0|\u00b0F}} or higher, and an average of 0.8 days with lows of {{convert|32|\u00b0F}} or lower. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|107|\u00b0F}} on June 15, 2000 and July 16, 1993, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|24|\u00b0F}} on December 22, 1990.\n\nJanuary is normally the wettest month, averaging {{convert|5.13|in|mm}} of precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|25.40|in|mm}}, falling on an average of 63.7 days each year. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|14.49|in|mm}} in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|6.98|in|mm}} on January 4, 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|title=Climatography of the United States : No. 20 : 1971-2000|publisher=Cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov|accessdate=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725104836/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As in most of California, the heaviest rainfall years are usually associated with warm water [[El Ni\u00f1o]] episodes in the Pacific (e.g., 1982\u201383; 1997\u201398), which bring in drenching \"[[pineapple express]]\" storms. In contrast, dry years are often associated with cold Pacific [[La Ni\u00f1a]] episodes. Light snow has fallen on rare occasions. Snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the [[Berkeley Hills]].<ref>Western Regional Climate Center Web site</ref>\n\nIn the late spring and early fall, strong [[Diablo wind|offshore winds]] of sinking air typically develop, bringing heat and dryness to the area. In the spring, this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains, but extreme dryness prevails by the fall, creating a danger of wildfires. In September 1923 a major fire swept through the neighborhoods north of the university campus, stopping just short of downtown. (''See'' [[1923 Berkeley fire]]). On October 20, 1991, gusty, hot winds fanned a conflagration along the Berkeley\u2013Oakland border, killing 25 people and injuring 150, as well as destroying 2,449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units.

The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]]) runs along the bay shoreline. Each day there is an influx of thousands of cars into the city by commuting UC faculty, staff and students, making parking for more than a few hours an expensive proposition.\n\nBerkeley has one of the highest rates of bicycle and pedestrian commuting in the nation. Berkeley is the safest city of its size in California for pedestrians and cyclists, considering the number of injuries per pedestrian and cyclist, rather than per capita.<ref>[http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/contentdisplay.aspx?id=8512 Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety in Berkeley], City of Berkeley.</ref>\n\n[[File:IMAG4107-berkeley-etna-and-dwight.jpg|thumb|A street closed off into two dead ends by traffic calming barriers.  A gap in the middle allows passage by bikes and emergency vehicles.]]\nBerkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers, moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets (visitors often find this confusing, because the diverters are not shown on all maps). Berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles, called [[Bicycle Boulevards]], with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel.\n\nBerkeley hosts [[car sharing]] networks including [[Uhaul Car Share]], and [[Zipcar]]. Rather than owning (and parking) their own cars, members share a group of cars parked nearby. Web- and telephone-based reservation systems keep track of hours and charges. Several \"pods\" (points of departure where cars are kept) exist throughout the city, in several downtown locations, at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations, and at various other locations in Berkeley (and other cities in the region). Using alternative transportation is encouraged.\n\nBerkeley has had recurring problems with [[parking meter]] vandalism. In 1999, over 2,400 Berkeley meters were jammed, smashed, or sawed apart.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/01/25/BAG664HDH31.DTL \"Chicanery tops meters in Berkeley\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref> Starting in 2005 and continuing into 2006, Berkeley began to phase out mechanical meters in favor of more centralized electronic meters.\n\n===Transportation history===\nThe first commuter service to San Francisco was provided by the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]'s [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], a [[standard gauge]] [[steam railroad]], which terminated in downtown Berkeley, and connected in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] (at a locale then known as \"Shellmound\") with trains to the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland ferry pier]] as well as with the Central Pacific main line starting in 1876. The Berkeley Branch line was extended from Shattuck and University to Vine Street (\"Berryman's Station\") in 1878. Starting in 1882, Berkeley trains ran directly to the Oakland Pier.<ref>''Berkeley Gazette'', January 22, 1903</ref> In the 1880s, [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] assumed operations of the Berkeley Branch under a lease from its own paper affiliate, the Northern Railway. In 1911, Southern Pacific electrified this line and the several others it constructed in Berkeley, creating its [[East Bay Electric Lines]] division. The huge and heavy cars specially built for these lines were called the \"Red Trains\" or the \"Big Red Cars.\" The Shattuck line was extended and connected with two other Berkeley lines (the Ninth Street Line and the California Street line) at Solano and Colusa (the \"Colusa [[Wye (rail)|Wye]]\"). At this time, the [[Northbrae Tunnel]] and Rose Street Undercrossing were constructed, both of which still exist. (The Rose Street Undercrossing is not accessible to the public, being situated between what is now two backyards.) The fourth Berkeley line was the Ellsworth St. line to the university campus. The last Red Trains ran in July 1941.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Robert S. |title=Red Trains in the East Bay: The History of the Southern Pacific Transbay Train and Ferry System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PT8fAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=65 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=978-0-916374-27-3}}</ref>\n\nThe first electric rail service in Berkeley was provided by several small [[streetcar]] companies starting in 1891. Most of these were eventually bought up by the [[Key System]] of [[Francis \"Borax\" Smith]] who added lines and improved equipment. The Key System's streetcars were operated by its East Bay Street Railways division. Principal lines in Berkeley ran on Euclid, The Arlington, College, Telegraph, Shattuck, San Pablo, University, and Grove (today's Martin Luther King Jr. Way). The last streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.\n\nThe first electric commuter interurban-type trains to San Francisco from Berkeley were put in operation by the Key System in 1903, several years before the Southern Pacific electrified its steam commuter lines. Like the SP, Key trains ran to a pier serviced by the Key's own fleet of [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferryboats]], which also docked at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. After the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was built, the Key trains ran to the [[Transbay Terminal]] in San Francisco, sharing tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge with the SP's red trains and the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railroad. It was at this time that the Key trains acquired their letter designations, which were later preserved by Key's public successor, AC Transit. Today's F bus is the successor of the F train. Likewise, the E, G and the H. Before the Bridge, these lines were simply the Shattuck Avenue Line, the Claremont Line, the Westbrae Line, and the Sacramento Street Line, respectively.\n\nAfter the Southern Pacific abandoned transbay service in 1941, the Key System acquired the rights to use its tracks and [[overhead lines|catenary]] on Shattuck north of Dwight Way and through the Northbrae Tunnel to The Alameda for the F-train. The SP tracks along Monterey Avenue as far as Colusa had been acquired by the Key System in 1933 for the H-train, but were abandoned in 1941. The Key System trains stopped running in April 1958.<ref>{{cite book |last=Demoro |first=Harre W. |title=The Key Route: Transbay Commuting by Train and Ferry, Part 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p0wfAQAAIAAJ |year=1985 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=95 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=978-0-916374-66-2}}</ref> On December 15, 1962, the Northbrae Tunnel was opened to auto traffic.<ref>[http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/Californiahighways/chpw_1963_marapr.pdf ''California Highways and Public Works'', March-April 1963, pp.61-64]</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Top employers===\n[[File:CampanileMtTamalpiasSunset-original.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sather Tower]] at the University of California]]\nAccording to the city's 2019 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Finance/Level_3_-_General/FY2019CAFRReport.pdf|title=Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Year Ended June 30, 2019|work=City of Berkeley|access-date=March 21, 2020|page=323}}</ref> the top employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

It has many nice restaurants and small shops. \n*Ashby Avenue ([[California State Route 13|Highway 13]]), which also runs from Berkeley's bayshore to the hills, connects with the Warren Freeway and [[California State Route 24|Highway 24]] leading to the [[Caldecott Tunnel]], named for a former Berkeley mayor.\n*[[San Pablo Avenue]] ([[California State Route 123|Highway 123]]) runs north\u2013south through West Berkeley, connecting [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to the south and [[Albany, California|Albany]] to the north.\n*[[Telegraph Avenue]], which runs north-south from the university campus to Oakland, historically the site of much of the [[hippie]] culture of Berkeley.\n*Martin Luther King Jr. Way, which until 1984 was called Grove St, runs north-south a few blocks west of Shattuck Avenue, connecting Oakland and the freeways to the south with the neighborhoods and other communities to the north.\n*Sacramento Street is one of the four streets with a median in Berkeley, running from Hopkins Street from the north to Alcatraz Ave in the south.\n*[[Solano Avenue]], a major street for shopping and restaurants, runs east-west near the north end of Berkeley, continuing into Albany. Since 1974, Solano Avenue has hosted the annual Solano Avenue Stroll and Parade<ref>[http://www.solanoavenueassn.org/events/solano-avenue-stroll/ Solano Avenue Stroll and Parade]</ref> of the twin-cities of Albany and Berkeley, the East Bay's largest street festival.\n\n===Freeways===\n*The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]]) runs along Berkeley's bayshore with exits at Ashby Avenue, University Avenue and Gilman Street.\n\n===Bicycle and pedestrian paths===\n*[[Ohlone Greenway]]\n*[[San Francisco Bay Trail]]\n*[[Berkeley I-80 bridge]] \u2013 opened in 2002, an arch-suspension bridge spanning Interstate 80, for bicycles and pedestrians only, giving access from the city at the foot of Addison Street to the [[San Francisco Bay Trail]], the [[Eastshore State Park]] and the [[Berkeley Marina]].\n*Berkeley's Network of Historic Pathways \u2013 Berkeley has a network of historic pathways that link the winding neighborhoods found in the hills and offer panoramic lookouts over the East Bay.

Surrounding the [[University of California, Berkeley Campus Architecture|University of California campus]] are the most densely populated parts of the city. West of the campus is '''[[Downtown Berkeley, California|Downtown Berkeley]]''', the city's traditional commercial core; home of the [[civic center]], the city's only public [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], the busiest [[Downtown Berkeley Station|BART station]] in Berkeley, as well as a major transfer point for [[AC Transit]] buses. South of the campus is '''[[Southside, Berkeley, California|Southside]]''', mainly a [[student ghetto]], where much of the university's [[UC Berkeley student housing|student housing]] is located. The busiest stretch of [[Telegraph Avenue]] is in this neighborhood. North of the campus is the quieter '''[[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]]''' neighborhood, the location of the [[Graduate Theological Union]].\n\nFarther from the university campus, the influence of the university quickly becomes less visible. Most of Berkeley's neighborhoods are primarily made up of detached houses, often with separate in-law units in the rear, although larger apartment buildings are also common in many neighborhoods. Commercial activities are concentrated along the major avenues and at important intersections and frequently define the neighborhood within which they reside.\n\nIn the southeastern corner of the city is the '''[[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont District]]''', home to the [[Claremont Resort|Claremont Hotel]]. Also in the southeast is the '''[[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood District]]''' known for its commercial area on College Avenue. West of Elmwood is '''[[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]]''', known for its weekend [[flea market]] at the [[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby Station]].\n\nWest of (and including) San Pablo Avenue, itself a major commercial and transport corridor, is '''[[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]]''', the historic commercial center of the city.  This neighborhood and area includes the former unincorporated town of '''[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]'''. West Berkeley contains the remnants of Berkeley's industrial area, much of which has been replaced by retail and office uses, as well as residential live/work loft space, paralleling the decline of manufacturing in the United States. This area abuts the shoreline of the San Francisco Bay and is home to the [[Berkeley Marina]]. Also nearby is Berkeley's [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]], featuring an artificial linear lagoon of San Francisco Bay.\n\nNorth of downtown is '''[[North Berkeley, Berkeley, California|North Berkeley]]''' which has its main commercial area nicknamed the \"[[Gourmet Ghetto]]\" because of the concentration of well-known restaurants and other food-related businesses. West of North Berkeley (roughly west of Sacramento and north of Cedar) is '''[[Westbrae, Berkeley, California|Westbrae]]''', a small neighborhood centered on a small commercial area on Gilman Street and through which part of the [[Ohlone Greenway]] runs. Meanwhile, further north of North Berkeley are '''[[Northbrae, Berkeley, California|Northbrae]]''', a master-planned subdivision from the early 20th century, and '''[[Thousand Oaks, Berkeley, California|Thousand Oaks]]'''. Above these last three neighborhoods, on the western slopes of the [[Berkeley Hills]] are the neighborhoods of '''[[Cragmont, Berkeley|Cragmont]]''' and '''[[La Loma Park]]''', notable for their dramatic views, winding streets, and numerous public stairways and paths.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Apartments and other higher density housing in Berkeley, California\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"font-size:88%;line-height:130%;\">\nFile:IMAG4110-berkeley-2729-dwight.jpg|Mid-20th century apartments with soft story parking.

The Berkeley City Council is composed of the mayor and eight council members elected by district who each serve four-year terms. Districts 2, 3, 5 and 6 hold their elections in years divisible by four while Districts 1, 4, 7 and 8 hold theirs in even-numbered years not divisible by four. The city council appoints a city manager, who is the chief executive of the city. Additionally, the city voters directly elect an independent city auditor, [[Berkeley Unified School District|school board]], and rent stabilization board. The current council members and auditor are:<ref name=EO/>\n*Mayor (At-Large): [[Jesse Arregu\u00edn]]\n* District 1: Rashi Kesarwani\n* District 2: Cheryl Davila\n* District 3: [[Ben Bartlett]]\n* District 4: Kate Harrison\n* District 5: Sophie Hahn\n* District 6: Susan Wengraf\n* District 7: Rigel Robinson\n* District 8: Lori Droste\n* City Auditor: Jenny Wong\n\nKriss Worthington, elected in 1996 to represent District 7, was the first openly [[LGBT]] man elected to Berkeley City Council.

Today, most of the University housing is located in District 7 (although Foothill and Clark Kerr are in Districts 6 and 8, respectively). Districts 4 and 7 are majority-student. The City of Berkeley in 2014 passed a redistricting measure to create the nation's first student supermajority district<ref>{{cite web | url=https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2013-10-27/berkeley-city-councils-historic-offer-take-seat-cal | title=Berkeley City Council's historic offer: Take a seat, Cal| date=2013-08-22}}</ref> in District 7, which in 2018 elected Rigel Robinson, a 22-year-old [[UC Berkeley]] graduate and the youngest Councilmember in the city's history.\n\nBerkeley is also part of [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], for which the [[Government of Alameda County, California|Government of Alameda County]] is defined and authorized under the [[California Constitution]], [[California law]], and the Charter of the County of Alameda.<ref>California Government Code \u00a7 23004</ref> The county government provides countywide services, such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services.

The last [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate to receive at least one-quarter of the vote in Berkeley was [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968. Consistent with Berkeley's reputation as a strongly [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and/or [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] city, in the 2016 presidential election more votes were won by [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Jill Stein]] than by Republican candidate [[Donald Trump]].<ref>Jill Stein won 4.6% vs Donald Trump's 3.2%.

Bay]] in northern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[California]]. It is named after the 18th-century [[Irish people|Irish]] bishop and philosopher [[George Berkeley]]. It borders the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to the south and the city of [[Albany, California|Albany]] and the [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] of [[Kensington, California|Kensington]] to the north. Its eastern border with [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] generally follows the ridge of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. The 2010 census recorded a population of 112,580.\n\nBerkeley is home to the oldest campus in the [[University of California]] system, the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], which is managed and operated by the University. It also has the [[Graduate Theological Union]], one of the largest religious studies institutions in the world. Berkeley is considered one of the most [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] cities in the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe site of today's City of Berkeley was the territory of the Chochenyo/Huchiun band of the [[Ohlone]] people when the first Europeans arrived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Golla|first=Victor|title=California Indian Languages|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-0-520-26667-4|page=380|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520266674}}</ref> Evidence of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations, which they used to grind acorns, and a [[shellmound]], now mostly leveled and covered up, along the shoreline of [[San Francisco Bay]] at the mouth of [[Strawberry Creek]]. Other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the [[Downtown Berkeley|downtown area]] during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.{{citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=see talk page}}\n\n[[File:Acorn pit at Indian Rock.jpg|thumb|left|100px|This pit in the surface of a rock at [[Indian Rock Park]] is typical of those used by [[Ohlone]] Indians to grind [[acorn]]s.]]\nThe first people of European descent (most of whom were of mixed race and born in America<ref>[https://anzasociety.org/the-spanish-myth/ \"The Spanish Myth\", Phil Valdez Jr., Anza Society International]</ref>) arrived with the [[De Anza Expedition]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Juan Bautista de Anza|url=http://www.borregospringschamber.com/juan_bautista_de_anza.html|publisher=Borrego Springs Chamber of Commerce|access-date=February 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725052027/http://www.borregospringschamber.com/juan_bautista_de_anza.html|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The De Anza Expedition led to establishment of the Spanish [[Presidio of San Francisco]] at the entrance to San Francisco Bay (the ''[[Golden Gate]])''. [[Luis Mar\u00eda Peralta|Luis Peralta]] was among the soldiers at the Presidio. For his services to the [[King of Spain]], he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of San Francisco Bay (the ''contra costa'', \"opposite shore\") for a ranch, including that portion that now comprises the City of Berkeley.\n\nLuis Peralta named his holding \"[[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]\". The primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides, but hunting and farming were also pursued. Eventually, Peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons. What is now Berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to Peralta's son [[Jos\u00e9 Domingo Peralta|Domingo]], with a little in the portion that went to another son, Vicente. No artifact survives of the Domingo or Vicente ranches, but their names survive in Berkeley street names (Vicente, Domingo, and Peralta). However, legal title to all land in the City of Berkeley remains based on the original Peralta land grant.\n\nThe Peraltas' Rancho San Antonio continued after [[Alta California]] passed from Spanish to Mexican sovereignty after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. However, the advent of U.S. sovereignty after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and especially, the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], saw the Peraltas' lands quickly encroached on by [[squatter]]s and diminished by dubious legal proceedings. The lands of the brothers Domingo and Vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes. The rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various American claimants (''See'' [[Kellersberger's Map]]).\n\nPolitically, the area that became Berkeley was initially part of a vast [[Contra Costa County]]. On March 25, 1853, Alameda County was created from a division of Contra Costa County, as well as from a small portion of [[Santa Clara County]]. The area that became Berkeley was then the northern part of the \"Oakland Township\" subdivision of Alameda County. During this period, \"Berkeley\" was mostly a mix of open land, farms, and ranches, with a small, though busy, wharf by the bay.\n\n[[File:Indian rock.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The city as seen from [[Indian Rock Park]] in the North Berkeley Hills. Berkeley is in the foreground, with the [[Berkeley Marina]] and [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Park]] just beyond.]]\n\n===Late 19th century===\nIn 1866, Oakland's private [[College of California]] looked for a new site. It settled on a location north of Oakland along the foot of the [[Berkeley Hills|Contra Costa Range]] (later called the Berkeley Hills) astride [[Strawberry Creek]], at an elevation about {{convert|500|ft}} above the bay, commanding a view of the Bay Area and the Pacific Ocean through the [[Golden Gate]].\n\nAccording to the ''Centennial Record of the University of California'', \"In 1866\u2026at [[Founders' Rock]], a group of College of California men watched two ships standing out to sea through the [[Golden Gate]]. One of them, [[Frederick Billings]], thought of the lines of the Anglo-Irish Anglican Bishop [[George Berkeley]], 'westward the course of empire takes its way,' and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish philosopher.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stadtman |editor-first=Verne |title=The Centennial Record of the University of California |publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] |year=1967 |page=114 |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00219&toc.depth=1&toc.id=div00219&brand=calisphere}}</ref> The philosopher's name is pronounced ''BARK-lee'', but the city's name, to accommodate [[American English]], is pronounced ''BERK-lee''.<ref>{{cite web |title=George Berkeley \u2013 Biography |publisher=[[European Graduate School]] |url=http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225225047/http://www.egs.edu/library/george-berkeley/biography/ |archivedate=February 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe College of California's ''College Homestead Association'' planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and they began a collaboration with the [[California|State of California]] that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public [[University of California]].\n\nAs construction began on the new site, more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus. At the same time, a settlement of residences, saloons, and various industries grew around the wharf area called \"[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]\". A [[horsecar]] ran from [[Temescal, Oakland, California|Temescal]] in Oakland to the university campus along what is now [[Telegraph Avenue]]. The first post office opened in 1872.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|601}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1870s, the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] reached its terminus in Oakland. In 1876, a branch line of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], was laid from a junction with the mainline called Shellmound (now a part of Emeryville) into what is now [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown Berkeley]]. That same year, the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into Oakland was re-routed, putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through Ocean View.\n\nThere was a strong prohibition movement in Berkeley at this time. In 1876, the state enacted the ''mile limit law'', which forbade sale or public consumption of alcohol within one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of the new University of California.<ref>Berkeley Gazette. 1900 April 9</ref> Then, in 1899 Berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone. Scientists, scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol.<ref>Berkeley 1900: Daily Life at the Turn of the Century, by Richard Schwartz. 2000. page 187</ref>\n\nOn April 1, 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the university campus, together with local farmers, were granted [[municipal corporation|incorporation]] by the State of California as the Town of Berkeley.<ref>[https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1877/1877_78.PDF#page=956 ''Statutes of California'', 1877-78, p.888]</ref> The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of [[Denis Kearney]]'s [[Workingman's Party]], who were particularly favored in the working class area of the former Ocean View, now called \"West Berkeley\". The area near the university became known for a time as \"East Berkeley\".\n\nDue to the influence of the university, the modern age came quickly to Berkeley. [[Electric light]]s and the telephone were in use by 1888. Electric [[streetcar]]s soon replaced the [[horsecar]]. A silent film of one of these early streetcars in Berkeley can be seen at the [[Library of Congress]] website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/00694420/|title=Trip to Berkeley, California, Lcmp003 M3a29754|publisher=Library of Congress}}<!-- https://www.loc.gov/collections/san-francisco-earthquake-and-fire-1897-to-1916/?q=lcmp003%20m3a29754 --></ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:Oakland 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Oakland and Berkeley area in 1917]]\n\nBerkeley's slow growth ended abruptly with the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906]]. The town and other parts of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] escaped serious damage, and thousands of refugees flowed across the Bay.  Among them were most of San Francisco's painters and sculptors, who between 1907 and 1911 created one of the largest art colonies west of Chicago.  Artist and critic [[Jennie V.

Around 640 structures burned before a late afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress, allowing firefighters to put it out.\n\nThe next big growth occurred with the advent of [[World War II]], when large numbers of people moved to the Bay Area to work in the many war industries, such as the immense [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in nearby [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]. One who moved out, but played a big role in the outcome of the War was U.C. Professor and Berkeley resident [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. During the war, an Army base, [[Camp Ashby]], was temporarily sited in Berkeley.\n\n[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Lawn Forum.

In the 1950s, [[McCarthyism]] induced the university to demand a loyalty oath from its professors, many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought. In 1960, a U.S. House committee ([[HUAC]]) came to San Francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the Bay Area. Their presence was met by protesters, including many from the university. Meanwhile, a number of U.C. students became active in the [[civil rights movement]]. Finally, in 1964, the university provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus. This protest became the [[Free Speech Movement]]. As the [[Vietnam War]] rapidly escalated in the ensuing years, so did student activism at the university, particularly that organized by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]].\n\n{{See also|1960s Berkeley protests}}\n\nBerkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes, civic unrest, and political upheaval that characterized the late 1960s.<ref>[http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/berkeley%20shattuck%20context%2005-28-2015.pdf \"Shattuck Avenue: Commercial Corridor Historic Context and Survey\"].

Retrieved October 5, 2017.</ref> In that period, Berkeley\u2014especially [[Telegraph Avenue]]\u2014became a focal point for the [[hippie]] movement, which spilled over the Bay from San Francisco. Many hippies were apolitical drop-outs, rather than students, but in the heady atmosphere of Berkeley in 1967\u20131969 there was considerable overlap between the hippie movement and the radical left. An iconic event in the Berkeley Sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of university property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called \"[[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]].\"\n\n[[File:People's-Park.jpg|thumbnail|left|People's Park with Unit 2 in the background]]\n\nThe battle over the disposition of People's Park resulted in a month-long occupation of Berkeley by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] on orders of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the end, the park remained undeveloped, and remains so today. A spin-off, ''People's Park Annex'', was established at the same time by activist citizens of Berkeley on a strip of land above the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] subway construction along Hearst Avenue northwest of the U.C. campus. The land had also been intended for development, but was turned over to the city by BART and is now [[Ohlone Park]].\n\nThe era of large public protest in Berkeley waned considerably with the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. While the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in Berkeley, it remains one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic cities in the United States.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\n====Housing and zoning changes====\n[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|Shattuck Avenue at Center Street in downtown Berkeley as seen in 1973]]\nThe Berkeley population declined in the 1970s, partly due to an exodus to the suburbs. Some moved because of the rising cost of living throughout the Bay Area, and others because of the decline and disappearance of many industries in West Berkeley.\n\nIncreasing enrollment at the university led to replacement of older buildings by large apartment buildings, especially in older parts of the city near the University and downtown. Increasing enrollment also led the university to wanting to redevelop certain places of Berkeley, especially Southside, but more specifically People's Park.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Don|title=Iconography and locational conflict from the underside: Free speech, People's Park, and the politics of homelessness in Berkeley, California|journal=Political Geography|volume=11|issue=2|pages=152\u2013169|doi=10.1016/0962-6298(92)90046-V|year=1992}}</ref> [[Preservationists]] passed the Neighborhood Protection Ordinance in 1973 by ballot measure and the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance in 1974 by City Council.

Though more far-reaching in their effect than those of some of the other jurisdictions in California who chose to use rent-control where they could, these policies were limited by the Costa-Hawkins Act, a statewide ban on rent control that came into effect in 1995, limiting rent control to multi-family units that were built (or technically buildings that were issued their original certificate of occupation) before the state law came into effect in 1995, though for cities such as Berkely where rent-control was already in place, the law limited the use of rent-control to units built before the local rent control law was enacted, i.e. 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/What_is_Rent_Control_.aspx|title=What is Rent Control? ... and How Does It Affect Me?|publisher=City of Berkeley|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Political movements====\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, activists increased their power in local government. This era also saw major developments in Berkeley's environmental and food culture. Berkeley's last Republican mayor, [[Wallace J.S. Johnson]], left office in 1971. [[Alice Waters]] opened [[Chez Panisse]] in 1971.  The first curbside recycling program in the U.S. was started by the [[Ecology Center (Berkeley)|Ecology Center]] in 1973.

East of the [[Hayward Fault]] along the base of the hills, elevation increases more rapidly. The highest peak along the ridge line above Berkeley is [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]], elevation {{convert|1754|ft}}. A number of small creeks run from the hills to the Bay through Berkeley: [[Cerrito Creek|Cerrito]], [[Codornices Creek|Codornices]], [[Schoolhouse Creek|Schoolhouse]] and [[Strawberry Creek|Strawberry]] Creeks are the principal streams. Most of these are largely [[culvert]]ed once they reach the plain west of the hills.\n\nThe Berkeley Hills are part of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]], and run in a northwest\u2013southeast alignment. Exposed in the Berkeley Hills are cherts and shales of the Claremont Formation (equivalent to the [[Monterey Formation]]), conglomerate and sandstone of the Orinda Formation and lava flows of the Moraga Volcanics. Of similar age to the Moraga Volcanics (extinct), within the Northbrae neighborhood of Berkeley, are outcroppings of erosion resistant rhyolite. These [[rhyolite]] formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences. [[Indian Rock Park]] in the northeastern part of Berkeley near the Arlington/Marin Circle features a large example.\n\n====Earthquakes====\nBerkeley is traversed by the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], a major branch of the [[San Andreas Fault]] to the west. No large earthquake has occurred on the Hayward Fault near Berkeley in historic times (except possibly in 1836), but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large temblors several times in the deeper past. The current assessment is that a Bay Area earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater within the next 30 years is likely, with the Hayward Fault having the highest likelihood among faults in the Bay Area of being the epicenter.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|title = 2008 Bay Area Earthquake Probabilities|accessdate = June 26, 2015|website = USGS|publisher = USGS|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150629012606/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/ucerf/|archive-date = June 29, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Moreover, like much of the Bay Area, Berkeley has many areas of some risk to [[soil liquefaction]], with the flat areas closer to the shore at low to high susceptibility.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|title = U.S. Geological Survey Liquefaction Hazard Maps|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = U.S. Geological Survey|publisher = USGS|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150219045641/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/alameda/|archive-date = February 19, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1868 Hayward earthquake]] did occur on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1868/10/22/87584244.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 22, 1868 |title=Earthquake in San Francisco and Neighboring Places }}</ref> in the vicinity of today's city of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]]. This quake destroyed the county seat of Alameda County then located in [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] and it subsequently moved to Oakland. It was strongly felt in San Francisco, causing major damage.  It was regarded as the \"Great San Francisco earthquake\" prior to 1906. It produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in Berkeley, across the grounds of the new [[State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind]] then under construction, which was noted by one early University of California professor. Although no significant damage was reported to most of the few Berkeley buildings of the time, the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of Domingo Peralta in north Berkeley.<ref>Lawson, A. C. (ed.), ''The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906'', 1908, Reprinted 1969 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This is a comprehensive report on the 1906 earthquake, published by the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, and comprises two volumes and an atlas. It contains a discussion of the 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake and its effects, and includes a number of photos taken by Lawson himself of damage in Berkeley caused by the 1906 quake. The report is available from the USGS. {{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/1906calif/18april/references.php |title=1906 Earthquake \u2013 References |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov}}</ref>\n\nToday, evidence of the Hayward Fault's \"creeping\" is visible at various locations in Berkeley. Cracked roadways, sharp jogs in streams, and springs mark the fault's path. However, since it cuts across the base of the hills, the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity. Some of the slide activity itself, however, results from movement on the Hayward Fault.\n\nA notorious segment of the Hayward Fault runs lengthwise down the middle of [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon on the University of California campus.<ref>[https://haywardfaultucberkeley.pressbooks.com/chapter/the-california-memorial-stadium/ ''The Hayward Fault at the Campus of University of California, Berkeley: A Guide to a Brief Walking Tour'', Horst Rademacher, Pressbooks, 2017, Chapter 5]</ref> Photos and measurements<ref>[http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.htm]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> show the movement of the fault through the stadium.\n\n===Climate===\nBerkeley has a cool summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (type [[Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Csb]] in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), with dry summers and wet winters. Berkeley's location directly opposite the [[Golden Gate]] ensures that typical eastward [[San Francisco fog|fog]] flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0107/b.html |title=Jane Houston Jones.

These help produce cool and foggy nights and mornings.\n\nWinter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature. Summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or fog, followed by sunny, warm days. The warmest and driest months are typically June through September, with the highest temperatures occurring in September. Mid-summer (July\u2013August) is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then.\n\nIn a year, there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of {{convert|90.0|\u00b0F}} or higher, and an average of 0.8 days with lows of {{convert|32|\u00b0F}} or lower. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|107|\u00b0F}} on June 15, 2000 and July 16, 1993, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|24|\u00b0F}} on December 22, 1990.\n\nJanuary is normally the wettest month, averaging {{convert|5.13|in|mm}} of precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|25.40|in|mm}}, falling on an average of 63.7 days each year. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|14.49|in|mm}} in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|6.98|in|mm}} on January 4, 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|title=Climatography of the United States : No. 20 : 1971-2000|publisher=Cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov|accessdate=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725104836/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As in most of California, the heaviest rainfall years are usually associated with warm water [[El Ni\u00f1o]] episodes in the Pacific (e.g., 1982\u201383; 1997\u201398), which bring in drenching \"[[pineapple express]]\" storms. In contrast, dry years are often associated with cold Pacific [[La Ni\u00f1a]] episodes. Light snow has fallen on rare occasions. Snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the [[Berkeley Hills]].<ref>Western Regional Climate Center Web site</ref>\n\nIn the late spring and early fall, strong [[Diablo wind|offshore winds]] of sinking air typically develop, bringing heat and dryness to the area. In the spring, this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains, but extreme dryness prevails by the fall, creating a danger of wildfires. In September 1923 a major fire swept through the neighborhoods north of the university campus, stopping just short of downtown. (''See'' [[1923 Berkeley fire]]). On October 20, 1991, gusty, hot winds fanned a conflagration along the Berkeley\u2013Oakland border, killing 25 people and injuring 150, as well as destroying 2,449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units.

Each day there is an influx of thousands of cars into the city by commuting UC faculty, staff and students, making parking for more than a few hours an expensive proposition.\n\nBerkeley has one of the highest rates of bicycle and pedestrian commuting in the nation.

A gap in the middle allows passage by bikes and emergency vehicles.]]\nBerkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers, moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets (visitors often find this confusing, because the diverters are not shown on all maps). Berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles, called [[Bicycle Boulevards]], with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel.\n\nBerkeley hosts [[car sharing]] networks including [[Uhaul Car Share]], and [[Zipcar]]. Rather than owning (and parking) their own cars, members share a group of cars parked nearby. Web- and telephone-based reservation systems keep track of hours and charges. Several \"pods\" (points of departure where cars are kept) exist throughout the city, in several downtown locations, at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations, and at various other locations in Berkeley (and other cities in the region). Using alternative transportation is encouraged.\n\nBerkeley has had recurring problems with [[parking meter]] vandalism. In 1999, over 2,400 Berkeley meters were jammed, smashed, or sawed apart.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/01/25/BAG664HDH31.DTL \"Chicanery tops meters in Berkeley\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref> Starting in 2005 and continuing into 2006, Berkeley began to phase out mechanical meters in favor of more centralized electronic meters.\n\n===Transportation history===\nThe first commuter service to San Francisco was provided by the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]'s [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], a [[standard gauge]] [[steam railroad]], which terminated in downtown Berkeley, and connected in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] (at a locale then known as \"Shellmound\") with trains to the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland ferry pier]] as well as with the Central Pacific main line starting in 1876. The Berkeley Branch line was extended from Shattuck and University to Vine Street (\"Berryman's Station\") in 1878. Starting in 1882, Berkeley trains ran directly to the Oakland Pier.<ref>''Berkeley Gazette'', January 22, 1903</ref> In the 1880s, [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] assumed operations of the Berkeley Branch under a lease from its own paper affiliate, the Northern Railway. In 1911, Southern Pacific electrified this line and the several others it constructed in Berkeley, creating its [[East Bay Electric Lines]] division. The huge and heavy cars specially built for these lines were called the \"Red Trains\" or the \"Big Red Cars.\" The Shattuck line was extended and connected with two other Berkeley lines (the Ninth Street Line and the California Street line) at Solano and Colusa (the \"Colusa [[Wye (rail)|Wye]]\"). At this time, the [[Northbrae Tunnel]] and Rose Street Undercrossing were constructed, both of which still exist. (The Rose Street Undercrossing is not accessible to the public, being situated between what is now two backyards.) The fourth Berkeley line was the Ellsworth St. line to the university campus. The last Red Trains ran in July 1941.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Robert S. |title=Red Trains in the East Bay: The History of the Southern Pacific Transbay Train and Ferry System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PT8fAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=65 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=978-0-916374-27-3}}</ref>\n\nThe first electric rail service in Berkeley was provided by several small [[streetcar]] companies starting in 1891. Most of these were eventually bought up by the [[Key System]] of [[Francis \"Borax\" Smith]] who added lines and improved equipment. The Key System's streetcars were operated by its East Bay Street Railways division. Principal lines in Berkeley ran on Euclid, The Arlington, College, Telegraph, Shattuck, San Pablo, University, and Grove (today's Martin Luther King Jr. Way). The last streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.\n\nThe first electric commuter interurban-type trains to San Francisco from Berkeley were put in operation by the Key System in 1903, several years before the Southern Pacific electrified its steam commuter lines. Like the SP, Key trains ran to a pier serviced by the Key's own fleet of [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferryboats]], which also docked at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. After the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was built, the Key trains ran to the [[Transbay Terminal]] in San Francisco, sharing tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge with the SP's red trains and the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railroad. It was at this time that the Key trains acquired their letter designations, which were later preserved by Key's public successor, AC Transit. Today's F bus is the successor of the F train. Likewise, the E, G and the H. Before the Bridge, these lines were simply the Shattuck Avenue Line, the Claremont Line, the Westbrae Line, and the Sacramento Street Line, respectively.\n\nAfter the Southern Pacific abandoned transbay service in 1941, the Key System acquired the rights to use its tracks and [[overhead lines|catenary]] on Shattuck north of Dwight Way and through the Northbrae Tunnel to The Alameda for the F-train. The SP tracks along Monterey Avenue as far as Colusa had been acquired by the Key System in 1933 for the H-train, but were abandoned in 1941.

It is named for [[Francis K. Shattuck]], one of Berkeley's earliest influential citizens.\n*University Avenue runs from Berkeley's bayshore and marina in the west to the University of California campus in the east.\n*College Avenue, running from the University of California from the north to Broadway in [[Oakland]] in the south close to the foothill, is a relatively quiet street compared with other major streets in Berkeley. It has many nice restaurants and small shops. \n*Ashby Avenue ([[California State Route 13|Highway 13]]), which also runs from Berkeley's bayshore to the hills, connects with the Warren Freeway and [[California State Route 24|Highway 24]] leading to the [[Caldecott Tunnel]], named for a former Berkeley mayor.\n*[[San Pablo Avenue]] ([[California State Route 123|Highway 123]]) runs north\u2013south through West Berkeley, connecting [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to the south and [[Albany, California|Albany]] to the north.\n*[[Telegraph Avenue]], which runs north-south from the university campus to Oakland, historically the site of much of the [[hippie]] culture of Berkeley.\n*Martin Luther King Jr. Way, which until 1984 was called Grove St, runs north-south a few blocks west of Shattuck Avenue, connecting Oakland and the freeways to the south with the neighborhoods and other communities to the north.\n*Sacramento Street is one of the four streets with a median in Berkeley, running from Hopkins Street from the north to Alcatraz Ave in the south.\n*[[Solano Avenue]], a major street for shopping and restaurants, runs east-west near the north end of Berkeley, continuing into Albany. Since 1974, Solano Avenue has hosted the annual Solano Avenue Stroll and Parade<ref>[http://www.solanoavenueassn.org/events/solano-avenue-stroll/ Solano Avenue Stroll and Parade]</ref> of the twin-cities of Albany and Berkeley, the East Bay's largest street festival.\n\n===Freeways===\n*The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]]) runs along Berkeley's bayshore with exits at Ashby Avenue, University Avenue and Gilman Street.\n\n===Bicycle and pedestrian paths===\n*[[Ohlone Greenway]]\n*[[San Francisco Bay Trail]]\n*[[Berkeley I-80 bridge]] \u2013 opened in 2002, an arch-suspension bridge spanning Interstate 80, for bicycles and pedestrians only, giving access from the city at the foot of Addison Street to the [[San Francisco Bay Trail]], the [[Eastshore State Park]] and the [[Berkeley Marina]].\n*Berkeley's Network of Historic Pathways \u2013 Berkeley has a network of historic pathways that link the winding neighborhoods found in the hills and offer panoramic lookouts over the East Bay. A complete guide to the pathways may be found at [[Berkeley Path Wanderers Association]] website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berkeleypaths.org|title=Berkeley Path Wanderers Association|publisher=Berkeleypaths.org|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{See also|List of Berkeley neighborhoods}}\n[[File:Claremonthotel03192006.JPG|thumb|The Claremont Resort at the heart of the Claremont neighborhood]]\n\nBerkeley has a number of distinct neighborhoods. Surrounding the [[University of California, Berkeley Campus Architecture|University of California campus]] are the most densely populated parts of the city. West of the campus is '''[[Downtown Berkeley, California|Downtown Berkeley]]''', the city's traditional commercial core; home of the [[civic center]], the city's only public [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], the busiest [[Downtown Berkeley Station|BART station]] in Berkeley, as well as a major transfer point for [[AC Transit]] buses. South of the campus is '''[[Southside, Berkeley, California|Southside]]''', mainly a [[student ghetto]], where much of the university's [[UC Berkeley student housing|student housing]] is located. The busiest stretch of [[Telegraph Avenue]] is in this neighborhood. North of the campus is the quieter '''[[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]]''' neighborhood, the location of the [[Graduate Theological Union]].\n\nFarther from the university campus, the influence of the university quickly becomes less visible. Most of Berkeley's neighborhoods are primarily made up of detached houses, often with separate in-law units in the rear, although larger apartment buildings are also common in many neighborhoods. Commercial activities are concentrated along the major avenues and at important intersections and frequently define the neighborhood within which they reside.\n\nIn the southeastern corner of the city is the '''[[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont District]]''', home to the [[Claremont Resort|Claremont Hotel]]. Also in the southeast is the '''[[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood District]]''' known for its commercial area on College Avenue. West of Elmwood is '''[[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]]''', known for its weekend [[flea market]] at the [[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby Station]].\n\nWest of (and including) San Pablo Avenue, itself a major commercial and transport corridor, is '''[[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]]''', the historic commercial center of the city.  This neighborhood and area includes the former unincorporated town of '''[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]'''. West Berkeley contains the remnants of Berkeley's industrial area, much of which has been replaced by retail and office uses, as well as residential live/work loft space, paralleling the decline of manufacturing in the United States. This area abuts the shoreline of the San Francisco Bay and is home to the [[Berkeley Marina]]. Also nearby is Berkeley's [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]], featuring an artificial linear lagoon of San Francisco Bay.\n\nNorth of downtown is '''[[North Berkeley, Berkeley, California|North Berkeley]]''' which has its main commercial area nicknamed the \"[[Gourmet Ghetto]]\" because of the concentration of well-known restaurants and other food-related businesses. West of North Berkeley (roughly west of Sacramento and north of Cedar) is '''[[Westbrae, Berkeley, California|Westbrae]]''', a small neighborhood centered on a small commercial area on Gilman Street and through which part of the [[Ohlone Greenway]] runs. Meanwhile, further north of North Berkeley are '''[[Northbrae, Berkeley, California|Northbrae]]''', a master-planned subdivision from the early 20th century, and '''[[Thousand Oaks, Berkeley, California|Thousand Oaks]]'''. Above these last three neighborhoods, on the western slopes of the [[Berkeley Hills]] are the neighborhoods of '''[[Cragmont, Berkeley|Cragmont]]''' and '''[[La Loma Park]]''', notable for their dramatic views, winding streets, and numerous public stairways and paths.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Apartments and other higher density housing in Berkeley, California\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"font-size:88%;line-height:130%;\">\nFile:IMAG4110-berkeley-2729-dwight.jpg|Mid-20th century apartments with soft story parking.
