First flown in 1987, it was developed by a joint venture between [[Westland Helicopters]] in the United Kingdom and [[Agusta]] in Italy in response to national requirements for a modern naval utility helicopter. Several operators, including the armed forces of Britain, Denmark, and Portugal, use the name '''Merlin''' for their AW101 aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.emfa.pt/www/aeronavesdetalhe.php?lang=ing&cod=eh101 |title= EH-101 Merlin factsheet |publisher= Portuguese Air Force |accessdate= 5 February 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090620003601/http://www.emfa.pt/www/aeronavesdetalhe.php?lang=ing&cod=eh101 |archive-date= 20 June 2009 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://forsvaret.dk/FTK/Factsheets/ |title= Danish Airforce factsheet |publisher= Danish Airforce |accessdate=5 February 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080618040906/http://forsvaret.dk/FTK/Factsheets/|archivedate=18 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It is manufactured at factories in [[Yeovil]], England and [[Vergiate]], Italy; licensed assembly work has also taken place in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].\n\nPrior to 2007, the aircraft had been marketed under the designation '''EH101'''.

The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) operates a variant of the AW101, designated [[CH-149 Cormorant]], in the [[air-sea rescue]] role. Another variant, designated [[VH-71 Kestrel]], was being developed to serve in the [[Marine One|US presidential transport fleet]] before the program was cancelled. Civil operators also use AW101s in roles such as passenger and VIP transportation. The type has been deployed to active combat theatres, such as in support of coalition forces during the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nIn 1977, the [[British Ministry of Defence|UK Ministry of Defence]] issued a requirement for an [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) helicopter to replace the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Westland Sea King]]s, which were becoming inadequate in the face of advances in [[Soviet Navy#Submarines|Soviet submarine]] technology. [[Westland Helicopters]] put together a proposal, designated '''WG.34''', for a three-engined helicopter of similar dimensions to the Sea King; the WG.34 was to feature more autonomy and a greater range than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1978/1978%20-%203004.html |title= Royal Navy keeps its wings |work= Flight International |date= 25 November 1978 |pages= 1926\u20131927 |access-date= 26 January 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206104008/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%203004.html |archive-date= 6 December 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref> At the same time, the [[Italian Navy]] (''Marina Militare'') was also considering the replacement of its fleet of Sea Kings, which had been built by the Italian company [[Agusta]]; Westland and Agusta soon began talks regarding the joint development of a successor helicopter.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.defense-aerospace.com/cgi-bin/client/modele.pl?prod=19144&shop=dae&modele=feature |title= Agusta, Westland and Europe |first= Giovanni de |last= Briganti |publisher= defense-aerospace.com |accessdate= 5 February 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110929030811/http://www.defense-aerospace.com/cgi-bin/client/modele.pl?prod=19144&shop=dae&modele=feature |archive-date= 29 September 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nAgusta and Westland finalised an agreement to work on the project together, and formed a jointly owned new company, EH Industries Limited (EHI), to pursue the development and marketing of the new helicopter to potential operators.

First flown in 1987, it was developed by a joint venture between [[Westland Helicopters]] in the United Kingdom and [[Agusta]] in Italy in response to national requirements for a modern naval utility helicopter. Several operators, including the armed forces of Britain, Denmark, and Portugal, use the name '''Merlin''' for their AW101 aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.emfa.pt/www/aeronavesdetalhe.php?lang=ing&cod=eh101 |title= EH-101 Merlin factsheet |publisher= Portuguese Air Force |accessdate= 5 February 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090620003601/http://www.emfa.pt/www/aeronavesdetalhe.php?lang=ing&cod=eh101 |archive-date= 20 June 2009 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://forsvaret.dk/FTK/Factsheets/ |title= Danish Airforce factsheet |publisher= Danish Airforce |accessdate=5 February 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080618040906/http://forsvaret.dk/FTK/Factsheets/|archivedate=18 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It is manufactured at factories in [[Yeovil]], England and [[Vergiate]], Italy; licensed assembly work has also taken place in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].\n\nPrior to 2007, the aircraft had been marketed under the designation '''EH101'''. The original designation was, in fact, EHI 01, from the name given to the Anglo-Italian joint venture \u2013 European Helicopter Industries \u2013 but a transcription error changed this to EH101 and the designation stuck.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=D.

The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) operates a variant of the AW101, designated [[CH-149 Cormorant]], in the [[air-sea rescue]] role. Another variant, designated [[VH-71 Kestrel]], was being developed to serve in the [[Marine One|US presidential transport fleet]] before the program was cancelled. Civil operators also use AW101s in roles such as passenger and VIP transportation. The type has been deployed to active combat theatres, such as in support of coalition forces during the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nIn 1977, the [[British Ministry of Defence|UK Ministry of Defence]] issued a requirement for an [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) helicopter to replace the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Westland Sea King]]s, which were becoming inadequate in the face of advances in [[Soviet Navy#Submarines|Soviet submarine]] technology. [[Westland Helicopters]] put together a proposal, designated '''WG.34''', for a three-engined helicopter of similar dimensions to the Sea King; the WG.34 was to feature more autonomy and a greater range than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1978/1978%20-%203004.html |title= Royal Navy keeps its wings |work= Flight International |date= 25 November 1978 |pages= 1926\u20131927 |access-date= 26 January 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206104008/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%203004.html |archive-date= 6 December 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref> At the same time, the [[Italian Navy]] (''Marina Militare'') was also considering the replacement of its fleet of Sea Kings, which had been built by the Italian company [[Agusta]]; Westland and Agusta soon began talks regarding the joint development of a successor helicopter.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.defense-aerospace.com/cgi-bin/client/modele.pl?prod=19144&shop=dae&modele=feature |title= Agusta, Westland and Europe |first= Giovanni de |last= Briganti |publisher= defense-aerospace.com |accessdate= 5 February 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110929030811/http://www.defense-aerospace.com/cgi-bin/client/modele.pl?prod=19144&shop=dae&modele=feature |archive-date= 29 September 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nAgusta and Westland finalised an agreement to work on the project together, and formed a jointly owned new company, EH Industries Limited (EHI), to pursue the development and marketing of the new helicopter to potential operators.
