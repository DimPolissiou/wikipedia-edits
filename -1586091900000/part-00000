{"title_page": "British colonisation of South Australia", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n{{use Australian English|date=November 2019}}\n'''British colonisation of South Australia''' describes the planning and establishment of the colony of South Australia by the British government, covering the period from 1829, when the idea was raised by the then imprisoned [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]], to 1842, when the ''[[South Australia Act 1842]]'' changed the form of government to a [[Crown colony]].\n\nIdeas espoused and promulgated by Wakefield since 1829 led to the formation of the '''South Australian Land Company''' ('''SALC''') in 1831,  but this first attempt failed to achieve its goals and the company folded. \n\nThe [[South Australian Association]] was formed in 1833 by Wakefield, [[Robert Gouger]] and other supporters, which put forward a proposal less radical than previous ones, which was finally supported and a Bill proposed in Parliament.\n\nThe '''British Province of South Australia''' was established by the ''[[South Australia Act 1834]]'' in August 1834, and the [[South Australian Company]] formed on 9 October 1835 to fulfil the purposes of the Act by forming a new colony financed by land sales. The first settlers arrived on [[Kangaroo Island]] in July 1836, with all of the ships later sailing north soon afterwards to anchor in [[Holdfast Bay]] on the advice of [[Surveyor General of South Australia|Surveyor-General]], [[Colonel William Light]]. The '''foundation of South Australia''' is usually considered to be the [[Proclamation_Day#South_Australia|Proclamation of the new Province]] by [[Governor Hindmarsh]]  at [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]] on 28 December 1836.\n\nHowever, after the government under the Colonisation Commission set up by the 1834 Act failed to achieve financial self-sufficiency, the ''South Australia Act 1842'' was passed in July 1842, repealing the earlier Act, making South Australia a [[Crown colony]], providing for the formation of an appointed [[Legislative Assembly]] and passing greater powers to the [[Governor of South Australia]] (then [[Sir George Grey]]).\n\n==Background==\nThe French [[Nicolas Baudin]] and the British [[Matthew Flinders]] had both done exploratory voyages around the central southern coastline, an area previously ignored by [[Captain Cook]] and others. The two explorers met at what is now [[Encounter Bay]] in South Australia on 8 April 1802, and each gave names to various places around [[Kangaroo Island]] and the two gulfs ([[Gulf of St Vincent]] and [[Spencer's Gulf]]). The British Government, not wanting to be pre-empted by the French, sent out new expeditions to [[Port Phillip]] and northern [[Tasmania]], and set up the first{{clarify|date=December 2019}} free settlement, the [[Swan River Colony]], in 1829.<ref name=dutton146>{{Cite book| last1=Dutton|first1=Geoffrey | title=Founder of a city: the life of Colonel William Light, first Surveyor-General of the colony of South Australia, founder of Adelaide, 1786-1839 | date=1984 | publisher=Rigby | edition=[New] | isbn=978-0-7270-1913-4|pp=146\u2013149 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Geoffrey Dutton]] suggests three clear phases in the foundation of the colony: first, the practical men, with their discoveries; second, the theorists, in particular Wakefield and Gouger (who had not seen Australia); and lastly the settlers, who had to marry fact with ideals.<ref name=dutton146/>\n\n==1829\u20131831==\n===Wakefield===\nInfluenced by prison reformer [[Elizabeth Fry]] while himself serving a term in prison for abduction of a minor, Wakefield turned his mind to social problems caused by [[over-population]]. In 1829, he wrote a series of anonymous \"Letters from Sydney\" to a [[London]] newspaper, ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'', in which he purported to write about his own experiences as a gentleman settler in [[New South Wales]] (completely fictitious), outlining his various ideas as a new theory of colonisation.<ref name=dutton146/> He proposed an \"Emigration Fund\" payable by landlords' taxes and land sales, which would fund labour for the colonies. Gouger, an enthusiastic supporter, published the letters as a book, edited by himself,<ref name=dutton146/> helping to distribute Wakefield's document.<ref name=samem>{{cite web|website=SA Memory|url=https://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=349&startRow=13|publisher=State Library of South Australia|title=Foundation of the Province|date=5 February 2015|access-date=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nWakefield saw the colonies as \"extensions of an old society\"; all classes would be represented among the settlers. In addition, the colonies would be more or less self-governing. His ideas were not original, but Wakefield was the one who synthesised a number of theories into one plan of systematic colonisation, and who spread the ideas among the British public and urged the [[Colonial Office]] to push forward with such a plan. After his release from gaol in 1830, he funded the National Colonization Society, with Gouger as secretary and a large number of enthusiastic members.<ref name=dutton146/> Wakefield's ideas caused much debate in the [[English parliament]].<ref name=samem/>\n\nAfter [[Charles Sturt]] \"discovered\" the [[River Murray]] in 1830, more interest in Wakefield's scheme followed. In 1831 a \"Proposal to His Majesty's Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia\" was prepared under the auspices of Gouger, [[Anthony Bacon (British Army officer)|Anthony Bacon]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]], but its ideas were considered too radical, and it was unable to attract the required investment.<ref name=samem/>\n===South Australian Land Company===\nAfter the failure of this proposal, Wakefield published his \"Plan of a company to be established for the purpose of founding a colony in Southern Australia, purchasing land therein and preparing the land so purchased for the Reception of Immigrants\", and the South Australian Land Company (SALC) was formed in 1831 to establish a new colony in the area of South Australia.<ref name=samem/> The SALC sought a [[Royal Charter]] for the purchase of land for colonisation, which would raise funding for the transport of immigrants, and for the governance of the new colony to be administered by the SALC. The company anticipated that the centre of government would be on [[Kangaroo Island]] or at [[Port Lincoln]] on the western side of [[Spencer Gulf]], based on reports from [[Matthew Flinders]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proposal to His Majesty's Government for Founding a Colony on the Southern Coast of Australia |author=South Australian Land Company |date=1831 |ol=20440157M }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | date=1831 | author=South Australian Land Company | title=Plan of a company to be established for the purpose of founding a colony in Southern Australia : purchasing land therein, and preparing the land so purchased for the reception of immigrants | publication-date=1831 | publisher=Ridgway and Sons | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6901870 | accessdate=21 December 2016 }}</ref> \n\nHowever, the scheme, which included free trade, self-government and the power to select the Governor, was not approved as these ideas were considered too radical and republican.<ref name=samem/>\n\n==1833 \u2014 1835==\n===South Australian Association (1833)===\n{{Main|South Australian Company}}\nIn 1833 the [[South Australian Association]] was established and began to lobby the government for the establishment of a colony in South Australia, with Crown-appointed governance.<ref name=foundation>{{cite web|website=SA Memory|url=https://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=349&startRow=13|publisher=State Library of South Australia|title=Foundation of the Province|date=5 February 2015|access-date=6 December 2019}}</ref>\n===''South Australia Act 1834''===\n{{Main|South Australia Act 1834}}\nThe South Australian Association succeeded in the passing on 15 August of the ''[[South Australia Act 1834]]'', which gave provision for the settlement as the Province of South Australia, for the sale of lands, and for funding of the venture, in addition to detailing the governance by the Colonization Commissioners for South Australia.<ref name=bound>{{cite web|url=http://boundforsouthaustralia.com.au/journey-content/south-australian-colonization-commission.html|website=Bound for South Australia|title=South Australian Colonization Commission|publisher=[[History Trust of South Australia]]|others=Creative Commons 3.0|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=foundation/> However, the Act gave control of the new colony to the Colonial Office as well as the Commissioners, which led to tension between the two and caused problems later.<ref name=dutton146/> On 5 May 1835 eleven commissioners were appointed to control sales of land and the administration of revenue.

Franklin withdrew in favour of Napier, but Napier quarrelled with the emigrants and made two requests (for access to [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] funds, and for troops to act as police) which were not met, and he resigned.<ref name=dutton149/>\n\nNapier favoured  Light as Governor; however, the ambitious [[John Hindmarsh]] had got wind of the forthcoming appointment, and set out first to see Napier, then woo some powerful supporters in London, including the [[Lords of the Admiralty]] before approaching the Colonial Secretary (Gouger).

The first settlers arrived on [[Kangaroo Island]] in July 1836, with all of the ships later sailing north soon afterwards to anchor in [[Holdfast Bay]] on the advice of [[Surveyor General of South Australia|Surveyor-General]], [[Colonel William Light]]. The '''foundation of South Australia''' is usually considered to be the [[Proclamation_Day#South_Australia|Proclamation of the new Province]] by [[Governor Hindmarsh]]  at [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]] on 28 December 1836.\n\nHowever, after the government under the Colonisation Commission set up by the 1834 Act failed to achieve financial self-sufficiency, the ''South Australia Act 1842'' was passed in July 1842, repealing the earlier Act, making South Australia a [[Crown colony]], providing for the formation of an appointed [[Legislative Assembly]] and passing greater powers to the [[Governor of South Australia]] (then [[Sir George Grey]]).\n\n==Background==\nThe French [[Nicolas Baudin]] and the British [[Matthew Flinders]] had both done exploratory voyages around the central southern coastline, an area previously ignored by [[Captain Cook]] and others. The two explorers met at what is now [[Encounter Bay]] in South Australia on 8 April 1802, and each gave names to various places around [[Kangaroo Island]] and the two gulfs ([[Gulf of St Vincent]] and [[Spencer's Gulf]]).

In addition, the colonies would be more or less self-governing. His ideas were not original, but Wakefield was the one who synthesised a number of theories into one plan of systematic colonisation, and who spread the ideas among the British public and urged the [[Colonial Office]] to push forward with such a plan.

Man-made climate change is real and by now we're experiencing the grave changes that it's bringing.

It was the third successive Kiss album to reach the top 40 in the US, as well as the first to chart in [[Germany]] and [[New Zealand]]. The album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on April 22, 1976, and platinum on November 11 of the same year, the first Kiss album to achieve platinum. The album marked a departure from the raw sound of the band's first three albums.{{certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=album|artist=Kiss|title=Destroyer}}\n\n==Album information==\nAfter attaining modest commercial success with their first three studio albums, Kiss achieved a commercial breakthrough with the 1975 concert album ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]''. It was the first album by the band to be certified gold.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 67\u201368.</ref> The success of ''Alive!'', which spent 110 weeks on the charts, benefited not only the struggling band but also their cash-strapped label [[Casablanca Records]].<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 178.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Kiss signed a new contract with Casablanca in late 1975, partly because the label had been very supportive from the start of the band's career. The contract was for two albums, an indication that Casablanca was unsure if the group could duplicate the accomplishments of ''Alive!''.<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 181.</ref>\n\n[[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked with [[Alice Cooper]], was brought in to produce the album.  Ezrin introduced to Kiss  sound effects, strings, screaming children, reversed drums (on \"God of Thunder\") and a children's choir. The song \"Great Expectations\" uses the first phrase of the main theme from the second movement of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13]] (known as ''Sonata Path\u00e9tique''), but songwriting is credited to Simmons and Ezrin.\n\n''Destroyer'' is the first Kiss album to prominently feature outside musicians, such as members of the [[New York Philharmonic]]. One musician not credited was [[Dick Wagner]], from Alice Cooper's band, replacing [[Ace Frehley]] on the track \"Sweet Pain\". Wagner also played the acoustic guitar found on the song \"Beth\".<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask''</ref> The success of ''Alive!'' and ''Destroyer'' enabled the band to embark on their first tour of [[Europe]].\n\n==Production==\n{{listen\n | filename     = KISS Beth.ogg\n | title        = \"Beth\"\n | description  = \"Beth\" marked a musical departure for Kiss, with its heavy use of an orchestra section.

The band felt that Bob Ezrin was the right person to help them take their sound to the next level and to maintain the commercial success they had achieved with ''Alive!''<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\nThe first recording sessions for the album took place in September 3\u20136, 1975 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]], during a brief break between the ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' and ''Alive!'' tours. The basic album tracks were recorded during this time.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 64.</ref> The majority of the recording sessions for ''Destroyer'' took place in January 1976, after the conclusion of the ''Alive!'' tour.<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe first [[Demo (music)|demo]] recorded during the ''Destroyer'' sessions was \"Ain't None of Your Business\"<ref>http://www.kissfaq.com/multimedia/audio/noneofyourbusiness.mp3</ref> featuring [[Peter Criss]] on vocals. The plodding, heavy song, written by [[country music|country]] songwriters Becky Hobbs and Lew Anderson, was rejected by the band and later appeared on the 1977 debut album by [[Michael Des Barres]]' band [[Detective (band)|Detective]]. Although this song was rejected, other outside songs and suggestions were accepted by the band. In particular, [[Kim Fowley]] and Mark Anthony became important contributors during the songwriting process.,<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', pp. 185\u2013189.</ref> bringing in the title and basic structure of the song \"King of the Night Time World\" from their previous band Hollywood Stars' then-unreleased 1974 album ''Shine Like a Radio'' (which also featured the original version of the [[Alice Cooper]] song \"Escape\" from ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightintheattic.net/releases/978-shine-like-a-radio-the-great-lost-1974-album |title=Shine Like A Radio: The Great Lost 1974 Album &#124; Light In The Attic Records |publisher=Lightintheattic.net |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}</ref>\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Ezrin resorted to numerous tactics designed to increase the quality of music Kiss recorded. Because none of the group were trained musicians, Ezrin halted the sessions at one point to provide lessons in basic [[music theory]].<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  pp. 253\u2013254.</ref> In an effort to instill a sense of discipline, he wore a whistle around his neck and exhorted the band with sayings such as, \"Campers, we're going to work!\".<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  p. 255.</ref> When Simmons stopped playing during the recording of an [[Conclusion (music)|outro]], Ezrin yelled at him, saying, \"Don't you ever stop a take unless I tell you!\"<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  p. 256.</ref>\n\n[[Paul Stanley]] later compared the experience of working with Ezrin as \"musical [[Recruit training|boot camp]]\" but said that the group \"came out a lot smarter for it.\"<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  p. 252.</ref> Simmons echoed the sentiment by stating, \"It was exactly what we needed at the time.\"<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 188.</ref>\n\n==Album artwork==\nThe cover art for ''Destroyer'' was painted by fantasy artist [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]]. Kelly was invited to a show and given a [[backstage pass]]. He said of the performance, \"It blew me away.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloud9recording.com/pages/kenkelly.html |title=Ken Kelly & Kiss |accessdate=2007-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213219/http://www.cloud9recording.com/pages/kenkelly.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Kelly was later commissioned by the band to draw the cover for 1977's ''[[Love Gun]]''.\n\nKelly's original version of the album cover was rejected by the record company because they felt the scene was too violent looking with the rubble and flames. Also, the original version had the members of Kiss wearing the ''Alive!'' costumes. The front cover shows the group striding on top of a pile of rubble, and a desolate background spotted with destroyed buildings, some of which are engulfed in flames. The back cover shows a similar scene, but with more buildings on fire. The front of the inner sleeve featured a large Kiss logo and the lyrics to \"Detroit Rock City\". The other side displayed the lyric \"SHOUT IT OUT LOUD\", as well as an advertisement for the [[Kiss Army]] fan club.\n\n==''Destroyer: Resurrected''==\nIn anticipation of the 35th anniversary of the release of ''Destroyer'', producer Bob Ezrin approached Simmons and Stanley about doing a remix and re-release of the original album. With their approval, Ezrin acquired the original 16-track analog master tapes and had them digitally transferred for remixing. In addition to re-equalizing elements of each song, Ezrin also added in some parts of tracks that had been omitted from the original mix. These include some additional vocals on \"Detroit Rock City\" and \"Beth\", and the substitution of a guitar solo by Frehley on \"Sweet Pain\" for the one from the original that had been performed by Wagner (a version of \"Sweet Pain\" with Frehley's solo was included as track 6, while the original version with Wagner's solo is appended as a \"bonus\" track at the end of the new CD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kissfaq.com/discography/resurrected.html |title=Discography \u2013 \"Destroyer: Resurrected\" (2012) |publisher=The KissFAQ |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref> Ezrin also used digital manipulation to fix an incorrect lyric (changing \"down 95\" to \"doin' 95\") on \"Detroit Rock City\". The resulting album, titled ''Destroyer: Resurrected'', was released on August 21, 2012.<ref name=\"Destroyer Deluxe Edition Release Date\">{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-destroyer-deluxe-edition-august-21-release/ |title=KISS' 'Destroyer' Deluxe Edition Set for August 21 Release |accessdate=July 8, 2012 |publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock |year=2012 }}</ref> It featured Ken Kelly's original cover artwork prior to alteration by Casablanca for the 1976 release.\n\n''Destroyer: Resurrected'' met with mixed critical reception.

It was the third successive Kiss album to reach the top 40 in the US, as well as the first to chart in [[Germany]] and [[New Zealand]]. The album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on April 22, 1976, and platinum on November 11 of the same year, the first Kiss album to achieve platinum. The album marked a departure from the raw sound of the band's first three albums.{{certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=album|artist=Kiss|title=Destroyer}}\n\n==Album information==\nAfter attaining modest commercial success with their first three studio albums, Kiss achieved a commercial breakthrough with the 1975 concert album ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]''. It was the first album by the band to be certified gold.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 67\u201368.</ref> The success of ''Alive!'', which spent 110 weeks on the charts, benefited not only the struggling band but also their cash-strapped label [[Casablanca Records]].<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 178.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Kiss signed a new contract with Casablanca in late 1975, partly because the label had been very supportive from the start of the band's career. The contract was for two albums, an indication that Casablanca was unsure if the group could duplicate the accomplishments of ''Alive!''.<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 181.</ref>\n\n[[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked with [[Alice Cooper]], was brought in to produce the album.  Ezrin introduced to Kiss  sound effects, strings, screaming children, reversed drums (on \"God of Thunder\") and a children's choir. The song \"Great Expectations\" uses the first phrase of the main theme from the second movement of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13]] (known as ''Sonata Path\u00e9tique''), but songwriting is credited to Simmons and Ezrin.\n\n''Destroyer'' is the first Kiss album to prominently feature outside musicians, such as members of the [[New York Philharmonic]]. One musician not credited was [[Dick Wagner]], from Alice Cooper's band, replacing [[Ace Frehley]] on the track \"Sweet Pain\".

The band felt that Bob Ezrin was the right person to help them take their sound to the next level and to maintain the commercial success they had achieved with ''Alive!''<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\nThe first recording sessions for the album took place in September 3\u20136, 1975 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]], during a brief break between the ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' and ''Alive!'' tours. The basic album tracks were recorded during this time.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 64.</ref> The majority of the recording sessions for ''Destroyer'' took place in January 1976, after the conclusion of the ''Alive!'' tour.<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe first [[Demo (music)|demo]] recorded during the ''Destroyer'' sessions was \"Ain't None of Your Business\"<ref>http://www.kissfaq.com/multimedia/audio/noneofyourbusiness.mp3</ref> featuring [[Peter Criss]] on vocals. The plodding, heavy song, written by [[country music|country]] songwriters Becky Hobbs and Lew Anderson, was rejected by the band and later appeared on the 1977 debut album by [[Michael Des Barres]]' band [[Detective (band)|Detective]]. Although this song was rejected, other outside songs and suggestions were accepted by the band. In particular, [[Kim Fowley]] and Mark Anthony became important contributors during the songwriting process.,<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', pp. 185\u2013189.</ref> bringing in the title and basic structure of the song \"King of the Night Time World\" from their previous band Hollywood Stars' then-unreleased 1974 album ''Shine Like a Radio'' (which also featured the original version of the [[Alice Cooper]] song \"Escape\" from ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lightintheattic.net/releases/978-shine-like-a-radio-the-great-lost-1974-album |title=Shine Like A Radio: The Great Lost 1974 Album &#124; Light In The Attic Records |publisher=Lightintheattic.net |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}</ref>\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Ezrin resorted to numerous tactics designed to increase the quality of music Kiss recorded. Because none of the group were trained musicians, Ezrin halted the sessions at one point to provide lessons in basic [[music theory]].<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  pp. 253\u2013254.</ref> In an effort to instill a sense of discipline, he wore a whistle around his neck and exhorted the band with sayings such as, \"Campers, we're going to work!\".<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  p. 255.</ref> When Simmons stopped playing during the recording of an [[Conclusion (music)|outro]], Ezrin yelled at him, saying, \"Don't you ever stop a take unless I tell you!\"<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  p. 256.</ref>\n\n[[Paul Stanley]] later compared the experience of working with Ezrin as \"musical [[Recruit training|boot camp]]\" but said that the group \"came out a lot smarter for it.\"<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'',  p. 252.</ref> Simmons echoed the sentiment by stating, \"It was exactly what we needed at the time.\"<ref>Gill, ''Kiss Album Focus'', p. 188.</ref>\n\n==Album artwork==\nThe cover art for ''Destroyer'' was painted by fantasy artist [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]]. Kelly was invited to a show and given a [[backstage pass]]. He said of the performance, \"It blew me away.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloud9recording.com/pages/kenkelly.html |title=Ken Kelly & Kiss |accessdate=2007-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213219/http://www.cloud9recording.com/pages/kenkelly.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Kelly was later commissioned by the band to draw the cover for 1977's ''[[Love Gun]]''.\n\nKelly's original version of the album cover was rejected by the record company because they felt the scene was too violent looking with the rubble and flames. Also, the original version had the members of Kiss wearing the ''Alive!'' costumes. The front cover shows the group striding on top of a pile of rubble, and a desolate background spotted with destroyed buildings, some of which are engulfed in flames. The back cover shows a similar scene, but with more buildings on fire. The front of the inner sleeve featured a large Kiss logo and the lyrics to \"Detroit Rock City\". The other side displayed the lyric \"SHOUT IT OUT LOUD\", as well as an advertisement for the [[Kiss Army]] fan club.\n\n==''Destroyer: Resurrected''==\nIn anticipation of the 35th anniversary of the release of ''Destroyer'', producer Bob Ezrin approached Simmons and Stanley about doing a remix and re-release of the original album. With their approval, Ezrin acquired the original 16-track analog master tapes and had them digitally transferred for remixing. In addition to re-equalizing elements of each song, Ezrin also added in some parts of tracks that had been omitted from the original mix. These include some additional vocals on \"Detroit Rock City\" and \"Beth\", and the substitution of a guitar solo by Frehley on \"Sweet Pain\" for the one from the original that had been performed by Wagner (a version of \"Sweet Pain\" with Frehley's solo was included as track 6, while the original version with Wagner's solo is appended as a \"bonus\" track at the end of the new CD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kissfaq.com/discography/resurrected.html |title=Discography \u2013 \"Destroyer: Resurrected\" (2012) |publisher=The KissFAQ |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref> Ezrin also used digital manipulation to fix an incorrect lyric (changing \"down 95\" to \"doin' 95\") on \"Detroit Rock City\".

She is currently signed to [[WWE]] on the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand under the [[ring name]] '''Becky Lynch''', where she is the current [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Champion]] in her first reign and the longest reigning champion.\n\nQuin began training as a professional wrestler in June 2002. Initially working in Ireland, and occasionally [[Tag team|teaming]] with her brother using the ring name '''Rebecca Knox''', she soon expanded her career into the rest of Europe and North America on the [[independent circuit]], wrestling regularly for various promotions. She most notably competed in [[Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling]] and became the inaugural [[ECCW Women's Championship|SuperGirls Champion]] in June 2005.\n\nIn September 2006, Quin suffered a severe head injury during a match which kept her away from professional wrestling for several years. She returned in late 2012 and signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2013, reporting to the [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. Following her arrival on WWE's main roster, she became the inaugural [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Champion]] at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash 2016]] and has held the title a total of [[List of WWE SmackDown Women's Champions|three times]].\n\nIn 2018, Lynch transitioned towards a more aggressive character, which started at [[SummerSlam (2018)|SummerSlam]] when she attacked [[Charlotte Flair]], perceiving herself as an unfairly-treated [[underdog]] and dubbing herself \"The Man\", resulting in a large increase in her popularity and fan support. In January 2019, she won the women's [[Royal Rumble (2019)|Royal Rumble match]]. At [[WrestleMania 35]], in what was the first time women headlined a [[WrestleMania]] event, Lynch won both the Raw Women's Championship and SmackDown Women's Championship, making her a double champion and the only woman to hold both titles simultaneously. She is now a four-time women's champion in WWE.\n\n==Early life==\nRebecca Quin<ref name=\"espn mcGregor\">{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Brian|url=http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/17619566/wwe-superstar-becky-lynch-talks-conor-mcgregor-cm-punk-cheap-heat-podcast|title=WWE's Becky Lynch: McGregor knows what he's doing|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=23 December 2018|website=[[ESPN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224073751/http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/17619566/wwe-superstar-becky-lynch-talks-conor-mcgregor-cm-punk-cheap-heat-podcast|archive-date=24 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> was born in [[Limerick]] on 30 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173527/wwe-profile-page-becky-lynch|title=WWE Profile \u2013 Becky Lynch|date=18 December 2018|accessdate=23 December 2018|website=[[ESPN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224024149/http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173527/wwe-profile-page-becky-lynch|archive-date=24 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She grew up in the [[Dublin]] suburb of [[Baldoyle]].<ref name=\"IT_Apri_ 2019\">{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=Amy |title=Becky Lynch, the girl from Baldoyle who has become a wrestling superstar |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/becky-lynch-the-girl-from-baldoyle-who-has-become-a-wrestling-superstar-1.3840173 |accessdate=10 April 2019 |work=The Irish Times |date=6 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408213224/https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/becky-lynch-the-girl-from-baldoyle-who-has-become-a-wrestling-superstar-1.3840173 |archive-date=8 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=BeckyLynchWWE|last=Lynch|first=Becky|number=598303787674112001|title=@SFulton_WWE I thought today was the day everyone talked about how great I am because I was born in Limerick, you mean I have to talk too?|date=13 May 2015|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite podcast|host=[[Lilian Garcia|Garcia, Lilian]]|title=Becky Lynch Interview {{!}} AfterBuzz TV's Lilian Garcia: Making Their Way to The Ring|publisher=[[AfterBuzz TV]]|website=[[YouTube]]|date=20 March 2017|time=13:00 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO_0dnhw1Nc|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> Her parents separated when she was one year old.<ref>{{cite podcast|host=[[Lilian Garcia|Garcia, Lilian]]|title=Becky Lynch Interview {{!}} AfterBuzz TV's Lilian Garcia: Making Their Way to The Ring|publisher=[[AfterBuzz TV]]|website=[[YouTube]]|date=20 March 2017|time=05:34 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO_0dnhw1Nc|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> She started watching professional wrestling from a young age with her brother, Richy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.totallydublin.ie/more/features-more/queen-of-the-ring-becky-lynch-interview/|title=Queen of the Ring: Becky Lynch interview|last=Hyland|first=John|date=31 March 2016|website=Totally Dublin|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418233535/http://www.totallydublin.ie/more/features-more/queen-of-the-ring-becky-lynch-interview/|archive-date=18 April 2018|url-status=live|access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref> who later wrestled under the ring name Gonzo de Mondo.<ref name=\"slammin\"/><ref name=\"ls\"/> She was involved in horse riding, swimming, and basketball.<ref name=\"ls\"/> However, she claimed to have failed [[Physical education|P.E]]. in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2015/10/becky-lynch-on-who-the-best-wrestler-in-the-world-is-602720/|title=Becky Lynch On Who The Best Wrestler In The World Is, Her Look, Sara Del Ray's Influence, More|last=Windsor|first=William|date=15 October 2015|website=Wrestling Inc.|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229031238/https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2015/10/becky-lynch-on-who-the-best-wrestler-in-the-world-is-602720/|archive-date=29 December 2018|url-status=live|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nQuin attended university to study philosophy, history and politics, but said she 'really hated it' and dropped out.<ref name=\"ls\"/><ref name=\"Glory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glorywrestling.com/gg/RebeccaKnox/RK.asp|title=Rebecca Knox|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=G.L.O.R.Y.

She is currently signed to [[WWE]] on the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand under the [[ring name]] '''Becky Lynch''', where she is the current [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Champion]] in her first reign and the longest reigning champion.\n\nQuin began training as a professional wrestler in June 2002. Initially working in Ireland, and occasionally [[Tag team|teaming]] with her brother using the ring name '''Rebecca Knox''', she soon expanded her career into the rest of Europe and North America on the [[independent circuit]], wrestling regularly for various promotions. She most notably competed in [[Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling]] and became the inaugural [[ECCW Women's Championship|SuperGirls Champion]] in June 2005.\n\nIn September 2006, Quin suffered a severe head injury during a match which kept her away from professional wrestling for several years. She returned in late 2012 and signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2013, reporting to the [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. Following her arrival on WWE's main roster in 2015, she became the inaugural [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Champion]] at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash 2016]] and has held the title a total of [[List of WWE SmackDown Women's Champions|three times]].\n\nIn 2018, Lynch transitioned towards a more aggressive character, which started at [[SummerSlam (2018)|SummerSlam]] when she attacked [[Charlotte Flair]], perceiving herself as an unfairly-treated [[underdog]] and dubbing herself \"The Man\", resulting in a large increase in her popularity and fan support. In January 2019, she won the women's [[Royal Rumble (2019)|Royal Rumble match]]. At [[WrestleMania 35]], in what was the first time women headlined a [[WrestleMania]] event, Lynch won both the Raw Women's Championship and SmackDown Women's Championship, making her a double champion and the only woman to hold both titles simultaneously. She is now a four-time women's champion in WWE.\n\n==Early life==\nRebecca Quin<ref name=\"espn mcGregor\">{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Brian|url=http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/17619566/wwe-superstar-becky-lynch-talks-conor-mcgregor-cm-punk-cheap-heat-podcast|title=WWE's Becky Lynch: McGregor knows what he's doing|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=23 December 2018|website=[[ESPN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224073751/http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/17619566/wwe-superstar-becky-lynch-talks-conor-mcgregor-cm-punk-cheap-heat-podcast|archive-date=24 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> was born in [[Limerick]] on 30 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173527/wwe-profile-page-becky-lynch|title=WWE Profile \u2013 Becky Lynch|date=18 December 2018|accessdate=23 December 2018|website=[[ESPN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224024149/http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17173527/wwe-profile-page-becky-lynch|archive-date=24 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She grew up in the [[Dublin]] suburb of [[Baldoyle]].<ref name=\"IT_Apri_ 2019\">{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=Amy |title=Becky Lynch, the girl from Baldoyle who has become a wrestling superstar |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/becky-lynch-the-girl-from-baldoyle-who-has-become-a-wrestling-superstar-1.3840173 |accessdate=10 April 2019 |work=The Irish Times |date=6 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408213224/https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/becky-lynch-the-girl-from-baldoyle-who-has-become-a-wrestling-superstar-1.3840173 |archive-date=8 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=BeckyLynchWWE|last=Lynch|first=Becky|number=598303787674112001|title=@SFulton_WWE I thought today was the day everyone talked about how great I am because I was born in Limerick, you mean I have to talk too?|date=13 May 2015|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite podcast|host=[[Lilian Garcia|Garcia, Lilian]]|title=Becky Lynch Interview {{!}} AfterBuzz TV's Lilian Garcia: Making Their Way to The Ring|publisher=[[AfterBuzz TV]]|website=[[YouTube]]|date=20 March 2017|time=13:00 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO_0dnhw1Nc|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> Her parents separated when she was one year old.<ref>{{cite podcast|host=[[Lilian Garcia|Garcia, Lilian]]|title=Becky Lynch Interview {{!}} AfterBuzz TV's Lilian Garcia: Making Their Way to The Ring|publisher=[[AfterBuzz TV]]|website=[[YouTube]]|date=20 March 2017|time=05:34 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO_0dnhw1Nc|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> She started watching professional wrestling from a young age with her brother, Richy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.totallydublin.ie/more/features-more/queen-of-the-ring-becky-lynch-interview/|title=Queen of the Ring: Becky Lynch interview|last=Hyland|first=John|date=31 March 2016|website=Totally Dublin|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418233535/http://www.totallydublin.ie/more/features-more/queen-of-the-ring-becky-lynch-interview/|archive-date=18 April 2018|url-status=live|access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref> who later wrestled under the ring name Gonzo de Mondo.<ref name=\"slammin\"/><ref name=\"ls\"/> She was involved in horse riding, swimming, and basketball.<ref name=\"ls\"/> However, she claimed to have failed [[Physical education|P.E]]. in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2015/10/becky-lynch-on-who-the-best-wrestler-in-the-world-is-602720/|title=Becky Lynch On Who The Best Wrestler In The World Is, Her Look, Sara Del Ray's Influence, More|last=Windsor|first=William|date=15 October 2015|website=Wrestling Inc.|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229031238/https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2015/10/becky-lynch-on-who-the-best-wrestler-in-the-world-is-602720/|archive-date=29 December 2018|url-status=live|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nQuin attended university to study philosophy, history and politics, but said she 'really hated it' and dropped out.<ref name=\"ls\"/><ref name=\"Glory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glorywrestling.com/gg/RebeccaKnox/RK.asp|title=Rebecca Knox|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=G.L.O.R.Y.
