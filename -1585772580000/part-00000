In 1842, he created the title-role in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Nabucco]]'' at [[La Scala]], Milan.\n\n==Personal life==\nRonconi was born in Milan and had been taught to sing by his father, [[Domenico Ronconi]], who was a leading [[tenor]].\n\nHe married soprano Elguerra Giannoni on 8 October 1837 in [[Naples|Naples, Italy]]. By some accounts Giannoni had sung with some success at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] and at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in London.<ref>Maitland 1908, p. 134</ref>\nHowever, [[Harold Rosenthal]] has written: \"This lady, who failed on virtually every opera stage in Europe, was considered a good concert-room singer only, but so indispensable was her husband to any Italian company that willy-nilly she had to be engaged as well.\"<ref>Rosenthal 1958, p. 75</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Ronconi founded a school of singing at [[Granada]] in Spain and also accepted a professorial post at the [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]]. Ronconi died in [[Madrid]], aged 79.\n\n==Career in opera==\nHe made his operatic debut at [[Pavia]] in 1831, as Valdeburgo in [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[La straniera]]'', and went on to sing at the [[Teatro alla Scala]] and elsewhere in Italy.\n\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, he appeared in the first performances of seven operas by [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]: \n* 1833, as Cardenio in ''[[Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo]]'';\n* 1833, in the title role in ''[[Torquato Tasso]]'';\n* 1836, as Enrico in ''[[Il campanello]]'';\n* 1837, as Nello Dello Pietra in ''[[Pia de' Tolomei]]'';\n* 1838, as Corrado Waldorf in ''[[Maria de Rudenz]]'';\n* 1841, as Don Pedro in ''[[Maria Padilla]]''; and\n* 1843, as Enrico, Duke of Chevreuse, in ''[[Maria di Rohan]]''.\n\nIn 1842, Ronconi appeared for the first time in London, at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], performing the part of Henry Ashton in Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''. Ronconi's success with audiences outside Italy was immediate, and he continued to be one of the most popular and influential operatic artists in Europe until the early 1870s, when he retired. For instance, from 1847 and until 1866, he appeared at London's [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], in the second and third of the three theatres on that site (now known as the Royal Opera House.) Vienna heard him in 1843 and he sang in St Petersburg between 1850 and 1860 and New York City from 1866 to 1872.\n\n==Assessment==\nThe 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' offers the following assessment of Ronconi:\n<blockquote>His voice was neither extensive in compass nor fine in quality, but the genius of his acting and the strength of his personality atoned for his vocal defects. He was equally at home in comedy and tragedy, and the two parts by which he is best remembered, Rigoletto and Figaro, show conclusively the range of his talent. \n</blockquote>\nThe two roles cited are the title character in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' and the central character of [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''.\n\nA large section is devoted to descriptions of Ronconi's powers in the critic [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]]'s ''Recollections'' of 1862.<ref>Chorley 1862, pp. 14\u201421</ref>\n\nRonconi instigated a long line of great Italian baritones that continued into modern times.

Singing in the duet \"Suoni la tromba\" in ''[[I Puritani]]'' on one occasion, Ronconi gave the words ''gridando libert\u00e0'' (\"crying Liberty!\") with such vigour and emphasis that the audience was excited to the pitch of frenzy, and a great commotion ensued. Next morning he received a reprimand for using the prohibited word, accompanied by a request to use the word ''lealt\u00e0'' (\"loyalty\") on future occasions in its stead. Shortly after, playing Il Sergente in ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' and in deference to the request for him to substitute ''perd\u00e8 la liberta'' (\"lost his freedom\") with ''perd\u00e8 la lealt\u00e0'' (\"lost his loyalty\"), the result was received with shrieks of laughter by the audience, to the great discomfiture of the advocates of \"loyalty\".<ref>Santley 1892, p. 80</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Ronconi, Giorgio|volume=23|page=689}}\n*Chorley, H.

The WRQK-FM studios are located in [[North Canton, Ohio|North Canton]], while the station transmitter resides in Canton.  In addition to a standard [[analog transmission]], WRQK-FM broadcasts over two [[HD Radio]] channels, and is available online via [[iHeartRadio]].\n\n==History==\nWRQK-FM began broadcasting as '''WCNO''' on March 1, 1961.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB-IDX/60s-OCR-YB/1965-YB/1965-BC-YB-for-OCR-Page-0280.pdf</ref>  The new station was owned by the Greer Group, also owner of [[WCER (AM)|WAND]]-[[Canton, Ohio|Canton]]; the two stations became WNYN and '''WNYN-FM''' in 1967.  Both stations were purchased in 1965 by Don Keyes, who had made his mark as a national programmer for legendary station owner [[Gordon McLendon]]. In 1971, he sold the FM station to [[Susquehanna Radio Corporation]], the owners of [[WHLO]] (AM) Akron, and it became '''WHLQ'''.\n\nSusquehanna sold the station in 1978 to the owners of WINW, who applied to change the FM call letters to WHOF (for the \"Hall of Fame\" city of Canton) but were rebuffed by the owners of WTOF, another local FM station. (Coincidentally, WRQK-FM now has a new Clear Channel sister station using the [[WHOF]] call letters.) 106.9 adopted an automated Top 40 format and became '''WOOS-FM''' on June 1, 1979.\n\nWOOS-FM changed its call sign to '''WRQK''' on August 3, 1985, taking on an [[album oriented rock]] music format.  For a while, the station called itself '''Goodrock 107''', an apparent play on the name of the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] in nearby [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. It formally changed from WRQK to '''WRQK-FM''' on February 14, 1989, when AM station [[WINW]] changed its call sign to WRQK. The AM station changed back to WINW six months later, but the FM call sign has remained WRQK-FM.\n\nIn 1995, the station was sold by Jim Embrescia's Canton/Akron Radio, Inc. to Sabre Communications. Then In 1997, SabreComm sold to Connoisseur.  Connoisseur sold their entire radio group to [[Cumulus]]. Then, on August 8, 2006, it was announced that WRQK-FM would be sold to [[Clear Channel Communications]], pairing WRQK-FM with former partner [[WHLO]], as well as [[WARF]], [[WKDD]], and [[WHOF]]. Clear Channel took over operations of WRQK-FM on January 15, 2007, pending FCC approval of its purchase of the station from Cumulus.\n\nIn March 2007, WRQK-FM changed its branding from '''Rock&nbsp;107''' to '''Rock&nbsp;106.9'''.

{"title_page": "Land recycling", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{tone|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\n'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.\n\nLand recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.\n\nSince many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.\n\n==Synonyms==\nOther commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:\n\n* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; \n* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and\n* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.\n\n== Types of Land Recycling  ==\n=== Building Reuse ===\nThe most common form of land recycling is the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties. \n\n'''Adaptive building'''\n\nAdaptive building is the development of an old abandoned building and repurposing it into a new building design. This is considered to be more environmentally sustainable by saving the old buildings and reusing the materials within the building.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conejos|first=Sheila|last2=Langston|first2=Craig|last3=Smith|first3=Jim|date=2015-01-01|title=Enhancing sustainability through designing for adaptive reuse from the outset: A comparison of adaptSTAR and Adaptive Reuse Potential (ARP) models|url=https://doi.org/10.1108/F-02-2013-0011|journal=Facilities|volume=33|issue=9/10|pages=531\u2013552|doi=10.1108/F-02-2013-0011|issn=0263-2772}}</ref> This could include wood, metals, roofing, brick, etc. It ensures that products that are valuable are not used and not created as excessive waste. Site disruptions are also decreased due to less destruction and building. Building reuse overall emits less pollutants into the air, which reduces the carbon footprint. It also reduces the amount of pollutants that can contaminate the soil and water around the abandoned building. Especially if the buildings you are repurposing are around other buildings like schools, neighborhoods, other workplaces, etc. By reducing the amount of deconstruction, you are also helping save the workers and the people around from health risks that can develop from such contaminants. This is also thought of to be more economic friendly, including direct and indirect cost savings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Laefer Debra F.|last2=Manke Jonathan P.|date=2008-03-01|title=Building Reuse Assessment for Sustainable Urban Reconstruction|url=https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:3(217)|journal=Journal of Construction Engineering and Management|volume=134|issue=3|pages=217\u2013227|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:3(217)}}</ref> The cost of producing new materials and the services that come with manufacturing these products comes out to cost way more money than it would by repurposing these buildings.\n\n=== Brownfields ===\nThe EPA classifies a brownfield as \"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields.\n\n=== Non-Infrastructure ===\nLand Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of Land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nThe US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.<ref>Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts\nGAO-05-94; December 2, 2004</ref> These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:\n\n* Social and economic [[revitalization]]\n* Sustainability\n* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]\n* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores\n* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Social and economic revitalization===\n\nLand recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.\n\nThe re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.\n\nBy putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.\n\n=== An alternative to sprawl ===\nLand recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.\n\nSprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.\n\nBy moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.\n\nRather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.\n\nLand recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.\n\n===Directing development to urban cores===\nRedirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.\n\n===Addressing climate change===\nLand recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent <ref>Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html|archivedate=2010-12-24|accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design Certification ===\n[[File:LEED Gold 2016 plaque, Serrano 55 Madrid (cropped).jpg|thumb|174x174px|LEED Gold Plaque in a Certified Building]]\n{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.\n\nLEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability. In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends.\n\n==Sustainability ==\n[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nLand recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.\n\nBy encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.\n[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.\n\n=== Sustainable Land Remediation and Planning ===\nLand development is an aspect of land recycling which involves urbanization and development of land, by reusing previously abandoned and unused land in commercial areas of larger cities.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cclr.org/3-benefits-land-recycling|title=3.

Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:\n\n* market factors\n* environmental-liability risks\n* uncertainty and cost\n* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements\n* difficulty in obtaining project financing\n* the lure of greenfields\n\n===Market factors===\nAs the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.\n\n====Greenfields competition====\nBrownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.\n\n===Brownfields===\nAs defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is \u201creal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\u201d. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n\n\n'''Brownfield Remediation''' \n\nBrownfield sites are not being repurposed or reused because of the amount of toxins left over from urban industrialization. These sites are can cause serious health risks to a large number of people. Since these sites have a high levels of land contamination, there is a high cost of remediation. Processes to reduce land contamination, either physical or chemical technologies can also cause more infectivity and loss of land function. Nature-based solutions is an idea being talked about to produce a more environmental space. Nature-based solutions can be looked at as policies and approaches to environmental issues that are in benefit to human health and biodiversity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Yinan|last2=Kirkwood|first2=Niall|last3=Maksimovi\u0107|first3=\u010cedo|last4=Zheng|first4=Xiaodi|last5=O'Connor|first5=David|last6=Jin|first6=Yuanliang|last7=Hou|first7=Deyi|date=2019-05-01|title=Nature based solutions for contaminated land remediation and brownfield redevelopment in cities: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719303985|journal=Science of The Total Environment|language=en|volume=663|pages=568\u2013579|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.347|issn=0048-9697}}</ref> These nature-based solutions promote environmentally friendly strategies instead of your regular industrial approaches that have climate hazards. An example would include developing a permeable green area, from these brownfield sites. Phytoremediation is another environmentally friendly approach for brownfield remediation. Phytoremediation programs reduce contaminants in the soil, water and air through planting different types of plants. Important metals that are harmful to human health such as Se, Zn, Ni and Fe are removed from this to contaminated soil through this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phytoremediation|title=Phytoremediation - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> These procedures are inexpensive because the plants rely on sunlight and the recycled nutrients in the ground.

Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.\n\n====Project financing====\nObtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Michael Allan|date=1997-1998|title=Dangerous Crossing: State Brownfields Recycling and Federal Enterprise Zoning|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdmev9&id=503&div=&collection=|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Journal|volume=9|pages=495}}</ref> Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.\n\n==== Environmental Justice ====\nThe concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination.\n\n===Environmental-liability risks===\nAlthough recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or \u201cmothball\u201d a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.\n\n====Regulatory requirements====\nThe potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.\n\n=== Gentrification ===\nBecause most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of gentrification. The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.\n\n== Global Land Recycling ==\n\n=== Developed Countries  ===\n\n==== Land Recycling in the EU ====\nAn in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trefzer|first=Annette|last2=Jackson|first2=Jeffrey T.|last3=McKee|first3=Kathryn|last4=Dellinger|first4=Kirsten|date=2014|title=Introduction: The Global South and/in the Global North: Interdisciplinary Investigations|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585671|journal=The Global South|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1\u201315|issn=1932-8656}}</ref> The general European focus looked at land use in the EU and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/land-recycling-in-europe|title=Land recycling in Europe|website=European Environment Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Beginning with research, a main database called Copernicus is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA).<ref name=\":0\" /> Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure.<ref name=\":0\" /> For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets.<ref name=\":0\" /> The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries.<ref name=\":0\" /> The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Land Development in Germany ====\nOn a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of land conversion specifically for settling and traffic to 30ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dillmann|first=Oliver|last2=Beckmann|first2=Volker|date=2018-12-12|title=Do Administrative Incentives for the Containment of Cities Work?

This program was established in 1995 and is also known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program. This program aims to set four main standards, the first is to set structured standards. This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dep.pa.gov:443/Business/Land/LandRecycling/Pages/default.aspx|title=Land Recycling Program|website=Department of Environmental Protection|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Ghirardelli Square ===\n[[Ghirardelli Square]] is in San Francisco, California and is the center of many examples of land recycling and building reuse.

End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.\n\nSince many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.\n\n==Synonyms==\nOther commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:\n\n* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; \n* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and\n* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.\n\n== Types of Land Recycling  ==\n=== Building Reuse ===\nThe most common form of land recycling is the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties. This involves\n\n=== Brownfields ===\nThe EPA classifies a brownfield as \"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields.\n\n=== Non-Infrastructure ===\nLand Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of Land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nThe US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.<ref>Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts\nGAO-05-94; December 2, 2004</ref> These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:\n\n* Social and economic [[revitalization]]\n* Sustainability\n* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]\n* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores\n* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Social and economic revitalization===\n\nLand recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.\n\nThe re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.\n\nBy putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.\n\n=== An alternative to sprawl ===\nLand recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.\n\nSprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.\n\nBy moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.\n\nRather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.\n\nLand recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.\n\n===Directing development to urban cores===\nRedirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.\n\n===Addressing climate change===\nLand recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent <ref>Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.

Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design Certification ===\n[[File:LEED Gold 2016 plaque, Serrano 55 Madrid (cropped).jpg|thumb|174x174px|LEED Gold Plaque in a Certified Building]]\n{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.\n\nLEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability. In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends.\n\n==Sustainability ==\n[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nLand recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.\n\nBy encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.\n[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption.

Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:\n\n* market factors\n* environmental-liability risks\n* uncertainty and cost\n* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements\n* difficulty in obtaining project financing\n* the lure of greenfields\n\n===Market factors===\nAs the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.\n\n====Greenfields competition====\nBrownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.\n\n===Brownfields===\nAs defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is \u201creal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\u201d. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n\n\n'''Brownfield Remediation''' \n\nBrownfield sites are not being repurposed or reused because of the amount of toxins left over from urban industrialization. These sites are can cause serious health risks to a large number of people. Since these sites have a high levels of land contamination, there is a high cost of remediation. Processes to reduce land contamination, either physical or chemical technologies can also cause more infectivity and loss of land function. Nature-based solutions is an idea being talked about to produce a more environmental space. Nature-based solutions can be looked at as policies and approaches to environmental issues that are in benefit to human health and biodiversity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Yinan|last2=Kirkwood|first2=Niall|last3=Maksimovi\u0107|first3=\u010cedo|last4=Zheng|first4=Xiaodi|last5=O'Connor|first5=David|last6=Jin|first6=Yuanliang|last7=Hou|first7=Deyi|date=2019-05-01|title=Nature based solutions for contaminated land remediation and brownfield redevelopment in cities: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719303985|journal=Science of The Total Environment|language=en|volume=663|pages=568\u2013579|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.347|issn=0048-9697}}</ref> These nature-based solutions promote environmentally friendly strategies instead of your regular industrial approaches that have climate hazards. An example would include developing a permeable green area, from these brownfield sites. Phytoremediation is another environmentally friendly approach for brownfield remediation. Phytoremediation programs reduce contaminants in the soil, water and air through planting different types of plants. Important metals that are harmful to human health such as Se, Zn, Ni and Fe are removed from this to contaminated soil through this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phytoremediation|title=Phytoremediation - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> These procedures are inexpensive because the plants rely on sunlight and the recycled nutrients in the ground. Although, phytoremediation cannot be used the same way in every destination due to different types of plants nurture differently in different types of environments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Westphal|first=Lynne M.|last2=Isebrands|first2=J.

Thermal treatment is used as a disposal option. Thermal treatment implicates the combustion of the waste materials through machines that produce high enough temperatures, which decomposes the organic molecules within the plant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/thermal-treatment|title=Thermal Treatment - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> This treatment is typically used in the residential and industrial scale, making it useful for brownfield sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kovacs|first=Helga|last2=Szemmelveisz|first2=Katalin|date=2017-01-01|title=Disposal options for polluted plants grown on heavy metal contaminated brownfield lands \u2013 A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653516312747|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=166|pages=8\u201320|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.076|issn=0045-6535}}</ref>\n\n====Uncertainty and costs====\nAssessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.\n\n====Project financing====\nObtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Michael Allan|date=1997-1998|title=Dangerous Crossing: State Brownfields Recycling and Federal Enterprise Zoning|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdmev9&id=503&div=&collection=|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Journal|volume=9|pages=495}}</ref> Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.\n\n==== Environmental Justice ====\nThe concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination.\n\n===Environmental-liability risks===\nAlthough recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or \u201cmothball\u201d a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.\n\n====Regulatory requirements====\nThe potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.\n\n=== Gentrification ===\nBecause most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of gentrification. The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.\n\n== Global Land Recycling ==\n\n=== Developed Countries  ===\n\n==== Land Recycling in the EU ====\nAn in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trefzer|first=Annette|last2=Jackson|first2=Jeffrey T.|last3=McKee|first3=Kathryn|last4=Dellinger|first4=Kirsten|date=2014|title=Introduction: The Global South and/in the Global North: Interdisciplinary Investigations|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585671|journal=The Global South|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1\u201315|issn=1932-8656}}</ref> The general European focus looked at land use in the EU and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/land-recycling-in-europe|title=Land recycling in Europe|website=European Environment Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Beginning with research, a main database called Copernicus is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA).<ref name=\":0\" /> Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure.<ref name=\":0\" /> For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets.<ref name=\":0\" /> The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries.<ref name=\":0\" /> The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Land Development in Germany ====\nOn a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of land conversion specifically for settling and traffic to 30ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dillmann|first=Oliver|last2=Beckmann|first2=Volker|date=2018-12-12|title=Do Administrative Incentives for the Containment of Cities Work?

This program was established in 1995 and is also known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program. This program aims to set four main standards, the first is to set structured standards. This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dep.pa.gov:443/Business/Land/LandRecycling/Pages/default.aspx|title=Land Recycling Program|website=Department of Environmental Protection|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Ghirardelli Square ===\n[[Ghirardelli Square]] is in San Francisco, California and is the center of many examples of land recycling and building reuse.

Retrieved 3 December 2018</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Types ==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n\nThere are two overall forms of synesthesia:\n* projective synesthesia: people who see actual colors, forms, or shapes when stimulated (the widely understood version of synesthesia).\n* associative synesthesia: people who feel a very strong and involuntary connection between the stimulus and the sense that it triggers.\nFor example, in [[chromesthesia]] (sound to color), a ''projector'' may hear a trumpet, and see an orange triangle in space, while an ''associator'' might hear a trumpet, and think very strongly that it sounds \"orange\". {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSynesthesia can occur between nearly any two senses or perceptual modes, and at least one synesthete, [[Solomon Shereshevsky]], experienced synesthesia that linked all five senses.{{mcn|date=January 2014}} Types of synesthesia are indicated by using the notation x \u2192 y, where x is the \"inducer\" or trigger experience, and y is the \"concurrent\" or additional experience. For example, perceiving letters and numbers (collectively called [[grapheme]]s) as colored would be indicated as grapheme \u2192 color synesthesia. Similarly, when synesthetes see colors and movement as a result of hearing musical tones, it would be indicated as tone \u2192 (color, movement) synesthesia.\n\nWhile nearly every logically possible combination of experiences can occur, several types are more common than others.\n\n=== Grapheme-color synesthesia ===\n{{Main|Grapheme-color synesthesia}}\n\n[[File:Number Form--colored.jpg|thumb|From the 2009 non-fiction book ''[[Wednesday Is Indigo Blue]]''.<ref name=\"Cytowic_Eagleman2009\" /> Note this example's upside-down clock face.]] In one of the most common forms of synesthesia, individual letters of the alphabet and numbers (collectively referred to as [[grapheme]]s) are \"shaded\" or \"tinged\" with a color. While different individuals usually do not report the same colors for all letters and numbers, studies with large numbers of synesthetes find some commonalities across letters (e.g. A is likely to be red).<ref name=\"isbn0-19-516623-X\"/>\n\n=== Chromesthesia ===\n{{Main|Chromesthesia}}\nAnother common form of synesthesia is the association of sounds with colors. For some, everyday sounds such as doors opening, cars honking, or people talking can trigger seeing colors. For others, colors are triggered when musical notes or keys are being played. People with synesthesia related to music may also have [[perfect pitch]] because their ability to see/hear colors aids them in identifying notes or keys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/robert-s-boas-center-for-genomics-and-human-genetics/projects/genetics-and-epidemiology-of-absolute-pitch-and-related-cognitive-traits/|title=Absolute Pitch and Synesthesia {{!}} The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research|website=The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-02}}</ref>\n\nThe colors triggered by certain sounds, and any other synesthetic visual experiences, are referred to as ''photisms''.\n\nAccording to [[Richard Cytowic]],<ref name=\"Cytowic_Eagleman2009\" /> chromesthesia is \"something like fireworks\": voice, music, and assorted environmental sounds such as clattering dishes or dog barks trigger color and firework shapes that arise, move around, and then fade when the sound ends. Sound often changes the perceived hue, brightness, scintillation, and directional movement. Some individuals see music on a \"screen\" in front of their faces. For Deni Simon, music produces waving lines \"like oscilloscope configurations \u2013 lines moving in color, often metallic with height, width and, most importantly, depth. My favorite music has lines that extend horizontally beyond the 'screen' area.\"\n\nIndividuals rarely agree on what color a given sound is. B flat might be orange for one person and blue for another. Composers [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] famously disagreed on the colors of musical keys.\n\n=== Spatial sequence synesthesia ===\n\nThose with spatial sequence synesthesia (SSS) tend to see numerical sequences as points in space. For instance, the number 1 might be farther away and the number 2 might be closer. People with SSS may have superior memories; in one study, they were able to recall past events and memories far better and in far greater detail than those without the condition. They also see months or dates in the space around them. Some people see time like a clock above and around them.{{MEDRS|date=January 2014}}<ref>{{MEDRS|date=January 2014}}[http://www.sciencemag.org/site/help/about/index.xhtml Do sequence-space synaesthetes have better spatial imagery skills?

These numbers might appear in different locations and the mapping changes and varies between individuals. Number forms were first documented and named in 1881 by [[Francis Galton]] in \"The Visions of Sane Persons\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seaton|first=Maureen|date=2013|title=The Visions of Sane Persons|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/plo.2013.0012|journal=Ploughshares|volume=39|issue=1|pages=144\u2013145|doi=10.1353/plo.2013.0012|issn=2162-0903}}</ref> It is suggested that this might be caused by \u201ccross activation\u201d of the neural pathway that connects the parietal lobes and angular gyrus.

For example, someone with auditory-tactile synesthesia may experience that hearing a specific word feels like touch in one specific part of the body or may experience that certain sounds can create a sensation in the skin without being touched. It is one of the least common forms of synesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Naumer MJ, van den Bosch JJ |title=Touching u: thalamocortical plasticity and the neural basis of multisensory integration |journal=J.

For example, the number 2 might be a young boy with a short temper, or the letter G might be a busy mother with a kind face. Although this form of synesthesia was documented as early as the 1890s ({{Harvnb|Flournoy|1893}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1893}}) researchers have, until recently, paid little attention to this form (see [[History of synesthesia research]]).  This form of synesthesia was named as OLP in the contemporary literature by Julia Simner and colleagues <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Variants of synesthesia interact in cognitive tasks: evidence for implicit associations and late connectivity in cross-talk theories|date=December 2006|pmid=16996695|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.08.018|volume=143|issue=3|vauthors=Simner J, Hubbard EM |journal=Neuroscience|pages=805\u201314}}</ref> although it is now also widely recognised by the term \"sequence-personality\" synesthesia.  Ordinal linguistic personification normally co-occurs with other forms of synesthesia such as [[grapheme-color synesthesia]].\n\n=== Misophonia ===\n{{Main|Misophonia}}\n[[Misophonia]] is a neurological disorder in which negative experiences (anger, fright, hatred, disgust) are triggered by specific sounds. Richard Cytowic suggests that misophonia is related to, or perhaps a variety of, synesthesia.<ref>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} Cytowic, Richard E. (2002).

For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap on their own shoulder as well. People with this type of synesthesia have been shown to have higher [[empathy]] levels compared to the general population. This may be related to the so-called [[mirror neuron]]s present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.<ref>Heyes, Cecelia. \"Where Do Mirror Neurons Come From?\" Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews (2009): 576\u201377.

Features appear similar to auditory-tactile synesthesia but sensations are not isolated to individual numbers or letters but complex systems of relationships. The result is the ability to memorize and model complex relationships between numerous variables by feeling physical sensations around the kinesthetic movement of related variables. Reports include feeling sensations in the hands or feet, coupled with visualizations of shapes or objects, when analyzing mathematical equations, physical systems, or music. In another case, a sufferer described seeing interactions between physical shapes causing sensations in the feet when solving a math problem. Generally, those with this type of synesthesia can memorize and visualize complicated systems, and with a high degree of accuracy, predict the results of changes to the system. Examples include predicting the results of computer simulations in subjects such as quantum mechanics or fluid dynamics when results are not naturally intuitive.<ref name=\"isbn0-19-516623-X\" /><ref name=\"dailey1997\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dailey A, Martindale C, Borkum J |title= Creativity, synesthesia, and physiognomic perception|journal=Creativity Research Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20138 |year=1997 |pmid= |doi= 10.1207/s15326934crj1001_1}}</ref>\n\n=== Other forms ===\nOther forms of synesthesia have been reported, but little has been done to analyze them scientifically. There are at least 80 different types of synesthesia.<ref name=\"Types-of-Syn\"/>\n\nIn August 2017 a research article in the journal ''[[Social Neuroscience]]'' reviewed studies with [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] to determine if persons who experience [[Autonomous sensory meridian response|Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response]] are experiencing a form of synesthesia. While a determination has not yet been made, there is anecdotal evidence that this may be the case, based on significant and consistent differences from the control group, in terms of functional connectivity within neural pathways. It is unclear whether this will lead to ASMR being included as a form of existing synesthesia, or if a new type will be considered.<ref>{{cite journal|title=An examination of the default mode network in individuals with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)|first1=Stephen D.|last1=Smith|first2=Beverley|last2=Katherine Fredborg|first3=Jennifer|last3=Kornelsen|journal=Social Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=4|pages=361\u2013365|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/17470919.2016.1188851|pmid=27196787|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nSome synesthetes often report that they were unaware their experiences were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives.<ref name=campen2007>{{page needed|date=January 2014}} {{cite book |first=Cretien |last=van Campen |title=The Hidden Sense: Synesthesia in Art and Science |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-22081-1 |oclc=80179991 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hiddensensesynes0000camp }}</ref> The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem out of the ordinary. This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience. Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their experiences can lead to a degree of [[sensory overload]].<ref name=\"isbn0-19-516623-X\" />\n\nThough often stereotyped in the popular media as a medical condition or neurological aberration, many synesthetes themselves do not perceive their synesthetic experiences as a handicap. To the contrary, some report it as a gift\u2014an additional \"hidden\" sense\u2014something they would not want to miss.

Thus, synesthesia may be fundamentally a [[semantic]] phenomenon. Therefore, to understand neural mechanisms of synesthesia the mechanisms of semantics and the extraction of meaning need to be understood better.

Each common type has a specific test. When testing for grapheme-color synesthesia a visual test is given. The person is shown a picture that includes black letters and numbers. A synesthete will associate the letters and numbers with a specific color. An auditory test is another way to test for synesthesia. A sound is turned on and one will either identify it with a taste, or envision shapes. The audio test correlates with chromesthesia (sounds with colors). Since people question whether or not synesthesia is tied to memory the \"retest\" is given. One is given a set of objects and is asked to assign colors, tastes, personalities, or more. After a period of time, the same objects are presented and the person is asked again to do the same task. The synesthete is able to assign the same characteristics, because that person has permanent neural associations in the brain, rather than memories of a certain object. The simplest approach is test-retest reliability over long periods of time, using stimuli of color names, color chips, or a computer-screen color picker providing 16.7&nbsp;million choices. Synesthetes consistently score around 90% on reliability of associations, even with years between tests.<ref name=\"isbn0-262-03296-1\" /> In contrast, non-synesthetes score just 30\u201340%, even with only a few weeks between tests and a warning that they would be retested.<ref name=\"isbn0-262-03296-1\" />\n[[File:synaesthesiatest.jpg|thumb|The automaticity of synesthetic experience.

Later research showed that such stark externalization occurs in a minority of synesthetes.

Retrieved 3 December 2018</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n\nThere are two overall forms of synesthesia:\n* projective synesthesia: people who see actual colors, forms, or shapes when stimulated (the widely understood version of synesthesia).\n* associative synesthesia: people who feel a very strong and involuntary connection between the stimulus and the sense that it triggers.\nFor example, in [[chromesthesia]] (sound to color), a ''projector'' may hear a trumpet, and see an orange triangle in space, while an ''associator'' might hear a trumpet, and think very strongly that it sounds \"orange\". {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSynesthesia can occur between nearly any two senses or perceptual modes, and at least one synesthete, [[Solomon Shereshevsky]], experienced synesthesia that linked all five senses.{{mcn|date=January 2014}} Types of synesthesia are indicated by using the notation x \u2192 y, where x is the \"inducer\" or trigger experience, and y is the \"concurrent\" or additional experience. For example, perceiving letters and numbers (collectively called [[grapheme]]s) as colored would be indicated as grapheme \u2192 color synesthesia. Similarly, when synesthetes see colors and movement as a result of hearing musical tones, it would be indicated as tone \u2192 (color, movement) synesthesia.\n\nWhile nearly every logically possible combination of experiences can occur, several types are more common than others.\n\n=== Grapheme-color synesthesia ===\n{{Main|Grapheme-color synesthesia}}\n\n[[File:Number Form--colored.jpg|thumb|From the 2009 non-fiction book ''[[Wednesday Is Indigo Blue]]''.<ref name=\"Cytowic_Eagleman2009\" /> Note this example's upside-down clock face.]] In one of the most common forms of synesthesia, individual letters of the alphabet and numbers (collectively referred to as [[grapheme]]s) are \"shaded\" or \"tinged\" with a color. While different individuals usually do not report the same colors for all letters and numbers, studies with large numbers of synesthetes find some commonalities across letters (e.g. A is likely to be red).<ref name=\"isbn0-19-516623-X\"/>\n\n=== Chromesthesia ===\n{{Main|Chromesthesia}}\nAnother common form of synesthesia is the association of sounds with colors. For some, everyday sounds such as doors opening, cars honking, or people talking can trigger seeing colors. For others, colors are triggered when musical notes or keys are being played. People with synesthesia related to music may also have [[perfect pitch]] because their ability to see/hear colors aids them in identifying notes or keys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/robert-s-boas-center-for-genomics-and-human-genetics/projects/genetics-and-epidemiology-of-absolute-pitch-and-related-cognitive-traits/|title=Absolute Pitch and Synesthesia {{!}} The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research|website=The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-02}}</ref>\n\nThe colors triggered by certain sounds, and any other synesthetic visual experiences, are referred to as ''photisms''.\n\nAccording to [[Richard Cytowic]],<ref name=\"Cytowic_Eagleman2009\" /> chromesthesia is \"something like fireworks\": voice, music, and assorted environmental sounds such as clattering dishes or dog barks trigger color and firework shapes that arise, move around, and then fade when the sound ends. Sound often changes the perceived hue, brightness, scintillation, and directional movement. Some individuals see music on a \"screen\" in front of their faces. For Deni Simon, music produces waving lines \"like oscilloscope configurations \u2013 lines moving in color, often metallic with height, width and, most importantly, depth. My favorite music has lines that extend horizontally beyond the 'screen' area.\"\n\nIndividuals rarely agree on what color a given sound is. B flat might be orange for one person and blue for another. Composers [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] famously disagreed on the colors of musical keys.\n\n=== Spatial sequence synesthesia ===\n\nThose with spatial sequence synesthesia (SSS) tend to see numerical sequences as points in space. For instance, the number 1 might be farther away and the number 2 might be closer. People with SSS may have superior memories; in one study, they were able to recall past events and memories far better and in far greater detail than those without the condition. They also see months or dates in the space around them. Some people see time like a clock above and around them.{{MEDRS|date=January 2014}}<ref>{{MEDRS|date=January 2014}}[http://www.sciencemag.org/site/help/about/index.xhtml Do sequence-space synaesthetes have better spatial imagery skills?

These numbers might appear in different locations and the mapping changes and varies between individuals. Number forms were first documented and named in 1881 by [[Francis Galton]] in \"The Visions of Sane Persons\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seaton|first=Maureen|date=2013|title=The Visions of Sane Persons|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/plo.2013.0012|journal=Ploughshares|volume=39|issue=1|pages=144\u2013145|doi=10.1353/plo.2013.0012|issn=2162-0903}}</ref> It is suggested that this might be caused by \u201ccross activation\u201d of the neural pathway that connects the parietal lobes and angular gyrus.

For example, someone with auditory-tactile synesthesia may experience that hearing a specific word feels like touch in one specific part of the body or may experience that certain sounds can create a sensation in the skin without being touched. It is one of the least common forms of synesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Naumer MJ, van den Bosch JJ |title=Touching u: thalamocortical plasticity and the neural basis of multisensory integration |journal=J.

For example, the number 2 might be a young boy with a short temper, or the letter G might be a busy mother with a kind face. Although this form of synesthesia was documented as early as the 1890s ({{Harvnb|Flournoy|1893}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1893}}) researchers have, until recently, paid little attention to this form (see [[History of synesthesia research]]).  This form of synesthesia was named as OLP in the contemporary literature by Julia Simner and colleagues <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Variants of synesthesia interact in cognitive tasks: evidence for implicit associations and late connectivity in cross-talk theories|date=December 2006|pmid=16996695|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.08.018|volume=143|issue=3|vauthors=Simner J, Hubbard EM |journal=Neuroscience|pages=805\u201314}}</ref> although it is now also widely recognised by the term \"sequence-personality\" synesthesia.  Ordinal linguistic personification normally co-occurs with other forms of synesthesia such as [[grapheme-color synesthesia]].\n\n=== Misophonia ===\n{{Main|Misophonia}}\n[[Misophonia]] is a neurological disorder in which negative experiences (anger, fright, hatred, disgust) are triggered by specific sounds.

Features appear similar to auditory-tactile synesthesia but sensations are not isolated to individual numbers or letters but complex systems of relationships. The result is the ability to memorize and model complex relationships between numerous variables by feeling physical sensations around the kinesthetic movement of related variables. Reports include feeling sensations in the hands or feet, coupled with visualizations of shapes or objects, when analyzing mathematical equations, physical systems, or music. In another case, a sufferer described seeing interactions between physical shapes causing sensations in the feet when solving a math problem. Generally, those with this type of synesthesia can memorize and visualize complicated systems, and with a high degree of accuracy, predict the results of changes to the system. Examples include predicting the results of computer simulations in subjects such as quantum mechanics or fluid dynamics when results are not naturally intuitive. <ref name=\"isbn0-19-516623-X\" /> <ref name=\"dailey1997\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dailey A, Martindale C, Borkum J |title= Creativity, synesthesia, and physiognomic perception|journal=Creativity Research Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20138 |year=1997 |pmid= |doi= 10.1207/s15326934crj1001_1}}</ref>\n\n=== Other forms ===\nOther forms of synesthesia have been reported, but little has been done to analyze them scientifically.

According to this account, synesthesia is a phenomenon mediated by the extraction of the [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] of the inducing stimulus. Thus, synesthesia may be fundamentally a [[semantic]] phenomenon. Therefore, to understand neural mechanisms of synesthesia the mechanisms of semantics and the extraction of meaning need to be understood better.

Each common type has a specific test. When testing for grapheme-color synesthesia a visual test is given. The person is shown a picture that includes black letters and numbers. A synesthete will associate the letters and numbers with a specific color. An auditory test is another way to test for synesthesia. A sound is turned on and one will either identify it with a taste, or envision shapes. The audio test correlates with chromesthesia (sounds with colors). Since people question whether or not synesthesia is tied to memory the \"retest\" is given. One is given a set of objects and is asked to assign colors, tastes, personalities, or more. After a period of time, the same objects are presented and the person is asked again to do the same task. The synesthete is able to assign the same characteristics, because that person has permanent neural associations in the brain, rather than memories of a certain object. The simplest approach is test-retest reliability over long periods of time, using stimuli of color names, color chips, or a computer-screen color picker providing 16.7&nbsp;million choices. Synesthetes consistently score around 90% on reliability of associations, even with years between tests.<ref name=\"isbn0-262-03296-1\" /> In contrast, non-synesthetes score just 30\u201340%, even with only a few weeks between tests and a warning that they would be retested.<ref name=\"isbn0-262-03296-1\" />\n[[File:synaesthesiatest.jpg|thumb|The automaticity of synesthetic experience.

Using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for [[cellulosic ethanol]] does. Additionally, the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|2007b|pp=note 9 at 143}} \"It can be mixed with manures or fertilizers and included in no-tillage methods, without the need for additional equipment.\"</ref>\n\n=== Water retention ===\n\nBiochar is [[hygroscopic]]. Thus it is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water. This is possible because of its [[porosity|porous structure]] and high [[specific surface area]].<ref>[https://www.agronomy.org/files/students/2010-ricigliano-entry.pdf Terra Pretas: Charcoal Amendments Influence on Relict Soils and Modern Agriculture]</ref> As a result, nutrients such as [[phosphate]], and [[agrochemical]]s are retained for the plants benefit.

He asserts that in [[ruminant]]s, biochar can assist digestion and reduce [[Methane#Ruminants|methane production]]. The farmer also uses [[dung beetle]]s to work the biochar infused dung down into the soil without using machinery.

[[Topsoil]]s from these 'black spots' had a higher organic C concentration [3.6 \u00b1 0.9% organic carbon (OC)] than adjacent soils outside these black spots (2.1 \u00b1 0.2% OC). The soils had been cropped with maize for at least 12 years which provided a continuous input of C with a C isotope signature (\u03b413C) \u221213.1, distinct from the \u03b413C of soil organic carbon (\u221227.4 \u2030) and charcoal (\u221225.7 \u2030) collected in the surrounding area. The isotope signatures in the soil revealed that maize-derived C concentration was significantly higher in charcoal-amended samples ('black spots') than in adjacent unamended ones (0.44% vs. 0.31%; P = 0.02). Topsoils were subsequently collected as a gradient across two 'black spots' along with corresponding adjacent soils outside these black spots and soil respiration, and physical soil fractionation was conducted. Total soil respiration (130 days) was unaffected by charcoal, but the maize-derived C respiration per unit maize-derived OC in soil significantly decreased about half (P < 0.02) with increasing charcoal-derived C in soil. Maize-derived C was proportionally present more in protected soil aggregates in the presence of charcoal. The lower specific mineralization and increased C sequestration of recent C with charcoal are attributed to a combination of physical protection, C saturation of microbial communities and, potentially, slightly higher annual primary production. Overall, this study provides evidence of the capacity of biochar to enhance C sequestration in soils through reduced C turnover on the long term. ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12250/full Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2015]).\n\nBiochar sequesters carbon (C) in soils because of its prolonged residence time, ranging from several years to millennia. In addition, biochar can promote indirect C-sequestration by increasing crop yield while, potentially, reducing C-mineralization. Laboratory studies have evidenced effects of biochar on C-mineralization using 13C isotope signatures. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715312614 (Kerre et al, 2016)]\n\nFluorescence analysis of the dissolved organic matter from soil amended with biochar revealed that biochar application increased a humic-like fluorescent component, likely associated with biochar-carbon in solution. The combined spectroscopy-microscopy approach revealed the accumulation of aromatic-carbon in discrete spots in the solid-phase of microaggregates and its co-localization with clay minerals for soil amended with raw residue or biochar. The co-localization of aromatic-C:polysaccharides-C was consistently reduced upon biochar application. These finding suggested that reduced C metabolism is an important mechanism for C stabilization in biochar-amended soils [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25127 (Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2016)]\n\nStudents at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in New Jersey are developing [[supercapacitor]]s that use electrodes made of biochar.<ref name=Supercapacitors>{{cite web\n  |title=A Cheaper, Greener Material for Supercapacitors\n  |url=http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2859:a-cheaper-greener-material-for-supercapacitors&catid=52:applications-tech-research&Itemid=247\n  |publisher=[[Stevens Institute of Technology]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=25 May 2011\n}}</ref> A process developed by [[University of Florida]] researchers that removes [[phosphate]] from water, also yields [[methane gas]] usable as fuel and phosphate-laden carbon suitable for enriching soil.<ref name=\"Removing Phosphate from Water\">{{cite web\n  |title=Biochar\" More Effective, Cheaper at Removing Phosphate from Water\n  |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2011/05/18/biochar-more-effective-cheaper-at-removing-phosphate-from-water.aspx\n  |publisher=[[University of Florida]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=18 May 2011\n}}</ref> \nResearchers at the University of Auckland are also working on utilizing biochar in concrete applications to reduce carbon emissions during concrete production and to improve the strength considerably.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akhtar | first1 = A. | last2 = Sarmah | first2 = A.

Using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for [[cellulosic ethanol]] does. Additionally, the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|2007b|pp=note 9 at 143}} \"It can be mixed with manures or fertilizers and included in no-tillage methods, without the need for additional equipment.\"</ref>\n\n=== Water retention ===\n\nBiochar is [[hygroscopic]]. Thus it is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water. This is possible because of its [[porosity|porous structure]] and high [[specific surface area]].<ref>[https://www.agronomy.org/files/students/2010-ricigliano-entry.pdf Terra Pretas: Charcoal Amendments Influence on Relict Soils and Modern Agriculture]</ref> As a result, nutrients such as [[phosphate]], and [[agrochemical]]s are retained for the plants benefit.

The farmer also uses [[dung beetle]]s to work the biochar infused dung down into the soil without using machinery. It is proposed that the nitrogen and carbon in the dung are both incorporated into the soil rather than staying on the soil surface, reducing the production of [[Nitrous oxide#Greenhouse effect|nitrous oxide]] and [[Carbon dioxide#In Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]], which are both greenhouse gasses. The nitrogen and carbon then both add to soil fertility.

[[Topsoil]]s from these 'black spots' had a higher organic C concentration [3.6 \u00b1 0.9% organic carbon (OC)] than adjacent soils outside these black spots (2.1 \u00b1 0.2% OC). The soils had been cropped with maize for at least 12 years which provided a continuous input of C with a C isotope signature (\u03b413C) \u221213.1, distinct from the \u03b413C of soil organic carbon (\u221227.4 \u2030) and charcoal (\u221225.7 \u2030) collected in the surrounding area. The isotope signatures in the soil revealed that maize-derived C concentration was significantly higher in charcoal-amended samples ('black spots') than in adjacent unamended ones (0.44% vs. 0.31%; P = 0.02). Topsoils were subsequently collected as a gradient across two 'black spots' along with corresponding adjacent soils outside these black spots and soil respiration, and physical soil fractionation was conducted. Total soil respiration (130 days) was unaffected by charcoal, but the maize-derived C respiration per unit maize-derived OC in soil significantly decreased about half (P < 0.02) with increasing charcoal-derived C in soil. Maize-derived C was proportionally present more in protected soil aggregates in the presence of charcoal. The lower specific mineralization and increased C sequestration of recent C with charcoal are attributed to a combination of physical protection, C saturation of microbial communities and, potentially, slightly higher annual primary production. Overall, this study provides evidence of the capacity of biochar to enhance C sequestration in soils through reduced C turnover on the long term. ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12250/full Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2015]).\n\nBiochar sequesters carbon (C) in soils because of its prolonged residence time, ranging from several years to millennia. In addition, biochar can promote indirect C-sequestration by increasing crop yield while, potentially, reducing C-mineralization. Laboratory studies have evidenced effects of biochar on C-mineralization using 13C isotope signatures. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715312614 (Kerre et al, 2016)]\n\nFluorescence analysis of the dissolved organic matter from soil amended with biochar revealed that biochar application increased a humic-like fluorescent component, likely associated with biochar-carbon in solution. The combined spectroscopy-microscopy approach revealed the accumulation of aromatic-carbon in discrete spots in the solid-phase of microaggregates and its co-localization with clay minerals for soil amended with raw residue or biochar. The co-localization of aromatic-C:polysaccharides-C was consistently reduced upon biochar application. These finding suggested that reduced C metabolism is an important mechanism for C stabilization in biochar-amended soils [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25127 (Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2016)]\n\nStudents at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in New Jersey are developing [[supercapacitor]]s that use electrodes made of biochar.<ref name=Supercapacitors>{{cite web\n  |title=A Cheaper, Greener Material for Supercapacitors\n  |url=http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2859:a-cheaper-greener-material-for-supercapacitors&catid=52:applications-tech-research&Itemid=247\n  |publisher=[[Stevens Institute of Technology]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=25 May 2011\n}}</ref> A process developed by [[University of Florida]] researchers that removes [[phosphate]] from water, also yields [[methane gas]] usable as fuel and phosphate-laden carbon suitable for enriching soil.<ref name=\"Removing Phosphate from Water\">{{cite web\n  |title=Biochar\" More Effective, Cheaper at Removing Phosphate from Water\n  |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2011/05/18/biochar-more-effective-cheaper-at-removing-phosphate-from-water.aspx\n  |publisher=[[University of Florida]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=18 May 2011\n}}</ref> \nResearchers at the University of Auckland are also working on utilizing biochar in concrete applications to reduce carbon emissions during concrete production and to improve the strength considerably.<ref>Akhtar, A., & Sarmah, A.
