On April 13, 1945, on the Isenschnibbe estate near the [[North Germany|northern German]] town of [[Gardelegen]], the troops forced 1,016 slave laborers who were part of a transport evacuated from the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] Concentration Camp and from the Hannover-St\u00f6cken Concentration Camp into a large barn which was then set on fire.\n1016 prisoners, of which the largest group were Poles, were burned alive or shot trying to escape. The crime was discovered two days later by F Company, 2nd Battalion, 405th Regiment, [[U.S. 102nd Infantry Division]], when the U.S. Army occupied the area. Eleven prisoners were found alive \u2013 7 Poles, 3 Russians and 1 Frenchman. The testimonies of survivors were collected and published by Melchior Wa\u0144kowicz in 1969, in the book ''From Sto\u0142pc\u00f3w to Cairo''. Gardelegen became a part of the newly established [[German Democratic Republic]] in 1947 and is now in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Germany.\n\n==Details==\n[[File:Gardelegen Massacre, Soldiers in barn viewing bodies, Charles Overstreet.jpg|thumb|American soldiers view bodies in barn]]\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1    = Political prisoners of the Nazis who met their deaths at the hands of SS troops who set the barn afire.

The consensus account is that American [[Lieutenant]] Emerson Hunt, a liaison officer <!--(____unit____)--> between Ozark HQ and the 701st Tank Battalion, was captured by German forces on April 14, 1945, that he bluffed the German forces defending the town of Gardelegen into believing that American tanks were approaching the city, and that this induced the German commander to surrender to the American forces.  The Americans arrived at the site before the Germans had time to bury all of the bodies.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/with102dinfantry00unit/with102dinfantry00unit_djvu.txt</ref>\n\nOn April 3\u20134, following the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s crossing of the [[Rhine River]] and push into [[Germany]], the [[SS]] camp administration at [[Dora-Mittelbau]] had ordered the evacuation of prisoners from the main camp and a number of its affiliated subcamps. The goal was to transport the inmates by train or by foot to the other north German concentration camps: [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], or [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]].\n\nWithin days, some 4,000 prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora, its satellite camps, and from the Neuengamme subcamp Hannover-St\u00f6cken arrived in the Gardelegen area, where they had to deboard from the freight cars because the trains could not advance any further due to air raid damage to the rail lines. Greatly outnumbered by the prisoners, the SS guards began recruiting auxiliary forces from the local fire department, the air force, the aged [[Volkssturm|home guard]], the [[Hitler Youth]], and other organizations to watch over the inmates.\n\nOn April 13, more than a thousand prisoners, many of them sick and too weak to march any further, were taken from the town of Gardelegen to a large barn on the [[Isenschnibbe]] estate and forced inside the building. The assembled guards then barricaded the doors and set fire to gasoline-soaked straw. Prisoners who escaped the conflagration by digging under the barn's walls were killed by the guards. The next day, the SS and local auxiliaries returned to dispose of the evidence of their crime. They planned to incinerate what remained of the bodies and the barn, and kill any survivors of the blaze. The swift advance of the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)]], however, prevented the SS and its accomplices from completely carrying out this plan.\n\nOn April 14, the 102nd entered Gardelegen and, the following day, discovered the atrocity. They found the corpses of 1,016 prisoners in the still-smoldering barn and nearby trenches, where the SS had had the charred remains dumped. They also interviewed several of the prisoners who had managed to escape the fire and the shootings. [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] photographers soon arrived to document the Nazi crime and by April 19, 1945, the story of the Gardelegen massacre began appearing in the Western press. On that day, both the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran stories on the massacre, quoting one American soldier who stated:\n<blockquote>\n\nI never was so sure before of exactly what I was fighting for. Before this you would have said those stories were [[propaganda]], but now you know they weren't. There are the bodies and all those guys are dead.\n</blockquote>\n\nEleven prisoners survived the burning of the barn and were found alive by U.S. soldiers \u2013 seven Poles, three Russians and one severely wounded Frenchman.\n\nOn April 21, 1945, the local commander of the 102nd ordered between 200 and 300 men from the town of Gardelegen to give the murdered prisoners a proper burial. Over the next few days, the German civilians exhumed 586 bodies from the trenches and recovered 430 bodies from the barn, placing each in an individual grave. On April 25, the 102nd carried out a ceremony to honor the dead and erected a memorial tablet to the victims, which stated that the townspeople of Gardelegen are charged with the responsibility that the \u201cgraves are forever kept as green as the memory of these unfortunates will be kept in the hearts of freedom-loving men everywhere.\u201d Also on April 25, Colonel George Lynch addressed German civilians at Gardelegen with the following statement:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe German people have been told that stories of German atrocities were Allied propaganda. Here, you can see for yourself. Some will say that the Nazis were responsible for this crime. Others will point to the Gestapo. The responsibility rests with neither \u2014 it is the responsibility of the German people....Your so-called Master Race has demonstrated that it is master only of crime, cruelty and sadism. You have lost the respect of the civilized world.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n==Investigation==\n[[File:Erhard Brauny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|{{ill|Erhard Brauny|de}}]]\nAn investigation was undertaken by Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward E.

The British Commonwealth land forces were drawn primarily from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]] and [[Africa]].\n\nPartly because [[monsoon]] rains made effective campaigning possible only for about half of the year, the Burma campaign was almost the longest campaign of the war. During the campaigning season of 1942, the Japanese had conquered Burma, driving British, Indian and Chinese forces from the country and forcing the British administration to flee into India. After scoring some defensive successes during 1943, they then attempted to forestall Allied offensives in 1944 by launching an invasion of India ([[Operation U-Go]]). This failed with disastrous losses.\n\nDuring the next campaigning season beginning in December 1944, the Allies launched several offensives into Burma. American and Chinese forces advancing from northernmost Burma linked up with armies of the Chinese Republic advancing into [[Yunnan]], which allowed the Allies to complete the [[Burma Road]] in the last months of the war. In the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], Allied amphibious landings secured vital offshore islands and inflicted heavy casualties, although the Japanese maintained some positions until the end of the campaign. In Central Burma however, the Allies crossed the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] and defeated the main Japanese armies in the theatre. Allied formations then followed up with an advance on [[Yangon|Rangoon]], the capital and principal port. Japanese rearguards delayed them until the monsoon struck but an Allied airborne and amphibious attack secured the city, which the Japanese had abandoned.\n\nIn a final operation just before the end of the war, Japanese forces which had been isolated in Southern Burma attempted to [[Battle of the Sittang Bend|escape across]] the [[Sittang River]], suffering heavy casualties.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Allied plans===\nAs the monsoon rains ended late in 1944, the Allies were preparing to launch large-scale offensives into Japanese-occupied Burma. The main Allied headquarters for the British, Indians and Americans in the theatre of war was [[South East Asia Command]], based at [[Kandy]] in [[Ceylon]] and commanded by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]]. The command had considered three major plans as far back as July 1944.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=368\u2013369}}\n* Plan \"X\": The main effort was to be made by the American-led [[Northern Combat Area Command]], with support from the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]]. Starting from [[Mogaung]] and [[Myitkyina]] which had been captured in mid-1944, the NCAC would link up with the [[Republic of China|Chinese]] [[National Revolutionary Army]] attacking from [[Yunnan]] province under General [[Wei Lihuang]] about [[Lashio]]. The aim was to complete the [[Ledo Road]], which would link [[Assam]] in north-east India with Yunnan, supplementing [[The Hump]] airlift which delivered aid and war material to China.\n* Plan \"Y\": The major effort was to be made by Fourteenth Army, across the [[Chindwin River]] into Central Burma, with the aim of capturing Mandalay and linking up with the NCAC and Yunnan Chinese around [[Maymyo]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Mandalay\n* Plan \"Z\": Under this plan, which would later be developed into [[Operation Dracula]], the main effort would be an amphibious and airborne attack on [[Rangoon]], the capital and principal port of Burma. If successful, this would isolate the Japanese in Burma from their lines of communication and force them to evacuate the country.\n\nWhen these plans were studied, it was found that the resources required for Plan \"Z\" (landing craft, [[aircraft carrier]] groups etc.) would probably not be made available until the war in Europe was won. Mountbatten nevertheless proposed to attempt Plans \"Y\" and \"Z\" simultaneously but Plan \"Y\" was adopted and renamed [[Operation Capital]]. Under this, Fourteenth Army (supported by 221 Group RAF) would make the major offensive into Central Burma, where the terrain and road network favoured the British and Indian armoured and motorised formations. The NCAC and Yunnan Chinese (supported by the United States [[10th Air Force#World War II|Tenth]] and [[14th Air Force#Fourteenth Air Force|Fourteenth]] Air Forces) would make subsidiary advances to Lashio, while the [[XV Corps (British India)|XV Corps]] (supported by 224 Group RAF) would seize the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], securing or constructing airfields which could be used to supply Fourteenth Army.{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=368}}\n\n===Japanese plans===\n[[File:Burma topo en.jpg|thumb|Geography of Burma]]\nIn the aftermath of their defeats the previous year, the Japanese had made major changes in their command. The most important was the appointment of Lieutenant General [[Hyotaro Kimura]] to command [[Burma Area Army]], succeeding General [[Masakazu Kawabe]]. Kimura was primarily a logistician who had previously been [[List of Japanese government and military commanders of World War II#Vice-Minister of War|Vice-Minister of War]] and it was hoped that he could use the natural and industrial resources of Burma to make his army self-sufficient. Nevertheless, the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]], which had overall control of all Japanese land forces in Southern Asia and much of the Pacific Ocean and was commanded by Field Marshal [[Hisaichi Terauchi]], found 60,000 reinforcements for Kimura's army, with equipment for three infantry divisions and 500 lorries and 2000 pack animals for the lines of communication. Allied air attacks strangled the Japanese communications via the [[Burma Railway]] and the port of [[Yangon|Rangoon]] and only 30,000 of the intended reinforcements reached Burma. Under pressure of events in the Pacific, Terauchi even withdrew some units from Burma during the campaign.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=391}}\n\nAlthough the Allies expected that the Japanese would fight as far forward as possible, on the Chindwin, Kimura recognised that most of the Japanese units in Burma were weakened by heavy casualties during the previous year and were short of equipment. To avoid fighting at a disadvantage on the Chindwin or in the [[Shwebo]] plain between the Chindwin and [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] where the terrain provided comparatively few obstacles to the British and Indian armoured and motorised units, he withdrew [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|Fifteenth Army]] behind the Irrawaddy, which they would defend against the British Fourteenth Army (Operation BAN). The [[Twenty-Eighth Army (Japan)|Twenty-Eighth Army]] was to continue to defend the Arakan and lower Irrawaddy valley (Operation KAN), while [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Thirty-Third Army]] would attempt to prevent the completion of the new road link between India and China by defending the cities of [[Bhamo]] and [[Lashio]] and mounting guerilla raids (Operation DAN).{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=392}}\n\n===Burma===\nAnother factor which was to become significant during the campaign was the changing attitude of the Burmese population. During the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]] in 1942, many of the majority [[Bamar]] population had actively aided the Japanese Army. Although the Japanese had established a nominally independent Burmese government (the [[State of Burma]]) under [[Ba Maw]] and formed a [[Burma National Army]] under [[Aung San]], they remained in effective control of the country. Their strict control, along with wartime privations, turned the Burmese against them.\n\nAung San had sought an alliance with [[Thakin Soe]], who was leading a Communist insurgency in southern Arakan, as early as 1943. They formed the [[Anti-Fascist Organisation]] and intended turning against the Japanese at some stage but Thakin Soe dissuaded Aung San from openly rebelling until Allied forces had established permanent footholds in Burma. In early 1945, Aung San sought the aid of the Allied liaison organisation [[Force 136]], which was already aiding resistance movements among the minority [[Karen people|Karen]] population. Although there was some debate among the Allies, Mountbatten eventually decided that Aung San should be supported. Force 136 was now to abet the defection of the entire Burma National Army to the Allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Bayly|Harper|2005|pp=429\u2013432}}</ref>\n\nAnother force nominally under Japanese control was the [[Indian National Army]], a force mainly composed of former [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and volunteers from the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriate]] communities in [[British Malaya]] and Burma. Its commander in chief was [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. During the 1945 campaign, some INA units fought stoutly against the Allies but others deserted or capitulated readily. The Japanese had alienated many of the INA by denying them equipment and supplies, or by using them as labourers and carriers rather than as fighting troops. Their morale was also affected in some units by the obvious turn of fortune against the Japanese.\n\n==Southern front==\n[[File:Royal Marines land Ramree Burma.jpg|thumb|Royal Marines land on [[Ramree Island]]]]\nThe Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shozo Sakurai]], defended the coastal [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] region and the lower Irrawaddy valley. The Japanese [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|54th Division]] defended the [[Mayu Peninsula]] and [[Kaladan River]] valley, the Japanese [[55th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|55th Division]] garrisoned several ports and part of southern Burma (with a regiment on [[Mount Popa]]) and the 72nd Independent Mixed Brigade was stationed around the oilfields at [[Yenangyaung]] on the Irrawaddy.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=456}}\n\nThe Allied forces in Arakan were controlled by the XV Indian Corps under Lieutenant General [[Philip Christison]]. The Corps' first major objective was [[Sittwe|Akyab Island]], at the end of the Mayu Peninsula. The island held a port and an important airfield which the Allies planned to use as a base from which to deliver supplies by air to the troops in Central Burma. An attempt to capture the island in 1943 had been defeated, a second attempt in early 1944 gained some ground but was abandoned because of monsoon rains and lack of resources.\n\nAs the monsoon ended in late 1944, XV Corps resumed the advance on Akyab for the third year in succession. The [[25th Infantry Division (India)|25th Indian Division]] advanced on [[Foul Point]] and [[Rathedaung]] at the end of the Mayu Peninsula, being supplied by landing craft over beaches to avoid the risk of Japanese attacks against their lines of communication. The [[82nd (West Africa) Division]] cleared the valley of the Kalapanzin River before crossing a mountain range into the Kaladan River valley, while the [[81st (West Africa) Division]] advanced down the Kaladan River, repeating the move it had made in early 1944. The two African divisions converged on [[Mrauk U|Myohaung]] near the mouth of the Kaladan River, cutting the supply lines of the Japanese troops in the Mayu Peninsula. The Japanese evacuated Akyab Island on 31 December 1944. It was occupied by XV Corps without resistance two days later.\n\nThe 82nd Division next attacked south along the coastal plain, while the 25th Indian Division, with [[3 Commando Brigade]] under command, made amphibious landings further south to catch the Japanese in a pincer movement. First ashore was [[42 Commando|No. 42 (Royal Marine) Commando]] on the south-eastern face of the [[Myebon]] Peninsula on 12 January 1945. Over the next few days the commandos and a brigade of 25th Division cleared the peninsula and denied the Japanese the use of the many waterways along the Arakan coast.\n\n{{see also|Battle of Hill 170}}\nOn 22 January, 3 Commando Brigade landed on the beaches at [[Daingbon Chaung]] led this time by [[No. 1 Commando]]. Having secured the beaches they moved inland and became involved in very heavy fighting with the Japanese. The following night a brigade of the 25th Division was landed in support. The fighting around the beachhead involved hand-to-hand fighting as the Japanese realised the danger of encirclement and threw all their available troops into the fight. The commandos and Indian troops managed to turn the tide of the battle and take the village of Kangaw only on 29 January. Meanwhile, the forces on the Myebon Peninsula linked up with the 82nd Division fighting its way overland towards Kangaw. Caught between the 82nd Division and the forces already in Kangaw, the Japanese were forced to scatter, leaving behind thousands of dead and most of their heavy equipment.\n\nWith the coastal area secured, the Allies were free to build airbases which could be supplied by sea on the two offshore islands, [[Ramree Island]] and [[Cheduba Island]]. Cheduba, the smaller of the two islands, had no Japanese garrison but the [[Battle of Ramree Island]] lasted for six weeks after the initial landings on 21 January by the [[26th Indian Infantry Division|26th Indian Division]] before the survivors of the small but tenacious Japanese garrison withdrew from the island,<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|pp=461\u2013462}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedops.com/No%205%20Commando.htm |work=Combined Operations |title=No 5 Commando |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> suffering heavy casualties to disease, starvation, Allied [[Motor Launch]]es and other naval vessels and (allegedly) crocodiles.{{sfn|McLynn|2011|pp=13\u201315, 459}}\n\nFollowing these actions, XV Corps' operations were curtailed to release transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army. The 81st Division and the [[50th Indian Tank Brigade]] were withdrawn to India. Outflanking moves by the 82nd Division and 26th Indian Division through the hills around [[Ann, Burma|An]] and [[Toungup|Taungup]] were abandoned or cancelled and the Corps' divisions were withdrawn to the coast. The Japanese successfully defended the port of Taungup and the An and Taungup passes across the Arakan hills until very late in the campaign.\n\n==Northern front==\n[[File:Opening the Burma Road October 1944 - January 1945.jpg|thumb|Northern Combat Area Command's operations]]\nThe Japanese Thirty-third Army, led by Lieutenant General [[Masaki Honda]], defended Northern Burma against attacks from both Northern India and the Chinese province of Yunnan. The Japanese [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] faced the American and Chinese [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan]] advancing south from [[Siege of Myitkyina|Myitkyina]] and [[Battle of Mogaung|Mogaung]] which the Allies had secured in 1944, while the Japanese [[56th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|56th Division]] faced the large Chinese Yunnan armies led by [[Wei Lihuang]].\n\nAlthough Thirty-third Army had been forced to relinquish most of the reinforcements it had received the previous year, the operations of the NCAC were limited from late 1944 onwards as many of its troops were withdrawn by air to face Japanese attacks in China. In [[The Hump#Operation Grubworm|Operation Grubworm]], the Chinese 14th and 22nd divisions were flown via Myitkyina to defend the airfields around [[Kunming]], vital to the airlift of aid to China, nicknamed [[The Hump]]. Nevertheless, the command resumed its advance.\n\nOn the right flank of the command, the British [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Division]], which had been assigned to the command in July 1944 to replace the [[Chindits]], advanced south down the \"Railway Valley\" from Mogaung to [[Indaw]]. It made contact with the [[19th Infantry Division (India)|19th Indian Division]] near Indaw on 10 December 1944 and Fourteenth Army and NCAC now had a continuous front. On Sultan's left, the Chinese [[New 1st Army|New First Army]] (the 30th Division and 38th Division) advanced from Myitkyina to Bhamo. The Japanese resisted for several weeks but Bhamo fell on 15 December. The Chinese [[New 6th Army|New Sixth Army]] (commanded by [[Liao Yaoxiang]] and consisting of the 50th Division) infiltrated through the difficult terrain between these two wings to threaten the Japanese lines of communication. An American force (the 5334th Composite Unit, known as the \"Mars Brigade\", commanded by Brigadier General J. P. Willey, which had replaced [[Merrill's Marauders]] and consisted of 475th United States Infantry Regiment, 124th United States Cavalry Regiment and a Chinese regiment), acted independently, though mainly in support of the New First Army.\n\nThe New First Army made contact with Wei Lihuang's armies advancing from Yunnan near [[Hsipaw]] on 21 January 1945 and the Ledo road could finally be completed. The first truck convoy from India arrived in Kunming on 4 February{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} but by this point in the war the value of the Ledo road was uncertain, as it would not now affect the military situation in China.\n\nTo the annoyance of the British and Americans, Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ordered Sultan to halt his advance at Lashio, which was captured on 7 March. The British and Americans generally refused to understand that Chiang had to balance the needs of China as a whole against fighting the Japanese in a British colony.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Japanese had already withdrawn most of their divisions from the northern front, to face the Fourteenth Army in central Burma. On 12 March, the Thirty-third Army HQ was also dispatched there, leaving only the 56th Division to hold the northern front.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} This division was also withdrawn in late March and early April.\n\nFrom 1 April, NCAC's operations stopped and its units returned to China. The British 36th Division moved to Mandalay, which had been captured in March and was subsequently withdrawn to India. A US-led guerrilla force, [[OSS Detachment 101]], took over the military responsibilities of NCAC,{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} while British civil affairs and other units such as the Civil Affairs Service (Burma) stepped in to take over its other responsibilities. Northern Burma was partitioned into Line-of-Communication areas by the military authorities.\n\n==Central front==\n{{Main|Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay}}\n[[File:Indian troops among pagodas on Mandalay.jpg|thumb|Troops of the 19th Indian Division in Mandalay]]\nThe Japanese Fifteenth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shihachi Katamura]], held the central part of the front. The army was falling back behind the Irrawaddy, deploying rearguards to delay the Allied advance. A bridgehead was retained in the [[Sagaing]] hills.\n\nThe Fifteenth Army consisted of the Japanese [[15th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|15th Division]], [[31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|31st Division]] and the [[33rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|33rd Division]]. The [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] provided a reserve, although it was controlled directly by the Burma Area Army. During the campaign, the headquarters of the Japanese Thirty-third Army and parts of the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Division]] and the [[49th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|49th Division]] reinforced the forces on the central part of the front.\n\nThe British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[William Slim]] made the main Allied thrust, codenamed Operation Capital, into central Burma. It consisted of [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Frank Messervy]] and [[XXXIII Corps (British India)|XXXIII Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Montagu Stopford]], together controlling six infantry divisions, two armoured brigades and three independent infantry brigades. The main constraint on the number of forces the Fourteenth Army could deploy was supply. A carefully designed system involving large amounts of air transport was introduced and major construction projects were undertaken to improve the land route from India into Burma and make use of river transport.\n\nUnits of both corps of the Fourteenth Army crossed the Chindwin and attacked into the Shwebo plain, IV Corps on the left and XXXIII Corps on the right. After a few days, when it was realised that the Japanese had fallen back behind the Irrawaddy River, the plan was hastily changed. Now, only XXXIII Corps was to continue the attack into the Shwebo Plain, reinforced by the one division of IV Corps which had been committed across the Chindwin, while the main body of IV Corps was switched to the right flank, changing its axis of advance to the Gangaw Valley west of the Chindwin. It aimed to cross the Irrawaddy close to [[Pakokku]] and then capture the main Japanese line of communication centre of [[Meiktila]]. Diversionary measures (such as dummy radio traffic) were made to persuade the Japanese that both corps were still aimed at Mandalay. The new plan was a success. Allied air superiority and the thin Japanese presence on the ground meant that the Japanese were unaware of the strength of the force moving on Pakokku.\n\nDuring January and February, the XXXIII Corps (consisting of the British [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], 19th Indian Division, [[20th Infantry Division (India)|20th Indian Division]], [[268th Indian Infantry Brigade|268th Indian Brigade]] and the [[254th Indian Tank Brigade]]) cleared the Shwebo plain and established bridgeheads over the Irrawaddy River near Mandalay. There was heavy fighting, which attracted Japanese reserves and fixed their attention. Late in February, the [[7th Indian Infantry Division|7th Indian Division]], leading IV Corps, seized crossings at [[Nyaung-U|Nyaungu]] and [[Bagan|Pagan]] near Pakokku. While the 28th (East Africa) Infantry Brigade maintained diversionary pressure against Yenangyaung on the west bank of the river, the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Indian Division]] and the [[255th Indian Tank Brigade|255th Indian Armoured brigade]] crossed through 7th Indian Division's bridgeheads and began advancing to Meiktila.\n\n===Meiktila===\nIn the dry season, central Burma is largely an open plain with sandy soil and there is also a good road network. The [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]] 17th Indian Division and the armoured brigade could move rapidly and unhindered in this open terrain, apparently taking the staffs at the various Japanese headquarters by surprise with this [[blitzkrieg]] manoeuvre. Reinforced by the third brigade of the 17th Indian Division which flew in to a captured airstrip, they struck Meiktila on 1 March and captured it in four days, despite resistance to the last man. In an oft-recounted incident, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches with aircraft bombs, with orders to detonate them when an enemy tank loomed over the trench.\n\nJapanese reinforcements arrived too late to relieve the garrison but they besieged the town in an attempt to recapture it and destroy the 17th Indian Division. Although eight Japanese regiments were eventually involved, they were mostly weak in numbers and drawn from five divisions, so their efforts were not coordinated. The Japanese Thirty-third Army HQ (re-titled The Army of the Decisive Battle) was assigned to take command in this vital sector but was unable to establish proper control.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} The 17th Indian Division had been reinforced by a brigade of the [[Indian 5th Infantry Division|5th Indian Division]] landed by air. British tank-infantry forces sallied out of Meiktila to break up Japanese concentrations and by the end of the month the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and had lost most of their artillery, their chief anti-tank weapon. The Japanese broke off the attack and retreated to Pyawbwe.\n\nWhile the capture and siege of Meiktila took place, the 7th Indian Division, reinforced by a mechanised brigade of the 5th Indian Division, secured the Irrawaddy bridgehead, captured the important river port at [[Myingyan]] and began clearing the lines of communication to Meiktila.\n\n===Mandalay===\nWhile the Japanese were distracted by events at Meiktila, XXXIII Corps had renewed its attack on Mandalay. It fell to the 19th Indian Division on 20 March, though the Japanese held the former citadel, which the British called [[Mandalay Palace|Fort Dufferin]], for another week. Many of the historically and culturally significant areas of Mandalay, including the old royal palace, were burned to the ground. A great deal was lost by the Japanese choice to make a last stand in the city itself. The other divisions of XXXIII Corps simultaneously attacked from their bridgeheads across the Irrawaddy. The Japanese Fifteenth Army was reduced to small detachments and parties of stragglers making their way south, or east into the Shan States. With the fall of Mandalay (and of [[Pyin U Lwin|Maymyo]] to its east), the Japanese communications to the front in the north of Burma were cut and the Allied road link between India and China was therefore finally secured, though far too late to affect the course of the war in China.\n\nThe fall of Mandalay also precipitated the change of sides by the Burma National Army and open rebellion against the Japanese by other underground movements belonging to the Anti-Fascist Organisation.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=573}} In the last week of March Aung San, commander-in-chief of the Burma National Army, appeared in public in Burmese native dress instead of Japanese uniform.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=582}} Shortly afterwards, most of the Burma National Army paraded in Rangoon and then marched out of the city as if going to the front in Central Burma. They then rebelled against the Japanese on 27 March.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=584}}\n\n==Race for Rangoon==\n[[File:IND 004652 Stuart tank advancing on Rangoon.jpg|thumb|A [[Stuart light tank]] of an Indian cavalry regiment during the advance on Rangoon]]\nThough the Allied force had advanced successfully into central Burma, it was vital to capture the port of Rangoon before the monsoon rains began. The temporarily upgraded overland routes from India would disintegrate under heavy rain, which would also curtail flying and reduce the amount of supplies which could be delivered by air. Furthermore, South East Asia Command had been notified that many of the American transport aircraft allocated to the theatre would be withdrawn in June at the latest. The use of Rangoon would be necessary to meet the needs of the large army force and (as importantly) the food needs of the civilian population in the areas liberated.\n\nThe British 2nd Division and British 36th Division, both of which were understrength and could not readily be reinforced, were withdrawn to India to reduce the demand for supplies. (The 36th Division also exchanged the Indian battalions in one of its brigades for the depleted British battalions in the 20th Indian Division). The Indian XXXIII Corps, consisting of the 7th Indian Division and 20th Indian Division, mounted the Fourteenth Army's secondary drive down the Irrawaddy River valley, against the Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army. The IV Corps, of the 5th, 17th and 19th Indian divisions, made the main attack down the [[Sittang River]] valley.\n\nThe 17th Indian Division and 255th Armoured Brigade began the IV Corps advance on 6 April by striking from all sides at the delaying position held by the remnants of the Japanese Thirty-third Army at [[Pyawbwe Township|Pyawbwe]], while a flanking column (nicknamed \"Claudcol\") of tanks and mechanised infantry cut the main road behind them and attacked their rear.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=461}} This column was initially delayed by the remnants of the Japanese 49th Division defending a village but bypassed them to defeat the remnants of the Japanese 53rd Division and destroy the last tanks remaining to the Japanese 14th Tank regiment. As they then turned north against the town of Pyawbwe itself, they attacked Lieutenant General Honda's headquarters but were not aware of the presence of an army headquarters and broke off to capture the town instead.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=465\u2013466}}\n\nFrom this point, the advance down the main road to Rangoon faced little organised opposition. At [[Pyinmana]], the town and the bridge were seized on 19 April before the Japanese could organise their defence. The Japanese Thirty-third Army headquarters was present in Pyinmana. From reports by agents, the Allies were aware this time of Honda's presence and his headquarters was attacked by tanks and aircraft. Lieutenant-General Honda and his staff escaped at night on foot but they now had little means of controlling the remnants of their formations.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=468\u2013471}}\n\n[[File:IND 004723.jpg|thumb|British [[3-inch mortar]] detachments support the 19th Indian Division advance along the Mawchi road, east of [[Toungoo]] (1944)]]\nSome units of the Japanese Fifteenth Army had reorganised in the Shan States and were reinforced by the Japanese 56th Division, which had been transferred from the northern front. They were ordered to move to [[Toungoo]] to block the road to Rangoon but a general uprising by Karen forces who had been organised and equipped by Force 136 delayed them long enough for the 5th Indian Division to reach the town first on 23 April. The Japanese briefly recaptured Toungoo once the 5th Indian Division had passed through but the 19th Indian Division, which was following up the leading units of IV Corps, captured the town again and slowly drove the Japanese back towards [[Mawchi]] to the east.\n\nThe 17th Indian Division resumed the lead of the advance and met a Japanese blocking force north of [[Pegu]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 25 April. The various line of communication troops, naval personnel and even Japanese civilians in Rangoon had been formed into the Japanese 105 Independent Mixed Brigade. This scratch formation used anti-tank mines improvised from aircraft bombs, anti-aircraft guns and suicide attacks with pole charges to delay the 17th Indian Division and then defended Pegu until 30 April, when it withdrew into the hills west of Pegu. The monsoon broke as the division resumed its advance on Rangoon and floods slowed the division.\n\n==Operation Dracula==\n{{Main|Operation Dracula}}\nIn the original conception of the plan to re-take Burma, it had been intended that the XV Indian Corps would make an amphibious assault codenamed [[Operation Dracula]] on Rangoon long before Fourteenth Army reached the capital, in order to ease supply problems. Lack of resources meant that ''Dracula'' was postponed and the operation was subsequently dropped in favour of a planned assault on [[Phuket Island]] off the [[Kra Isthmus]].\n\nSlim feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon to the last man through the monsoon, which would put the Fourteenth Army in a disastrous supply situation. In late March, he therefore asked for ''Dracula'' to be reinstated at short notice. However, Kimura had ordered Rangoon to be evacuated, starting on 22 April. Many troops were evacuated by sea, although British destroyers claimed several ships. Kimura's own HQ and the establishments of Ba Maw and Subhas Bose left by land, covered by the action of 105 Mixed Brigade at Pegu and proceeded to [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]].\n\nOn 1 May, a Gurkha parachute battalion was dropped on [[Battle of Elephant Point|Elephant Point]] and cleared Japanese coastal defence batteries at the mouth of the [[Rangoon River]]. The 26th Indian Division started to land the next day as the monsoon began and took over Rangoon, which had seen an orgy of looting and lawlessness since the Japanese had left. The leading troops of the 17th and 26th Indian divisions met at Hlegu, {{convert|28|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 6 May.\n\n==Final operations==\n{{Main|Battle of the Sittang Bend|}}\nFollowing the capture of Rangoon, a new [[British Twelfth Army|Twelfth Army]] headquarters, commanded by Lieutenant General Stopford, was created from the XXXIII Indian Corps HQ to take control of the allied formations which were to remain in Burma, including IV Corps.\n\nThe remnants of the Japanese Burma Area Army remained in control of [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]] province. The Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, which had withdrawn from [[Arakan Province|Arakan]] and unsuccessfully resisted XXXIII Corps in the Irrawaddy valley, and the 105 Independent Brigade, were cut off in the [[Pegu Yomas]], a range of low jungle-covered hills between the Irrawaddy and Sittang rivers. They planned to break out and rejoin Burma Area Army. To cover this break-out, Kimura ordered Honda's Thirty-third Army to mount a diversionary offensive across the Sittang, although the entire army could muster the strength of barely a regiment. On 3 July, Honda's troops attacked British positions in the \"Sittang Bend\". On 10 July, after a battle for country which was almost entirely under chest-high water, both the Japanese and the 89th Indian Brigade withdrew.\n\nHonda, pressed by Kimura and his chief of staff, Tanaka, had attacked too early. Sakurai's Twenty-eighth Army was not ready to start the break-out until 17 July. The break-out was a disaster. The British had captured the Japanese plans from an officer killed making a final reconnaissance,{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=506\u2013507}} and had placed ambushes or artillery concentrations on the routes they were to use. Hundreds of men drowned trying to cross the swollen Sittang on improvised bamboo floats and rafts. Burmese guerrillas and bandits killed stragglers east of the river. The break-out cost the Japanese nearly 10,000 men, half the strength of Twenty-eighth Army. Some units of 105 Independent Brigade were almost entirely wiped out.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=524\u2013525}} British and Indian casualties were minimal.\n\nFourteenth Army (now commanded by Lieutenant General [[Miles Dempsey]]) and XV Corps had returned to India to plan the next stage of the campaign to re-take south east Asia. A new corps, the [[Indian XXXIV Corps|XXXIV Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Ouvry Lindfield Roberts]], was raised and assigned to Fourteenth Army for further operations.\n\nThe next intended operation was to be an amphibious assault on the western coast of Malaya, codenamed [[Operation Zipper]]. The dropping of the atomic bombs forestalled ''Zipper'' but the operation was undertaken post-war as the quickest way of getting occupation troops into Malaya.\n\n==Maps==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=175>\nAllied Third Burma Campaign October 1943-May 1944.jpg|Third Burma campaign, October 1943 \u2013 May 1944\nAllied Third Burma Campaign June 1944-May 1945.jpg|Third Burma campaign, June 1944 \u2013 April 1945\nAllied Third Burma Campaign Apri 1-May 1945.jpg|Third Burma campaign, April\u2013May 1945\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Allen|2005}}\n|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The longest War |publisher=Dent Publishing |year=2005 |orig-year=1984 |isbn=0-460-02474-4}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Bayly |first=Christopher |last2=Harper |first2=Tim |title=Forgotten Armies: Britain's Asian Empire and the War with Japan |publisher=Penguin |year=2005 |isbn=0-14-029331-0}}\n* {{cite book |last=McLynn |first=Frank |series=Yale Library of Military History |title=The Burma Campaign: Disaster Into Triumph, 1942\u201345 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-300-17162-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Slim |first=William |authorlink=William Slim |year=1956 |title=Defeat Into Victory: An Account of the Burma campaign, 1942\u201345 with Maps and a Portrait |publisher=Cassell |location=London |oclc=843081328}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Fraser |first=George MacDonald |authorlink=George MacDonald Fraser |title=[[Quartered Safe Out Here]] |location=London |publisher=Harvill |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-00-710593-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hickey |first=Michael |title=The Unforgettable Army |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=Spellmount |year=1992 |isbn=1-873376-10-3}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hodsun |first=J.

The British Commonwealth land forces were drawn primarily from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]] and [[Africa]].\n\nPartly because [[monsoon]] rains made effective campaigning possible only for about half of the year, the Burma campaign was almost the longest campaign of the war. During the campaigning season of 1942, the Japanese had conquered Burma, driving British, Indian and Chinese forces from the country and forcing the British administration to flee into India. After scoring some defensive successes during 1943, they then attempted to forestall Allied offensives in 1944 by launching an invasion of India ([[Operation U-Go]]). This failed with disastrous losses.\n\nDuring the next campaigning season beginning in December 1944, the Allies launched several offensives into Burma. American and Chinese forces advancing from northernmost Burma linked up with armies of the Chinese Republic advancing into [[Yunnan]], which allowed the Allies to complete the [[Burma Road]] in the last months of the war. In the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], Allied amphibious landings secured vital offshore islands and inflicted heavy casualties, although the Japanese maintained some positions until the end of the campaign. In Central Burma however, the Allies crossed the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] and defeated the main Japanese armies in the theatre. Allied formations then followed up with an advance on [[Yangon|Rangoon]], the capital and principal port. Japanese rearguards delayed them until the monsoon struck but an Allied airborne and amphibious attack secured the city, which the Japanese had abandoned.\n\nIn a final operation just before the end of the war, Japanese forces which had been isolated in Southern Burma attempted to [[Battle of the Sittang Bend|escape across]] the [[Sittang River]], suffering heavy casualties.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Allied plans===\nAs the monsoon rains ended late in 1944, the Allies were preparing to launch large-scale offensives into Japanese-occupied Burma. The main Allied headquarters for the British, Indians and Americans in the theatre of war was [[South East Asia Command]], based at [[Kandy]] in [[Ceylon]] and commanded by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]]. The command had considered three major plans as far back as July 1944.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=368\u2013369}}\n* Plan \"X\": The main effort was to be made by the American-led [[Northern Combat Area Command]], with support from the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]]. Starting from [[Mogaung]] and [[Myitkyina]] which had been captured in mid-1944, the NCAC would link up with the [[Republic of China|Chinese]] [[National Revolutionary Army]] attacking from [[Yunnan]] province under General [[Wei Lihuang]] about [[Lashio]]. The aim was to complete the [[Ledo Road]], which would link [[Assam]] in north-east India with Yunnan, supplementing [[The Hump]] airlift which delivered aid and war material to China.\n* Plan \"Y\": The major effort was to be made by Fourteenth Army, across the [[Chindwin River]] into Central Burma, with the aim of capturing Mandalay and linking up with the NCAC and Yunnan Chinese around [[Maymyo]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Mandalay\n* Plan \"Z\": Under this plan, which would later be developed into [[Operation Dracula]], the main effort would be an amphibious and airborne attack on [[Rangoon]], the capital and principal port of Burma. If successful, this would isolate the Japanese in Burma from their lines of communication and force them to evacuate the country.\n\nWhen these plans were studied, it was found that the resources required for Plan \"Z\" (landing craft, [[aircraft carrier]] groups etc.) would probably not be made available until the war in Europe was won. Mountbatten nevertheless proposed to attempt Plans \"Y\" and \"Z\" simultaneously but Plan \"Y\" was adopted and renamed [[Operation Capital]]. Under this, Fourteenth Army (supported by 221 Group RAF) would make the major offensive into Central Burma, where the terrain and road network favoured the British and Indian armoured and motorised formations. The NCAC and Yunnan Chinese (supported by the United States [[10th Air Force#World War II|Tenth]] and [[14th Air Force#Fourteenth Air Force|Fourteenth]] Air Forces) would make subsidiary advances to Lashio, while the [[XV Corps (British India)|XV Corps]] (supported by 224 Group RAF) would seize the coastal province of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], securing or constructing airfields which could be used to supply Fourteenth Army.{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=368}}\n\n===Japanese plans===\n[[File:Burma topo en.jpg|thumb|Geography of Burma]]\nIn the aftermath of their defeats the previous year, the Japanese had made major changes in their command. The most important was the appointment of Lieutenant General [[Hyotaro Kimura]] to command [[Burma Area Army]], succeeding General [[Masakazu Kawabe]]. Kimura was primarily a logistician who had previously been [[List of Japanese government and military commanders of World War II#Vice-Minister of War|Vice-Minister of War]] and it was hoped that he could use the natural and industrial resources of Burma to make his army self-sufficient. Nevertheless, the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]], which had overall control of all Japanese land forces in Southern Asia and much of the Pacific Ocean and was commanded by Field Marshal [[Hisaichi Terauchi]], found 60,000 reinforcements for Kimura's army, with equipment for three infantry divisions and 500 lorries and 2000 pack animals for the lines of communication. Allied air attacks strangled the Japanese communications via the [[Burma Railway]] and the port of [[Yangon|Rangoon]] and only 30,000 of the intended reinforcements reached Burma. Under pressure of events in the Pacific, Terauchi even withdrew some units from Burma during the campaign.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=391}}\n\nAlthough the Allies expected that the Japanese would fight as far forward as possible, on the Chindwin, Kimura recognised that most of the Japanese units in Burma were weakened by heavy casualties during the previous year and were short of equipment. To avoid fighting at a disadvantage on the Chindwin or in the [[Shwebo]] plain between the Chindwin and [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]] where the terrain provided comparatively few obstacles to the British and Indian armoured and motorised units, he withdrew [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|Fifteenth Army]] behind the Irrawaddy, which they would defend against the British Fourteenth Army (Operation BAN). The [[Twenty-Eighth Army (Japan)|Twenty-Eighth Army]] was to continue to defend the Arakan and lower Irrawaddy valley (Operation KAN), while [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Thirty-Third Army]] would attempt to prevent the completion of the new road link between India and China by defending the cities of [[Bhamo]] and [[Lashio]] and mounting guerilla raids (Operation DAN).{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=392}}\n\n===Burma===\nAnother factor which was to become significant during the campaign was the changing attitude of the Burmese population. During the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]] in 1942, many of the majority [[Bamar]] population had actively aided the Japanese Army. Although the Japanese had established a nominally independent Burmese government (the [[State of Burma]]) under [[Ba Maw]] and formed a [[Burma National Army]] under [[Aung San]], they remained in effective control of the country. Their strict control, along with wartime privations, turned the Burmese against them.\n\nAung San had sought an alliance with [[Thakin Soe]], who was leading a Communist insurgency in southern Arakan, as early as 1943. They formed the [[Anti-Fascist Organisation]] and intended turning against the Japanese at some stage but Thakin Soe dissuaded Aung San from openly rebelling until Allied forces had established permanent footholds in Burma. In early 1945, Aung San sought the aid of the Allied liaison organisation [[Force 136]], which was already aiding resistance movements among the minority [[Karen people|Karen]] population. Although there was some debate among the Allies, Mountbatten eventually decided that Aung San should be supported. Force 136 was now to abet the defection of the entire Burma National Army to the Allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Bayly|Harper|2005|pp=429\u2013432}}</ref>\n\nAnother force nominally under Japanese control was the [[Indian National Army]], a force mainly composed of former [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and volunteers from the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriate]] communities in [[British Malaya]] and Burma. Its commander in chief was [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. During the 1945 campaign, some INA units fought stoutly against the Allies but others deserted or capitulated readily. The Japanese had alienated many of the INA by denying them equipment and supplies, or by using them as labourers and carriers rather than as fighting troops. Their morale was also affected in some units by the obvious turn of fortune against the Japanese.\n\n==Southern front==\n[[File:Royal Marines land Ramree Burma.jpg|thumb|Royal Marines land on [[Ramree Island]]]]\nThe Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shozo Sakurai]], defended the coastal [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] region and the lower Irrawaddy valley. The Japanese [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|54th Division]] defended the [[Mayu Peninsula]] and [[Kaladan River]] valley, the Japanese [[55th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|55th Division]] garrisoned several ports and part of southern Burma (with a regiment on [[Mount Popa]]) and the 72nd Independent Mixed Brigade was stationed around the oilfields at [[Yenangyaung]] on the Irrawaddy.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=456}}\n\nThe Allied forces in Arakan were controlled by the XV Indian Corps under Lieutenant General [[Philip Christison]]. The Corps' first major objective was [[Sittwe|Akyab Island]], at the end of the Mayu Peninsula. The island held a port and an important airfield which the Allies planned to use as a base from which to deliver supplies by air to the troops in Central Burma. An attempt to capture the island in 1943 had been defeated, a second attempt in early 1944 gained some ground but was abandoned because of monsoon rains and lack of resources.\n\nAs the monsoon ended in late 1944, XV Corps resumed the advance on Akyab for the third year in succession. The [[25th Infantry Division (India)|25th Indian Division]] advanced on [[Foul Point]] and [[Rathedaung]] at the end of the Mayu Peninsula, being supplied by landing craft over beaches to avoid the risk of Japanese attacks against their lines of communication. The [[82nd (West Africa) Division]] cleared the valley of the Kalapanzin River before crossing a mountain range into the Kaladan River valley, while the [[81st (West Africa) Division]] advanced down the Kaladan River, repeating the move it had made in early 1944. The two African divisions converged on [[Mrauk U|Myohaung]] near the mouth of the Kaladan River, cutting the supply lines of the Japanese troops in the Mayu Peninsula. The Japanese evacuated Akyab Island on 31 December 1944. It was occupied by XV Corps without resistance two days later.\n\nThe 82nd Division next attacked south along the coastal plain, while the 25th Indian Division, with [[3 Commando Brigade]] under command, made amphibious landings further south to catch the Japanese in a pincer movement. First ashore was [[42 Commando|No. 42 (Royal Marine) Commando]] on the south-eastern face of the [[Myebon]] Peninsula on 12 January 1945. Over the next few days the commandos and a brigade of 25th Division cleared the peninsula and denied the Japanese the use of the many waterways along the Arakan coast.\n\n{{see also|Battle of Hill 170}}\nOn 22 January, 3 Commando Brigade landed on the beaches at [[Daingbon Chaung]] led this time by [[No. 1 Commando]]. Having secured the beaches they moved inland and became involved in very heavy fighting with the Japanese. The following night a brigade of the 25th Division was landed in support. The fighting around the beachhead involved hand-to-hand fighting as the Japanese realised the danger of encirclement and threw all their available troops into the fight. The commandos and Indian troops managed to turn the tide of the battle and take the village of Kangaw only on 29 January. Meanwhile, the forces on the Myebon Peninsula linked up with the 82nd Division fighting its way overland towards Kangaw. Caught between the 82nd Division and the forces already in Kangaw, the Japanese were forced to scatter, leaving behind thousands of dead and most of their heavy equipment.\n\nWith the coastal area secured, the Allies were free to build airbases which could be supplied by sea on the two offshore islands, [[Ramree Island]] and [[Cheduba Island]]. Cheduba, the smaller of the two islands, had no Japanese garrison but the [[Battle of Ramree Island]] lasted for six weeks after the initial landings on 21 January by the [[26th Indian Infantry Division|26th Indian Division]] before the survivors of the small but tenacious Japanese garrison withdrew from the island,<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|pp=461\u2013462}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedops.com/No%205%20Commando.htm |work=Combined Operations |title=No 5 Commando |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> suffering heavy casualties to disease, starvation, Allied [[Motor Launch]]es and other naval vessels and (allegedly) crocodiles.{{sfn|McLynn|2011|pp=13\u201315, 459}}\n\nFollowing these actions, XV Corps' operations were curtailed to release transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army. The 81st Division and the [[50th Indian Tank Brigade]] were withdrawn to India. Outflanking moves by the 82nd Division and 26th Indian Division through the hills around [[Ann, Burma|An]] and [[Toungup|Taungup]] were abandoned or cancelled and the Corps' divisions were withdrawn to the coast. The Japanese successfully defended the port of Taungup and the An and Taungup passes across the Arakan hills until very late in the campaign.\n\n==Northern front==\n[[File:Opening the Burma Road October 1944 - January 1945.jpg|thumb|Northern Combat Area Command's operations]]\nThe Japanese Thirty-third Army, led by Lieutenant General [[Masaki Honda]], defended Northern Burma against attacks from both Northern India and the Chinese province of Yunnan. The Japanese [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] faced the American and Chinese [[Northern Combat Area Command]] (NCAC) under Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan]] advancing south from [[Myitkyina]] and [[Mogaung]] which the Allies had secured in 1944, while the Japanese [[56th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|56th Division]] faced the large Chinese Yunnan armies led by [[Wei Lihuang]].\n\nAlthough Thirty-third Army had been forced to relinquish most of the reinforcements it had received the previous year, the operations of the NCAC were limited from late 1944 onwards as many of its troops were withdrawn by air to face Japanese attacks in China. In [[The Hump#Operation Grubworm|Operation Grubworm]], the Chinese 14th and 22nd divisions were flown via Myitkyina to defend the airfields around [[Kunming]], vital to the airlift of aid to China, nicknamed [[The Hump]]. Nevertheless, the command resumed its advance.\n\nOn the right flank of the command, the British [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Division]], which had been assigned to the command in July 1944 to replace the [[Chindits]], advanced south down the \"Railway Valley\" from Mogaung to [[Indaw]]. It made contact with the [[19th Infantry Division (India)|19th Indian Division]] near Indaw on 10 December 1944 and Fourteenth Army and NCAC now had a continuous front. On Sultan's left, the Chinese [[New 1st Army|New First Army]] (the 30th Division and 38th Division) advanced from Myitkyina to Bhamo. The Japanese resisted for several weeks but Bhamo fell on 15 December. The Chinese [[New 6th Army|New Sixth Army]] (commanded by [[Liao Yaoxiang]] and consisting of the 50th Division) infiltrated through the difficult terrain between these two wings to threaten the Japanese lines of communication. An American force (the 5334th Composite Unit, known as the \"Mars Brigade\", commanded by Brigadier General J. P. Willey, which had replaced [[Merrill's Marauders]] and consisted of 475th United States Infantry Regiment, 124th United States Cavalry Regiment and a Chinese regiment), acted independently, though mainly in support of the New First Army.\n\nThe New First Army made contact with Wei Lihuang's armies advancing from Yunnan near [[Hsipaw]] on 21 January 1945 and the Ledo road could finally be completed. The first truck convoy from India arrived in Kunming on 4 February{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} but by this point in the war the value of the Ledo road was uncertain, as it would not now affect the military situation in China.\n\nTo the annoyance of the British and Americans, Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ordered Sultan to halt his advance at Lashio, which was captured on 7 March. The British and Americans generally refused to understand that Chiang had to balance the needs of China as a whole against fighting the Japanese in a British colony.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Japanese had already withdrawn most of their divisions from the northern front, to face the Fourteenth Army in central Burma. On 12 March, the Thirty-third Army HQ was also dispatched there, leaving only the 56th Division to hold the northern front.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} This division was also withdrawn in late March and early April.\n\nFrom 1 April, NCAC's operations stopped and its units returned to China. The British 36th Division moved to Mandalay, which had been captured in March and was subsequently withdrawn to India. A US-led guerrilla force, [[OSS Detachment 101]], took over the military responsibilities of NCAC,{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=455}} while British civil affairs and other units such as the Civil Affairs Service (Burma) stepped in to take over its other responsibilities. Northern Burma was partitioned into Line-of-Communication areas by the military authorities.\n\n==Central front==\n{{Main|Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay}}\n[[File:Indian troops among pagodas on Mandalay.jpg|thumb|Troops of the 19th Indian Division in Mandalay]]\nThe Japanese Fifteenth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shihachi Katamura]], held the central part of the front. The army was falling back behind the Irrawaddy, deploying rearguards to delay the Allied advance. A bridgehead was retained in the [[Sagaing]] hills.\n\nThe Fifteenth Army consisted of the Japanese [[15th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|15th Division]], [[31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|31st Division]] and the [[33rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|33rd Division]]. The [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] provided a reserve, although it was controlled directly by the Burma Area Army. During the campaign, the headquarters of the Japanese Thirty-third Army and parts of the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Division]] and the [[49th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|49th Division]] reinforced the forces on the central part of the front.\n\nThe British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[William Slim]] made the main Allied thrust, codenamed Operation Capital, into central Burma. It consisted of [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Frank Messervy]] and [[XXXIII Corps (British India)|XXXIII Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Montagu Stopford]], together controlling six infantry divisions, two armoured brigades and three independent infantry brigades. The main constraint on the number of forces the Fourteenth Army could deploy was supply. A carefully designed system involving large amounts of air transport was introduced and major construction projects were undertaken to improve the land route from India into Burma and make use of river transport.\n\nUnits of both corps of the Fourteenth Army crossed the Chindwin and attacked into the Shwebo plain, IV Corps on the left and XXXIII Corps on the right. After a few days, when it was realised that the Japanese had fallen back behind the Irrawaddy River, the plan was hastily changed. Now, only XXXIII Corps was to continue the attack into the Shwebo Plain, reinforced by the one division of IV Corps which had been committed across the Chindwin, while the main body of IV Corps was switched to the right flank, changing its axis of advance to the Gangaw Valley west of the Chindwin. It aimed to cross the Irrawaddy close to [[Pakokku]] and then capture the main Japanese line of communication centre of [[Meiktila]]. Diversionary measures (such as dummy radio traffic) were made to persuade the Japanese that both corps were still aimed at Mandalay. The new plan was a success. Allied air superiority and the thin Japanese presence on the ground meant that the Japanese were unaware of the strength of the force moving on Pakokku.\n\nDuring January and February, the XXXIII Corps (consisting of the British [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], 19th Indian Division, [[20th Infantry Division (India)|20th Indian Division]], [[268th Indian Infantry Brigade|268th Indian Brigade]] and the [[254th Indian Tank Brigade]]) cleared the Shwebo plain and established bridgeheads over the Irrawaddy River near Mandalay. There was heavy fighting, which attracted Japanese reserves and fixed their attention. Late in February, the [[7th Indian Infantry Division|7th Indian Division]], leading IV Corps, seized crossings at [[Nyaung-U|Nyaungu]] and [[Bagan|Pagan]] near Pakokku. While the 28th (East Africa) Infantry Brigade maintained diversionary pressure against Yenangyaung on the west bank of the river, the [[17th Infantry Division (India)|17th Indian Division]] and the [[255th Indian Tank Brigade|255th Indian Armoured brigade]] crossed through 7th Indian Division's bridgeheads and began advancing to Meiktila.\n\n===Meiktila===\nIn the dry season, central Burma is largely an open plain with sandy soil and there is also a good road network. The [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]] 17th Indian Division and the armoured brigade could move rapidly and unhindered in this open terrain, apparently taking the staffs at the various Japanese headquarters by surprise with this [[blitzkrieg]] manoeuvre. Reinforced by the third brigade of the 17th Indian Division which flew in to a captured airstrip, they struck Meiktila on 1 March and captured it in four days, despite resistance to the last man. In an oft-recounted incident, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches with aircraft bombs, with orders to detonate them when an enemy tank loomed over the trench.\n\nJapanese reinforcements arrived too late to relieve the garrison but they besieged the town in an attempt to recapture it and destroy the 17th Indian Division. Although eight Japanese regiments were eventually involved, they were mostly weak in numbers and drawn from five divisions, so their efforts were not coordinated. The Japanese Thirty-third Army HQ (re-titled The Army of the Decisive Battle) was assigned to take command in this vital sector but was unable to establish proper control.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=450}} The 17th Indian Division had been reinforced by a brigade of the [[Indian 5th Infantry Division|5th Indian Division]] landed by air. British tank-infantry forces sallied out of Meiktila to break up Japanese concentrations and by the end of the month the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and had lost most of their artillery, their chief anti-tank weapon. The Japanese broke off the attack and retreated to Pyawbwe.\n\nWhile the capture and siege of Meiktila took place, the 7th Indian Division, reinforced by a mechanised brigade of the 5th Indian Division, secured the Irrawaddy bridgehead, captured the important river port at [[Myingyan]] and began clearing the lines of communication to Meiktila.\n\n===Mandalay===\nWhile the Japanese were distracted by events at Meiktila, XXXIII Corps had renewed its attack on Mandalay. It fell to the 19th Indian Division on 20 March, though the Japanese held the former citadel, which the British called [[Mandalay Palace|Fort Dufferin]], for another week. Many of the historically and culturally significant areas of Mandalay, including the old royal palace, were burned to the ground. A great deal was lost by the Japanese choice to make a last stand in the city itself. The other divisions of XXXIII Corps simultaneously attacked from their bridgeheads across the Irrawaddy. The Japanese Fifteenth Army was reduced to small detachments and parties of stragglers making their way south, or east into the Shan States. With the fall of Mandalay (and of [[Pyin U Lwin|Maymyo]] to its east), the Japanese communications to the front in the north of Burma were cut and the Allied road link between India and China was therefore finally secured, though far too late to affect the course of the war in China.\n\nThe fall of Mandalay also precipitated the change of sides by the Burma National Army and open rebellion against the Japanese by other underground movements belonging to the Anti-Fascist Organisation.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=573}} In the last week of March Aung San, commander-in-chief of the Burma National Army, appeared in public in Burmese native dress instead of Japanese uniform.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=582}} Shortly afterwards, most of the Burma National Army paraded in Rangoon and then marched out of the city as if going to the front in Central Burma. They then rebelled against the Japanese on 27 March.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=584}}\n\n==Race for Rangoon==\n[[File:IND 004652 Stuart tank advancing on Rangoon.jpg|thumb|A [[Stuart light tank]] of an Indian cavalry regiment during the advance on Rangoon]]\nThough the Allied force had advanced successfully into central Burma, it was vital to capture the port of Rangoon before the monsoon rains began. The temporarily upgraded overland routes from India would disintegrate under heavy rain, which would also curtail flying and reduce the amount of supplies which could be delivered by air. Furthermore, South East Asia Command had been notified that many of the American transport aircraft allocated to the theatre would be withdrawn in June at the latest. The use of Rangoon would be necessary to meet the needs of the large army force and (as importantly) the food needs of the civilian population in the areas liberated.\n\nThe British 2nd Division and British 36th Division, both of which were understrength and could not readily be reinforced, were withdrawn to India to reduce the demand for supplies. (The 36th Division also exchanged the Indian battalions in one of its brigades for the depleted British battalions in the 20th Indian Division). The Indian XXXIII Corps, consisting of the 7th Indian Division and 20th Indian Division, mounted the Fourteenth Army's secondary drive down the Irrawaddy River valley, against the Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army. The IV Corps, of the 5th, 17th and 19th Indian divisions, made the main attack down the [[Sittang River]] valley.\n\nThe 17th Indian Division and 255th Armoured Brigade began the IV Corps advance on 6 April by striking from all sides at the delaying position held by the remnants of the Japanese Thirty-third Army at [[Pyawbwe Township|Pyawbwe]], while a flanking column (nicknamed \"Claudcol\") of tanks and mechanised infantry cut the main road behind them and attacked their rear.{{sfn|Allen|2005|p=461}} This column was initially delayed by the remnants of the Japanese 49th Division defending a village but bypassed them to defeat the remnants of the Japanese 53rd Division and destroy the last tanks remaining to the Japanese 14th Tank regiment. As they then turned north against the town of Pyawbwe itself, they attacked Lieutenant General Honda's headquarters but were not aware of the presence of an army headquarters and broke off to capture the town instead.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=465\u2013466}}\n\nFrom this point, the advance down the main road to Rangoon faced little organised opposition. At [[Pyinmana]], the town and the bridge were seized on 19 April before the Japanese could organise their defence. The Japanese Thirty-third Army headquarters was present in Pyinmana. From reports by agents, the Allies were aware this time of Honda's presence and his headquarters was attacked by tanks and aircraft. Lieutenant-General Honda and his staff escaped at night on foot but they now had little means of controlling the remnants of their formations.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=468\u2013471}}\n\n[[File:IND 004723.jpg|thumb|British [[3-inch mortar]] detachments support the 19th Indian Division advance along the Mawchi road, east of [[Toungoo]] (1944)]]\nSome units of the Japanese Fifteenth Army had reorganised in the Shan States and were reinforced by the Japanese 56th Division, which had been transferred from the northern front. They were ordered to move to [[Toungoo]] to block the road to Rangoon but a general uprising by Karen forces who had been organised and equipped by Force 136 delayed them long enough for the 5th Indian Division to reach the town first on 23 April. The Japanese briefly recaptured Toungoo once the 5th Indian Division had passed through but the 19th Indian Division, which was following up the leading units of IV Corps, captured the town again and slowly drove the Japanese back towards [[Mawchi]] to the east.\n\nThe 17th Indian Division resumed the lead of the advance and met a Japanese blocking force north of [[Pegu]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 25 April. The various line of communication troops, naval personnel and even Japanese civilians in Rangoon had been formed into the Japanese 105 Independent Mixed Brigade. This scratch formation used anti-tank mines improvised from aircraft bombs, anti-aircraft guns and suicide attacks with pole charges to delay the 17th Indian Division and then defended Pegu until 30 April, when it withdrew into the hills west of Pegu. The monsoon broke as the division resumed its advance on Rangoon and floods slowed the division.\n\n==Operation Dracula==\n{{Main|Operation Dracula}}\nIn the original conception of the plan to re-take Burma, it had been intended that the XV Indian Corps would make an amphibious assault codenamed [[Operation Dracula]] on Rangoon long before Fourteenth Army reached the capital, in order to ease supply problems. Lack of resources meant that ''Dracula'' was postponed and the operation was subsequently dropped in favour of a planned assault on [[Phuket Island]] off the [[Kra Isthmus]].\n\nSlim feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon to the last man through the monsoon, which would put the Fourteenth Army in a disastrous supply situation. In late March, he therefore asked for ''Dracula'' to be reinstated at short notice. However, Kimura had ordered Rangoon to be evacuated, starting on 22 April. Many troops were evacuated by sea, although British destroyers claimed several ships. Kimura's own HQ and the establishments of Ba Maw and Subhas Bose left by land, covered by the action of 105 Mixed Brigade at Pegu and proceeded to [[Mawlamyine|Moulmein]].\n\nOn 1 May, a Gurkha parachute battalion was dropped on [[Battle of Elephant Point|Elephant Point]] and cleared Japanese coastal defence batteries at the mouth of the [[Rangoon River]]. The 26th Indian Division started to land the next day as the monsoon began and took over Rangoon, which had seen an orgy of looting and lawlessness since the Japanese had left. The leading troops of the 17th and 26th Indian divisions met at Hlegu, {{convert|28|mi|km}} north of Rangoon, on 6 May.\n\n==Final operations==\n{{Main|Battle of the Sittang Bend|}}\nFollowing the capture of Rangoon, a new [[British Twelfth Army|Twelfth Army]] headquarters, commanded by Lieutenant General Stopford, was created from the XXXIII Indian Corps HQ to take control of the allied formations which were to remain in Burma, including IV Corps.\n\nThe remnants of the Japanese Burma Area Army remained in control of [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]] province. The Japanese Twenty-eighth Army, which had withdrawn from [[Arakan Province|Arakan]] and unsuccessfully resisted XXXIII Corps in the Irrawaddy valley, and the 105 Independent Brigade, were cut off in the [[Pegu Yomas]], a range of low jungle-covered hills between the Irrawaddy and Sittang rivers. They planned to break out and rejoin Burma Area Army. To cover this break-out, Kimura ordered Honda's Thirty-third Army to mount a diversionary offensive across the Sittang, although the entire army could muster the strength of barely a regiment. On 3 July, Honda's troops attacked British positions in the \"Sittang Bend\". On 10 July, after a battle for country which was almost entirely under chest-high water, both the Japanese and the 89th Indian Brigade withdrew.\n\nHonda, pressed by Kimura and his chief of staff, Tanaka, had attacked too early. Sakurai's Twenty-eighth Army was not ready to start the break-out until 17 July. The break-out was a disaster. The British had captured the Japanese plans from an officer killed making a final reconnaissance,{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=506\u2013507}} and had placed ambushes or artillery concentrations on the routes they were to use. Hundreds of men drowned trying to cross the swollen Sittang on improvised bamboo floats and rafts. Burmese guerrillas and bandits killed stragglers east of the river. The break-out cost the Japanese nearly 10,000 men, half the strength of Twenty-eighth Army. Some units of 105 Independent Brigade were almost entirely wiped out.{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=524\u2013525}} British and Indian casualties were minimal.\n\nFourteenth Army (now commanded by Lieutenant General [[Miles Dempsey]]) and XV Corps had returned to India to plan the next stage of the campaign to re-take south east Asia. A new corps, the [[Indian XXXIV Corps|XXXIV Corps]] under Lieutenant-General [[Ouvry Lindfield Roberts]], was raised and assigned to Fourteenth Army for further operations.\n\nThe next intended operation was to be an amphibious assault on the western coast of Malaya, codenamed [[Operation Zipper]]. The dropping of the atomic bombs forestalled ''Zipper'' but the operation was undertaken post-war as the quickest way of getting occupation troops into Malaya.\n\n==Maps==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=175>\nAllied Third Burma Campaign October 1943-May 1944.jpg|Third Burma campaign, October 1943 \u2013 May 1944\nAllied Third Burma Campaign June 1944-May 1945.jpg|Third Burma campaign, June 1944 \u2013 April 1945\nAllied Third Burma Campaign Apri 1-May 1945.jpg|Third Burma campaign, April\u2013May 1945\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Allen|2005}}\n|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The longest War |publisher=Dent Publishing |year=2005 |orig-year=1984 |isbn=0-460-02474-4}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Bayly |first=Christopher |last2=Harper |first2=Tim |title=Forgotten Armies: Britain's Asian Empire and the War with Japan |publisher=Penguin |year=2005 |isbn=0-14-029331-0}}\n* {{cite book |last=McLynn |first=Frank |series=Yale Library of Military History |title=The Burma Campaign: Disaster Into Triumph, 1942\u201345 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-300-17162-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Slim |first=William |authorlink=William Slim |year=1956 |title=Defeat Into Victory: An Account of the Burma campaign, 1942\u201345 with Maps and a Portrait |publisher=Cassell |location=London |oclc=843081328}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Fraser |first=George MacDonald |authorlink=George MacDonald Fraser |title=[[Quartered Safe Out Here]] |location=London |publisher=Harvill |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-00-710593-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hickey |first=Michael |title=The Unforgettable Army |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=Spellmount |year=1992 |isbn=1-873376-10-3}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hodsun |first=J.

2009-06-22.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former Comecon headquarters in Moscow.]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe Comecon was founded in 1949 by the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]. The primary factors in Comecon's formation appear to have been [[Joseph Stalin]]'s desire to cooperate and strengthen the international relationships at an economic level with the smaller states of Central Europe,<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> and which were now, increasingly, cut off from their traditional markets and suppliers in the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had remained interested in Marshall aid despite the requirements for a [[convertible currency]] and [[market economy|market economies]]. These requirements, which would inevitably have resulted in stronger economic ties to free European markets than to the Soviet Union, were unacceptable to Stalin, who in July 1947, ordered these communist-dominated governments to pull out of the Paris Conference on the European Recovery Programme. This has been described as \"the moment of truth\" in the post-[[World War II]] division of Europe.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 534\u201335.</ref> According to the Soviet view the \"Anglo-American bloc\" and \"American monopolists ... whose interests had nothing in common with those of the European people\" had spurned East-West collaboration within the framework agreed within the United Nations, that is, through the Economic Commission for Europe.<ref>Kaser, 1967, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nAs always, Stalin's precise motives are \"inscrutable\"<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 535.</ref> They may well have been \"more negative than positive\", with Stalin \"more anxious to keep other powers out of neighbouring [[buffer state]]s\u2026 than to integrate them.\"<ref>W. Wallace and R. Clarke, ''Comecon, Trade, and [[Western World|the West]]'', London: Pinter (1986), p. 1, quoted by Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Furthermore, [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]]'s notion of ostensibly nondiscriminatory treatment of trade partners was thought to be incompatible with notions of [[socialism|socialist]] solidarity.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> In any event, proposals for a [[customs union]] and economic integration of Central and Eastern Europe date back at least to the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (although many earlier proposals had been intended to stave off the Russian and/or communist \"menace\")<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> and the state-to-state trading inherent in centrally planned economies required some sort of coordination: otherwise, a [[monopoly|monopolist]] seller would face a [[monopsony|monopsonist]] buyer, with no structure to set prices.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 536\u201337.</ref>\n\nComecon was established at a Moscow economic conference January 5\u20138, 1949, at which the six founding member countries were represented; its foundation was publicly announced on January 25; [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] joined a month later and [[East Germany]] in 1950.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\"/>\n\nRecent research by the Romanian researcher Elena Dragomir suggests that Romania played a rather important role in the Comecon's creation in 1949. Dragomir argues that Romania was interested in the creation of a \u201csystem of cooperation\u201d to improve its trade relations with the other people's democracies, especially with those able to export industrial equipment and machinery to Romania.<ref>Elena Dragomir, \u2018The formation of the Soviet bloc\u2019s Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: Romania\u2019s involvement\u2019, Journal Cold War Studies, xiv (2012), 34\u201347.http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/JCWS_a_00190#.VQKof9KsX65.</ref> According to Dragomir, in December 1948, the Romanian leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] sent a letter to Stalin, proposing the creation of the Comecon.<ref>Elena Dragomir, 'The creation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance as seen from the Romanian Archives', in ''Historical Research'', September 2014. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2281.12083/abstract.</ref>\n{{confusing|date=December 2016}}\nAt first, planning seemed to be moving along rapidly. After pushing aside [[Nikolai Voznesensky]]'s [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic, price-based approach (see further discussion [[#How Comecon exchanges worked|below]]), the direction appeared to be toward a coordination of national economic plans, but with no coercive authority from Comecon itself. All decisions would require unanimous ratification, and even then governments would separately translate these into policy.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539\u201341.</ref> Then in summer 1950, probably unhappy with the favorable implications for the effective individual and collective [[sovereignty]] of the smaller states, Stalin \"seems to have taken [Comecon's] personnel by surprise,\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}} bringing operations to a nearly complete halt, as the Soviet Union moved domestically toward [[autarky]] and internationally toward an \"embassy system of meddling in other countries' affairs directly\" rather than by \"constitutional means\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}. Comecon's scope was officially limited in November 1950 to \"practical questions of facilitating trade.\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 541\u201342.</ref>\n\nOne important legacy of this brief period of activity was the [[Sofia principle]], adopted at the August 1949 Comecon council session in Bulgaria. This radically weakened [[intellectual property]] rights, making each country's technologies available to the others for a nominal charge that did little more than cover the cost of documentation. This, naturally, benefited the less industrialized Comecon countries, and especially the technologically lagging Soviet Union, at the expense of East Germany and Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, Hungary and Poland. (This principle would weaken after 1968, as it became clear that it discouraged new research\u2014and as the Soviet Union itself began to have more marketable technologies.)<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 542\u201343.</ref>\n\n===Khrushchev era===\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, Comecon again began to find its footing. In the early 1950s, all Comecon countries had adopted relatively [[Autarky|autarkic]] policies; now they began again to discuss developing complementary specialties, and in 1956, ten permanent standing committees arose, intended to facilitate coordination in these matters. The Soviet Union began to trade [[petroleum|oil]] for Comecon manufactured goods. There was much discussion of coordinating [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]]s.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\"/>\n\nHowever, once again, trouble arose. The [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Polish protests]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] led to major social and economic changes, including the 1957 abandonment of the [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)#Sixth Plan, 1956\u20131960|1956\u201360 Soviet five-year plan]], as the Comecon governments struggled to reestablish their legitimacy and popular support.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 543\u201334.</ref> The next few years saw a series of small steps toward increased trade and economic integration, including the introduction of the \"{{ill|convertible rouble|ru|\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c}}\", revised efforts at national specialization, and a 1959 charter modeled after the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 544.</ref>\n\nOnce again, efforts at transnational [[economic planning|central planning]] failed. In December 1961, a council session approved the Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour, which talked of closer coordination of plans and of \"concentrating production of similar products in one or several socialist countries.\" In November 1962, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] followed this up with a call for \"a common single planning organ.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 559.</ref> This was resisted by Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, but most emphatically by increasingly nationalistic Romania, which strongly rejected the notion that they should specialize in agriculture.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 560.</ref> In Central and Eastern Europe, only Bulgaria happily took on an assigned role (also agricultural, but in Bulgaria's case this had been the country's chosen direction even as an independent country in the 1930s).<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 553.</ref> Essentially, by the time the Soviet Union was calling for tight economic integration, they no longer had the power to impose it. Despite some slow headway\u2014integration increased in petroleum, electricity, and other technical/scientific sectors\u2014and the 1963 founding of an International Bank for Economic Co-operation, Comecon countries all increased trade with [[Western World|the West]] relatively more than with one another.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 560\u201361.</ref>\n\n===Brezhnev era===\nFrom its founding until 1967, Comecon had operated only on the basis of unanimous agreements. It had become increasingly obvious that the result was usually failure. In 1967, Comecon adopted the \"interested party principle\", under which any country could opt out of any project they chose, still allowing the other member states to use Comecon mechanisms to coordinate their activities. In principle, a country could still veto, but the hope was that they would typically choose just to step aside rather than either veto or be a reluctant participant.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 561.</ref> This aimed, at least in part, at allowing Romania to chart its own economic course without leaving Comecon entirely or bringing it to an impasse.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 566.</ref>\n\nAlso until the late 1960s, the official term for Comecon activities was ''cooperation''. The term ''integration'' was always avoided because of its connotations of monopolistic capitalist collusion. After the \"special\" council session of April 1969 and the development and adoption (in 1971) of the Comprehensive Program for the Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and the Further Development of Socialist Economic Integration by Comecon Member Countries, Comecon activities were officially termed ''integration'' (equalization of \"differences in relative scarcities of goods and services between states through the deliberate elimination of barriers to trade and other forms of interaction\"). Although such equalization had not been a pivotal point in the formation and implementation of Comecon's economic policies, improved economic integration had always been Comecon's goal.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 564, 566.</ref>\n\nWhile such integration was to remain a goal, and while Bulgaria became yet more tightly integrated with the Soviet Union, progress in this direction was otherwise continually frustrated by the national central planning prevalent in all Comecon countries, by the increasing diversity of its members (which by this time included Mongolia and would soon include Cuba) and by the \"overwhelming asymmetry\" and resulting distrust between the many small member states and the Soviet \"superstate\" which, in 1983, \"accounted for 88 percent of Comecon's territory and 60 percent of its population.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 564.</ref>\n\nIn this period, there were some efforts to move away from central planning, by establishing intermediate industrial associations and combines in various countries (which were often empowered to negotiate their own international deals). However, these groupings typically proved \"unwieldy, conservative, risk-averse, and bureaucratic,\" reproducing the problems they had been intended to solve.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 568\u201369.</ref>\n\nOne economic success of the 1970s was the development of Soviet oil fields. While doubtless \"(Central and) [[East Europeans]] resented having to defray some of the costs of developing the economy of their hated overlord and oppressor,\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 568.</ref> they benefited from low prices for fuel and other mineral products. As a result, Comecon economies generally showed strong growth in the mid-1970s. They were largely unaffected by the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\"/> Another short-term economic gain in this period was that ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' brought opportunities for investment and technology transfers from [[Western World|the West]]. This also led to an importation of [[Western World|Western]] cultural attitudes, especially in Central Europe. However, many undertakings based on [[Western World|Western]] technology were less than successful (for example, Poland's [[Ursus Factory|Ursus]] tractor factory did not do well with technology licensed from [[Massey Ferguson]]); other investment was wasted on luxuries for the party elite, and most Comecon countries ended up indebted to [[Western World|the West]] when capital flows died out as ''d\u00e9tente'' faded in the late 1970s, and from 1979 to 1983, all of Comecon experienced a recession from which (with the possible exceptions of East Germany and Bulgaria) they never recovered in the Communist era. Romania and Poland experienced major declines in the standard of living.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 571\u201372.</ref>\n\n===Perestroika===\nThe 1985 Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress and the rise to power of Soviet general secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] increased Soviet influence in Comecon operations and led to attempts to give Comecon some degree of supranational authority. The Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress was designed to improve economic cooperation through the development of a more efficient and interconnected scientific and technical base.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> This was the era of ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\"), the last attempt to put the Comecon economies on a sound economic footing.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 579.</ref> Gorbachev and his economic mentor [[Abel Aganbegyan]] hoped to make \"revolutionary changes\" in the economy, foreseeing that \"science will increasingly become a 'direct productive force', as Marx foresaw\u2026 By the year 2000\u2026 the renewal of plant and machinery\u2026 will be running at 6 percent or more per year.\"<ref>Abel Aganbegyan, quoted in Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref>\n\nThe program was not a success. \"The Gorbachev regime made too many commitments on too many fronts, thereby overstretching and overheating the Soviet economy. Bottlenecks and shortages were not relieved but exacerbated, while the (Central and) East European members of Comecon resented being asked to contribute scarce capital to projects that were chiefly of interest to the Soviet Union\u2026\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref> Furthermore, the liberalization that by June 25, 1988 allowed Comecon countries to negotiate trade treaties directly with the European Community (the renamed EEC), and the \"[[Sinatra doctrine]]\" under which the Soviet Union allowed that change would be the exclusive affair of each individual country marked the beginning of the end for Comecon. Although the [[Revolutions of 1989]] did not formally end Comecon, and the Soviet government itself lasted until 1991, the March 1990 meeting in Prague was little more than a formality, discussing the coordination of non-existent five-year plans. From January 1, 1991, the countries shifted their dealings with one another to a hard currency market basis. The result was a radical decrease in trade with one another, as \"(Central and) Eastern Europe\u2026 exchanged asymmetrical trade dependence on the Soviet Union for an equally asymmetrical commercial dependence on the European Community.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 580\u201382; the quotation is on p. 582.</ref>\n\nThe final Comecon council session took place on June 28, 1991, in [[Budapest]], and led to an agreement to disband within 90 days.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 582.</ref> The Soviet Union itself was dismantled on December 26, 1991.\n\n===Post-Cold War activity after Comecon===\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and communist rule in Eastern Europe, [[East Germany]] (now unified with Germany) automatically joined the [[European Union]] (then the European Community) in 1990. The [[Baltic States]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]), [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]] joined the EU in 2004, followed by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in 2007 and [[Croatia]] in 2013. To date, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany (former GDR), Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are now members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. All four Central European states are now members of the [[Visegrad Group]].\n\nRussia, the successor to the Soviet Union along with [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] founded the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] which consists of the ex-Soviet republics. The country also leads the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] with [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] with [[Armenia]], Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Along with Ukraine, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Moldova]] are also part of the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]].\n\n[[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] joined the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] in 1995 and 1997 respectively.\n\n==Membership==\n===Full members===\n<!--List of Member States-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

countries{{snd}} the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]{{snd}} were invited to participate as observers in Comecon sessions. Although Mongolia and Vietnam later gained full membership, China stopped attending Comecon sessions after 1961. Yugoslavia negotiated a form of associate status in the organization, specified in its 1964 agreement with Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> Collectively, the members of the Comecon did not display the necessary prerequisites for economic integration: their level of industrialization was low and uneven, with a single dominant member (the Soviet Union) producing 70% of the community national product.<ref>Zwass, 1989, p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, there were ten full members: the Soviet Union, six East European countries, and three extra-regional members. Geography, therefore, no longer united Comecon members. Wide variations in economic size and level of economic development also tended to generate divergent interests among the member countries. All these factors combined to give rise to significant differences in the member states' expectations about the benefits to be derived from membership in Comecon. Unity was provided instead by political and ideological factors. All Comecon members were \"united by a commonality of fundamental class interests and the ideology of Marxism-Leninism\" and had common approaches to economic ownership (state versus private) and management (plan versus market). In 1949 the ruling communist parties of the founding states were also linked internationally through the [[Cominform]], from which [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] [[Informbiro|had been expelled]] the previous year. Although the Cominform was disbanded in 1956, interparty links continued to be strong among Comecon members, and all participated in periodic international conferences of communist parties. Comecon provided a mechanism through which its leading member, the Soviet Union, sought to foster economic links with and among its closest political and military allies. The East European members of Comecon were also militarily allied with the Soviet Union in the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThere were three kinds of relationships &ndash; besides the 10 full memberships &ndash; with the Comecon:\n\n* Yugoslavia was the only country considered to have associate member status. On the basis of the 1964 agreement, Yugoslavia participated in twenty-one of the thirty-two key Comecon institutions as if it were a full member.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* [[Finland]], [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mexico]], and [[Nicaragua]] had a cooperant status with Comecon. Because the governments of these countries were not empowered to conclude agreements in the name of private companies, the governments did not take part in Comecon operations. They were represented in Comecon by commissions made up of members of the government and the business community. The commissions were empowered to sign various \"framework\" agreements with Comecon's Joint Commission on Cooperation.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* After 1956, Comecon allowed certain countries with communist or pro-Soviet governments to attend sessions as observers. In November 1986, delegations from [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Laos]], and [[South Yemen]] attended the 42nd Council Session as observers.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n==Exchange==\nWorking with neither meaningful [[exchange rate]]s nor a market economy, Comecon countries had to look to world markets as a reference point for prices, but unlike agents acting in a market, prices tended to be stable over a period of years, rather than constantly fluctuating, which assisted central planning. Also, there was a tendency to underprice raw materials relative to the manufactured goods produced in many of the Comecon countries.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 537.</ref>\n\nInternational barter helped preserve the Comecon countries' scarce [[hard currency]] reserves. In strict economic terms, barter inevitably harmed countries whose goods would have brought higher prices in the free market or whose imports could have been obtained more cheaply and benefitted those for whom it was the other way around. Still, all of the Comecon countries gained some stability, and the governments gained some legitimacy,<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\"/> and in many ways this stability and protection from the world market was viewed, at least in the early years of Comecon, as an advantage of the system, as was the formation of stronger ties with other socialist countries.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 538.</ref>\n\nWithin Comecon, there were occasional struggles over just how this system should work. Early on, [[Nikolai Voznesensky]] pushed for a more \"law-governed\" and [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic price-based approach. However, with the August 1948 death of [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Voznesensky lost his patron and was soon accused of treason as part of the [[Leningrad Affair]]; within two years he was dead in prison. Instead, what won out was a \"physical planning\" approach that strengthened the role of central governments over technocrats.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539.</ref> At the same time, the effort to create a single regime of planning \"common economic organization\" with the ability to set plans throughout the Comecon region also came to nought. A protocol to create such a system was signed January 18, 1949, but never ratified.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 540.</ref> While historians are not unanimous on why this was stymied, it clearly threatened the sovereignty not only of the smaller states but even of the Soviet Union itself, since an international body would have had real power; Stalin clearly preferred informal means of intervention in the other Comecon states.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 540\u201341.</ref> This lack of either rationality or international central planning tended to promote [[autarky]] in each Comecon country because none fully trusted the others to deliver goods and services.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\"/>\n\nWith few exceptions, foreign trade in the Comecon countries was a [[state monopoly]], and the state agencies and captive trading companies were often corrupt. Even at best, this tended to put several removes between a producer and any foreign customer, limiting the ability to learn to adjust to foreign customers' needs. Furthermore, there was often strong political pressure to keep the best products for domestic use in each country. From the early 1950s to Comecon's demise in the early 1990s, intra-Comecon trade, except for Soviet petroleum, was in steady decline.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 565.</ref>\n\n===Oil transfers===\nBeginning no later than the early 1970s,<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 569.</ref> Soviet petroleum and [[natural gas]] were routinely transferred within Comecon at below-market rates. Most [[Western World|Western]] commentators have viewed this as implicit, politically motivated subsidization of shaky economies to defuse discontent and reward compliance with Soviet wishes.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 570 makes the assertion about this being the dominant view, and cites several examples.</ref> Other commentators say that this may not have been deliberate policy, noting that whenever prices differ from world market prices, there will be winners and losers. They argue that this may have been simply an unforeseen consequence of two factors: the slow adjustment of Comecon prices during a time of rising oil and gas prices, and the fact that mineral resources were abundant in the Comecon sphere, relative to manufactured goods. A possible point of comparison is that there were also winners and losers under EEC agricultural policy in the same period.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 570\u201371.</ref> Russian and Kazakh oil kept the Comecon countries' oil prices low when the [[1973 oil crisis]] quadrupled Western oil prices.\n\n===Ineffective production===\nThe organization of Comecon was officially focused on common expansion of states, more effective production and building relationships between countries within. And as in every planned economy, operations did not reflect state of market, innovations, availability of items or the specific needs of a country. One example came from former Czechoslovakia. In the 1970s, the Communist party of Czechoslovakia finally realized that there was a need for underground trains. Czechoslovak designers projected a cheap but technologically innovative underground train. The train was a state-of-the-art project, capable of moving underground or on the surface using standard rails, had a high number of passenger seats, and was lightweight. According to the designers, the train was technologically more advanced than the trains used in New York's Subway, London's Tube or the Paris Metro. However, due to the plan of Comecon, older Soviet trains were used, which guaranteed profit for the Soviet Union and work for workers in Soviet factories. That economical change lead to the cancellation of the R1 trains by A. Honz\u00edk. The Comecon plan, though more profitable for the Soviets, if less resourceful for the Czechs and Slovaks, forced the Czechoslovak government to buy trains \"E\u010ds (81-709)\" and \"81-71\", both of which were designed in early 1950s and were heavy, unreliable and expensive.

Poland was a manufacturer of light helicopters for Comecon countries ([[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] of the Soviet design). The USSR developed their own model [[Kamov Ka-26]] and Romania produced French helicopters under license for their own market. In a formal or informal way, often the countries were discouraged from developing their own designs that competed with the main Comecon design.\n\n==Structure==\n\nAlthough not formally part of the organization's hierarchy, the Conference of First Secretaries of Communist and Workers' Parties and of the Heads of Government of the Comecon Member Countries was Comecon's most important organ. These party and government leaders gathered for conference meetings regularly to discuss topics of mutual interest. Because of the rank of conference participants, their decisions had considerable influence on the actions taken by Comecon and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe official hierarchy of Comecon consisted of the Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the Executive Committee of the Council, the Secretariat of the Council, four council committees, twenty-four standing commissions, six interstate conferences, two scientific institutes, and several associated organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===The Session===\nThe Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, officially the highest Comecon organ, examined fundamental problems of economic integration and directed the activities of the Secretariat and other subordinate organizations. Delegations from each Comecon member country attended these meetings. Prime ministers usually headed the delegations, which met during the second quarter of each year in a member country's capital (the location of the meeting was determined by a system of rotation based on [[Cyrillic script]]). All interested parties had to consider recommendations handed down by the Session. A [[treaty]] or other kind of legal agreement implemented adopted recommendations. Comecon itself might adopt decisions only on organizational and procedural matters pertaining to itself and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nEach country appointed one permanent representative to maintain relations between members and Comecon between annual meetings. An extraordinary Session, such as the one in December 1985, might be held with the consent of at least one-third of the members. Such meetings usually took place in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===Executive Committee===\nThe highest executive organ in Comecon, the Executive Committee, was entrusted with elaborating policy recommendations and supervising their implementation between sessions. In addition, it supervised work on plan coordination and scientific-technical cooperation. Composed of one representative from each member country, usually a deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Executive Committee met quarterly, usually in Moscow. In 1971 and 1974, the Executive Committee acquired economic departments that ranked above the standing commissions. These economic departments considerably strengthened the authority and importance of the Executive Committee.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===Other entities===\nThere were four council committees: Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning, Council Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, Council Committee for Cooperation in Material and Technical Supply, and Council Committee for Cooperation in Machine Building. Their mission was \"to ensure the comprehensive examination and a multilateral settlement of the major problems of cooperation among member countries in the economy, science, and technology.\" All committees were headquartered in Moscow and usually met there. These committees advised the standing commissions, the Secretariat, the interstate conferences, and the scientific institutes in their areas of specialization. Their jurisdiction was generally wider than that of the standing commissions because they had the right to make policy recommendations to other Comecon organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning was the most important of the four. It coordinated the national economic plans of Comecon members. As such, it ranked in importance only after the Session and the Executive Committee. Made up of the chairmen of Comecon members' national central planning offices, the Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning drew up draft agreements for joint projects, adopted a resolution approving these projects, and recommended approval to the concerned parties. If its decisions were not subject to approval by national governments and parties, this committee would be considered Comecon's supranational planning body.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe international Secretariat, Comecon's only permanent body, was Comecon's primary economic research and administrative organ. The secretary, who has been a Soviet official since Comecon creation, was the official Comecon representative to Comecon member states and to other states and international organizations. Subordinate to the secretary were his deputy and the various departments of the Secretariat, which generally corresponded to the standing commissions. The Secretariat's responsibilities included preparation and organization of Comecon sessions and other meetings conducted under the auspices of Comecon; compilation of digests on Comecon activities; conduct of economic and other research for Comecon members; and preparation of recommendations on various issues concerning Comecon operations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nIn 1956, eight standing commissions were set up to help Comecon make recommendations pertaining to specific economic sectors. The commissions have been rearranged and renamed a number of times since the establishment of the first eight. In 1986 there were twenty-four standing commissions, each headquartered in the capital of a member country and headed by one of that country's leading authorities in the field addressed by the commission. The Secretariat supervised the actual operations of the commissions. The standing commissions had authority only to make recommendations, which had then to be approved by the Executive Committee, presented to the Session, and ratified by the interested member countries. Commissions usually met twice a year in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe six interstate conferences (on water management, internal trade, legal matters, inventions and [[patents]], pricing, and labor affairs) served as forums for discussing shared issues and experiences. They were purely consultative and generally acted in an advisory capacity to the Executive Committee or its specialized committees.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe scientific institutes on standardization and on economic problems of the world economic system concerned themselves with theoretical problems of international cooperation. Both were headquartered in Moscow and were staffed by experts from various member countries.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===Affiliated agencies===\n[[File:Budapest, Hungary Elisabeth Bridge Medal 1974.jpg|thumb|1974 Medallion 10th Anniversary of Intermetall, that was founded in 1964 in Budapest]]\n\nSeveral affiliated agencies, having a variety of relationships with Comecon, existed outside the official Comecon hierarchy. They served to develop \"direct links between appropriate bodies and organizations of Comecon member countries.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThese affiliated agencies were divided into two categories: intergovernmental economic organizations (which worked on a higher level in the member countries and generally dealt with a wider range of managerial and coordinative activities) and international economic organizations (which worked closer to the operational level of research, production, or trade). A few examples of the former are the [[International Bank for Economic Cooperation]] (managed the transferable ruble system), the [[International Investment Bank]] (in charge of financing joint projects), and [[Intermetall]] (encouraged cooperation in [[ferrous metallurgy]]).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nInternational economic organizations generally took the form of either joint enterprises, international economic associations or unions, or international economic partnerships. The latter included [[Interatominstrument]] (nuclear machinery producers), [[Intertekstilmash]] (textile machinery producers), and Haldex (a Hungarian-Polish joint enterprise for reprocessing coal slag).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n==Nature of operation==\n\nComecon was an interstate organization through which members attempted to coordinate economic activities of mutual interest and to develop multilateral economic, scientific, and technical cooperation:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* The Charter (1959) stated that \"the sovereign equality of all members\" was fundamental to the organization and procedures of Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\"/>\n* The Comprehensive Program further emphasized that the processes of integration of members' economies were \"completely voluntary and do not involve the creation of supranational bodies.\" Hence under the provisions of the Charter, each country had the right to equal representation and one vote in all organs of Comecon, regardless of the country's economic size or the size of its contribution to Comecon's budget.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* From 1967, the \"interestedness\" provisions of the Charter reinforced the principle of \"sovereign equality.\" Comecon's recommendations and decisions could be adopted only upon agreement among the interested members, and each had the right to declare its \"interest\" in any matter under consideration.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>\n* Furthermore, in the words of the Charter (as revised in 1967), \"recommendations and decisions shall not apply to countries that have declared that they have no interest in a particular matter.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>\n* Although Comecon recognized the principle of unanimity, from 1967 disinterested parties did not have a veto but rather the right to abstain from participation. A declaration of disinterest could not block a project unless the disinterested party's participation was vital. Otherwise, the Charter implied that the interested parties could proceed without the abstaining member, affirming that a country that had declared a lack of interest \"may subsequently adhere to the recommendations and decisions adopted by the remaining members of the Council.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> However, a member country could also declare an \"interest\" and exercise a veto.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>\n\nOver the years of its functioning, Comecon acted more as an instrument of mutual economic assistance than a means of economic integration, with multilateralism as an unachievable goal.<ref>Zwass, 1989, pp. 14\u201321</ref> J.F. Brown, a British historian of Eastern Europe, cited Vladimir Sobell, a Czech-born economist, for the view that Comecon was an \"international protection system\" rather than an \"international trade system\", in contrast with the EEC, which was essentially the latter.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\">{{Citation |last=Brown |first=J.F. |year=1988 |title=Eastern Europe and Communist Rule |publisher=Duke University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=vlhpAAAAMAAJ |isbn=978-0882308418}}, pp. 145\u201356.</ref> Whereas the latter was interested in production efficiency and in allocation via market prices, the former was interested in bilateral aid to fulfill central planning goals.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/> Writing in 1988, Brown stated that many people in both the West and the East had assumed that a trade and efficiency approach was what Comecon was meant to pursue, which might make it an international trade system more like the EEC, and that some economists in Hungary and Poland had advocated such an approach in the 1970s and 1980s, but that \"it would need a transformation of every [Eastern Bloc] economy along Hungarian lines [i.e., only partly centrally planned] to enable a market-guided Comecon to work. And any change along those lines has been ideologically unacceptable up to now.\"<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/>\n\n==Comecon versus the European Economic Community==\n[[File:Europe 1988.svg|thumb|European [[trade bloc]]s as of the late 1980s. EEC member states are marked in blue, [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] &ndash; green, and Comecon &ndash; red.]]\n\nAlthough Comecon was loosely referred to as the \"[[European Economic Community]] (EEC) of (Central and) Eastern Europe,\" important contrasts existed between the two organizations. Both organizations administered economic integration; however, their economic structure, size, balance, and influence differed:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the EEC incorporated the 270 million people in Europe into economic association through intergovernmental agreements aimed at maximizing profits and economic efficiency on a national and international scale. The EEC was a supranational body that could adopt decisions (such as removing tariffs) and enforce them. Activity by members was based on initiative and enterprise from below (on the individual or enterprise level) and was strongly influenced by market forces.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nComecon joined together 450 million people in 10 countries and on 3 continents. The level of industrialization from country to country differed greatly: the organization linked two underdeveloped countries &ndash; Mongolia, and Vietnam &ndash; with some highly industrialized states. Likewise, a large national income difference existed between European and non-European members. The physical size, military power, and political and economic resource base of the Soviet Union made it the dominant member. In trade among Comecon members, the Soviet Union usually provided raw materials, and Central and East European countries provided finished equipment and machinery. The three underdeveloped Comecon members had a special relationship with the other seven. Comecon realized disproportionately more political than economic gains from its heavy contributions to these three countries' underdeveloped economies. Economic integration or \"plan coordination\" formed the basis of Comecon's activities. In this system, which mirrored the member countries' planned economies, the decisions handed down from above ignored the influences of market forces or private initiative. Comecon had no supranational authority to make decisions or to implement them. Its recommendations could only be adopted with the full concurrence of interested parties and (from 1967<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>) did not affect those members who declared themselves disinterested parties.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nAs remarked above, most Comecon foreign trade was a state monopoly, placing several barriers between a producer and a foreign customer.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\"/> Unlike the EEC, where treaties mostly limited government activity and allowed the market to integrate economies across national lines, Comecon needed to develop agreements that called for positive government action. Furthermore, while private trade slowly limited or erased national rivalries in the EEC, state-to-state trade in Comecon reinforced national rivalries and resentments.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 567.</ref>\n\n==Prices, exchange rates, coordination of national plans==\n:''See: [[Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration]]''\n\n==International relations within the Comecon==\n:''See: [[International relations within the Comecon]]''\n\nSoviet domination of Comecon was a function of its economic, political, and military power. The Soviet Union possessed 90 percent of Comecon members' land and energy resources, 70 percent of their population, 65 percent of their national income, and industrial and military capacities second in the world only to those of the United States .{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}The location of many Comecon committee headquarters in Moscow and the large number of Soviet nationals in positions of authority also testified to the power of the Soviet Union within the organization.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nSoviet efforts to exercise political power over its Comecon partners, however, were met with determined opposition. The \"sovereign equality\" of members, as described in the Comecon Charter, assured members that if they did not wish to participate in a Comecon project, they might abstain. Central and East European members frequently invoked this principle in fear that economic interdependence would further reduce political sovereignty. Thus, neither Comecon nor the Soviet Union as a major force within Comecon had supranational authority. Although this fact ensured some degree of freedom from Soviet economic domination of the other members, it also deprived Comecon of necessary power to achieve maximum economic efficiency.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Soviet Union|Economy}}\n* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]\n* [[Bilateral trade]]\n* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]\n* [[Economy of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Eurasian Economic Union]]\n* [[European Union]]\n* [[History of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Non-Aligned Movement]]\n* [[Planned economy]]\n* [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]\n* [[Spartakiad]]\n* [[ALBA]]\n* [[Visegrad Group]]\n* [[Warsaw Pact]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{loc}}\n* Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, ''A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change'', Routledge, 1998. {{ISBN|0-415-16111-8}}.\n* Brine, Jenny J., ed.

2009-06-22.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former Comecon headquarters in Moscow.]]\n\n===Foundation===\nThe Comecon was founded in 1949 by the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]. The primary factors in Comecon's formation appear to have been [[Joseph Stalin]]'s desire to cooperate and strengthen the international relationships at an economic level with the smaller states of Central Europe,<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> and which were now, increasingly, cut off from their traditional markets and suppliers in the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had remained interested in Marshall aid despite the requirements for a [[convertible currency]] and [[market economy|market economies]]. These requirements, which would inevitably have resulted in stronger economic ties to free European markets than to the Soviet Union, were unacceptable to Stalin, who in July 1947, ordered these communist-dominated governments to pull out of the Paris Conference on the European Recovery Programme. This has been described as \"the moment of truth\" in the post-[[World War II]] division of Europe.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 534\u201335.</ref> According to the Soviet view the \"Anglo-American bloc\" and \"American monopolists ... whose interests had nothing in common with those of the European people\" had spurned East-West collaboration within the framework agreed within the United Nations, that is, through the Economic Commission for Europe.<ref>Kaser, 1967, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nAs always, Stalin's precise motives are \"inscrutable\"<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 535.</ref> They may well have been \"more negative than positive\", with Stalin \"more anxious to keep other powers out of neighbouring [[buffer state]]s\u2026 than to integrate them.\"<ref>W. Wallace and R. Clarke, ''Comecon, Trade, and [[Western World|the West]]'', London: Pinter (1986), p. 1, quoted by Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Furthermore, [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]]'s notion of ostensibly nondiscriminatory treatment of trade partners was thought to be incompatible with notions of [[socialism|socialist]] solidarity.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> In any event, proposals for a [[customs union]] and economic integration of Central and Eastern Europe date back at least to the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (although many earlier proposals had been intended to stave off the Russian and/or communist \"menace\")<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> and the state-to-state trading inherent in centrally planned economies required some sort of coordination: otherwise, a [[monopoly|monopolist]] seller would face a [[monopsony|monopsonist]] buyer, with no structure to set prices.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 536\u201337.</ref>\n\nComecon was established at a Moscow economic conference January 5\u20138, 1949, at which the six founding member countries were represented; its foundation was publicly announced on January 25; [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] joined a month later and [[East Germany]] in 1950.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\"/>\n\nRecent research by the Romanian researcher Elena Dragomir suggests that Romania played a rather important role in the Comecon's creation in 1949. Dragomir argues that Romania was interested in the creation of a \u201csystem of cooperation\u201d to improve its trade relations with the other people's democracies, especially with those able to export industrial equipment and machinery to Romania.<ref>Elena Dragomir, \u2018The formation of the Soviet bloc\u2019s Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: Romania\u2019s involvement\u2019, Journal Cold War Studies, xiv (2012), 34\u201347.http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/JCWS_a_00190#.VQKof9KsX65.</ref> According to Dragomir, in December 1948, the Romanian leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] sent a letter to Stalin, proposing the creation of the Comecon.<ref>Elena Dragomir, 'The creation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance as seen from the Romanian Archives', in ''Historical Research'', September 2014. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2281.12083/abstract.</ref>\n{{confusing|date=December 2016}}\nAt first, planning seemed to be moving along rapidly. After pushing aside [[Nikolai Voznesensky]]'s [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic, price-based approach (see further discussion [[#How Comecon exchanges worked|below]]), the direction appeared to be toward a coordination of national economic plans, but with no coercive authority from Comecon itself. All decisions would require unanimous ratification, and even then governments would separately translate these into policy.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539\u201341.</ref> Then in summer 1950, probably unhappy with the favorable implications for the effective individual and collective [[sovereignty]] of the smaller states, Stalin \"seems to have taken [Comecon's] personnel by surprise,\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}} bringing operations to a nearly complete halt, as the Soviet Union moved domestically toward [[autarky]] and internationally toward an \"embassy system of meddling in other countries' affairs directly\" rather than by \"constitutional means\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}. Comecon's scope was officially limited in November 1950 to \"practical questions of facilitating trade.\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 541\u201342.</ref>\n\nOne important legacy of this brief period of activity was the [[Sofia principle]], adopted at the August 1949 Comecon council session in Bulgaria. This radically weakened [[intellectual property]] rights, making each country's technologies available to the others for a nominal charge that did little more than cover the cost of documentation. This, naturally, benefited the less industrialized Comecon countries, and especially the technologically lagging Soviet Union, at the expense of East Germany and Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, Hungary and Poland. (This principle would weaken after 1968, as it became clear that it discouraged new research\u2014and as the Soviet Union itself began to have more marketable technologies.)<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 542\u201343.</ref>\n\n===Khrushchev era===\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, Comecon again began to find its footing. In the early 1950s, all Comecon countries had adopted relatively [[Autarky|autarkic]] policies; now they began again to discuss developing complementary specialties, and in 1956, ten permanent standing committees arose, intended to facilitate coordination in these matters. The Soviet Union began to trade [[petroleum|oil]] for Comecon manufactured goods. There was much discussion of coordinating [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]]s.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\"/>\n\nHowever, once again, trouble arose. The [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Polish protests]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] led to major social and economic changes, including the 1957 abandonment of the [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)#Sixth Plan, 1956\u20131960|1956\u201360 Soviet five-year plan]], as the Comecon governments struggled to reestablish their legitimacy and popular support.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 543\u201334.</ref> The next few years saw a series of small steps toward increased trade and economic integration, including the introduction of the \"{{ill|convertible rouble|ru|\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c}}\", revised efforts at national specialization, and a 1959 charter modeled after the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 544.</ref>\n\nOnce again, efforts at transnational [[economic planning|central planning]] failed. In December 1961, a council session approved the Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour, which talked of closer coordination of plans and of \"concentrating production of similar products in one or several socialist countries.\" In November 1962, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] followed this up with a call for \"a common single planning organ.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 559.</ref> This was resisted by Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, but most emphatically by increasingly nationalistic Romania, which strongly rejected the notion that they should specialize in agriculture.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 560.</ref> In Central and Eastern Europe, only Bulgaria happily took on an assigned role (also agricultural, but in Bulgaria's case this had been the country's chosen direction even as an independent country in the 1930s).<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 553.</ref> Essentially, by the time the Soviet Union was calling for tight economic integration, they no longer had the power to impose it. Despite some slow headway\u2014integration increased in petroleum, electricity, and other technical/scientific sectors\u2014and the 1963 founding of an International Bank for Economic Co-operation, Comecon countries all increased trade with [[Western World|the West]] relatively more than with one another.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 560\u201361.</ref>\n\n===Brezhnev era===\nFrom its founding until 1967, Comecon had operated only on the basis of unanimous agreements. It had become increasingly obvious that the result was usually failure. In 1967, Comecon adopted the \"interested party principle\", under which any country could opt out of any project they chose, still allowing the other member states to use Comecon mechanisms to coordinate their activities. In principle, a country could still veto, but the hope was that they would typically choose just to step aside rather than either veto or be a reluctant participant.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 561.</ref> This aimed, at least in part, at allowing Romania to chart its own economic course without leaving Comecon entirely or bringing it to an impasse.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 566.</ref>\n\nAlso until the late 1960s, the official term for Comecon activities was ''cooperation''. The term ''integration'' was always avoided because of its connotations of monopolistic capitalist collusion. After the \"special\" council session of April 1969 and the development and adoption (in 1971) of the Comprehensive Program for the Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and the Further Development of Socialist Economic Integration by Comecon Member Countries, Comecon activities were officially termed ''integration'' (equalization of \"differences in relative scarcities of goods and services between states through the deliberate elimination of barriers to trade and other forms of interaction\"). Although such equalization had not been a pivotal point in the formation and implementation of Comecon's economic policies, improved economic integration had always been Comecon's goal.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 564, 566.</ref>\n\nWhile such integration was to remain a goal, and while Bulgaria became yet more tightly integrated with the Soviet Union, progress in this direction was otherwise continually frustrated by the national central planning prevalent in all Comecon countries, by the increasing diversity of its members (which by this time included Mongolia and would soon include Cuba) and by the \"overwhelming asymmetry\" and resulting distrust between the many small member states and the Soviet \"superstate\" which, in 1983, \"accounted for 88 percent of Comecon's territory and 60 percent of its population.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 564.</ref>\n\nIn this period, there were some efforts to move away from central planning, by establishing intermediate industrial associations and combines in various countries (which were often empowered to negotiate their own international deals). However, these groupings typically proved \"unwieldy, conservative, risk-averse, and bureaucratic,\" reproducing the problems they had been intended to solve.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 568\u201369.</ref>\n\nOne economic success of the 1970s was the development of Soviet oil fields. While doubtless \"(Central and) East Europeans resented having to defray some of the costs of developing the economy of their hated overlord and oppressor,\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 568.</ref> they benefited from low prices for fuel and other mineral products. As a result, Comecon economies generally showed strong growth in the mid-1970s. They were largely unaffected by the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\"/> Another short-term economic gain in this period was that ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' brought opportunities for investment and technology transfers from [[Western World|the West]]. This also led to an importation of [[Western World|Western]] cultural attitudes, especially in Central Europe. However, many undertakings based on [[Western World|Western]] technology were less than successful (for example, Poland's [[Ursus Factory|Ursus]] tractor factory did not do well with technology licensed from [[Massey Ferguson]]); other investment was wasted on luxuries for the party elite, and most Comecon countries ended up indebted to [[Western World|the West]] when capital flows died out as ''d\u00e9tente'' faded in the late 1970s, and from 1979 to 1983, all of Comecon experienced a recession from which (with the possible exceptions of East Germany and Bulgaria) they never recovered in the Communist era. Romania and Poland experienced major declines in the standard of living.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 571\u201372.</ref>\n\n===Perestroika===\nThe 1985 Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress and the rise to power of Soviet general secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] increased Soviet influence in Comecon operations and led to attempts to give Comecon some degree of supranational authority. The Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress was designed to improve economic cooperation through the development of a more efficient and interconnected scientific and technical base.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> This was the era of ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\"), the last attempt to put the Comecon economies on a sound economic footing.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 579.</ref> Gorbachev and his economic mentor [[Abel Aganbegyan]] hoped to make \"revolutionary changes\" in the economy, foreseeing that \"science will increasingly become a 'direct productive force', as Marx foresaw\u2026 By the year 2000\u2026 the renewal of plant and machinery\u2026 will be running at 6 percent or more per year.\"<ref>Abel Aganbegyan, quoted in Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref>\n\nThe program was not a success. \"The Gorbachev regime made too many commitments on too many fronts, thereby overstretching and overheating the Soviet economy. Bottlenecks and shortages were not relieved but exacerbated, while the (Central and) East European members of Comecon resented being asked to contribute scarce capital to projects that were chiefly of interest to the Soviet Union\u2026\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref> Furthermore, the liberalization that by June 25, 1988 allowed Comecon countries to negotiate trade treaties directly with the European Community (the renamed EEC), and the \"[[Sinatra doctrine]]\" under which the Soviet Union allowed that change would be the exclusive affair of each individual country marked the beginning of the end for Comecon. Although the [[Revolutions of 1989]] did not formally end Comecon, and the Soviet government itself lasted until 1991, the March 1990 meeting in Prague was little more than a formality, discussing the coordination of non-existent five-year plans. From January 1, 1991, the countries shifted their dealings with one another to a hard currency market basis. The result was a radical decrease in trade with one another, as \"(Central and) Eastern Europe\u2026 exchanged asymmetrical trade dependence on the Soviet Union for an equally asymmetrical commercial dependence on the European Community.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 580\u201382; the quotation is on p. 582.</ref>\n\nThe final Comecon council session took place on June 28, 1991, in [[Budapest]], and led to an agreement to disband within 90 days.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 582.</ref> The Soviet Union itself was dismantled on December 26, 1991.\n\n===Post-Cold War activity after Comecon===\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and communist rule in Eastern Europe, [[East Germany]] (now unified with Germany) automatically joined the [[European Union]] (then the European Community) in 1990. The [[Baltic States]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]), [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]] joined the EU in 2004, followed by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in 2007 and [[Croatia]] in 2013. To date, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany (former GDR), Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are now members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. All four Central European states are now members of the [[Visegrad Group]].\n\nRussia, the successor to the Soviet Union along with [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] founded the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] which consists of the ex-Soviet republics. The country also leads the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] with [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] with [[Armenia]], Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Along with Ukraine, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Moldova]] are also part of the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]].\n\n[[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] joined the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] in 1995 and 1997 respectively.\n\n==Membership==\n===Full members===\n<!--List of Member States-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

countries{{snd}} the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]{{snd}} were invited to participate as observers in Comecon sessions. Although Mongolia and Vietnam later gained full membership, China stopped attending Comecon sessions after 1961. Yugoslavia negotiated a form of associate status in the organization, specified in its 1964 agreement with Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> Collectively, the members of the Comecon did not display the necessary prerequisites for economic integration: their level of industrialization was low and uneven, with a single dominant member (the Soviet Union) producing 70% of the community national product.<ref>Zwass, 1989, p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, there were ten full members: the Soviet Union, six East European countries, and three extra-regional members. Geography, therefore, no longer united Comecon members. Wide variations in economic size and level of economic development also tended to generate divergent interests among the member countries. All these factors combined to give rise to significant differences in the member states' expectations about the benefits to be derived from membership in Comecon. Unity was provided instead by political and ideological factors. All Comecon members were \"united by a commonality of fundamental class interests and the ideology of Marxism-Leninism\" and had common approaches to economic ownership (state versus private) and management (plan versus market). In 1949 the ruling communist parties of the founding states were also linked internationally through the [[Cominform]], from which [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] [[Informbiro|had been expelled]] the previous year. Although the Cominform was disbanded in 1956, interparty links continued to be strong among Comecon members, and all participated in periodic international conferences of communist parties. Comecon provided a mechanism through which its leading member, the Soviet Union, sought to foster economic links with and among its closest political and military allies. The East European members of Comecon were also militarily allied with the Soviet Union in the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThere were three kinds of relationships &ndash; besides the 10 full memberships &ndash; with the Comecon:\n\n* Yugoslavia was the only country considered to have associate member status. On the basis of the 1964 agreement, Yugoslavia participated in twenty-one of the thirty-two key Comecon institutions as if it were a full member.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* [[Finland]], [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mexico]], and [[Nicaragua]] had a cooperant status with Comecon. Because the governments of these countries were not empowered to conclude agreements in the name of private companies, the governments did not take part in Comecon operations. They were represented in Comecon by commissions made up of members of the government and the business community. The commissions were empowered to sign various \"framework\" agreements with Comecon's Joint Commission on Cooperation.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* After 1956, Comecon allowed certain countries with communist or pro-Soviet governments to attend sessions as observers. In November 1986, delegations from [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Laos]], and [[South Yemen]] attended the 42nd Council Session as observers.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n==Exchange==\nWorking with neither meaningful [[exchange rate]]s nor a market economy, Comecon countries had to look to world markets as a reference point for prices, but unlike agents acting in a market, prices tended to be stable over a period of years, rather than constantly fluctuating, which assisted central planning. Also, there was a tendency to underprice raw materials relative to the manufactured goods produced in many of the Comecon countries.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 537.</ref>\n\nInternational barter helped preserve the Comecon countries' scarce [[hard currency]] reserves. In strict economic terms, barter inevitably harmed countries whose goods would have brought higher prices in the free market or whose imports could have been obtained more cheaply and benefitted those for whom it was the other way around. Still, all of the Comecon countries gained some stability, and the governments gained some legitimacy,<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\"/> and in many ways this stability and protection from the world market was viewed, at least in the early years of Comecon, as an advantage of the system, as was the formation of stronger ties with other socialist countries.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 538.</ref>\n\nWithin Comecon, there were occasional struggles over just how this system should work. Early on, [[Nikolai Voznesensky]] pushed for a more \"law-governed\" and [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic price-based approach. However, with the August 1948 death of [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Voznesensky lost his patron and was soon accused of treason as part of the [[Leningrad Affair]]; within two years he was dead in prison. Instead, what won out was a \"physical planning\" approach that strengthened the role of central governments over technocrats.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539.</ref> At the same time, the effort to create a single regime of planning \"common economic organization\" with the ability to set plans throughout the Comecon region also came to nought. A protocol to create such a system was signed January 18, 1949, but never ratified.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 540.</ref> While historians are not unanimous on why this was stymied, it clearly threatened the sovereignty not only of the smaller states but even of the Soviet Union itself, since an international body would have had real power; Stalin clearly preferred informal means of intervention in the other Comecon states.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 540\u201341.</ref> This lack of either rationality or international central planning tended to promote [[autarky]] in each Comecon country because none fully trusted the others to deliver goods and services.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\"/>\n\nWith few exceptions, foreign trade in the Comecon countries was a [[state monopoly]], and the state agencies and captive trading companies were often corrupt. Even at best, this tended to put several removes between a producer and any foreign customer, limiting the ability to learn to adjust to foreign customers' needs. Furthermore, there was often strong political pressure to keep the best products for domestic use in each country. From the early 1950s to Comecon's demise in the early 1990s, intra-Comecon trade, except for Soviet petroleum, was in steady decline.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 565.</ref>\n\n===Oil transfers===\nBeginning no later than the early 1970s,<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 569.</ref> Soviet petroleum and [[natural gas]] were routinely transferred within Comecon at below-market rates. Most [[Western World|Western]] commentators have viewed this as implicit, politically motivated subsidization of shaky economies to defuse discontent and reward compliance with Soviet wishes.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 570 makes the assertion about this being the dominant view, and cites several examples.</ref> Other commentators say that this may not have been deliberate policy, noting that whenever prices differ from world market prices, there will be winners and losers. They argue that this may have been simply an unforeseen consequence of two factors: the slow adjustment of Comecon prices during a time of rising oil and gas prices, and the fact that mineral resources were abundant in the Comecon sphere, relative to manufactured goods. A possible point of comparison is that there were also winners and losers under EEC agricultural policy in the same period.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 570\u201371.</ref> Russian and Kazakh oil kept the Comecon countries' oil prices low when the [[1973 oil crisis]] quadrupled Western oil prices.\n\n===Ineffective production===\nThe organization of Comecon was officially focused on common expansion of states, more effective production and building relationships between countries within. And as in every planned economy, operations did not reflect state of market, innovations, availability of items or the specific needs of a country. One example came from former Czechoslovakia. In the 1970s, the Communist party of Czechoslovakia finally realized that there was a need for underground trains. Czechoslovak designers projected a cheap but technologically innovative underground train. The train was a state-of-the-art project, capable of moving underground or on the surface using standard rails, had a high number of passenger seats, and was lightweight. According to the designers, the train was technologically more advanced than the trains used in New York's Subway, London's Tube or the Paris Metro. However, due to the plan of Comecon, older Soviet trains were used, which guaranteed profit for the Soviet Union and work for workers in Soviet factories. That economical change lead to the cancellation of the R1 trains by A. Honz\u00edk. The Comecon plan, though more profitable for the Soviets, if less resourceful for the Czechs and Slovaks, forced the Czechoslovak government to buy trains \"E\u010ds (81-709)\" and \"81-71\", both of which were designed in early 1950s and were heavy, unreliable and expensive.

Poland was a manufacturer of light helicopters for Comecon countries ([[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] of the Soviet design). The USSR developed their own model [[Kamov Ka-26]] and Romania produced French helicopters under license for their own market. In a formal or informal way, often the countries were discouraged from developing their own designs that competed with the main Comecon design.\n\n==Structure==\n\nAlthough not formally part of the organization's hierarchy, the Conference of First Secretaries of Communist and Workers' Parties and of the Heads of Government of the Comecon Member Countries was Comecon's most important organ. These party and government leaders gathered for conference meetings regularly to discuss topics of mutual interest. Because of the rank of conference participants, their decisions had considerable influence on the actions taken by Comecon and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe official hierarchy of Comecon consisted of the Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the Executive Committee of the Council, the Secretariat of the Council, four council committees, twenty-four standing commissions, six interstate conferences, two scientific institutes, and several associated organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===The Session===\nThe Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, officially the highest Comecon organ, examined fundamental problems of economic integration and directed the activities of the Secretariat and other subordinate organizations. Delegations from each Comecon member country attended these meetings. Prime ministers usually headed the delegations, which met during the second quarter of each year in a member country's capital (the location of the meeting was determined by a system of rotation based on [[Cyrillic script]]). All interested parties had to consider recommendations handed down by the Session. A [[treaty]] or other kind of legal agreement implemented adopted recommendations. Comecon itself might adopt decisions only on organizational and procedural matters pertaining to itself and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nEach country appointed one permanent representative to maintain relations between members and Comecon between annual meetings. An extraordinary Session, such as the one in December 1985, might be held with the consent of at least one-third of the members. Such meetings usually took place in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===Executive Committee===\nThe highest executive organ in Comecon, the Executive Committee, was entrusted with elaborating policy recommendations and supervising their implementation between sessions. In addition, it supervised work on plan coordination and scientific-technical cooperation. Composed of one representative from each member country, usually a deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Executive Committee met quarterly, usually in Moscow. In 1971 and 1974, the Executive Committee acquired economic departments that ranked above the standing commissions. These economic departments considerably strengthened the authority and importance of the Executive Committee.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===Other entities===\nThere were four council committees: Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning, Council Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, Council Committee for Cooperation in Material and Technical Supply, and Council Committee for Cooperation in Machine Building. Their mission was \"to ensure the comprehensive examination and a multilateral settlement of the major problems of cooperation among member countries in the economy, science, and technology.\" All committees were headquartered in Moscow and usually met there. These committees advised the standing commissions, the Secretariat, the interstate conferences, and the scientific institutes in their areas of specialization. Their jurisdiction was generally wider than that of the standing commissions because they had the right to make policy recommendations to other Comecon organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning was the most important of the four. It coordinated the national economic plans of Comecon members. As such, it ranked in importance only after the Session and the Executive Committee. Made up of the chairmen of Comecon members' national central planning offices, the Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning drew up draft agreements for joint projects, adopted a resolution approving these projects, and recommended approval to the concerned parties. If its decisions were not subject to approval by national governments and parties, this committee would be considered Comecon's supranational planning body.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe international Secretariat, Comecon's only permanent body, was Comecon's primary economic research and administrative organ. The secretary, who has been a Soviet official since Comecon creation, was the official Comecon representative to Comecon member states and to other states and international organizations. Subordinate to the secretary were his deputy and the various departments of the Secretariat, which generally corresponded to the standing commissions. The Secretariat's responsibilities included preparation and organization of Comecon sessions and other meetings conducted under the auspices of Comecon; compilation of digests on Comecon activities; conduct of economic and other research for Comecon members; and preparation of recommendations on various issues concerning Comecon operations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nIn 1956, eight standing commissions were set up to help Comecon make recommendations pertaining to specific economic sectors. The commissions have been rearranged and renamed a number of times since the establishment of the first eight. In 1986 there were twenty-four standing commissions, each headquartered in the capital of a member country and headed by one of that country's leading authorities in the field addressed by the commission. The Secretariat supervised the actual operations of the commissions. The standing commissions had authority only to make recommendations, which had then to be approved by the Executive Committee, presented to the Session, and ratified by the interested member countries. Commissions usually met twice a year in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe six interstate conferences (on water management, internal trade, legal matters, inventions and [[patents]], pricing, and labor affairs) served as forums for discussing shared issues and experiences. They were purely consultative and generally acted in an advisory capacity to the Executive Committee or its specialized committees.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThe scientific institutes on standardization and on economic problems of the world economic system concerned themselves with theoretical problems of international cooperation. Both were headquartered in Moscow and were staffed by experts from various member countries.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n===Affiliated agencies===\n[[File:Budapest, Hungary Elisabeth Bridge Medal 1974.jpg|thumb|1974 Medallion 10th Anniversary of Intermetall, that was founded in 1964 in Budapest]]\n\nSeveral affiliated agencies, having a variety of relationships with Comecon, existed outside the official Comecon hierarchy. They served to develop \"direct links between appropriate bodies and organizations of Comecon member countries.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nThese affiliated agencies were divided into two categories: intergovernmental economic organizations (which worked on a higher level in the member countries and generally dealt with a wider range of managerial and coordinative activities) and international economic organizations (which worked closer to the operational level of research, production, or trade). A few examples of the former are the [[International Bank for Economic Cooperation]] (managed the transferable ruble system), the [[International Investment Bank]] (in charge of financing joint projects), and [[Intermetall]] (encouraged cooperation in [[ferrous metallurgy]]).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nInternational economic organizations generally took the form of either joint enterprises, international economic associations or unions, or international economic partnerships. The latter included [[Interatominstrument]] (nuclear machinery producers), [[Intertekstilmash]] (textile machinery producers), and Haldex (a Hungarian-Polish joint enterprise for reprocessing coal slag).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n==Nature of operation==\n\nComecon was an interstate organization through which members attempted to coordinate economic activities of mutual interest and to develop multilateral economic, scientific, and technical cooperation:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* The Charter (1959) stated that \"the sovereign equality of all members\" was fundamental to the organization and procedures of Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\"/>\n* The Comprehensive Program further emphasized that the processes of integration of members' economies were \"completely voluntary and do not involve the creation of supranational bodies.\" Hence under the provisions of the Charter, each country had the right to equal representation and one vote in all organs of Comecon, regardless of the country's economic size or the size of its contribution to Comecon's budget.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n* From 1967, the \"interestedness\" provisions of the Charter reinforced the principle of \"sovereign equality.\" Comecon's recommendations and decisions could be adopted only upon agreement among the interested members, and each had the right to declare its \"interest\" in any matter under consideration.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>\n* Furthermore, in the words of the Charter (as revised in 1967), \"recommendations and decisions shall not apply to countries that have declared that they have no interest in a particular matter.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>\n* Although Comecon recognized the principle of unanimity, from 1967 disinterested parties did not have a veto but rather the right to abstain from participation. A declaration of disinterest could not block a project unless the disinterested party's participation was vital. Otherwise, the Charter implied that the interested parties could proceed without the abstaining member, affirming that a country that had declared a lack of interest \"may subsequently adhere to the recommendations and decisions adopted by the remaining members of the Council.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> However, a member country could also declare an \"interest\" and exercise a veto.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>\n\nOver the years of its functioning, Comecon acted more as an instrument of mutual economic assistance than a means of economic integration, with multilateralism as an unachievable goal.<ref>Zwass, 1989, pp. 14\u201321</ref> J.F. Brown, a British historian of Eastern Europe, cited Vladimir Sobell, a Czech-born economist, for the view that Comecon was an \"international protection system\" rather than an \"international trade system\", in contrast with the EEC, which was essentially the latter.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\">{{Citation |last=Brown |first=J.F. |year=1988 |title=Eastern Europe and Communist Rule |publisher=Duke University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=vlhpAAAAMAAJ |isbn=978-0882308418}}, pp. 145\u201356.</ref> Whereas the latter was interested in production efficiency and in allocation via market prices, the former was interested in bilateral aid to fulfill central planning goals.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/> Writing in 1988, Brown stated that many people in both the West and the East had assumed that a trade and efficiency approach was what Comecon was meant to pursue, which might make it an international trade system more like the EEC, and that some economists in Hungary and Poland had advocated such an approach in the 1970s and 1980s, but that \"it would need a transformation of every [Eastern Bloc] economy along Hungarian lines [i.e., only partly centrally planned] to enable a market-guided Comecon to work. And any change along those lines has been ideologically unacceptable up to now.\"<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/>\n\n==Comecon versus the European Economic Community==\n[[File:Europe 1988.svg|thumb|European [[trade bloc]]s as of the late 1980s. EEC member states are marked in blue, [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] &ndash; green, and Comecon &ndash; red.]]\n\nAlthough Comecon was loosely referred to as the \"[[European Economic Community]] (EEC) of (Central and) Eastern Europe,\" important contrasts existed between the two organizations. Both organizations administered economic integration; however, their economic structure, size, balance, and influence differed:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the EEC incorporated the 270 million people in Europe into economic association through intergovernmental agreements aimed at maximizing profits and economic efficiency on a national and international scale. The EEC was a supranational body that could adopt decisions (such as removing tariffs) and enforce them. Activity by members was based on initiative and enterprise from below (on the individual or enterprise level) and was strongly influenced by market forces.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nComecon joined together 450 million people in 10 countries and on 3 continents. The level of industrialization from country to country differed greatly: the organization linked two underdeveloped countries &ndash; Mongolia, and Vietnam &ndash; with some highly industrialized states. Likewise, a large national income difference existed between European and non-European members. The physical size, military power, and political and economic resource base of the Soviet Union made it the dominant member. In trade among Comecon members, the Soviet Union usually provided raw materials, and Central and East European countries provided finished equipment and machinery. The three underdeveloped Comecon members had a special relationship with the other seven. Comecon realized disproportionately more political than economic gains from its heavy contributions to these three countries' underdeveloped economies. Economic integration or \"plan coordination\" formed the basis of Comecon's activities. In this system, which mirrored the member countries' planned economies, the decisions handed down from above ignored the influences of market forces or private initiative. Comecon had no supranational authority to make decisions or to implement them. Its recommendations could only be adopted with the full concurrence of interested parties and (from 1967<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>) did not affect those members who declared themselves disinterested parties.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nAs remarked above, most Comecon foreign trade was a state monopoly, placing several barriers between a producer and a foreign customer.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\"/> Unlike the EEC, where treaties mostly limited government activity and allowed the market to integrate economies across national lines, Comecon needed to develop agreements that called for positive government action. Furthermore, while private trade slowly limited or erased national rivalries in the EEC, state-to-state trade in Comecon reinforced national rivalries and resentments.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 567.</ref>\n\n==Prices, exchange rates, coordination of national plans==\n:''See: [[Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration]]''\n\n==International relations within the Comecon==\n:''See: [[International relations within the Comecon]]''\n\nSoviet domination of Comecon was a function of its economic, political, and military power. The Soviet Union possessed 90 percent of Comecon members' land and energy resources, 70 percent of their population, 65 percent of their national income, and industrial and military capacities second in the world only to those of the United States .{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}The location of many Comecon committee headquarters in Moscow and the large number of Soviet nationals in positions of authority also testified to the power of the Soviet Union within the organization.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\nSoviet efforts to exercise political power over its Comecon partners, however, were met with determined opposition. The \"sovereign equality\" of members, as described in the Comecon Charter, assured members that if they did not wish to participate in a Comecon project, they might abstain. Central and East European members frequently invoked this principle in fear that economic interdependence would further reduce political sovereignty. Thus, neither Comecon nor the Soviet Union as a major force within Comecon had supranational authority. Although this fact ensured some degree of freedom from Soviet economic domination of the other members, it also deprived Comecon of necessary power to achieve maximum economic efficiency.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Soviet Union|Economy}}\n* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]\n* [[Bilateral trade]]\n* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]\n* [[Economy of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Eurasian Economic Union]]\n* [[European Union]]\n* [[History of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Non-Aligned Movement]]\n* [[Planned economy]]\n* [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]\n* [[Spartakiad]]\n* [[ALBA]]\n* [[Visegrad Group]]\n* [[Warsaw Pact]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{loc}}\n* Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, ''A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change'', Routledge, 1998. {{ISBN|0-415-16111-8}}.\n* Brine, Jenny J., ed.

Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\"juice\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, pp.18\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, pp.18 and 20.</ref>\n\nThe mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the {{convert|239|cid|cc|abbr=on}} flatty, introduced in 1939<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\">Shelton, p.20.</ref>); a [[Halibrand]] quick-change rearend was also typical, and an [[Edelbrock]] [[intake manifold]] or Harman and Collins [[ignition magneto]] would not be uncommon.<ref>Shelton, pp.17-18.</ref> Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\"/> Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro,<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\">Shelton, p.20 caption.</ref> [[Edelbrock|Vic Edelbrock]], and [[Offenhauser]]. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a \"slingshot\" design for the flatty.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\"/> Front suspension hairpins were adapted from [[sprint car]]s, such as the [[Kurtis Kraft]]s.<ref>Shelton, p.24 and p.26 caption.</ref> The first Jimmy [[Supercharging|supercharger]] on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.<ref>Shelton, p.26 caption.</ref>\n\nMuch later, rods and customs swapped the old solid rear axle for an independent rear, often from [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]. Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 [[Buick]] grille was often used on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A Fords]] from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \"candy-like\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors.<ref name=\"Custom history\" />\n\nWith the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping [[headlamp]] rings, grilles, bumpers, [[Chrome plating|chrome]] side strips, and taillights as well as [[Frenching (automobile)|frenching]] and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding [[lead]] to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term [[lead sled]]; [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] has since largely replaced lead.) [[Chopped and channeled#Chopping|Chopping]] made the roof lower<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/78, p.64.</ref> while [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]]<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.15; ''Custom Rodder'' 1/97, p.29.</ref> made the body thinner from top to bottom. [[Chopped and channeled#Channeling|Channeling]]<ref>Jezek, George. \"The All Deuce Round-Up\", in ''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.58.</ref> was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. ''[[Juxtapoz Magazine]]'', founded by the artist [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], has covered [[Kustom Kulture]] art.\n\n==Customization style==\n[[File:Fuzzy dice 2.jpg|thumb|'55-7 Chevy with fuzzy dice]] <!--fuzzy dice are practically required-->\n[[File:Ed Roth 'bloodshot eyeball'.jpg|thumb|[[Ed Roth|'Big Daddy' Roth]] 'bloodshot eyeball' [[shift knob]] was a 1960s craze.]]\n\nCustom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including:\n* [[Rat rod]]: imitates (or exaggerates) the \"unfinished\" and amateur-built appearance of hot rods of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s\n* Restomod - restored and modernized. Safety and convenience upgrades, such as disc brakes, AC, etc., but can include fuel injection and overdrive upgrades, etc. Externally might resemble a stock car with period correct mods rather than customs.\n* Street machines: Typically American cars with large-displacement engines modified for speed and often appearance.\n* Street rod - consist largely of period specific vehicles and components, or emulate visual characteristics of cars through the'40s vintage. There is a great deal of overlap here with [[hot rod]]s.\n\n==Features==\n===Paint===\n[[File:'34 3-window flame job.JPG|thumb|'32 three-window with a classic-style flame job and [[Dean Moon|Moon]] tank, reminiscent of [[Pete Chapouris|Chapouris]]' [[The California Kid (custom car)|''California Kid'']]]]\nPaint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and [[metalflake]] paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect \u2013 which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.\n\nCustomizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. [[Flame job (painting technique)|Flame jobs]] later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \"ghost\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \"crab claw flames\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.<ref>Hotrod magazine, 1999.</ref>\n\nPainting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves.\n\n===Engine swaps===\nEngine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]] was the preference, supplanted by the [[Chrysler FirePower engine|early hemi]] in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#Small block Chevrolet V8 (1955\u20131998)|small-block Chevy]] was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the {{convert|350|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Chevy has been almost ubiquitous.<ref>See any issue of ''Street Rodder'', for instance.</ref> The {{convert|325|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[GM small-block engine#Generation III (1997\u20132007)|Chevrolet LS]] has begun replacing the 350.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOnce customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] prior to 1949 had [[Henry Ford]]'s old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by [[Cletus Clobes]] in 1932, among its exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | title=1932 Clobes | publisher=Wheels Through Time Museum | accessdate=2010-10-31 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928062921/http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref> With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where [[lowrider]]s were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars.\n\nAs the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such [[Westcott Auto Restyling|Westcott's]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.44.</ref> [[Harwood Street Rods|Harwood]], [[Gibbon Fiberglass]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\">''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> and [[Speedway Motors]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\"/> have begun to fabricate new [[fiberglass]] copies,<ref>See, for instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.183.</ref> while [[Classic Manufacturing and Supply]], for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s.<ref>''Street Rodder'', 7/94, pp.132-4.</ref> California's \"junker\" (or \"crusher\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \"gross polluters\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend.<ref>See, for instance, Dick Wells column \"SRMA Update\", ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.234.</ref> Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as [[Johnie's Broiler]] in [[Downey, California]]. The practice continues in Southern California.\n\n==Customizers==\nExamples of notable customizers include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], [[Vini Bergeman]], [[Bill Cushenberry]], the [[The Alexander Brothers|Alexander Brothers]], [[Gil Ayala]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.60.</ref> [[Darryl Starbird]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\">''Street Rodder'', 1/85, p.56.</ref> [[Roy Brizio]], [[Troy Trepanier]] (of [[Rad Rides by Troy]]), [[Boyd Coddington]], [[Darryl Hollenbeck]] (working out of at Vintage Color Studios; winner of the 2016 [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]] (AMBR) trophy with a custom Deuce)<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\"/> [[Harry Westergaard]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.55.</ref> [[Dave Stuckey]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> [[Dean Jeffries]], [[Barry Lobeck]], [[Phil Cool]] (who won the 1978 AMBR trophy with a bright orange Deuce, cover car for the July 1978 issue of ''Hot Rod''),<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.23.</ref> [[Troy Ladd]] of [[Hollywood Hot Rods]], [[Doane Spencer]] (builder of a 1940s Deuce considered the template for the hiboy),<ref>Shelton, p.29.</ref> [[Ken Fenical|\"Posie\"]],<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/85, p.5.</ref> [[Ron Clark (customizer)|Ron Clark]] and [[Bob Kaiser (customizer)|Bob Kaiser]] (of [[Clarkaiser Custom]]s),<ref>Fetherston, David, \"Detroit Dreams\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.58.</ref> [[Joe Bailon]]<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> (inventor of candy apple paint),<ref>Ganahl, Pat, \"The Candy Man\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.81.</ref> [[Gene Winfield]], [[Rick Dore]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTCkZlTKrGsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22Rick+dore%22&source=bl&ots=5Kr7TMRKmR&sig=SAqsQAkP_wAUlEwNlKsxvLkTm6w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ze8nU4CeA-jhyQGb9IGQDw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22Rick+dore%22&f=false|title=Art of the Hot Rod|first=Ken|last=Gross|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=Motorbooks|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Joe Wilhelm]], [[Dick Megugorac|\"Magoo\"]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 12/98, p.206.</ref> [[Chip Foose]],<ref>Bishop, Mike, \"The 45th Grand National Roadster Show\", in ''American Rodder'', 6/94, p.27.</ref> and [[Pete Chapouris]].\n\nOthers, such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]], are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to [[Hollywood]]; Barris designed TV's [[Batmobile]], while Chapouris built the [[The California Kid (custom car)|flamed '34 three-window coup\u00e9]] in the eponymous [[television film|telefilm]] \"[[The California Kid]]\". Another Barris creation, [[Ala Kart (custom car)|''Ala Kart'']] (a '29 Ford [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs).\n\n==Awards==\nThe highest award for customizers is the AMBR ([[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]]) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs.\n\nAnother is the [[Ridler Award]], presented at the [[Detroit Autorama]] since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement.\n\n==Notable customs==\nSome customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is [[Silhouette (show car)|''Silhouette'']] and [[Ed Roth]]'s [[Mysterion (show rod)|''Mysterion'']]. Some of these more unusual projects turned into [[Hot Wheels]] cars, among them [[The Red Baron (custom car)|''The Red Baron'']].\n\nOther custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as ''Ala Kart'' {1958},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29 sidebar.</ref> ''The California Kid'' three-window {1973},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29.</ref> or the yellow deuce from \"[[American Graffiti]]\" {1973}) or television (such as ''The [[Monkeemobile]]'', the [[The Munsters|\"Munsters\"]] hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Tool Time'']] '34, or [[Don Thelan]]'s<ref>Gingerelli, Dain. \"Jake's '34\". Written on June 23, 2005 [http://www.hotrod.com/features/history/articles/0009sr-1934-ford-three-window-coupe-milestone/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 19 June 2015)</ref> '33 three-window, ''Eliminator'', built for the [[ZZ Top]] video<ref>{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/zz-top-eliminator-hot-rod.htm |title=The ZZ Top Eliminator: Profile of a Hot Rod |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |date=2007-09-20 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>). Specialist vehicles, such as the [[Pontiac Trans-Am|T/A]], [[KITT]], from [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|''Knight Rider'']], are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior.\n\nStill others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the [[Hirohata Merc]]. Even without an appearance in film (\"Runnin' Wild\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, pp.8 & 10.</ref> The same year, [[Neil Emory]] and [[Clayton Jensen]] of [[Valley Custom Shop]] built [[Polynesian (custom car)|''Polynesian'']] for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 [[Oldsmobile 88#First generation (1949\u20131953)|Holiday 88 sedan]].<ref>[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)</ref> ''Polynesian'' made the cover of [[Hot Rod Magazine|''Hot Rod'']] in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in ''[[Motor Trend]] Custom Car Annual'' in 1954.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.68.</ref>\n\n==Language==<!--linked from [[Chevrolet Corvette C2]] -->\n[[File:'28 A roadster.jpg|thumb|'28 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|A]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] with [[Kelsey-Hayes]] [[wire wheel]]s]]\n\nCertain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers:\n* The [[model year]] is rarely given in full,<ref>For instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, ''passim''; ''Rod Action'', 2/78, ''passim''; ''Hot Rod'', October 1987, pp,8, 10, 18, 20, & 22.</ref> except when it might be confused, so a 1934 model is a '34, while a 2005 might be an '05 or not.\n** A '32 is usually a Deuce and most often a roadster, unless [[coup\u00e9]] is specified, and almost always a Ford, now commonly on [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|A]] [[chassis|frame rails]].<ref name=\"Fortier, Rob p.136\">Fortier, Rob. \"\"A Little Pinch Here, A Little Tuck There\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.136.</ref>\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 is usually a Chevrolet.\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 Chevrolet is often called a [[Tri-Five]].\n* A 3- or 5-window is usually a Ford, unless specified.\n* A flatty is a [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]]<ref>''American Rodder'', 6/94, pp.45 & 93.</ref> (always Ford, unless specified); a late (or late model) flatty is probably a [[Mercury (automobile)|Merc]].\n* A [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|hemi]] (\"''hem'' ee\") is always a 426, unless displacement (331, 354, or 392) is specified;<ref>Geisert, Eric. \"Tom's Fun Run\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.149cap.</ref> a 426 is a hemi, unless [[Chrysler RB engine#426|Wedge]] is specified.

Engine displacement can be described in cubic inches or liters (for example, a 5.7-liter engine is also known as a 350 {\"three fifty\"}); this frequently depends on which units the user is most comfortable or familiar with.<ref name=\"Freiburger, David 1993, p.45\">Freiburger, David. \"Hot Rod Dictionary\", in ''Hot Rod'', July 1993, p.45.</ref>\nThe \"cutoff year\" as originally promoted by the ''National Street Rod Association'' ([[National Street Rod Association|NSRA]]) is 1949. Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a [[Ford Capri]] built in the UK or a [[Holden|General Motors - Holden's]] product, not to mention [[captive imports|captives]]), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of [[muscle car]]s have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the [[catalytic converter]]. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on. Additionally, the Goodguys car show organization has moved the year limit for its \"rod\" shows from 1949 to 1954 in recent years.\n\n===Types===\n* [[Hi-Riser (automobile)]]\n* [[Hot rod]]\n* [[Kustom (cars)]]\n* [[Lead sled]]\n* [[Lowrider]]\n* [[Rat rod]]\n* [[Rice burner]]\n* [[Three window coupe]]\n\n===Common terms===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Yellow Deuce front wb.jpg|thumb|Front suspension of a lowboy Deuce roadster, with color-matched springs on coilover shocks, tube axle, and vented disc brakes.

The first hot rods were pre-[[World War II]] cars, with [[running board]]s and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The \"gow job\" morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.16.</ref> Typical of builds from before World War II were 1935 Ford [[wire wheel]]s.<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.18.</ref>\n\nMany cars were \"hopped up\" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. [[Engine swap]]s were often done, with the objective of placing the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.<ref name=\"Custom history\">{{cite web|url= http://www.yourcustomcar.com/custom-car-history.html |title=The evolution of custom cars |accessdate=2016-10-11}}</ref> The suspension was usually altered, initially by lowering the rear end as much as possible using lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job by either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make the front end of the car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\"juice\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, pp.18\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, pp.18 and 20.</ref>\n\nThe mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the {{convert|239|cid|cc|abbr=on}} flatty, introduced in 1939<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\">Shelton, p.20.</ref>); a [[Halibrand]] quick-change rearend was also typical, and an [[Edelbrock]] [[intake manifold]] or Harman and Collins [[ignition magneto]] would not be uncommon.<ref>Shelton, pp.17-18.</ref> Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\"/> Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro,<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\">Shelton, p.20 caption.</ref> [[Edelbrock|Vic Edelbrock]], and [[Offenhauser]].

Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 [[Buick]] grille was often used on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A Fords]] from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \"candy-like\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors.<ref name=\"Custom history\" />\n\nWith the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping [[headlamp]] rings, grilles, bumpers, [[Chrome plating|chrome]] side strips, and taillights as well as [[Frenching (automobile)|frenching]] and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding [[lead]] to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term [[lead sled]]; [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] has since largely replaced lead.) [[Chopped and channeled#Chopping|Chopping]] made the roof lower<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/78, p.64.</ref> while [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]]<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.15; ''Custom Rodder'' 1/97, p.29.</ref> made the body thinner from top to bottom. [[Chopped and channeled#Channeling|Channeling]]<ref>Jezek, George. \"The All Deuce Round-Up\", in ''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.58.</ref> was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. ''[[Juxtapoz Magazine]]'', founded by the artist [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], has covered [[Kustom Kulture]] art.\n\n==Customization style==\n[[File:Fuzzy dice 2.jpg|thumb|'55-7 Chevy with fuzzy dice]] <!--fuzzy dice are practically required-->\n[[File:Ed Roth 'bloodshot eyeball'.jpg|thumb|[[Ed Roth|'Big Daddy' Roth]] 'bloodshot eyeball' [[shift knob]] was a 1960s craze.]]\n\nCustom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including:\n* [[Rat rod]]: imitates (or exaggerates) the \"unfinished\" and amateur-built appearance of hot rods of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s\n* Restomod - restored and modernized. Safety and convenience upgrades, such as disc brakes, AC, etc., but can include fuel injection and overdrive upgrades, etc. Externally might resemble a stock car with period correct mods rather than customs.\n* Street machines: Typically American cars with large-displacement engines modified for speed and often appearance.\n* Street rod - consist largely of period specific vehicles and components, or emulate visual characteristics of cars through the'40s vintage. There is a great deal of overlap here with [[hot rod]]s.\n\n==Features==\n===Paint===\n[[File:'34 3-window flame job.JPG|thumb|'32 three-window with a classic-style flame job and [[Dean Moon|Moon]] tank, reminiscent of [[Pete Chapouris|Chapouris]]' [[The California Kid (custom car)|''California Kid'']]]]\nPaint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and [[metalflake]] paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect \u2013 which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.\n\nCustomizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. [[Flame job (painting technique)|Flame jobs]] later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \"ghost\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \"crab claw flames\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.<ref>Hotrod magazine, 1999.</ref>\n\nPainting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves.\n\n===Engine swaps===\nEngine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]] was the preference, supplanted by the [[Chrysler FirePower engine|early hemi]] in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#Small block Chevrolet V8 (1955\u20131998)|small-block Chevy]] was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the {{convert|350|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Chevy has been almost ubiquitous.<ref>See any issue of ''Street Rodder'', for instance.</ref> The {{convert|325|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[GM small-block engine#Generation III (1997\u20132007)|Chevrolet LS]] has begun replacing the 350.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOnce customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] prior to 1949 had [[Henry Ford]]'s old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by [[Cletus Clobes]] in 1932, among its exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | title=1932 Clobes | publisher=Wheels Through Time Museum | accessdate=2010-10-31 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928062921/http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref> With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where [[lowrider]]s were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars.\n\nAs the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such [[Westcott Auto Restyling|Westcott's]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.44.</ref> [[Harwood Street Rods|Harwood]], [[Gibbon Fiberglass]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\">''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> and [[Speedway Motors]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\"/> have begun to fabricate new [[fiberglass]] copies,<ref>See, for instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.183.</ref> while [[Classic Manufacturing and Supply]], for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s.<ref>''Street Rodder'', 7/94, pp.132-4.</ref> California's \"junker\" (or \"crusher\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \"gross polluters\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend.<ref>See, for instance, Dick Wells column \"SRMA Update\", ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.234.</ref> Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as [[Johnie's Broiler]] in [[Downey, California]]. The practice continues in Southern California.\n\n==Customizers==\nExamples of notable customizers include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], [[Bill Cushenberry]], the [[The Alexander Brothers|Alexander Brothers]], [[Gil Ayala]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.60.</ref> [[Darryl Starbird]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\">''Street Rodder'', 1/85, p.56.</ref> [[Roy Brizio]], [[Troy Trepanier]] (of [[Rad Rides by Troy]]), [[Boyd Coddington]], [[Darryl Hollenbeck]] (working out of at Vintage Color Studios; winner of the 2016 [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]] (AMBR) trophy with a custom Deuce)<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\"/> [[Harry Westergaard]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.55.</ref> [[Dave Stuckey]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> [[Dean Jeffries]], [[Barry Lobeck]], [[Phil Cool]] (who won the 1978 AMBR trophy with a bright orange Deuce, cover car for the July 1978 issue of ''Hot Rod''),<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.23.</ref> [[Troy Ladd]] of [[Hollywood Hot Rods]], [[Doane Spencer]] (builder of a 1940s Deuce considered the template for the hiboy),<ref>Shelton, p.29.</ref> [[Ken Fenical|\"Posie\"]],<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/85, p.5.</ref> [[Ron Clark (customizer)|Ron Clark]] and [[Bob Kaiser (customizer)|Bob Kaiser]] (of [[Clarkaiser Custom]]s),<ref>Fetherston, David, \"Detroit Dreams\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.58.</ref> [[Joe Bailon]]<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> (inventor of candy apple paint),<ref>Ganahl, Pat, \"The Candy Man\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.81.</ref> [[Gene Winfield]], [[Rick Dore]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTCkZlTKrGsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22Rick+dore%22&source=bl&ots=5Kr7TMRKmR&sig=SAqsQAkP_wAUlEwNlKsxvLkTm6w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ze8nU4CeA-jhyQGb9IGQDw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22Rick+dore%22&f=false|title=Art of the Hot Rod|first=Ken|last=Gross|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=Motorbooks|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Joe Wilhelm]], [[Dick Megugorac|\"Magoo\"]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 12/98, p.206.</ref> [[Chip Foose]],<ref>Bishop, Mike, \"The 45th Grand National Roadster Show\", in ''American Rodder'', 6/94, p.27.</ref> and [[Pete Chapouris]].\n\nOthers, such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]], are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to [[Hollywood]]; Barris designed TV's [[Batmobile]], while Chapouris built the [[The California Kid (custom car)|flamed '34 three-window coup\u00e9]] in the eponymous [[television film|telefilm]] \"[[The California Kid]]\". Another Barris creation, [[Ala Kart (custom car)|''Ala Kart'']] (a '29 Ford [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs).\n\n==Awards==\nThe highest award for customizers is the AMBR ([[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]]) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs.\n\nAnother is the [[Ridler Award]], presented at the [[Detroit Autorama]] since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement.\n\n==Notable customs==\nSome customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is [[Silhouette (show car)|''Silhouette'']] and [[Ed Roth]]'s [[Mysterion (show rod)|''Mysterion'']]. Some of these more unusual projects turned into [[Hot Wheels]] cars, among them [[The Red Baron (custom car)|''The Red Baron'']].\n\nOther custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as ''Ala Kart'' {1958},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29 sidebar.</ref> ''The California Kid'' three-window {1973},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29.</ref> or the yellow deuce from \"[[American Graffiti]]\" {1973}) or television (such as ''The [[Monkeemobile]]'', the [[The Munsters|\"Munsters\"]] hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Tool Time'']] '34, or [[Don Thelan]]'s<ref>Gingerelli, Dain. \"Jake's '34\". Written on June 23, 2005 [http://www.hotrod.com/features/history/articles/0009sr-1934-ford-three-window-coupe-milestone/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 19 June 2015)</ref> '33 three-window, ''Eliminator'', built for the [[ZZ Top]] video<ref>{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/zz-top-eliminator-hot-rod.htm |title=The ZZ Top Eliminator: Profile of a Hot Rod |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |date=2007-09-20 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>). Specialist vehicles, such as the [[Pontiac Trans-Am|T/A]], [[KITT]], from [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|''Knight Rider'']], are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior.\n\nStill others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the [[Hirohata Merc]]. Even without an appearance in film (\"Runnin' Wild\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, pp.8 & 10.</ref> The same year, [[Neil Emory]] and [[Clayton Jensen]] of [[Valley Custom Shop]] built [[Polynesian (custom car)|''Polynesian'']] for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 [[Oldsmobile 88#First generation (1949\u20131953)|Holiday 88 sedan]].<ref>[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)</ref> ''Polynesian'' made the cover of [[Hot Rod Magazine|''Hot Rod'']] in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in ''[[Motor Trend]] Custom Car Annual'' in 1954.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.68.</ref>\n\n==Language==<!--linked from [[Chevrolet Corvette C2]] -->\n[[File:'28 A roadster.jpg|thumb|'28 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|A]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] with [[Kelsey-Hayes]] [[wire wheel]]s]]\n\nCertain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers:\n* The [[model year]] is rarely given in full,<ref>For instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, ''passim''; ''Rod Action'', 2/78, ''passim''; ''Hot Rod'', October 1987, pp,8, 10, 18, 20, & 22.</ref> except when it might be confused, so a 1934 model is a '34, while a 2005 might be an '05 or not.\n** A '32 is usually a Deuce and most often a roadster, unless [[coup\u00e9]] is specified, and almost always a Ford, now commonly on [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|A]] [[chassis|frame rails]].<ref name=\"Fortier, Rob p.136\">Fortier, Rob. \"\"A Little Pinch Here, A Little Tuck There\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.136.</ref>\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 is usually a Chevrolet.\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 Chevrolet is often called a [[Tri-Five]].\n* A 3- or 5-window is usually a Ford, unless specified.\n* A flatty is a [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]]<ref>''American Rodder'', 6/94, pp.45 & 93.</ref> (always Ford, unless specified); a late (or late model) flatty is probably a [[Mercury (automobile)|Merc]].\n* A [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|hemi]] (\"''hem'' ee\") is always a 426, unless displacement (331, 354, or 392) is specified;<ref>Geisert, Eric. \"Tom's Fun Run\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.149cap.</ref> a 426 is a hemi, unless [[Chrysler RB engine#426|Wedge]] is specified.

Engine displacement can be described in cubic inches or liters (for example, a 5.7-liter engine is also known as a 350 {\"three fifty\"}); this frequently depends on which units the user is most comfortable or familiar with.<ref name=\"Freiburger, David 1993, p.45\">Freiburger, David. \"Hot Rod Dictionary\", in ''Hot Rod'', July 1993, p.45.</ref>\nThe \"cutoff year\" as originally promoted by the ''National Street Rod Association'' ([[National Street Rod Association|NSRA]]) is 1949. Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a [[Ford Capri]] built in the UK or a [[Holden|General Motors - Holden's]] product, not to mention [[captive imports|captives]]), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of [[muscle car]]s have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the [[catalytic converter]]. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on. Additionally, the Goodguys car show organization has moved the year limit for its \"rod\" shows from 1949 to 1954 in recent years.\n\n===Types===\n* [[Hi-Riser (automobile)]]\n* [[Hot rod]]\n* [[Kustom (cars)]]\n* [[Lead sled]]\n* [[Lowrider]]\n* [[Rat rod]]\n* [[Rice burner]]\n* [[Three window coupe]]\n\n===Common terms===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Yellow Deuce front wb.jpg|thumb|Front suspension of a lowboy Deuce roadster, with color-matched springs on coilover shocks, tube axle, and vented disc brakes.
