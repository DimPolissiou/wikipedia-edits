{"title_page": "Gospel of Philip", "text_new": "{{New Testament Apocrypha}}\nThe '''Gospel of Philip''' is one of the [[Gnostic Gospels]], a text of [[New Testament]] [[apocrypha]], dated to around the 3rd century but lost in [[medieval]] times until an Egyptian man rediscovered it by accident, buried in a cave near [[Nag Hammadi]], in 1945.<ref>\"Rivals of Jesus,\" National Geographic Channel (2006).</ref>\n\nThe text is not related to the [[canonical gospel]]s and is not accepted as canonical by the [[Christian church]]. Although it may seem similar to the [[Gospel of Thomas]], scholars are divided as to whether it is a single discourse or a collection of [[Valentinius|Valentinian]] sayings.{{sfn|Perkins|1993|p=184}}{{sfn|Meyer|De Boer|2009|pp=36-37}} [[Sacraments]], in particular the sacrament of marriage, are a major theme. As in the other gnostic texts, the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and [[Gospel of Mary]], the Gospel of Philip defends the tradition that gives [[Mary Magdalene]] special insight into Jesus' teaching, but does not support \"twenty-first-century inventions concerning Mary Magdalene as Jesus' wife and mother of his offspring.\"{{sfn|Perkins|2009|p=278}}\n\nNevertheless, novels such as [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' have encouraged the popular theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. The [[Ancient Greek]] manuscript describes Jesus as Mary's \"[[koinonos]]\", or \"companion\", which may sometimes imply a sexual relationship, but is always used as \"a metaphor for a deeper, spiritual partnership\".{{sfn|Schaberg|2004|pp=152-}}\n\n== Date of composition==\n{{Gnosticism}}\nThe gospel's title appears at the end of the Coptic manuscript in a colophon; the only connection with [[Philip the Apostle]] within the text is that he is the only apostle mentioned (at 73,8). The text proper makes no claim to be from Philip, though, similarly, the four [[New Testament]] gospels make no explicit claim of authorship. The Gospel of Philip was written between AD 150 and AD 350, while Philip himself lived in the first century, making it extremely unlikely to be his writing. Most scholars hold a 3rd-century date of composition.{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=xi-xii}}\n\n== History and context ==\nA single manuscript of the ''Gospel of Philip'', in [[Coptic Language|Coptic]] ([[Nag Hammadi Codex II|CG II]]), was found in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], a cache of documents that was secreted in a jar and buried in the Egyptian desert at the end of the 4th century. The text was bound in the same [[codex]] that contained the better-known [[Gospel of Thomas]].\n\nFrom the mix of aphorisms, [[parable]]s, brief [[polemic]]s, narrative dialogue, biblical exegesis (especially of ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''), and dogmatic propositions, Wesley T. Isenberg, the editor and translator of the text, has attributed seventeen sayings (''logia'') to Jesus, nine of which {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}} characterizes as citations and interpretations of those found in the canonical gospels{{efn|Those in the canonical New Testament: 55,33\u201334; 57,3\u20135; 68,8\u201312; 68,26\u201327; 72,33\u201373,1; 77,18; 83,11\u201313; 84,7\u20139; 85,29\u201331.}} The new sayings,{{efn|The new sayings: 55,37\u201356,3; 58,10\u201314; 59,25\u201327; 63,29\u201330; 64,2\u20139; 64,10\u201312; 67,30\u201335; and 74,25\u201327.}} \"identified by the formula introducing them ('he said', 'the Lord said', or 'the Saviour said') are brief and enigmatic and are best interpreted from a gnostic perspective.{{sfn|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}}\n\nMuch of the Gospel of Philip is concerned with Gnostic views of the origin and nature of mankind and the [[sacrament]]s of [[baptism]], [[unction]] and [[marriage]]. The Gospel emphasizes the sacramental nature of the embrace between man and woman in the nuptial chamber, which is an [[archetype]] of spiritual unity, which entails the indissoluble nature of marriage.{{efn|The Old and New Testament and Gnostic contexts and the text are discussed by {{harvnb|Grant|1961 |129-140}} }} Many of the sayings are identifiably [[Gnostic]], and often appear quite mysterious and enigmatic (these are from the translation by {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}}):\n\n{{quote|The Lord said, \"Blessed is he who is before he came into being. For he who is, has been and shall be.\"}}\n\n{{quote|He who has knowledge of the truth is a free man, but the free man does not sin, for \"He who sins is the slave of sin\" (John 8:34). Truth is the mother, knowledge the father. }}\n\n{{quote|Echamoth is one thing and Echmoth, another. Echamoth is Wisdom simply, but Echmoth is the Wisdom of death, which is the one who knows death, which is called \"the little Wisdom\". }}\n\n{{quote| Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing.  (Compare with translation provided by the Nag Hammadi library: \"Those who say that ''the Lord'' died first and then rose up are in error \u2013 for He rose up first and then died.\"{{cite quote|date=February 2015}}) }}\n\n{{quote|Jesus came to crucify the world.}}\n\n{{quote|Jesus took them all by stealth, for he did not appear as he was, but in the manner in which they would be able to see him. He appeared to them all. He appeared to the great as great. He appeared to the small as small. He appeared to the angels as an angel, and to men as a man.}}\n\n{{quote|It is not possible for anyone to see anything of the things that actually exist unless he becomes like them... You saw the Spirit, you became spirit. You saw Christ, you became Christ. You saw the Father, you shall become Father. So in this place you see everything and do not see yourself, but in that place you do see yourself - and what you see you shall become.}}\n\n{{quote| Adam came into being from two virgins, from the Spirit and from the virgin earth. Christ therefore, was born from a virgin to rectify the Fall which occurred in the beginning. }}\n\nOne saying in particular appears to identify the levels of initiation in gnosticism, although what exactly the ''bridal chamber'' represented in gnostic thought is currently a matter of great debate:\n\n{{quote|The Lord did everything in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism and a eucharist and a redemption and a bridal chamber.}}\n\nOne possibility{{original research inline|date=February 2015}} is that the bridal chamber refers symbolically to the relationship of trust and singular devotion that should exist between God (bridegroom) and mankind (bride) \u2013 just as the marriage relationship (bedchamber) implies a devotion of husband and wife to each other that is expected to exclude all other parties.  This symbolic meaning is found for example in the [[Parable of the Ten Virgins]] \u2013 {{Bibleref2|Matt|25:1-13|NASB|(Matthew 25:1-13)}}, \"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom\".\n\nAnother interpretation of the Gospel of Philip finds Jesus as the central focus of the text. This view is supported by the Gnostic scholar, [[Marvin W. Meyer]]. Evidence for this belief can be found in the following selection of quotations from the gospel:\n\n{{quote|Those who produce the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit...[are] no longer a Christian but [are] Christ.}}\n\n{{quote|\"My God, my God, why, O Lord, have you forsaken me?\" (Mark 15:34). It was on the cross that he said these words, for he had departed from that place.}}\n\n{{quote|We are born again through the Holy Spirit, and we are conceived through Christ in baptism with two elements. We are anointed through the spirit, and when we are conceived, we were united.{{cite quote|date=February 2015}}}}\n\n{{quote|Jesus appeared [...] Jordan - the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven. }}\n\n{{quote|By perfecting the water of baptism, Jesus emptied it of death. Thus we do go down into the water, but we do not go down into death, in order that we may not be poured out into the spirit of the world. }}\n\nThus, according to Meyer, it is clear that without Jesus, the rituals and mysteries mentioned in this gospel would have no context. Furthermore, according to Meyer, this text seems to follow the beliefs of the [[Valentinius|Valentinian Christian sect]], a group that worshipped the Gnostic Christ, and is often linked to what is sometimes thought to be Valentinius' own text, the [[Gospel of Truth]].\n\nThe Gospel of Philip ends with its promise:\n\n{{quote|If anyone becomes a 'son of the bridechamber' he will receive the Light. If anyone does not receive it while he is in these places, he cannot receive it in the other place.{{efn|{{bibleref|Luke |16:26|NIV}} is indicated}} He who receives any Light will not be seen, nor can he be held fast. No one will be able to trouble him in this way, whether he lives in the world or leaves the world. He has already received the Truth in images, and the World has become the [[Aeon]]. For the Aeon already exists for him as [[Pleroma]], and he exists in this way. It is revealed to him alone, since it is not hidden in darkness and night but is hidden in a perfect Day and a holy Night.<ref>Gospel of Philip p.127, as quoted in {{harvnb|Grant| 1961|p=138}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Mary Magdalene ===\n[[File:The Master of the Parrot, Saint Mary Magdalene before a curtain supported by angels in an architectural niche.jpg|thumb|Mary Magdalene]] \nDespite a lack of support from the available text, the Gospel of Philip has been cited for the theory that Jesus married Mary Magdalene.{{efn|For an example in popular culture, see the 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.}} Much of the Gospel of Philip is dedicated to a discussion of marriage as a [[Sacred_mysteries#Christian_mysteries|sacred mystery]], and two passages directly refer to Mary Magdalene and her close relationship with Jesus:\n\n{{quote|There were three who always walked with the Lord: Mary, his mother, and her sister, and Magdalene, the one who was called his companion. His sister and his mother and his companion were each a Mary.{{sfn|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}} }}\n\nIn different places in the Gospel of Philip, Mary Magdalene is called Jesus's companion, partner or consort, using Coptic variants of the word ''koin\u00f4nos'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greek-dictionary.net/koin%C5%8Dnos |title=Greek-Dictionary.net |access-date=2011-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032231/http://www.greek-dictionary.net/koin%C5%8Dnos |archive-date=2012-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of Greek origin, or the word ''h\u00f4tre'', of Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Meyer|De Boer|2009|pp=36-37}} In this passage ''koin\u00f4nos'' is used. ''Koin\u00f4nos'' has a range of possible meanings: at root, it denotes a \"person engaged in fellowship or sharing with someone or in something\", but what exactly a ''koin\u00f4nos'' \"can share with his or her partner can take many forms, ranging from a common enterprise or experience to a shared business\".{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}} In the Bible, ''koin\u00f4nos'' is sometimes used to refer to a spouse ({{Bibleref|Malachi|2:14|NASB}}; cf. {{Bibleref|3 Maccabees|4:6|NRSV}}), but is also used to refer to a \"companion\" in faith ({{Bibleref|Philemon|17|NASB}}), a co-worker in proclaiming the Gospel ({{Bibleref|2 Corinthians|8:23|NASB}}), or a business associate ({{Bibleref|Luke|5:10|NASB}}).{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}} The Gospel of Philip uses cognates of ''koin\u00f4nos'' and Coptic equivalents to refer to the literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse, but also metaphorically, referring to a spiritual partnership, and the reunification of the Gnostic Christian with the divine realm.{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}} And importantly, there are occasions in the Gospel of Philip when the regular Coptic word for ''wife'' is used directly in reference to people who are clearly spouses, suggesting that the term ''koin\u00f4nos'' is \"reserved for a more specific usage\" in the Gospel of Philip.{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}}\n\nThat passage is also interesting for its mention of Jesus's sister (Jesus's unnamed sisters are mentioned in the [[New Testament]] at {{Bibleref|Mark|6:3|NASB}}), although the text is confusing on that point: she appears to be described first as the sister of Jesus's mother Mary (also mentioned in the [[Gospel of John]], possibly the same person as [[Mary of Clopas]]), then as the sister of Jesus, although this may be a translation problem.\n\nThe other passage, purportedly referring to Jesus kissing Mary Magdalene, is incomplete because of damage to the original manuscript. Several words are missing. Guesses as to what they were are shown below in brackets.<!-- noting that scholars vary over what the missing words should be --> Most notably there is a hole in the manuscript after the phrase \"and used to kiss her [often] on her....\" But the passage appears to describe Jesus kissing Magdalene, apparently described as \"barren\" and \"the mother of the angels\" at the beginning of the relevant paragraph and using a parable to explain to the disciples why he loved her more than he loved them:\n\n{{quote|As for Wisdom who is called \"the barren\", she is the mother [of the] angels. And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [... loved] her more than [all] the disciples [and used to] kiss her [often] on her [...]. The rest of [the disciples...] They said to him, \"Why do you love her more than all of us?\" The Savior answered and said to them, \"Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in the darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|p=278}} }}\n\nSome scholars speculate that \"hand\" is the word after \"kiss her... on her\". But it may have been cheek, forehead or feet to simply show respect.{{efn|In the critical edition edited by Bentley Layton,{{cn|date=August 2019}} the feet, a cheek and the forehead of Mary are raised as possibilities.}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=94}} {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}} translates it as \"on her mouth\".\n\n== Problems concerning the text ==\nThe ''Gospel of Philip'' is a text that reveals some connections with [[Early Christian]] writings of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] traditions. It is a series of ''logia'' or [[aphorism|aphoristic]] utterances, most of them apparently quotations and excerpts of lost writings, without any attempt at a narrative context. The main theme concerns the value of [[sacrament]]s. Scholars debate whether the original language was [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Greek (language)|Greek]]. [[Wesley W. Isenberg]], the text's translator, places the date \"perhaps as late as the 2nd half of the 3rd century\" and places its probable origin in Syria due to its references to [[Syriac language|Syriac]] words and eastern baptismal practices as well as its ascetic outlook. The online Early Christian Writings site gives it a date c. 180\u2013250.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/gospelphilip.html|title=Gospel of Philip|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com|access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref> Meyer gives its date as \"2nd or 3rd century\".{{sfn|Meyer|1999|p=235}}\n\n== Interpretation ==\nThe text has been interpreted by {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|p=141}} as a Christian Gnostic sacramental [[catechism|catechesis]].

Although it may seem similar to the [[Gospel of Thomas]], scholars are divided as to whether it is a single discourse or a collection of [[Valentinius|Valentinian]] sayings.{{sfn|Perkins|1993|p=184}}{{sfn|Meyer|De Boer|2009|pp=36-37}} [[Sacraments]], in particular the sacrament of marriage, are a major theme. As in the other gnostic texts, the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and [[Gospel of Mary]], the Gospel of Philip defends the tradition that gives [[Mary Magdalene]] special insight into Jesus' teaching, but does not support \"twenty-first-century inventions concerning Mary Magdalene as Jesus' wife and mother of his offspring.\"{{sfn|Perkins|2009|p=278}}\n\nNevertheless, novels such as [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' have encouraged the popular theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. The [[Ancient Greek]] manuscript describes Jesus as Mary's \"[[koinonos]]\", or \"companion\", which may sometimes imply a sexual relationship, but is always used as \"a metaphor for a deeper, spiritual partnership\".{{sfn|Schaberg|2004|pp=152-}}\n\n== Date of composition==\n{{Gnosticism}}\nThe gospel's title appears at the end of the Coptic manuscript in a colophon; the only connection with [[Philip the Apostle]] within the text is that he is the only apostle mentioned (at 73,8). The text proper makes no claim to be from Philip, though, similarly, the four [[New Testament]] gospels make no explicit claim of authorship. The Gospel of Philip was written between 150 AD and 350 AD, while Philip himself lived in the first century, making it extremely unlikely to be his writing. Most scholars hold a 3rd-century date of composition.{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=xi-xii}}\n\n== History and context ==\nA single manuscript of the ''Gospel of Philip'', in [[Coptic Language|Coptic]] ([[Nag Hammadi Codex II|CG II]]), was found in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], a cache of documents that was secreted in a jar and buried in the Egyptian desert at the end of the 4th century. The text was bound in the same [[codex]] that contained the better-known [[Gospel of Thomas]].\n\nFrom the mix of aphorisms, [[parable]]s, brief [[polemic]]s, narrative dialogue, biblical exegesis (especially of ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''), and dogmatic propositions, Wesley T. Isenberg, the editor and translator of the text, has attributed seventeen sayings (''logia'') to Jesus, nine of which {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}} characterizes as citations and interpretations of those found in the canonical gospels{{efn|Those in the canonical New Testament: 55,33\u201334; 57,3\u20135; 68,8\u201312; 68,26\u201327; 72,33\u201373,1; 77,18; 83,11\u201313; 84,7\u20139; 85,29\u201331.}} The new sayings,{{efn|The new sayings: 55,37\u201356,3; 58,10\u201314; 59,25\u201327; 63,29\u201330; 64,2\u20139; 64,10\u201312; 67,30\u201335; and 74,25\u201327.}} \"identified by the formula introducing them ('he said', 'the Lord said', or 'the Saviour said') are brief and enigmatic and are best interpreted from a gnostic perspective.{{sfn|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}}\n\nMuch of the Gospel of Philip is concerned with Gnostic views of the origin and nature of mankind and the [[sacrament]]s of [[baptism]], [[unction]] and [[marriage]]. The Gospel emphasizes the sacramental nature of the embrace between man and woman in the nuptial chamber, which is an [[archetype]] of spiritual unity, which entails the indissoluble nature of marriage.{{efn|The Old and New Testament and Gnostic contexts and the text are discussed by {{harvnb|Grant|1961 |129-140}} }} Many of the sayings are identifiably [[Gnostic]], and often appear quite mysterious and enigmatic (these are from the translation by {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}}):\n\n{{quote|The Lord said, \"Blessed is he who is before he came into being. For he who is, has been and shall be.\"}}\n\n{{quote|He who has knowledge of the truth is a free man, but the free man does not sin, for \"He who sins is the slave of sin\" (John 8:34). Truth is the mother, knowledge the father. }}\n\n{{quote|Echamoth is one thing and Echmoth, another. Echamoth is Wisdom simply, but Echmoth is the Wisdom of death, which is the one who knows death, which is called \"the little Wisdom\". }}\n\n{{quote| Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing.  (Compare with translation provided by the Nag Hammadi library: \"Those who say that ''the Lord'' died first and then rose up are in error \u2013 for He rose up first and then died.\"{{cite quote|date=February 2015}}) }}\n\n{{quote|Jesus came to crucify the world.}}\n\n{{quote|Jesus took them all by stealth, for he did not appear as he was, but in the manner in which they would be able to see him. He appeared to them all. He appeared to the great as great. He appeared to the small as small. He appeared to the angels as an angel, and to men as a man.}}\n\n{{quote|It is not possible for anyone to see anything of the things that actually exist unless he becomes like them... You saw the Spirit, you became spirit. You saw Christ, you became Christ. You saw the Father, you shall become Father. So in this place you see everything and do not see yourself, but in that place you do see yourself - and what you see you shall become.}}\n\n{{quote| Adam came into being from two virgins, from the Spirit and from the virgin earth. Christ therefore, was born from a virgin to rectify the Fall which occurred in the beginning. }}\n\nOne saying in particular appears to identify the levels of initiation in gnosticism, although what exactly the ''bridal chamber'' represented in gnostic thought is currently a matter of great debate:\n\n{{quote|The Lord did everything in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism and a eucharist and a redemption and a bridal chamber.}}\n\nOne possibility{{original research inline|date=February 2015}} is that the bridal chamber refers symbolically to the relationship of trust and singular devotion that should exist between God (bridegroom) and mankind (bride) \u2013 just as the marriage relationship (bedchamber) implies a devotion of husband and wife to each other that is expected to exclude all other parties.  This symbolic meaning is found for example in the [[Parable of the Ten Virgins]] \u2013 {{Bibleref2|Matt|25:1-13|NASB|(Matthew 25:1-13)}}, \"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom\".\n\nAnother interpretation of the Gospel of Philip finds Jesus as the central focus of the text. This view is supported by the Gnostic scholar, [[Marvin W. Meyer]]. Evidence for this belief can be found in the following selection of quotations from the gospel:\n\n{{quote|Those who produce the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit...[are] no longer a Christian but [are] Christ.}}\n\n{{quote|\"My God, my God, why, O Lord, have you forsaken me?\" (Mark 15:34). It was on the cross that he said these words, for he had departed from that place.}}\n\n{{quote|We are born again through the Holy Spirit, and we are conceived through Christ in baptism with two elements. We are anointed through the spirit, and when we are conceived, we were united.{{cite quote|date=February 2015}}}}\n\n{{quote|Jesus appeared [...] Jordan - the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven. }}\n\n{{quote|By perfecting the water of baptism, Jesus emptied it of death. Thus we do go down into the water, but we do not go down into death, in order that we may not be poured out into the spirit of the world. }}\n\nThus, according to Meyer, it is clear that without Jesus, the rituals and mysteries mentioned in this gospel would have no context. Furthermore, according to Meyer, this text seems to follow the beliefs of the [[Valentinius|Valentinian Christian sect]], a group that worshipped the Gnostic Christ, and is often linked to what is sometimes thought to be Valentinius' own text, the [[Gospel of Truth]].\n\nThe Gospel of Philip ends with its promise:\n\n{{quote|If anyone becomes a 'son of the bridechamber' he will receive the Light. If anyone does not receive it while he is in these places, he cannot receive it in the other place.{{efn|{{bibleref|Luke |16:26|NIV}} is indicated}} He who receives any Light will not be seen, nor can he be held fast. No one will be able to trouble him in this way, whether he lives in the world or leaves the world. He has already received the Truth in images, and the World has become the [[Aeon]]. For the Aeon already exists for him as [[Pleroma]], and he exists in this way. It is revealed to him alone, since it is not hidden in darkness and night but is hidden in a perfect Day and a holy Night.<ref>Gospel of Philip p.127, as quoted in {{harvnb|Grant| 1961|p=138}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Mary Magdalene ===\n[[File:The Master of the Parrot, Saint Mary Magdalene before a curtain supported by angels in an architectural niche.jpg|thumb|Mary Magdalene]] \nDespite a lack of support from the available text, the Gospel of Philip has been cited for the theory that Jesus married Mary Magdalene.{{efn|For an example in popular culture, see the 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.}} Much of the Gospel of Philip is dedicated to a discussion of marriage as a [[Sacred_mysteries#Christian_mysteries|sacred mystery]], and two passages directly refer to Mary Magdalene and her close relationship with Jesus:\n\n{{quote|There were three who always walked with the Lord: Mary, his mother, and her sister, and Magdalene, the one who was called his companion. His sister and his mother and his companion were each a Mary.{{sfn|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}} }}\n\nIn different places in the Gospel of Philip, Mary Magdalene is called Jesus's companion, partner or consort, using Coptic variants of the word ''koin\u00f4nos'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greek-dictionary.net/koin%C5%8Dnos |title=Greek-Dictionary.net |access-date=2011-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032231/http://www.greek-dictionary.net/koin%C5%8Dnos |archive-date=2012-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of Greek origin, or the word ''h\u00f4tre'', of Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Meyer|De Boer|2009|pp=36-37}} In this passage ''koin\u00f4nos'' is used. ''Koin\u00f4nos'' has a range of possible meanings: at root, it denotes a \"person engaged in fellowship or sharing with someone or in something\", but what exactly a ''koin\u00f4nos'' \"can share with his or her partner can take many forms, ranging from a common enterprise or experience to a shared business\".{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}} In the Bible, ''koin\u00f4nos'' is sometimes used to refer to a spouse ({{Bibleref|Malachi|2:14|NASB}}; cf. {{Bibleref|3 Maccabees|4:6|NRSV}}), but is also used to refer to a \"companion\" in faith ({{Bibleref|Philemon|17|NASB}}), a co-worker in proclaiming the Gospel ({{Bibleref|2 Corinthians|8:23|NASB}}), or a business associate ({{Bibleref|Luke|5:10|NASB}}).{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}} The Gospel of Philip uses cognates of ''koin\u00f4nos'' and Coptic equivalents to refer to the literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse, but also metaphorically, referring to a spiritual partnership, and the reunification of the Gnostic Christian with the divine realm.{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}} And importantly, there are occasions in the Gospel of Philip when the regular Coptic word for ''wife'' is used directly in reference to people who are clearly spouses, suggesting that the term ''koin\u00f4nos'' is \"reserved for a more specific usage\" in the Gospel of Philip.{{sfn|Marjanen| 1996|pp=151-160}}\n\nThat passage is also interesting for its mention of Jesus's sister (Jesus's unnamed sisters are mentioned in the [[New Testament]] at {{Bibleref|Mark|6:3|NASB}}), although the text is confusing on that point: she appears to be described first as the sister of Jesus's mother Mary (also mentioned in the [[Gospel of John]], possibly the same person as [[Mary of Clopas]]), then as the sister of Jesus, although this may be a translation problem.\n\nThe other passage, purportedly referring to Jesus kissing Mary Magdalene, is incomplete because of damage to the original manuscript. Several words are missing. Guesses as to what they were are shown below in brackets.<!-- noting that scholars vary over what the missing words should be --> Most notably there is a hole in the manuscript after the phrase \"and used to kiss her [often] on her....\" But the passage appears to describe Jesus kissing Magdalene, apparently described as \"barren\" and \"the mother of the angels\" at the beginning of the relevant paragraph and using a parable to explain to the disciples why he loved her more than he loved them:\n\n{{quote|As for Wisdom who is called \"the barren\", she is the mother [of the] angels. And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [... loved] her more than [all] the disciples [and used to] kiss her [often] on her [...]. The rest of [the disciples...] They said to him, \"Why do you love her more than all of us?\" The Savior answered and said to them, \"Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in the darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|p=278}} }}\n\nSome scholars speculate that \"hand\" is the word after \"kiss her... on her\". But it may have been cheek, forehead or feet to simply show respect.{{efn|In the critical edition edited by Bentley Layton,{{cn|date=August 2019}} the feet, a cheek and the forehead of Mary are raised as possibilities.}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=94}} {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|pp=139-}} translates it as \"on her mouth\".\n\n== Problems concerning the text ==\nThe ''Gospel of Philip'' is a text that reveals some connections with [[Early Christian]] writings of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] traditions. It is a series of ''logia'' or [[aphorism|aphoristic]] utterances, most of them apparently quotations and excerpts of lost writings, without any attempt at a narrative context. The main theme concerns the value of [[sacrament]]s. Scholars debate whether the original language was [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Greek (language)|Greek]]. [[Wesley W. Isenberg]], the text's translator, places the date \"perhaps as late as the 2nd half of the 3rd century\" and places its probable origin in Syria due to its references to [[Syriac language|Syriac]] words and eastern baptismal practices as well as its ascetic outlook. The online Early Christian Writings site gives it a date c. 180\u2013250.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/gospelphilip.html|title=Gospel of Philip|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com|access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref> Meyer gives its date as \"2nd or 3rd century\".{{sfn|Meyer|1999|p=235}}\n\n== Interpretation ==\nThe text has been interpreted by {{harvnb|Isenberg |1996|p=141}} as a Christian Gnostic sacramental [[catechism|catechesis]].

Built in 1730 by Robert Carter II on land purchased from heirs of Nicholas Spencer by [[Robert Carter I|Robert \"King\" Carter]]]]\n\nAs originally established by the Virginia colony's [[House of Burgesses]], it was separated from [[Northumberland County, Virginia|Northumberland County]] in 1653. The territory of Westmoreland County encompassed much of what later became the various counties and cities of [[Northern Virginia]], including the [[Alexandria, Virginia|city of Alexandria]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], and [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]. These were part of Westmoreland until 1664, when [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] was formed.\n\nWestmoreland County was the birthplace of [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]] (at the former settlement of [[Bridges Creek, Virginia]]);<ref>Marquis, A.N. Company. ''Who's Who In America'', vol. 1:Historical Volume (1607-1896), revised ed., Marquis, A.N. Company., 1967.</ref> of [[James Monroe]], the fifth President; and of [[Robert E. Lee]], general and commander of the [[Confederate Army|Confederate armies]].\n\nThe county was the place of residence for Colonel [[Nicholas Spencer]] (1633-1689), who patented the land at [[Mount Vernon]] in 1674 with his friend Lt. Col. [[John Washington]], ancestor of [[George Washington]]. Spencer, who served as President of the Council and acting [[List of Governors of Virginia|Governor]] of the [[Colony of Virginia]], was the cousin of, and agent for, the [[Baron Colepeper|Barons Colepeper]], [[Proprietary colony|proprietors]] of the [[Northern Neck]]. Spencer lived at his plantation, ''Nomini'', which his descendants later sold to [[Robert Carter I]].

At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Basiliscus and Armatus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1229 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 476 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n\nBecause the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] occurred in 476, many historians consider it the last year of [[ancient history]] and the first year of the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.<ref>Clare, I.

He petitions [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Orestes]] (''[[magister militum]]'') to reward his [[mercenaries]] for their services and their support of his rebellion a year earlier, by making good on his promise to grant them lands to settle permanently in [[Italy]]. Orestes refuses this proposal and Odoacer leads his tribesmen in a revolt. \n* August &ndash; [[Basiliscus]], Roman [[usurper]], is deposed and [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] is restored as emperor of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. With the support of his adviser [[Illus]], he besieges [[Constantinople]], but the Senate opens the gates, allowing him to resume the [[throne]]. Basiliscus flees to [[sanctuary]] in a church, but surrenders himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood. Basiliscus is sent to a fortress in [[Cappadocia]], where he later dies from [[starvation]]. \n* [[August 23]] &ndash; Odoacer, age 43, is proclaimed ''rex Italiae'' (\"king of Italy\") by his troops.

{"title_page": "Olympic Games ceremony", "text_new": "{{Olympic Games infobox}}\n'''Olympic Games ceremonies''' of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] were an integral part of these Games; the modern Olympic games have opening, closing, and medal ceremonies. Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies harken back to the Ancient Games from which the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympics]] draw their ancestry. An example of this is the prominence of [[Greece]] in both the opening and closing ceremonies. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]], the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an [[olive wreath]]. The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter, and cannot be changed by the host nation. This requirement of seeking the approval of the [[IOC|International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) includes the artistic portion of opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe ceremonies have evolved over the centuries. Ancient Games incorporated ceremonies to mark the beginning and ending of each successive game. There are both similarities and differences between the ancient Olympic ceremonies and their modern counterparts. While the presentation of the Games has evolved with improvements in technology and the desire of the host nations to showcase their own artistic expression, the basic events of each ceremony have remained unchanged. The presentation of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies continue to increase in scope, scale, and expense with each successive celebration of the Games, but they are still steeped in tradition. The [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028 Los Angeles Olympics]] organisers propose that the opening and closing ceremonies will each, for the first time, be staged across two different stadiums.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-la2024-olympic-ceremonies-20170116-story.html|title=L.A. organizers propose linked, simultaneous Olympic ceremonies for Coliseum, Inglewood stadium|last=Wharton|first=David|date=16 January 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Ancient forerunners ==\nThe Ancient Games, held in Greece from ca. 776&nbsp;BC to ca. 393&nbsp;AD,<ref name=\"Ancient Olympic Games\">{{cite web |title = Ancient Olympic Games|publisher = The Olympic Movement|url = http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/Ancient-Olympic-Games/ |accessdate = 2010-02-15}}</ref> provide the first examples of Olympic ceremonies.

Eventually, by roughly the 77th Olympiad, a standard 18-event program was established.<ref name=oprogram>{{Cite journal |title=The Ancient Olympic Games:A Reconstruction of the Program|last=Howell|first=Maxwell L.|publisher=San Diego State University|year=1975}}</ref>  In order to open a Games in ancient Greece the organizers would hold an Inauguration Festival.

It is not compulsory for athletes to participate in the opening ceremonies. Because some of the first events of the Games may start on the day before, on the day, or the day after the ceremonies, athletes competing in these early events may elect not to participate.\n\nFor every Opening Ceremony, each host country has a theme. During the \"Parade of Nations\", the host country's goal is to represent their cultural identity and to show the world their place in society.  For example, in the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] the theme was \u201cunity\u201d. On May 12, 2008, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|a devastating earthquake]] erupted in Sichuan. As the host country, China wanted to remember this tragic event by having [[Yao Ming]], a Chinese basketball legend, walk hand-in-hand with Lin Hao, a nine-year-old boy who saved some of his classmates during the earthquake.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEach country's delegation is led by a sign with the name of their country and by their nation's flag.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Traditionally, since the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] Greece always enters first and leads the parade due to the historical status as the progenitor of the Olympics, and the host nation enters last.<ref name=OCprotocol1/><ref>{{YouTube|id=lnPqFq1lIGg|title=Athletes Parade-Opening Ceremony London 2012 Olympics}}</ref> All other participating teams enter after Greece and before the host nation, in alphabetical order according to a language selected by the organizing committee for those games, which is usually the dominant language in the area of the host city. Announcers announce each country's name in English, French and the dominant language of the area of the host city, if neither English nor French is the dominant language. Beginning with the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (Summer or Winter) will march immediately before the current host in descending order. Therefore, in 2021 (for example), host [[Japan]] will follow the [[2028 Summer Olympics|United States]] and [[2024 Summer Olympics|France]] respectively as the final three nations to march. Also, the [[Refugee Olympic Team]] will now follow Greece as the second team to enter.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morgan|first=Liam|title=France, United States and Refugee team given prominent slots in Tokyo 2020 parade|publisher=Inside the Games|date=2019-12-03|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1087784/ioc-change-opening-ceremony-order |accessdate=2020-01-01 | location=Lausanne}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, the Greek flag led the parade, while the Greek team entered last, as the host nation; [[Saint Lucia]] (\u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 in [[Greek language|Greek]]) then entered first. In the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] were official languages of the games, but due to the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in [[French language|French]] alphabetical order. Due to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] pronunciation issues, all four games taking place in Japan, including the upcoming [[2020 Summer Olympics]], had the nations enter in English alphabetical order instead of Japanese characters. In the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 Summer Olympics]], teams were ordered by the number of strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name; this is expected to happen again in the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker|first=Peter|title=Beijing Olympics open with spectacular ceremony|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2008-08-08|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china1 |accessdate=2009-01-10 | location=London}}</ref> In the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2010 Winter Olympics]], teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the Cyrillic alphabetical order, which is the Russian language's official script, while in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the [[Hangul]] alphabetical order, which is Korean language's official script.\n\n===Traditional events===\n{{further|List of people who have opened the Olympic Games}}\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II opens the 2012 London Olympic Games.webm|thumb|200px|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opens the 2012 London Olympic Games]]After all nations have entered, the [[President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games|President of the Organizing Committee]] makes a speech, followed by the [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC president]]. At the end of his speech, he introduces the representative or head of state of the host country who officially declares the opening of the Games. Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Olympic Charter presently requires the opener to be the host country's [[head of state]].<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\" /> However, there have been many cases where someone other than the host country's head of state opened the Games. The first example was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|Games of the II Olympiad]] in Paris in 1900, which had no opening ceremony before as part of the 1900 World's Fair. There are five examples from the United States alone in which the Games were not opened by the head of state.<ref>The first case was the [[1904 Summer Olympics|St. Louis Games]] at which David Francis, President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, performed the ceremony; nobody had thought of inviting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1932, the then-[[Governor of New York]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], opened the [[1932 Winter Olympics|III Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]]. Later that year the Vice President of the United States, [[Charles Curtis]], opened the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Games of the X Olympiad]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], stating, however, that he was doing so on behalf of President [[Herbert Hoover]]. In 1960, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] was sent by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to open the [[1960 Winter Olympics|VIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], California, and finally, in 1980, Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] stood in for President [[Jimmy Carter]] to open the [[1980 Winter Olympics|XIII Olympic Winter Games]], also in Lake Placid.</ref>\n\nThe Olympic Charter provides<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\">{{cite web |title=Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|year=2015|url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf|accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref> that the person designated to open the Games should do so by reciting whichever of the following lines is appropriate:\n\n* If at the Games of the [[Olympiad]] (Summer Olympics): ''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era''.\n* If at the Winter Games: ''I declare open the [ordinal number] Olympic Winter Games of [name of the host city].''\n\nBefore 1936, the opening official would often make a short welcoming speech before declaring the Games open. However, since 1936, when [[Adolf Hitler]] opened both the [[1936 Winter Olympics|Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics]] and the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Summer Olympics]], the openers have used the standard formula. Recent editions of the Winter Games have seen a trend of using the first version instead of the second, which happened in both the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Opening Ceremony: 2010 Winter Games declared open  |publisher=Vancouver 2010| date=12 February 2010|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/afp-news/opening-ceremony--2010-winter-games-declared-open_274384BS.html| accessdate=2010-02-19 }}</ref> Winter Games. There have been seven further exceptions to the rule:\n\n* In 1976, [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Queen of Canada]], opened the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympics]] (first in French followed by the English) with:\n''I declare open the Olympic Games of 1976, celebrating the XXI Olympiad of the modern era.''<ref>{{YouTube|id=aKh9881Xc8A|title=Montreal 1976 Olympics Opening}}</ref>\n\n* In 1984, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] opened the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Summer Olympics]] with:\n''Celebrating the XXIII Olympiad of the modern era, I declare open the Olympic Games of Los Angeles''.<ref>{{YouTube|id=cbbVk3AGVhE|title=1984 LA Opening Ceremonies \u2013 Lighting of the Cauldron}}</ref>\n\n* In 2002, U.S. President [[George W.

The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic flag must \"fly for the entire duration of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium\".<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\"/> At most games, the flag has been carried into the stadium by prominent athletes of the host nation, but in [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012]], it was carried by an international group of athletes and non-athletes famous for promoting Olympic values, including [[Muhammad Ali]] as a symbolic flag-bearer.\n\nThe flag bearers of all countries then circle a rostrum, where one athlete of the host nation (since the 1920 Summer Olympics), and one judge of the host nation (since the 1972 Summer Olympics) speak the [[Olympic Oath]], declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules of their respective sport.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> Since the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, continuing with the tradition started at the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]] a coach from the host nation speaks out the Olympic Oath. For the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in PyeongChang, the three oaths are merged into one as the Unified Oath where one athlete, judge, and coach recite one line of the oath respectively before the athlete finishes it.\n\n===Olympic flame===\n{{Further|Olympic flame|List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron}}\n[[File:Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima lights cauldron (28771915476).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vanderlei de Lima]] lights the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]]\nFinally, the [[Olympic Torch|Torch]] is brought into the [[Olympic Stadium|stadium]], passed from athlete to athlete during the [[Olympic Torch|torch relay]], until it reaches the last carrier; often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony for the 2010 Games]] in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was [[BC Place Stadium|BC Place]], which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist [[Catriona Le May Doan]], [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Nancy Greene]], who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Steve Nash]], a native of nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and hockey legend [[Wayne Gretzky]], to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm failed to rise; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.\n\nAfter the official conclusion of the Opening Ceremony, Gretzky was whisked away to a waiting car which took him to the secondary cauldron. Once there, he lit it to correspond with the tradition of Olympics past.\n\nDuring the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the cauldron located inside [[Olympic Stadium (London)]] was not visible from outside of the stadium.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 ceremony]] had yellow fireworks representing doves. [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|In 2010]], dove figures were projected on the stage floor. The [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 ceremony]] had bicyclists with dove-wings, lit by LEDs. In the [[2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2014 ceremony]] several dancers, holding strands of blue LED lights, danced on the shape of a dove projected on the stadium floor. In the [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2016 ceremony]], children with dove shaped kites were seen running with the first Olympic Laurel winner, [[Kipchoge Keino]].\n\n==Medal presentation==\n[[File:Victory ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The medal ceremony for the [[Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's uneven bars|women's uneven bars]] at the London 2012 Summer Olympics]]\nAfter each Olympic event is completed, a medal ceremony is held. The Summer Games would usually conduct the ceremonies immediately after the event at the respective venues, whereas the Winter editions would present the medals at a nightly victory ceremony held at a medal plaza, excluding the most of indoor events. A three\u2013tiered rostrum is used for the three medal winners, with the gold medal winner ascending to the highest platform, in the centre, with the silver and bronze medalists flanking. The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Olympic Games \u2013 the Medal Ceremonies|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> The IOC member is usually accompanied by a person from sports federation governing the sport (such as IAAF in athletics or FINA in swimming), who presents each athlete with a small bouquet of flowers. When the Games were held in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the medal winners also received [[olive wreath]]s in honor of the tradition at the Ancient Olympics. For the [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] Games in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], the flowers were replaced by a small 3D model of the Games' logo and [[Pyeongchang]] Games in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]] a stuffed animal. After medals are distributed, the flags of the nations of the three medalists are raised. The flag of the gold medalist's country is in the centre and raised the highest while the flag of the silver medalist's country is on the left facing the flags and the flag of the bronze medalist's country is on the right, both at lower elevations than the gold medalist's country's flag.\n\nThe flags are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medalist's country plays.<ref name=otraditions>{{cite news |title=Symbols and Traditions|newspaper=USA Today|date=1999-07-12|url=https://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr03.htm|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> Citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies.

For example, they are required to wear only pre-approved outfits that are standard for the athlete's national Olympic team.  They are not allowed to display any political affiliation or make a political statement while on the medal stand.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> The most famous violation of this rule was the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] of [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].\n\nFor their actions, IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] demanded their expulsion from the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news |title=1968 Black Athletes make silent protest|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm|accessdate=2009-01-10 | date=1968-10-17}}</ref> After the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) refused to do so, Brundage threatened to remove the entire [[United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics|United States]] track and field team from the Olympics.

Then after the flame is extinguished, there would be a party for the athletes featuring some of the host country's music culture\n\nThe traditional part of the closing ceremony starts with the \"Parade of Flags\",<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> where flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium in single file, with the Greek flag in the lead and the host nation's flag bringing up the rear. Behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. This \"Parade of Athletes,\"<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> the blending of all the athletes, is a tradition that began during the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as \"one nation.\" Prior to the 1956 Games, no Olympic Team had ever marched in the closing ceremony of the Modern or the Ancient Games. It was the very first International Peace March ever to be staged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwing.co.uk|title=Baron Pierre de Coubertin had a 'Dream'|website=www.johnwing.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Melbourne (Equestrian&nbsp;\u2013 Stockholm) 1956|publisher=[[British Olympic Association]] |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=S&ga=14 |accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> (In [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]], the athletes marched in with their countrymen, then dispersed and mingled as the ceremonies went on.) The Winter Olympics followed suit in [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960]].\n\nAfter all the athletes enter the stadium, the final medals ceremony of the Games is held. The organizing committee of the respective host city, after consulting with the IOC, determines which event will have its medals presented.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> During the Summer Olympics, this is usually the men's marathon.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> Traditionally, the men's marathon is held in the last hours of competition on the last day of the Olympics, and the race is won just before the start of the closing ceremony.  However, recent Summer Olympiads in [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]], [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]], and [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio]] staged the marathon in the early morning due to heat problems in the host city. Since the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|2006 Winter Olympics]], the medals for the men's 50&nbsp;km cross-country skiing event were presented at the closing ceremony. The medallists national flags are then hoisted and the national anthem of the gold medallist's country is played.\n\nThe newly elected members of the [[IOC Athletes' Commission]] then present a bouquet of flowers to a representative of the volunteers, as a thank you to them for their work during the Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/>\n\nNext, two other national flags are hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to again honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> \"[[Hymn to Liberty]]\", the national anthem of Greece, has been performed at every closing ceremony of the Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Anthem|url=http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|publisher=Hellenic Army Academy|accessdate=30 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209135154/http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy}}</ref> In [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], during the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]], the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of [[Los Angeles]] instead of the flag of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/multimedia-player/all-photos/1980/08/03/xaaku015/ |title=Moscow 1980 \u2014 Closing Ceremony \u2014 Los Angeles and Moscow's flags in the stadium. |publisher=Olympic.org |date=August 3, 1980 |accessdate=February 24, 2014 }}</ref> In [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], two Greek flags were raised because [[Greece]] was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games.

There are four such flags:\n* '''The Antwerp flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1920 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], and was passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Summer Olympics]] through the 1984 Games in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]].\n* '''The Oslo flag''' was presented to the IOC at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] by the city of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], and is passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Winter Olympics]].\n* '''The Seoul flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1988 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME TO USE 'REPUBLIC'--> as a replacement for the Antwerp flag. This flag was used until the 2012 Games in [[London]], [[England]].\n* '''The Rio flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 2016 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]  as a replacement for the Seoul flag. It'll be passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThis tradition was modified slightly at the 2006 Winter Games in [[Turin]], Italy. The flag was passed from [[Sergio Chiamparino]], the mayor of Turin, to [[Sam Sullivan]], the mayor of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.

Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies harken back to the Ancient Games from which the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympics]] draw their ancestry. An example of this is the prominence of [[Greece]] in both the opening and closing ceremonies. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]], the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an [[olive wreath]]. The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter, and cannot be changed by the host nation. This requirement of seeking the approval of the [[IOC|International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) includes the artistic portion of opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe ceremonies have evolved over the centuries. Ancient Games incorporated ceremonies to mark the beginning and ending of each successive game. There are both similarities and differences between the ancient Olympic ceremonies and their modern counterparts. While the presentation of the Games has evolved with improvements in technology and the desire of the host nations to showcase their own artistic expression, the basic events of each ceremony have remained unchanged. The presentation of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies continue to increase in scope, scale, and expense with each successive celebration of the Games, but they are still steeped in tradition. The [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028 Los Angeles Olympics]] organisers propose that the opening and closing ceremonies will each, for the first time, be staged across two different stadiums.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-la2024-olympic-ceremonies-20170116-story.html|title=L.A. organizers propose linked, simultaneous Olympic ceremonies for Coliseum, Inglewood stadium|last=Wharton|first=David|date=16 January 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Ancient forerunners ==\nThe Ancient Games, held in Greece from ca. 776&nbsp;BC to ca. 393&nbsp;AD,<ref name=\"Ancient Olympic Games\">{{cite web |title = Ancient Olympic Games|publisher = The Olympic Movement|url = http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/Ancient-Olympic-Games/ |accessdate = 2010-02-15}}</ref> provide the first examples of Olympic ceremonies.

The opening ceremony at the Beijing Games, for example, reportedly cost US$100&nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurring in the artistic portion of the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|date=2008-08-08|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref>\n\n===Parade of Nations===\nThe traditional part of the ceremonies starts with a \"'''Parade of Nations'''\", during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, country by country. It is not compulsory for athletes to participate in the opening ceremonies. Because some of the first events of the Games may start on the day before, on the day, or the day after the ceremonies, athletes competing in these early events may elect not to participate.\n\nFor every Opening Ceremony, each host country has a theme. During the \"Parade of Nations\", the host country's goal is to represent their cultural identity and to show the world their place in society.  For example, in the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] the theme was \u201cunity\u201d. On May 12, 2008, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|a devastating earthquake]] erupted in Sichuan. As the host country, China wanted to remember this tragic event by having [[Yao Ming]], a Chinese basketball legend, walk hand-in-hand with Lin Hao, a nine-year-old boy who saved some of his classmates during the earthquake.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEach country's delegation is led by a sign with the name of their country and by their nation's flag.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Traditionally, since the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] Greece always enters first and leads the parade due to the historical status as the progenitor of the Olympics, and the host nation enters last.<ref name=OCprotocol1/><ref>{{YouTube|id=lnPqFq1lIGg|title=Athletes Parade-Opening Ceremony London 2012 Olympics}}</ref> All other participating teams enter after Greece and before the host nation, in alphabetical order according to a language selected by the organizing committee for those games, which is usually the dominant language in the area of the host city. Announcers announce each country's name in English, French and the dominant language of the area of the host city, if neither English nor French is the dominant language. Beginning with the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (Summer or Winter) will march immediately before the current host in descending order. Therefore, in 2021 (for example), host [[Japan]] will follow the [[2028 Summer Olympics|United States]] and [[2024 Summer Olympics|France]] respectively as the final three nations to march. Also, the [[Refugee Olympic Team]] will now follow Greece as the second team to enter.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morgan|first=Liam|title=France, United States and Refugee team given prominent slots in Tokyo 2020 parade|publisher=Inside the Games|date=2019-12-03|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1087784/ioc-change-opening-ceremony-order |accessdate=2020-01-01 | location=Lausanne}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, the Greek flag led the parade, while the Greek team entered last, as the host nation; [[Saint Lucia]] (\u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 in [[Greek language|Greek]]) then entered first. In the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] were official languages of the games, but due to the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in [[French language|French]] alphabetical order. Due to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] pronunciation issues, all four games taking place in Japan, including the upcoming [[2020 Summer Olympics]], had the nations enter in English alphabetical order instead of Japanese characters. In the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 Summer Olympics]], teams were ordered by the number of strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name; this is expected to happen again in the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker|first=Peter|title=Beijing Olympics open with spectacular ceremony|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2008-08-08|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china1 |accessdate=2009-01-10 | location=London}}</ref> In the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2010 Winter Olympics]], teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the Cyrillic alphabetical order, which is the Russian language's official script, while in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the [[Hangul]] alphabetical order, which is Korean language's official script.\n\n===Traditional events===\n{{further|List of people who have opened the Olympic Games}}\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II opens the 2012 London Olympic Games.webm|thumb|200px|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opens the 2012 London Olympic Games]]After all nations have entered, the [[President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games|President of the Organizing Committee]] makes a speech, followed by the [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC president]]. At the end of his speech, he introduces the representative or head of state of the host country who officially declares the opening of the Games. Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Olympic Charter presently requires the opener to be the host country's [[head of state]].<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\" /> However, there have been many cases where someone other than the host country's head of state opened the Games. The first example was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|Games of the II Olympiad]] in Paris in 1900, which had no opening ceremony before as part of the 1900 World's Fair. There are five examples from the United States alone in which the Games were not opened by the head of state.<ref>The first case was the [[1904 Summer Olympics|St. Louis Games]] at which David Francis, President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, performed the ceremony; nobody had thought of inviting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1932, the then-[[Governor of New York]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], opened the [[1932 Winter Olympics|III Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]]. Later that year the Vice President of the United States, [[Charles Curtis]], opened the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Games of the X Olympiad]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], stating, however, that he was doing so on behalf of President [[Herbert Hoover]]. In 1960, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] was sent by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to open the [[1960 Winter Olympics|VIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], California, and finally, in 1980, Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] stood in for President [[Jimmy Carter]] to open the [[1980 Winter Olympics|XIII Olympic Winter Games]], also in Lake Placid.</ref>\n\nThe Olympic Charter provides<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\">{{cite web |title=Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|year=2015|url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf|accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref> that the person designated to open the Games should do so by reciting whichever of the following lines is appropriate:\n\n* If at the Games of the [[Olympiad]] (Summer Olympics): ''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era''.\n* If at the Winter Games: ''I declare open the [ordinal number] Olympic Winter Games of [name of the host city].''\n\nBefore 1936, the opening official would often make a short welcoming speech before declaring the Games open. However, since 1936, when [[Adolf Hitler]] opened both the [[1936 Winter Olympics|Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics]] and the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Summer Olympics]], the openers have used the standard formula. Recent editions of the Winter Games have seen a trend of using the first version instead of the second, which happened in both the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Opening Ceremony: 2010 Winter Games declared open  |publisher=Vancouver 2010| date=12 February 2010|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/afp-news/opening-ceremony--2010-winter-games-declared-open_274384BS.html| accessdate=2010-02-19 }}</ref> Winter Games. There have been seven further exceptions to the rule:\n\n* In 1976, [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Queen of Canada]], opened the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympics]] (first in French followed by the English) with:\n''I declare open the Olympic Games of 1976, celebrating the XXI Olympiad of the modern era.''<ref>{{YouTube|id=aKh9881Xc8A|title=Montreal 1976 Olympics Opening}}</ref>\n\n* In 1984, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] opened the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Summer Olympics]] with:\n''Celebrating the XXIII Olympiad of the modern era, I declare open the Olympic Games of Los Angeles''.<ref>{{YouTube|id=cbbVk3AGVhE|title=1984 LA Opening Ceremonies \u2013 Lighting of the Cauldron}}</ref>\n\n* In 2002, U.S. President [[George W.

The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic flag must \"fly for the entire duration of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium\".<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\"/> At most games, the flag has been carried into the stadium by prominent athletes of the host nation, but in [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012]], it was carried by an international group of athletes and non-athletes famous for promoting Olympic values, including [[Muhammad Ali]] as a symbolic flag-bearer.\n\nThe flag bearers of all countries then circle a rostrum, where one athlete of the host nation (since the 1920 Summer Olympics), and one judge of the host nation (since the 1972 Summer Olympics) speak the [[Olympic Oath]], declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules of their respective sport.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> Since the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, continuing with the tradition started at the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]] a coach from the host nation speaks out the Olympic Oath. For the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in PyeongChang, the three oaths are merged into one as the Unified Oath where one athlete, judge, and coach recite one line of the oath respectively before the athlete finishes it.\n\n===Olympic flame===\n{{Further|Olympic flame|List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron}}\n[[File:Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima lights cauldron (28771915476).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vanderlei de Lima]] lights the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]]\nFinally, the [[Olympic Torch|Torch]] is brought into the [[Olympic Stadium|stadium]], passed from athlete to athlete during the [[Olympic Torch|torch relay]], until it reaches the last carrier; often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony for the 2010 Games]] in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was [[BC Place Stadium|BC Place]], which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist [[Catriona Le May Doan]], [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Nancy Greene]], who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Steve Nash]], a native of nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and hockey legend [[Wayne Gretzky]], to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm failed to rise; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.\n\nAfter the official conclusion of the Opening Ceremony, Gretzky was whisked away to a waiting car which took him to the secondary cauldron. Once there, he lit it to correspond with the tradition of Olympics past.\n\nDuring the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the cauldron located inside [[Olympic Stadium (London)]] was not visible from outside of the stadium.

The Summer Games would usually conduct the ceremonies immediately after the event at the respective venues, whereas the Winter editions would present the medals at a nightly victory ceremony held at a medal plaza, excluding the most of indoor events. A three\u2013tiered rostrum is used for the three medal winners, with the gold medal winner ascending to the highest platform, in the centre, with the silver and bronze medalists flanking. The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Olympic Games \u2013 the Medal Ceremonies|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> The IOC member is usually accompanied by a person from sports federation governing the sport (such as IAAF in athletics or FINA in swimming), who presents each athlete with a small bouquet of flowers. When the Games were held in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the medal winners also received [[olive wreath]]s in honor of the tradition at the Ancient Olympics.

Then after the flame is extinguished, there would be a party for the athletes featuring some of the host country's music culture\n\nThe traditional part of the closing ceremony starts with the \"Parade of Flags\",<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> where flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium in single file, with the Greek flag in the lead and the host nation's flag bringing up the rear. Behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. This \"Parade of Athletes,\"<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> the blending of all the athletes, is a tradition that began during the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as \"one nation.\" Prior to the 1956 Games, no Olympic Team had ever marched in the closing ceremony of the Modern or the Ancient Games. It was the very first International Peace March ever to be staged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwing.co.uk|title=Baron Pierre de Coubertin had a 'Dream'|website=www.johnwing.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Melbourne (Equestrian&nbsp;\u2013 Stockholm) 1956|publisher=[[British Olympic Association]] |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=S&ga=14 |accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> (In [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]], the athletes marched in with their countrymen, then dispersed and mingled as the ceremonies went on.) The Winter Olympics followed suit in [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960]].\n\nAfter all the athletes enter the stadium, the final medals ceremony of the Games is held. The organizing committee of the respective host city, after consulting with the IOC, determines which event will have its medals presented.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> During the Summer Olympics, this is usually the men's marathon.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> Traditionally, the men's marathon is held in the last hours of competition on the last day of the Olympics, and the race is won just before the start of the closing ceremony.  However, recent Summer Olympiads in [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]], [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]], and [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio]] staged the marathon in the early morning due to heat problems in the host city. Since the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|2006 Winter Olympics]], the medals for the men's 50&nbsp;km cross-country skiing event were presented at the closing ceremony. The medallists national flags are then hoisted and the national anthem of the gold medallist's country is played.\n\nThe newly elected members of the [[IOC Athletes' Commission]] then present a bouquet of flowers to a representative of the volunteers, as a thank you to them for their work during the Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/>\n\nNext, two other national flags are hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to again honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> \"[[Hymn to Liberty]]\", the national anthem of Greece, has been performed at every closing ceremony of the Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Anthem|url=http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|publisher=Hellenic Army Academy|accessdate=30 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209135154/http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy}}</ref> In [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], during the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]], the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of [[Los Angeles]] instead of the flag of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/multimedia-player/all-photos/1980/08/03/xaaku015/ |title=Moscow 1980 \u2014 Closing Ceremony \u2014 Los Angeles and Moscow's flags in the stadium. |publisher=Olympic.org |date=August 3, 1980 |accessdate=February 24, 2014 }}</ref> In [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], two Greek flags were raised because [[Greece]] was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games. Then, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremony is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/>\n\nIn what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony (because the tradition began at the Antwerp Games), the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> The receiving mayor then waves the flag eight times. There are four such flags:\n* '''The Antwerp flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1920 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], and was passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Summer Olympics]] through the 1984 Games in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]].\n* '''The Oslo flag''' was presented to the IOC at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] by the city of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], and is passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Winter Olympics]].\n* '''The Seoul flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1988 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME TO USE 'REPUBLIC'--> as a replacement for the Antwerp flag. This flag was used until the 2012 Games in [[London]], [[England]].\n* '''The Rio flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 2016 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]  as a replacement for the Seoul flag. It'll be passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThis tradition was modified slightly at the 2006 Winter Games in [[Turin]], Italy. The flag was passed from [[Sergio Chiamparino]], the mayor of Turin, to [[Sam Sullivan]], the mayor of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.  Mayor Sullivan, who is a [[quadriplegic]], waved the flag by holding it in one hand and swinging his motorized wheelchair back and forth eight times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vancouver Mayor Achieves his Dreams with a Big Heart and Mechanical Help|publisher=Disabled World|last=Thomas|first=Andrew|date=2008-04-18|url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/sam-sullivan.shtml|accessdate=2009-02-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728200033/http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/sam-sullivan.shtml|archivedate=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThis portion of the ceremony actually took place at the opening ceremony until the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] summer games and the [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] winter games.<ref>[[1980 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe next host nation then introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of that country or city. This tradition began with the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Games]].\n\nAfterwards, the [[President of the Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games|President of the Organizing Committee]] makes a speech. The [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC President]] then makes a speech before closing the Olympics by saying:<blockquote>''And now, in accordance with tradition, I declare the Games of the [ordinal number of Summer Olympics] Olympiad/[ordinal number of Winter Olympics] Olympic Winter Games closed; and call upon the youth of the world to assemble four''{{Efn|This part of the declaration may vary if the next Olympic Games is not scheduled for four years hence.
