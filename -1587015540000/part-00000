This method works best for young planets that emit infrared light and are far from the glare of the star.  Currently, this list includes both directly imaged planets and imaged planetary-mass companions (objects that orbit a star but formed through a binary-star-formation process, not a planet-formation process). This list does not include free-floating planetary-mass objects in star-forming regions or young associations, which are also referred to as [[rogue planet]]s.\n\nThe data given for each planet is taken from the latest published paper on the planet to have that data. In many cases it is not possible to have an exact value, and an estimated range is instead provided. The least massive planet is [[Fomalhaut b]], which has a mass of 2 M<sub>J</sub> or less. The coldest and oldest is [[59 Virginis b]] with a mean temperature of 240&nbsp;\u00b0C and age of 100\u2013500 million years.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2886  Direct Imaging of a Cold Jovian Exoplanet in Orbit around the Sun-like Star GJ 504]</ref>\nThis list includes the four members of the multi-planet system that orbit [[HR 8799]].\n\n==Key==\nExoplanets have been discovered using several different methods for collecting or combining direct images to isolate planets from the background light of their star. [[Aperture masking interferometry|Non-Redundant Aperture Masking Interferometry]] is a method of combining the views of multiple telescopes into a single image, while the other methods are algorithms for combining multiple direct images taken from the same telescope.\n\n* '''ADI''' = Angular Differential Imaging\n*'''KLIP''' = Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve Image Processing\n* '''LOCI''' = Locally Optimized Combination of Images\n* '''NRM''' = Non-Redundant Aperture Masking Interferometry\n* '''RSDI''' = Reference Star Differential Imaging\n*'''SDI''' = Spectral Differential Imaging\n* '''TLOCI''' = Template Locally Optimized Combination of Images\n\n==Exoplanets==\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px;>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2020&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;There is no consensus whether these companions of stars should be considered [[sub-brown dwarf]]s or planets</span>\n\nCheck https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/imaging.html to see more directly imaged planets.

This method works best for young planets that emit infrared light and are far from the glare of the star.  Currently, this list includes both directly imaged planets and imaged planetary-mass companions (objects that orbit a star but formed through a binary-star-formation process, not a planet-formation process). This list does not include free-floating planetary-mass objects in star-forming regions or young associations, which are also referred to as [[rogue planet]]s.\n\nThe data given for each planet is taken from the latest published paper on the planet to have that data. In many cases it is not possible to have an exact value, and an estimated range is instead provided. The least massive planet is [[Fomalhaut b]], which has a mass of 2 M<sub>J</sub> or less. The coldest and oldest is [[59 Virginis b]] with a mean temperature of 240&nbsp;\u00b0C and age of 100\u2013500 million years.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2886  Direct Imaging of a Cold Jovian Exoplanet in Orbit around the Sun-like Star GJ 504]</ref>\nThis list includes the four members of the multi-planet system that orbit [[HR 8799]].\n\n==Key==\nExoplanets have been discovered using several different methods for collecting or combining direct images to isolate planets from the background light of their star. [[Aperture masking interferometry|Non-Redundant Aperture Masking Interferometry]] is a method of combining the views of multiple telescopes into a single image, while the other methods are algorithms for combining multiple direct images taken from the same telescope.\n\n* '''ADI''' = Angular Differential Imaging\n*'''KLIP''' = Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve Image Processing\n* '''LOCI''' = Locally Optimized Combination of Images\n* '''NRM''' = Non-Redundant Aperture Masking Interferometry\n* '''RSDI''' = Reference Star Differential Imaging\n*'''SDI''' = Spectral Differential Imaging\n* '''TLOCI''' = Template Locally Optimized Combination of Images\n\n==Exoplanets==\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px;>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2020&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;There is no consensus whether these companions of stars should be considered [[sub-brown dwarf]]s or planets</span>\n\nCheck https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/imaging.html to see more directly imaged planets.

It is located on the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]] of the [[Waitemata Harbour]], four kilometres northwest of the [[Auckland CBD]].\n\nIn November 2010, the suburb was included into the North Shore ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of the newly-formed [[Auckland Council]]. Under the council, Birkenhead is part of the Kaipatiki Local Board Area.\n\nIt is surrounded by the suburbs of [[Northcote, New Zealand|Northcote]] to the east, Glenfield to the north and Birkdale, Chelsea and [[Chatswood, New Zealand|Chatswood]] to the west. The southern part of the suburb is known as Birkenhead Point and lies on a promontory between Chelsea Bay and Little Shoal Bay, one kilometre to the west of the northern approaches to the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]].\n\nThe shopping area is known as the Birkenhead Town Centre with the term Highbury being used for the older shopping centre at the junction of Birkenhead Avenue and Mokoia Road.\n\n==History==\nBirkenhead was described as \"wild and bleak\" by ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' in 1883, as it was isolated from the city of [[Auckland]] by the harbour, and was little occupied. However, in 1882 it was chosen as the site of New Zealand's only sugar refinery, and in 1883 work began on what was later known as the [[Chelsea Sugar Refinery]].  The company built houses for its many new workers and thus the suburb of Birkenhead began. The Refinery was the main source of work for the area for many years, and still operates today.\n\nOnce the site of ancient [[Agathis australis|kauri]] forests, Birkenhead was the site of temporary [[gum-digger]]s' camps: as men and women sought to dig up the lucrative fossilized [[resin]].  Auckland families would cross the [[Waitemata Harbour]] by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.<ref>McClure, p 55-6</ref>\n\nIn 1883 a farm estate called \"Mayfield\" was auctioned and subsequently subdivided for housing sections. Birkenhead was probably named after the town of the same name across the River Mersey from the city of Liverpool, developed during the middle of the 19th century by ship builder \"John Laird\". The English [[Birkenhead]] was noted for its elegant and expensive houses, its sea views and its charmingly laid out picturesque park copied by New York's [[Central Park]].\n\nBirkenhead was one of several areas on the North Shore popular as a location for the homes of successful middle-class people. These men, usually professionals or business owners, would use the Auckland Harbour Ferry Services to commute to Auckland. The wharves at Devonport, Northcote and Birkenhead were very busy until the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959 changed things forever. The ferry to Birkenhead was resumed in the 1980s and since the increase in congestion on the bridge, the usage of the Birkenhead Ferry has grown considerably.\n\nBirkenhead was one of the suburbs that formed the area administered by Birkenhead Borough Council, which started in 1888 and in 1978 merged into Birkenhead City Council and then amalgamated into [[North Shore, New Zealand#Local government|North Shore City Council]].

{"title_page": "Alternative media", "text_new": "{{For|Alternative press disambiguation|Alternative press (disambiguation){{!}}Alternative press}}\n{{Journalism sidebar}}\n'''Alternative media''' are media that differ from established  or dominant types of media in terms of their content, production, or distribution.<ref name=\"Downing, John 2001\">Downing, John. (2001). Radical Media. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.</ref> Alternative media take many forms including print, audio, video, Internet and street art. Some examples include the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] [[zine]]s of the 1960s, ethnic and indigenous media such as the First People's television network in Canada (later rebranded [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]]), and more recently online [[open publishing]] journalism sites such as [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]].\n\nWhile [[Mainstream media|mainstream mass media]], on the whole, \"represent government and corporate interests\",<ref>Herman, E., & Chomsky, N. (1988). [[Manufacturing Consent|Manufacturing consent: The political economy of the mass media]]. New York: Pantheon Books.</ref> alternative media tend to be \"non-commercial projects that advocate the interests of those excluded from the mainstream\", for example, the poor, political and ethnic minorities, labor groups, and LGBT identities.<ref>Atton, Chris. (2002). Alternative Media. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.</ref>  These media disseminate marginalized viewpoints, such as those heard in the progressive news program [[Democracy Now!]], and create communities of identity, as seen for example in the [[It Gets Better Project]] that was created on [[YouTube]] in response to a rise in gay teen suicides at the time it was created.\n\nAlternative media challenge the dominant beliefs and values of a culture and have been described as \"counter-hegemonic\" by adherents of [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s theory of [[cultural hegemony]]. However, since the definition of alternative media as merely counter to the mainstream is limiting, some approaches to the study of alternative media also address the question of how and where these media are created, as well as the dynamic relationship between the media and the participants that create and use them.<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity.</ref><ref name=\":4\">Rodriguez, C. (2001). Fissures in the Mediascape. Cresskill, NJ:Hampton Press.</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nThere are various definitions of \"alternative media.\" [[John D. H. Downing|John Downing]], for example, defines \"radical alternative media\" as media \"that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies, priorities, and perspectives\".<ref>Downing, J. (2001). \"Preface.\" In ''Radical Media''. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.</ref> In his assessment of a variety of definitions for the term, [[Chris Atton]] notes repeatedly the importance of alternative media production originating from small-scale, counter-hegemonic groups and individuals.<ref>Atton, C. (2002). \"Approaching Alternative Media: Theory and Methodology.\" In ''Alternative Media''. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.</ref>\n\nChristian Fuchs also argues that alternative media must have four distinct properties. The first being that the audience of these media must be involved in the creation of what is put out in alternative media.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christian|date=June 3, 2010|title=Alternative Media as Critical Media|journal=European Journal of Social Theory|volume= 13|issue=2|pages=173\u2013192|url=http://fuchs.uti.at/wp-content/uploads/altmedia.pdf|doi=10.1177/1368431010362294}}</ref> The second is that it has to be different from the mainstream.<ref name=\":7\" /> The third is that it should create a perspective different from that of the state and major corporations.<ref name=\":7\" /> The fourth property is that alternative media must \"establish different types of relationships with the market and/or the state.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAs defined by Atton and Hamilton \u201cAlternative journalism proceeds from dissatisfaction not only with the mainstream coverage of certain issues and topics but also with the epistemology of news. Its critique emphasizes alternatives to, inter alia,\u00a0 conventions of news sources and representation; the inverted pyramid of news texts; the hierarchical and capitalized economy of commercial journalism; the professional, elite basis of journalism as a practice; the professional norm of objectivity; and the subordinate role of the audience as a receiver\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atton|first=Chris|date=2003-08|title=What is `Alternative' Journalism?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14648849030043001|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|volume=4|issue=3|pages=267\u2013272|doi=10.1177/14648849030043001|issn=1464-8849}}</ref>\n\nJournalistic Practices says \"Alternative media not only allow but also facilitate the participation (in its more radical meaning) of its members (or the community) in both the produced content and the content-producing organization.\u2019 In this sense, participation in alternative media as described and reflected upon by the participants in this study can best be understood as a form of active citizenship\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harcup|first=Tony|date=2011|title=Alternative journalism as active citizenship|url=|journal=Sage|volume=12(1)|pages=15-31|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Common approaches and practices ===\nApproaches to the academic study of alternative media attempt to understand the ways in which these media are significant, each emphasizing a different aspect of media, including the role of the public sphere, social movements, and the participation by communities that create the media.\n\n===Democratic theory and the public sphere===\n[[File:Lloyds-coffee-house-london-by-william-holland.jpg|thumb|A public sphere described by Habermas - Coffee House in 18C]]\nOne way of understanding alternative media is to consider their role in the process of democratic communication. Philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] proposed that a healthy democratic community requires a space where rational debate can take place between engaged citizens. It is essential that the dialogue in this [[public sphere]] occurs outside the control of any authority so that citizens can exchange ideas as equals.<ref name=\":6\">Habermas, J. (1991). The structural transformation of the public sphere: An inquiry into a category of bourgeois society. MIT press.</ref> This translates to the need for free speech and a free press.\n\nIn Habermas's idea of the public sphere, participation is open to everyone, all participants are considered equal, and any issue can be raised for debate.<ref name=\":6\"/> However, this view fails to note the inherent exclusion of women and minorities (and their interests) from the debate in the public sphere. In light of this social inequality, philosopher [[Nancy Fraser]] argues for the importance of multiple independent public spheres, in which members of subordinated groups can first deliberate their issues and concerns among themselves and later assert those issues into the larger public sphere. The alternative media associated with these counter-public spheres are critical in developing the needs and identity of the group and in challenging the larger dominant public sphere. A feminist counter-public sphere is, for example, responsible for circulating the view that women's issues such as domestic abuse and reproductive rights are deserving of debate in the larger public sphere.<ref>Fraser, N. (1990). [http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/rethinking_the_public_sphere_a_contribution_to_the_critique_of_actually_existing_democracy.pdf Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy]. Social text, 56-80.</ref>\n\n===Social movement media===\n\n[[Social movements]] are a type of collective action. They involve large, sometimes informal, groups or organizations which focus on specific political or social issues and instigate, resist or undo the social change. Social movement media is how social movements use media, and oftentimes, due to the nature of social movements, that media tends to be an alternative.\n\nCommunication is vital to the success of social movements. Research shows that social movements experience significant difficulties communicating through mainstream media because the mainstream media often systematically distort, stigmatize, or ignore social movement viewpoints.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Social movement web use in theory and practice: a content analysis of US movement websites|last = Stein|first = Laura|date = 2009|journal = New Media & Society|volume = 11|issue = 5|pages = 749\u2013771|doi = 10.1177/1461444809105350|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> They may deny social movements' access or\nrepresentation at critical moments in their development, employ message frames that undermine or weaken public perceptions of a movement's legitimacy or implicitly encourage movement actors who seek coverage to cater to the questionable values of mainstream reportage on social activism, including a heightened interest in violence, emotionality, and slogans.<ref name=\":1\" /> This problematic coverage of social movements is often referred to as the protest paradigm: the idea that mass media marginalizes protest groups through their depictions of the protesters, and, by doing so, subsequently support the status quo. As a result, social movements often turn to alternative media forms and practices in\norder to more effectively achieve their goals.\n[[File:Occupy Wall Street 11 11 11 DMGAINES Demonstrator 4899.jpg|thumb|Example of a sign used during the Occupy Wall Street movement.]]\nAn example of how the mainstream media problematically covers social movements is the [[Occupy movement]], which began with [[Occupy Wall Street]] in September 2011. The Occupy movement protests against social and economic inequality around the world, its primary goal being to make the economic and political relations in all societies less vertically hierarchical and more flatly distributed. Local groups often have different focuses, but among the movement's prime concerns deal with how large corporations and the global financial system control the world in a way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy, and is unstable. In comparing the mainstream news coverage of the Occupy movement against coverage from alternative press several trends emerge. First, mainstream media used confusion over the event as the dominant [[Framing (social sciences)|frame]] while alternative media focused on what the demonstrators were actually trying to accomplish. Second, the mainstream media placed the protesters at fault of any violence while the alternative media focused on the brutality of the police and their violent acts on the peaceful protesters.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.elon.edu/e-web/academics/communications/research/spring2012issue.xhtml|title = Media framing: A comparative content analysis on mainstream and alternative news coverage of occupy wall street|last = Cissell|first = M|date = 2012|journal = The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor more information about social movements, and alternative media, see [[Social movement theory]].\n\nAlternative media are activist. Social movements in areas such as [[human rights]], the [[environmental movement]], and [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] produce alternative media to further their goals, spread awareness, and inspire participation and support.\n\n==== Human rights ====\n[[File:Favelas-portoalegre.jpg|thumb|A favela in Brazil.]]\nAn example of a human rights social movement using\nalternative media is the group [[Witness (human rights group)|WITNESS]]. WITNESS is a human rights non-profit\norganization and its mission is to partner with on-the-ground organizations to support the documentation of human rights violations and their consequences, in order to further public engagement, policy change, and justice. They rely on video recordings using technology such as handheld camcorders and smartphones to capture the world's attention and viscerally communicate human rights abuses. They have documented human rights abuses from the police in the ''[[favela]]s'' of Brazil, children soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human trafficking in Brazil and the United States, and many other human rights issues, all through the use of alternative media.\n\n==== Environmental movement ====\n[[File:Greenpeace March 2009.jpg|thumb|Protester at a Greenpeace march in 2009.]]\nAn example of an environment movement using alternative media is the group, [[Greenpeace|Green Peace]]. Greenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization whose goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals, as well as alternative media. They use online tactics such as podcasts and blogs<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Alternative Media Handbook|last = Coyer|first = K|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Dowmunt|first2 = T|last3 = Fountain|first3 = A}}</ref> as well as performance art.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title = Alternative and Activist Media|last = Waltz|first = M|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Edinburgh|pages = }}</ref>\n\n==== Civil rights ====\nAn example of a civil rights group using alternative media was the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). SNCC was one of the most important organizations of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] in\nthe 1960s. SNCC was involved in voter registration rights in the south, established Freedom Schools, organized the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), among many other accomplishments. Alternative media tactics used by SNCC included establishing a dedicated Communication Section which included a  photography arm, its own printing press (which published its newsletter the Student Voice), published publicity materials, and created an alternative wire press.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tell it like it isn't: SNCC and the media, 1960-1965|last = Walmsley|first = M|date = 2014|journal = Journal of American Studies|volume = 48|pages = 291\u2013308|doi = 10.1017/S0021875813002545|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n=== Participatory culture ===\nAlternative media have frequently been studied as a manifestation of [[participatory culture]], in which citizens do not act as consumers only, but as contributors or producers as well. By opening up access to media production, participatory culture is believed to further democracy, civic engagement, and creative expression.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/3894/1/AltMedia_Sandoval_Fuchs_revisedV3.pdf|title = Towards a critical theory of alternative media|last = Sandoval|first = M|date = 2009|journal = Telematics and Informatics|volume = 27|issue = 2|pages = 141\u2013150|doi = 10.1016/j.tele.2009.06.011|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Fuchs|first2 = C}}</ref>\n\nParticipatory culture pre-dates the Internet. [[Amateur press association|Amateur Press Associations]] are a form of participatory culture which emerged late in the 19th century. Members of such associations typeset and print their own publications, which are mailed through a network of subscribers. [[Zine]]s, talk radio shows, and group projects also preceded blogs, podcasts, wikis, and social networks. With web services such as Wikipedia, [[Tumblr]], [[Imgur]], [[Reddit]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and [[YouTube]], all of which allow users to distribute original content, making media production more participatory.\n\nAlternative media are also created by [[Citizen journalism|participatory journalism]] as citizens play an active role in collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. This form of alternative and activist news-gathering and reporting functions outside of mainstream media institutions, often as a response to the shortcomings of professional journalism. It engages in journalistic practices but is driven by goals other than profit making, has different ideals, and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy.\n\nParticipatory media approaches consider participation in producing media content as well as in making decisions about media production processes as a defining feature of alternative media.<ref name=\":2\" /> Participatory culture can be realized in a number of ways. [[Media literacy]] is a way to begin participating by understanding media systems' conventions and means of production. Individuals learning to produce media themselves is the step that moves citizens from literacy to participation. [[Fan fiction]], [[community radio]] or [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power FM]], home videos, are but just a few ways that citizens can produce [[citizen media|media]] content to participate in culture and to produce alternative media.\n\nBy fostering participation, alternative media contribute to the strengthening of a civic attitude and allow citizens to be active in one of the main spheres relevant to daily life and to put their right to communication into practice. To demonstrate the relationship between democracy and participation in media production, the term citizen's media illustrates that alternative media can help those who are producing media also become active citizens \u2013 particularly in a democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> This idea is tied very closely to community media (see next section).\n\n=== Community media ===\n[[Community media]] includes citizens\u2032 media, participatory media, activist and [[radical media]] and the broader forms of communication that local or regional specific platforms engage in. Like other forms of alternative media, community media seeks to bypass the commercialization of media. The elimination or avoidance of sole ownership or sponsorship is motivated by a desire to be free of oversight or obligation to cater to a specific agenda. Community media is often categorized as grassroots, a description that applies to both the financial structure and the process of content creation. While there is diversity in community media, which varies by media platform (radio, TV, web or print), it is typical that the media source is open to the public/community to submit material and content. This open policy aligns with the values of community media to maintain a democratic approach and ethos. Historically community media has served to provide an alternative political voice. Across the world forms of community, media are used to elevate the needs and discourse of a specific space, typically connected by geographical, cultural, social, or economic similarities.\n\n=== Race and indigenous media ===\n\nMinority community media can be both localized and national, serving to disseminate information to a targeted demographic. They provide a platform for discussion and exchange within the minority communities as well as between the minority and the majority communities. Oftentimes minority-focused media serves an essential resource, providing their audiences with essential information, in their own language of origin, helping the specified group to participate as equal citizens of their country of residence.  These media platforms and outlets create an opportunity for cultural exchange and the elevation or empowerment of a disenfranchised or marginalized group, based on racial, ethnic or cultural identity. Historically, these forms of media have served a dual purpose, to disseminate information to a community that is traditionally ignored or overlooked by major media outlets and as a vehicle for political protest or social reform.\n\nSpaces created to address minority discourse typically straddle the line of both alternative and activist media, working to provide a resource unavailable through mainstream measures and to shift the universally accepted perspective or understanding of a specific group of people. Sociologist Yu Shi's exploration of alternative media provides opposing arguments about the role of minority media to both facilitate cultural place-making and hinder community assimilation and acculturation. Shi expounds a widely shared understanding that racially informed media provide a place, power, and political agency.\n\nThroughout the 20th-century, media spaces were developed to accommodate the growing multi-cultural state of the United States. African-Americans created local publications like the Chicago Defender to share critical information to protect citizens from discriminatory practices by police and policy-makers, while Jet and Ebony's magazine served to empower the national black identity, lauding the achievements and thought leadership of black Americans. Similar practices became increasingly common for Latino/Latina and Asian groups. As immigration increased post-1965, Spanish-language newspapers and television stations, along with the creation of television networks like ICN-TV specifically for Chinese immigrants. A critical awareness of an increasingly participatory global media culture in multicultural societies is becoming widespread and a necessary approach to explaining the success and impact of ethnic or minority media, as well as to embrace the changing ways in which people 'use' their media.\n\n=== Connections to subaltern studies ===\nThere are related aims found in alternative media studies and [[subaltern studies]], as a concern for disenfranchised and oppressed voices pervades both fields. Subaltern studies draw on [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s discussion of \"subaltern\" groups, that is, groups of people considered to be of inferior rank socially, economically, and politically.<ref>Pandey G. (2000). \"[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141844.1995.9981519 Voices from the Edge: The Struggle to Write Subaltern Histories].\" In ''Mapping Subaltern Studies and the Postcolonial.'' Ed. by Vinayak Chaturvedi.</ref> One of the most significant questions in subaltern studies is posed by [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], \"Can the subaltern speak?\" which she asks in her seminal essay of the same name. Spivak investigates whether the subaltern has a voice within hegemonic political discourses, and if so if their voices are being heard, allowing them to participate. This is important, as the subaltern's ability to participate in politics and other social and cultural practices is key in establishing\u2014as well as challenging\u2014their subaltern status.<ref name=\"Spivak, G. 2010\">Spivak, G. (2010). \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" In ''Can the Subaltern Speak? Reflections on the History of an Idea.'' Ed. by Rosalind Russel.</ref> This particular body of scholarship is useful to the study and discussion of alternative media due to their shared preoccupation with the ability of disenfranchised peoples to participate and contribute to mainstream hegemonic discourses, especially in regards to ethnic and racial media in which these groups speak from a subaltern position.\n\nThis connection is strengthened in the work of alternative media scholar [[Clemencia Rodriguez]]. In her discussion of citizenship, Rodriguez comments that \"Citizens have to enact their citizenship on a day-to-day basis, through their participation in everyday political practices...As citizens actively participate in actions that reshape their own identities, the identities of others, and their social environments, they produce power.\"<ref>Rodriguez, C. (2001). \"From Alternative Media to 'Citizens' Media.\" In ''Fissures in the Mediascape.'' Creskill, NJ: Hampton Press.</ref> So it could be said that by subaltern groups creating alternative media, they are indeed expressing their citizenship, producing their power, and letting their voice be heard.\n\n==Forms of media==\n\n===Press \u2013 print===\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Underground_Press_map_(1965-1975).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A map showing underground newspapers published from 1965 to 1975.|A map showing alternative newspapers published from 1965 to 1975 from the [http://depts.washington.edu/moves/altnews_map.shtml Mapping American Social Movements] project.]] -->\n\nThe alternative press consists of printed [[publications]] that provide a different or dissident viewpoint than that provided by major mainstream and corporate [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], and other print media.\n\n''[[Factsheet Five]]'' publisher Mike Gunderloy described the alternative press as \"sort of the 'grown-up' [[underground press]]. ''[[Whole Earth Catalog|Whole Earth]]'', the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'', and ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' are the sorts of things that fall in this classification.\"<ref name=\"f5\">{{Citation|last=Gunderloy|first=Mike|date=August 1991|title=Glossary|periodical=Factsheet Five|location=[[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer, NY]]|publisher=Pretzel Press|issue=44|pages=86|url=http://www.gyrofrog.com/glossary-ff44.php|issn=0890-6823|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> In contrast, Gunderloy described the underground press as \"the real thing, before it gets slick, co-opted, and profitable. The underground press comes out in small quantities, is often illegible, treads on the thin ice of unmentionable subjects, and never carries ads for designer jeans.\"<ref name=\"f5\" />\n\nAn example of alternative media is [[tactical media]], which uses 'hit-and-run' tactics to bring attention to an emerging problem. Often tactical media attempts to expose large corporations that control sources of mainstream media.\n\nOne prominent NGO dedicated to tactical media practices and info-activism is the [[Tactical Technology Collective]] which assists human rights advocates in using technology.  They have released several toolkits freely to the global community, including [[NGO In A Box South Asia]], which assists in the setting up the framework of a self-sustaining NGO, Security-In-A-Box,<ref>[http://security.ngoinabox.org Security-In-A-Box]</ref> a collection of software to keep data secure and safe for NGOs operating in potentially hostile political climates, and their new short form toolkit 10 Tactics,<ref>[http://www.informationactivism.org 10 Tactics]</ref> which \"... provides original and artful ways for rights advocates to capture attention and communicate a cause\".<ref>{{cite web|title=10 tactics for turning information into action|url=http://www.tacticaltech.org/10tactics|work=Tactical Technology Collective|publisher=Tactical Technology Collectiv|accessdate=20 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615011610/http://www.tacticaltech.org/10tactics|archivedate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\nRadio has been a significant form of alternative media due to its low cost, ease of use, and near ubiquity.<ref name=\":5\" /> Alternative radio has arisen in response to capitalist and/or state-sponsored mainstream radio broadcasts. For example, in early 1970s Australia, a new alternative radio sector was created by those who felt excluded from the two-sector national broadcasting system, consisting of a national public service broadcaster and commercial services.<ref>Barlow, D.

(2011). Breaking through the blockade. In ''Alternative and activist new media.'' (119-148) Cambridge: Polity Press.</ref>\n\n=== Internet ===\nWith the increasing importance attributed to digital technologies, questions have arisen about where digital media fit in the dichotomy between alternative and mainstream media. First, blogs, [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and other similar sites, while not necessarily created to be information media, increasingly are being used to spread news and information, potentially acting as alternative media as they allow ordinary citizens to bypass the gatekeepers of traditional, mainstream media and share the information and perspectives these citizens deem important.\n\nSecond, the Internet provides an alternative space for mobilization through the cultivation of interpersonal networks, collective action towards social change, and making information much readily accessible. Typically, among those with deviant, dissident or non-traditional views, Internet platforms allow for the creation of new, alternative communities that can provide a voice for those normally marginalized by the mainstream media.\n\nIn addition, the Internet has also led to an alternative form of programming, which allows both professionals and amateurs to subvert or evade commercial and political restraints on open [[access to information]] and information technologies.<ref name=\":8\" /> Some examples of alternative computing are hacking, open source software or systems, and file sharing.\n\nLastly, the Internet also breeds a new way of creation and dissemination of knowledge \u2014commons knowledge\u2014 that is different from the top-down manner. It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users, fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and folksonomies. Wikipedia is an excellent example of this genre.\n\n=== Street art ===\nOften considered [[Guerilla art|guerilla-art]], [[street art]] operates free from the confines of the formal art world.<ref name=\":8\">Schwartzman, Allan, ''Street Art'', The Dial Press, Doubleday & Co., New York, NY 1985 {{ISBN|0-385-19950-3}}</ref> In the form of [[graffiti]], stencil, mural, and print, street art appropriates or alters public spaces as a means of protest and social commentary. Important aspects of street art as an alternative form are its blend of aesthetics and social engagement, use of urban spaces, and interaction with the social landscape of the area in which the art is made.<ref>{{cite book|first=Martin|last= Irvine|title=The Work on the Street: Street Art and Visual Culture|work='The Handbook of Visual Culture|location=London|publisher= Berg| date= 2012|pages=235\u2013278}}</ref>\n\nThe street art movement gained popularity in the 1980s as a form of art distinct from high art and commercial venues, but as popularity grew, some street artists moved from the alternative venues of the streets to gallery and museum showings.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The History of Street Art|url = http://www.widewalls.ch/the-history-of-street-art|website = WideWalls|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}</ref>  Cities such as Paris, Buenos Aires, and S\u00e3o Paulo rose to prominence in using street art as legitimate alternative media through artist collectives and competitions, bringing attention to alternative voices. The internet has also influenced street art greatly by functioning as a platform for artists and fans to share pictures of street art from around the world. Websites like Streetsy.com and WoosterCollective.com are among the most popular of street art sharing sites.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wooster Collective|url = http://www.woostercollective.com|website = Wooster Collective|accessdate = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027052728/http://woostercollective.com/|archivedate = 2015-10-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Performance ===\nPerformance as an alternative medium uses theater, song, and [[performance art]] as a means of engaging audiences and furthering social agendas. Performance art is an [[Avant-garde|avant garde]] art form that typically uses live performances to challenge traditional forms of visual art.  It operates as \"the antithesis of theatre, challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms.\"<ref>Hellerman and Goddard 1983</ref> Playing an important role in social and cultural movements from [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] to [[Postminimalism|Post-Minimalism]], performance art reflects the political environment of the time.<ref>'''Performance Art Movement,\nArtists and Major Works.\" ''The Art Story''.'''</ref> While performance art is often relegated to high art, street theater is typically used in a [[grassroots]] fashion, utilizing local communities for performance or conversation.  It can be used as a form of [[Guerrilla theatre|guerilla theater]] to protest, like in the case of [[The Living Theatre]] which is dedicated to transforming the hierarchy of power in society through experimental theater.\n\n=== Music ===\nCertain genres of music and musical performance can be categorized as alternative media. Independent music, or [[Indie Music|indie music]], is music that is produced separate from commercial record labels. Professor David Hesmondhalgh describes indie music's alternative nature as a \"hard-headed network of post-punk companies which made significant challenges to the commercial organization of cultural production favoured by the major record companies.\"<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David. \"Indie: The Aesthetics and Institutional Politics of Popular Music Genre.\"</ref> Its subversive roots of sound or lyrics and alternative models of distribution distinguish it from the commercial record companies.\n\n==Genres==\nPrimarily concerned with the growing role of new media in alternative media projects, communication scholar Leah Lievrouw identifies five genres of contemporary new media based alternative and activist media: culture jamming, alternative computing, participatory journalism, mediated mobilization, and commons knowledge.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011\">Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.19)</ref>\n\n*[[Culture jamming]] generally attempts to critique popular cultures such as entertainment, advertising, and art.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011\"/> It tends to comment on issues of [[corporate capitalism]] and consumerism and seeks to provide political commentary. Characteristics of culture jamming texts include the appropriation or repurposing of images, video, sound, or text and that they are ironic or satirical in some sense.<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.22-23)</ref> Today, culture jamming can come in the form of internet memes and [[guerrilla marketing]].\n*Alternative computing deals with the material infrastructure of informational and communications technologies. It seeks to critique and reconfigure systems with the intention of subverting or evading commercial and political restraints on open access to information and information technologies.<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Chapter 4. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 98-108). Polity. (98)</ref> Some examples of alternative computing are [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]], [[open source software]] or systems, and [[file sharing]].\n*Participatory journalism refers to web-based sources of critical or radical news either in the form of online news services or blogs. These alternative outlets of news often adopt the philosophies of [[citizen journalism]] and view themselves as providing an alternative to mainstream news and opinion.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011 pp. 1\">Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.25)</ref> Participatory journalism projects may cover underreported groups and issues. Within this genre authors and readers of some of these alternative media projects have the ability contribute alike and therefore has the characteristic of being participatory or interactive. An example of participatory journalism is [[Indymedia]]\n*Mobilization media relate to communication practices that mobilization or organization social movements, identity, or cultural projects through the use of new media tools and platforms such as [[Facebook]] or [[YouTube]]. Characteristics of this genre include the cultivation of interpersonal networks, collective action towards social change, and making information much readily accessible.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011 pp. 1\"/>\n*Commons knowledge as a genre refers to projects that provide alternatives to the traditional top-down creation and dissemination of knowledge. It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users, fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and [[Folksonomy|folksonomies]].<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Chapter 7. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 178). Polity. (p.178)</ref> [[Wikipedia]] is an excellent example of this genre.\n\nThinking of current forms of alternative media in terms of the genre not only allow us to identify the features and conventions of certain modes of communication, but also how \"they allow people to express themselves appropriately, and to achieve their various purposes or intentions.\"<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.20)</ref> In other words, we can begin to understand how the creators and participants of alternative new media projects actively shape their communication practices.\n\nYouTube is considered to be not only a commercial enterprise but also a platform designed to encourage cultural participation by ordinary citizens. Although YouTube aimed to be foremost a commercial enterprise, nevertheless, it has become a community media as one of the forms of alternative media. Scholars assume that YouTube's commercial drive may have increased the probability of participation in online video culture for a broader spectrum of participants than before. This idea allows us to shift our concern away from the false contradiction between market-driven and non-market-driven culture towards the tensions between corporate logics and unruly and emergent traits of participatory culture, and the limits of YouTube model for cross-cultural diversity and global communication. In theory, YouTube stands as a site of cosmopolitan cultural citizenship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Jean|last2=Green|first2=Joshua|title=YouTube: Online video and participatory culture|date=2009|publisher=Polity|location=Boston, MA}}</ref> Uploading foreign soap opera episodes and dividing into several pieces to pass YouTube's content limits, can be seen as acts of cultural citizenship similar to the media sharing practices of diverse communities identified by Cunningham and Nguyen (2000).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=Stuart|last2=Nguyen|first2=T|title=Popular media of the Vietnamese Diaspora|date=2000|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Saint Lucia|pages=91\u2013135|edition=Floating lives: The media and Asian diasporas}}</ref> However, people who have the highest chance of encountering other cultural citizens are those who have the access to various contents, information and platforms; this is commonly referred to as the 'participation gap.' The notion of participation gap makes both digital literacy and digital divide such important issues for cultural politics. Therefore, it is still controversial whether YouTube is just another conduit for strengthening [[cultural imperialism]] or one of the alternative media.\n\n==Aesthetics==\nIn association with  experimental and innovative modes of production and collaboration, [[aesthetics]] in alternative media can be a political tool used to subvert dominant power. Like many makers of alternative media, scholar [[Crispin Sartwell]] identifies politics as an aesthetic environment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sartwell|first1=Crispin|title=Political Aesthetics|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalaesthet00sart|url-access=registration|date=2010|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=London}}</ref> As such, these art political systems not only use aesthetics as a tool to gain power but are also produced via aesthetic forms within all media. Thus, it is not uncommon for alternative media to seek new artistic, non-traditional, or avant-garde means to represent its content. In this case, the use of aesthetics allows alternative media to address otherwise banal content in a manner which re-aligns, re-negotiates, or exposes the politics at work within it.\n\n=== Form ===\nScholars have linked the [[Avant-Garde|Avante-garde]] art movements as one arena where alternative aesthetics are used as a political tool. Movements such as [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], and [[Situationism]] looked to challenge the formal rules regarding what art was, how it looked or sounded like, or where it could be in order to radically alter public and political ideology. The logic, reason, and rules of style and beauty, mandated by the dominant class, was rejected as an affirmation of subjugation.\n\n=== Appropriation  ===\nWhile some alternative makers look to radically break away from the suffocating restraints of the dominant class by rejecting their dominant visual dogma, others appropriate, twist, and remix in order to subvert dominant language and messaging through mimicry, mockery, and satire. The [[d\u00e9tournement]] (and its successor [[Culture jamming|culture-jamming]]) of the Situationists, the mimicry of [[Pop art|Pop Art]], and the reworking of normative narratives in [[slash fiction]] are examples of appropriation of mainstream media texts.\n\n===Participation ===\nAvant-garde movements that have emphasized audience participation include [[Futurism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]], [[Pop art]], [[Neo-concretism]], and the [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].<ref name=\"Intellect\">{{cite book|last1=Carpentiere|first1=Nico|title=Media and Participation: A Site of Ideological Democratic Struggle|date=2011|publisher=Intellect|location=Chicago|pages=55\u201364}}</ref> By inviting the audience to participate in the creation of media, collaborators look to subvert or critique hierarchical structures ([[capitalism]], the [[ivory tower]]) within society by embracing democratic modes of production.

However, since the definition of alternative media as merely counter to the mainstream is limiting, some approaches to the study of alternative media also address the question of how and where these media are created, as well as the dynamic relationship between the media and the participants that create and use them.<ref>Lievrouw, L.

The first being that the audience of these media must be involved in the creation of what is put out in alternative media.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christian|date=June 3, 2010|title=Alternative Media as Critical Media|journal=European Journal of Social Theory|volume= 13|issue=2|pages=173\u2013192|url=http://fuchs.uti.at/wp-content/uploads/altmedia.pdf|doi=10.1177/1368431010362294}}</ref> The second is that it has to be different from the mainstream.<ref name=\":7\" /> The third is that it should create a perspective different from that of the state and major corporations.<ref name=\":7\" /> The fourth property is that alternative media must \"establish different types of relationships with the market and/or the state.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAs defined by Atton and Hamilton \u201cAlternative journalism proceeds from dissatisfaction not only with the mainstream coverage of certain issues and topics but also with the epistemology of news. Its critique emphasizes alternatives to, inter alia,\u00a0 conventions of news sources and representation; the inverted pyramid of news texts; the hierarchical and capitalized economy of commercial journalism; the professional, elite basis of journalism as a practice; the professional norm of objectivity; and the subordinate role of the audience as a receiver\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atton|first=Chris|date=2003-08|title=What is `Alternative' Journalism?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14648849030043001|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|volume=4|issue=3|pages=267\u2013272|doi=10.1177/14648849030043001|issn=1464-8849}}</ref>\n\nJournalistic Practices says \"Alternative media not only allow but also facilitate the participation (in its more radical meaning) of its members (or the community) in both the produced content and the content-producing organization.\u2019 In this sense, participation in alternative media as described and reflected upon by the participants in this study can best be understood as a form of active citizenship\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harcup|first=Tony|date=2011|title=Alternative journalism as active citizenship|url=|journal=Sage|volume=12(1)|pages=15-31|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Common approaches and practices==\nApproaches to the academic study of alternative media attempt to understand the ways in which these media are significant, each emphasizing a different aspect of media, including the role of the public sphere, social movements, and the participation by communities that create the media.\n\n===Democratic theory and the public sphere===\n[[File:Lloyds-coffee-house-london-by-william-holland.jpg|thumb|A public sphere described by Habermas - Coffee House in 18C]]\nOne way of understanding alternative media is to consider their role in the process of democratic communication. Philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] proposed that a healthy democratic community requires a space where rational debate can take place between engaged citizens. It is essential that the dialogue in this [[public sphere]] occurs outside the control of any authority so that citizens can exchange ideas as equals.<ref name=\":6\">Habermas, J. (1991). The structural transformation of the public sphere: An inquiry into a category of bourgeois society. MIT press.</ref> This translates to the need for free speech and a free press.\n\nIn Habermas's idea of the public sphere, participation is open to everyone, all participants are considered equal, and any issue can be raised for debate.<ref name=\":6\"/> However, this view fails to note the inherent exclusion of women and minorities (and their interests) from the debate in the public sphere. In light of this social inequality, philosopher [[Nancy Fraser]] argues for the importance of multiple independent public spheres, in which members of subordinated groups can first deliberate their issues and concerns among themselves and later assert those issues into the larger public sphere. The alternative media associated with these counter-public spheres are critical in developing the needs and identity of the group and in challenging the larger dominant public sphere. A feminist counter-public sphere is, for example, responsible for circulating the view that women's issues such as domestic abuse and reproductive rights are deserving of debate in the larger public sphere.<ref>Fraser, N. (1990).

Social text, 56-80.</ref>\n\n===Social movement media===\n\n[[Social movements]] are a type of collective action. They involve large, sometimes informal, groups or organizations which focus on specific political or social issues and instigate, resist or undo the social change. Social movement media is how social movements use media, and oftentimes, due to the nature of social movements, that media tends to be an alternative.\n\nCommunication is vital to the success of social movements. Research shows that social movements experience significant difficulties communicating through mainstream media because the mainstream media often systematically distort, stigmatize, or ignore social movement viewpoints.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Social movement web use in theory and practice: a content analysis of US movement websites|last = Stein|first = Laura|date = 2009|journal = New Media & Society|volume = 11|issue = 5|pages = 749\u2013771|doi = 10.1177/1461444809105350|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> They may deny social movements' access or\nrepresentation at critical moments in their development, employ message frames that undermine or weaken public perceptions of a movement's legitimacy or implicitly encourage movement actors who seek coverage to cater to the questionable values of mainstream reportage on social activism, including a heightened interest in violence, emotionality, and slogans.<ref name=\":1\" /> This problematic coverage of social movements is often referred to as the protest paradigm: the idea that mass media marginalizes protest groups through their depictions of the protesters, and, by doing so, subsequently support the status quo. As a result, social movements often turn to alternative media forms and practices in\norder to more effectively achieve their goals.\n[[File:Occupy Wall Street 11 11 11 DMGAINES Demonstrator 4899.jpg|thumb|Example of a sign used during the Occupy Wall Street movement.]]\nAn example of how the mainstream media problematically covers social movements is the [[Occupy movement]], which began with [[Occupy Wall Street]] in September 2011. The Occupy movement protests against social and economic inequality around the world, its primary goal being to make the economic and political relations in all societies less vertically hierarchical and more flatly distributed. Local groups often have different focuses, but among the movement's prime concerns deal with how large corporations and the global financial system control the world in a way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy, and is unstable. In comparing the mainstream news coverage of the Occupy movement against coverage from alternative press several trends emerge. First, mainstream media used confusion over the event as the dominant [[Framing (social sciences)|frame]] while alternative media focused on what the demonstrators were actually trying to accomplish. Second, the mainstream media placed the protesters at fault of any violence while the alternative media focused on the brutality of the police and their violent acts on the peaceful protesters.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.elon.edu/e-web/academics/communications/research/spring2012issue.xhtml|title = Media framing: A comparative content analysis on mainstream and alternative news coverage of occupy wall street|last = Cissell|first = M|date = 2012|journal = The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor more information about social movements, and alternative media, see [[Social movement theory]].\n\nAlternative media are activist. Social movements in areas such as [[human rights]], the [[environmental movement]], and [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] produce alternative media to further their goals, spread awareness, and inspire participation and support.\n\n==== Human rights ====\n[[File:Favelas-portoalegre.jpg|thumb|A favela in Brazil.]]\nAn example of a human rights social movement using\nalternative media is the group [[Witness (human rights group)|WITNESS]]. WITNESS is a human rights non-profit\norganization and its mission is to partner with on-the-ground organizations to support the documentation of human rights violations and their consequences, in order to further public engagement, policy change, and justice. They rely on video recordings using technology such as handheld camcorders and smartphones to capture the world's attention and viscerally communicate human rights abuses. They have documented human rights abuses from the police in the ''[[favela]]s'' of Brazil, children soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human trafficking in Brazil and the United States, and many other human rights issues, all through the use of alternative media.\n\n==== Environmental movement ====\n[[File:Greenpeace March 2009.jpg|thumb|Protester at a Greenpeace march in 2009.]]\nAn example of an environment movement using alternative media is the group, [[Greenpeace|Green Peace]]. Greenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization whose goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals, as well as alternative media. They use online tactics such as podcasts and blogs<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Alternative Media Handbook|last = Coyer|first = K|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Dowmunt|first2 = T|last3 = Fountain|first3 = A}}</ref> as well as performance art.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title = Alternative and Activist Media|last = Waltz|first = M|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Edinburgh|pages = }}</ref>\n\n==== Civil rights ====\nAn example of a civil rights group using alternative media was the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). SNCC was one of the most important organizations of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] in\nthe 1960s. SNCC was involved in voter registration rights in the south, established Freedom Schools, organized the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), among many other accomplishments. Alternative media tactics used by SNCC included establishing a dedicated Communication Section which included a  photography arm, its own printing press (which published its newsletter the Student Voice), published publicity materials, and created an alternative wire press.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tell it like it isn't: SNCC and the media, 1960-1965|last = Walmsley|first = M|date = 2014|journal = Journal of American Studies|volume = 48|pages = 291\u2013308|doi = 10.1017/S0021875813002545|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n=== Participatory culture ===\nAlternative media have frequently been studied as a manifestation of [[participatory culture]], in which citizens do not act as consumers only, but as contributors or producers as well. By opening up access to media production, participatory culture is believed to further democracy, civic engagement, and creative expression.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/3894/1/AltMedia_Sandoval_Fuchs_revisedV3.pdf|title = Towards a critical theory of alternative media|last = Sandoval|first = M|date = 2009|journal = Telematics and Informatics|volume = 27|issue = 2|pages = 141\u2013150|doi = 10.1016/j.tele.2009.06.011|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Fuchs|first2 = C}}</ref>\n\nParticipatory culture pre-dates the Internet. [[Amateur press association|Amateur Press Associations]] are a form of participatory culture which emerged late in the 19th century. Members of such associations typeset and print their own publications, which are mailed through a network of subscribers. [[Zine]]s, talk radio shows, and group projects also preceded blogs, podcasts, wikis, and social networks. With web services such as Wikipedia, [[Tumblr]], [[Imgur]], [[Reddit]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and [[YouTube]], all of which allow users to distribute original content, making media production more participatory.\n\nAlternative media are also created by [[Citizen journalism|participatory journalism]] as citizens play an active role in collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. This form of alternative and activist news-gathering and reporting functions outside of mainstream media institutions, often as a response to the shortcomings of professional journalism. It engages in journalistic practices but is driven by goals other than profit making, has different ideals, and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy.\n\nParticipatory media approaches consider participation in producing media content as well as in making decisions about media production processes as a defining feature of alternative media.<ref name=\":2\" /> Participatory culture can be realized in a number of ways. [[Media literacy]] is a way to begin participating by understanding media systems' conventions and means of production. Individuals learning to produce media themselves is the step that moves citizens from literacy to participation. [[Fan fiction]], [[community radio]] or [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power FM]], home videos, are but just a few ways that citizens can produce [[citizen media|media]] content to participate in culture and to produce alternative media.\n\nBy fostering participation, alternative media contribute to the strengthening of a civic attitude and allow citizens to be active in one of the main spheres relevant to daily life and to put their right to communication into practice. To demonstrate the relationship between democracy and participation in media production, the term citizen's media illustrates that alternative media can help those who are producing media also become active citizens \u2013 particularly in a democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> This idea is tied very closely to community media (see next section).\n\n=== Community media ===\n[[Community media]] includes citizens\u2032 media, participatory media, activist and [[radical media]] and the broader forms of communication that local or regional specific platforms engage in. Like other forms of alternative media, community media seeks to bypass the commercialization of media. The elimination or avoidance of sole ownership or sponsorship is motivated by a desire to be free of oversight or obligation to cater to a specific agenda. Community media is often categorized as grassroots, a description that applies to both the financial structure and the process of content creation. While there is diversity in community media, which varies by media platform (radio, TV, web or print), it is typical that the media source is open to the public/community to submit material and content. This open policy aligns with the values of community media to maintain a democratic approach and ethos. Historically community media has served to provide an alternative political voice. Across the world forms of community, media are used to elevate the needs and discourse of a specific space, typically connected by geographical, cultural, social, or economic similarities.\n\n=== Race and indigenous media ===\n\nMinority community media can be both localized and national, serving to disseminate information to a targeted demographic. They provide a platform for discussion and exchange within the minority communities as well as between the minority and the majority communities. Oftentimes minority-focused media serves an essential resource, providing their audiences with essential information, in their own language of origin, helping the specified group to participate as equal citizens of their country of residence.  These media platforms and outlets create an opportunity for cultural exchange and the elevation or empowerment of a disenfranchised or marginalized group, based on racial, ethnic or cultural identity. Historically, these forms of media have served a dual purpose, to disseminate information to a community that is traditionally ignored or overlooked by major media outlets and as a vehicle for political protest or social reform.\n\nSpaces created to address minority discourse typically straddle the line of both alternative and activist media, working to provide a resource unavailable through mainstream measures and to shift the universally accepted perspective or understanding of a specific group of people. Sociologist Yu Shi's exploration of alternative media provides opposing arguments about the role of minority media to both facilitate cultural place-making and hinder community assimilation and acculturation. Shi expounds a widely shared understanding that racially informed media provide a place, power, and political agency.\n\nThroughout the 20th-century, media spaces were developed to accommodate the growing multi-cultural state of the United States. African-Americans created local publications like the Chicago Defender to share critical information to protect citizens from discriminatory practices by police and policy-makers, while Jet and Ebony's magazine served to empower the national black identity, lauding the achievements and thought leadership of black Americans. Similar practices became increasingly common for Latino/Latina and Asian groups. As immigration increased post-1965, Spanish-language newspapers and television stations, along with the creation of television networks like ICN-TV specifically for Chinese immigrants. A critical awareness of an increasingly participatory global media culture in multicultural societies is becoming widespread and a necessary approach to explaining the success and impact of ethnic or minority media, as well as to embrace the changing ways in which people 'use' their media.\n\n=== Connections to subaltern studies ===\nThere are related aims found in alternative media studies and [[subaltern studies]], as a concern for disenfranchised and oppressed voices pervades both fields. Subaltern studies draw on [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s discussion of \"subaltern\" groups, that is, groups of people considered to be of inferior rank socially, economically, and politically.<ref>Pandey G. (2000). \"[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141844.1995.9981519 Voices from the Edge: The Struggle to Write Subaltern Histories].\" In ''Mapping Subaltern Studies and the Postcolonial.'' Ed. by Vinayak Chaturvedi.</ref> One of the most significant questions in subaltern studies is posed by [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], \"Can the subaltern speak?\" which she asks in her seminal essay of the same name. Spivak investigates whether the subaltern has a voice within hegemonic political discourses, and if so if their voices are being heard, allowing them to participate. This is important, as the subaltern's ability to participate in politics and other social and cultural practices is key in establishing\u2014as well as challenging\u2014their subaltern status.<ref name=\"Spivak, G. 2010\">Spivak, G. (2010). \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" In ''Can the Subaltern Speak? Reflections on the History of an Idea.'' Ed. by Rosalind Russel.</ref> This particular body of scholarship is useful to the study and discussion of alternative media due to their shared preoccupation with the ability of disenfranchised peoples to participate and contribute to mainstream hegemonic discourses, especially in regards to ethnic and racial media in which these groups speak from a subaltern position.\n\nThis connection is strengthened in the work of alternative media scholar [[Clemencia Rodriguez]]. In her discussion of citizenship, Rodriguez comments that \"Citizens have to enact their citizenship on a day-to-day basis, through their participation in everyday political practices...As citizens actively participate in actions that reshape their own identities, the identities of others, and their social environments, they produce power.\"<ref>Rodriguez, C. (2001). \"From Alternative Media to 'Citizens' Media.\" In ''Fissures in the Mediascape.'' Creskill, NJ: Hampton Press.</ref> So it could be said that by subaltern groups creating alternative media, they are indeed expressing their citizenship, producing their power, and letting their voice be heard.\n\n==Forms of media==\n\n===Press \u2013 print===\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Underground_Press_map_(1965-1975).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A map showing underground newspapers published from 1965 to 1975.|A map showing alternative newspapers published from 1965 to 1975 from the [http://depts.washington.edu/moves/altnews_map.shtml Mapping American Social Movements] project.]] -->\n\nThe alternative press consists of printed [[publications]] that provide a different or dissident viewpoint than that provided by major mainstream and corporate [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], and other print media.\n\n''[[Factsheet Five]]'' publisher Mike Gunderloy described the alternative press as \"sort of the 'grown-up' [[underground press]]. ''[[Whole Earth Catalog|Whole Earth]]'', the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'', and ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' are the sorts of things that fall in this classification.\"<ref name=\"f5\">{{Citation|last=Gunderloy|first=Mike|date=August 1991|title=Glossary|periodical=Factsheet Five|location=[[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer, NY]]|publisher=Pretzel Press|issue=44|pages=86|url=http://www.gyrofrog.com/glossary-ff44.php|issn=0890-6823|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> In contrast, Gunderloy described the underground press as \"the real thing, before it gets slick, co-opted, and profitable. The underground press comes out in small quantities, is often illegible, treads on the thin ice of unmentionable subjects, and never carries ads for designer jeans.\"<ref name=\"f5\" />\n\nAn example of alternative media is [[tactical media]], which uses 'hit-and-run' tactics to bring attention to an emerging problem. Often tactical media attempts to expose large corporations that control sources of mainstream media.\n\nOne prominent NGO dedicated to tactical media practices and info-activism is the [[Tactical Technology Collective]] which assists human rights advocates in using technology.  They have released several toolkits freely to the global community, including [[NGO In A Box South Asia]], which assists in the setting up the framework of a self-sustaining NGO, Security-In-A-Box,<ref>[http://security.ngoinabox.org Security-In-A-Box]</ref> a collection of software to keep data secure and safe for NGOs operating in potentially hostile political climates, and their new short form toolkit 10 Tactics,<ref>[http://www.informationactivism.org 10 Tactics]</ref> which \"... provides original and artful ways for rights advocates to capture attention and communicate a cause\".<ref>{{cite web|title=10 tactics for turning information into action|url=http://www.tacticaltech.org/10tactics|work=Tactical Technology Collective|publisher=Tactical Technology Collectiv|accessdate=20 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615011610/http://www.tacticaltech.org/10tactics|archivedate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\nRadio has been a significant form of alternative media due to its low cost, ease of use, and near ubiquity.<ref name=\":5\" /> Alternative radio has arisen in response to capitalist and/or state-sponsored mainstream radio broadcasts.

First, blogs, [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and other similar sites, while not necessarily created to be information media, increasingly are being used to spread news and information, potentially acting as alternative media as they allow ordinary citizens to bypass the gatekeepers of traditional, mainstream media and share the information and perspectives these citizens deem important.\n\nSecond, the Internet provides an alternative space for mobilization through the cultivation of interpersonal networks, collective action towards social change, and making information much readily accessible. Typically, among those with deviant, dissident or non-traditional views, Internet platforms allow for the creation of new, alternative communities that can provide a voice for those normally marginalized by the mainstream media.\n\nIn addition, the Internet has also led to an alternative form of programming, which allows both professionals and amateurs to subvert or evade commercial and political restraints on open [[access to information]] and information technologies.<ref name=\":8\" /> Some examples of alternative computing are hacking, open source software or systems, and file sharing.\n\nLastly, the Internet also breeds a new way of creation and dissemination of knowledge \u2014commons knowledge\u2014 that is different from the top-down manner. It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users, fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and folksonomies. Wikipedia is an excellent example of this genre.\n\n=== Street art ===\nOften considered [[Guerilla art|guerilla-art]], [[street art]] operates free from the confines of the formal art world.<ref name=\":8\">Schwartzman, Allan, ''Street Art'', The Dial Press, Doubleday & Co., New York, NY 1985 {{ISBN|0-385-19950-3}}</ref> In the form of [[graffiti]], stencil, mural, and print, street art appropriates or alters public spaces as a means of protest and social commentary. Important aspects of street art as an alternative form are its blend of aesthetics and social engagement, use of urban spaces, and interaction with the social landscape of the area in which the art is made.<ref>{{cite book|first=Martin|last= Irvine|title=The Work on the Street: Street Art and Visual Culture|work='The Handbook of Visual Culture|location=London|publisher= Berg| date= 2012|pages=235\u2013278}}</ref>\n\nThe street art movement gained popularity in the 1980s as a form of art distinct from high art and commercial venues, but as popularity grew, some street artists moved from the alternative venues of the streets to gallery and museum showings.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The History of Street Art|url = http://www.widewalls.ch/the-history-of-street-art|website = WideWalls|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}</ref>  Cities such as Paris, Buenos Aires, and S\u00e3o Paulo rose to prominence in using street art as legitimate alternative media through artist collectives and competitions, bringing attention to alternative voices. The internet has also influenced street art greatly by functioning as a platform for artists and fans to share pictures of street art from around the world. Websites like Streetsy.com and WoosterCollective.com are among the most popular of street art sharing sites.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wooster Collective|url = http://www.woostercollective.com|website = Wooster Collective|accessdate = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027052728/http://woostercollective.com/|archivedate = 2015-10-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Performance ===\nPerformance as an alternative medium uses theater, song, and [[performance art]] as a means of engaging audiences and furthering social agendas. Performance art is an [[Avant-garde|avant garde]] art form that typically uses live performances to challenge traditional forms of visual art.  It operates as \"the antithesis of theatre, challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms.\"<ref>Hellerman and Goddard 1983</ref> Playing an important role in social and cultural movements from [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] to [[Postminimalism|Post-Minimalism]], performance art reflects the political environment of the time.<ref>'''Performance Art Movement,\nArtists and Major Works.\" ''The Art Story''.'''</ref> While performance art is often relegated to high art, street theater is typically used in a [[grassroots]] fashion, utilizing local communities for performance or conversation.  It can be used as a form of [[Guerrilla theatre|guerilla theater]] to protest, like in the case of [[The Living Theatre]] which is dedicated to transforming the hierarchy of power in society through experimental theater.\n\n=== Music ===\nCertain genres of music and musical performance can be categorized as alternative media. Independent music, or [[Indie Music|indie music]], is music that is produced separate from commercial record labels. Professor David Hesmondhalgh describes indie music's alternative nature as a \"hard-headed network of post-punk companies which made significant challenges to the commercial organization of cultural production favoured by the major record companies.\"<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David. \"Indie: The Aesthetics and Institutional Politics of Popular Music Genre.\"</ref> Its subversive roots of sound or lyrics and alternative models of distribution distinguish it from the commercial record companies.\n\n==Genres==\nPrimarily concerned with the growing role of new media in alternative media projects, communication scholar Leah Lievrouw identifies five genres of contemporary new media based alternative and activist media: culture jamming, alternative computing, participatory journalism, mediated mobilization, and commons knowledge.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011\">Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.19)</ref>\n\n*[[Culture jamming]] generally attempts to critique popular cultures such as entertainment, advertising, and art.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011\"/> It tends to comment on issues of [[corporate capitalism]] and consumerism and seeks to provide political commentary. Characteristics of culture jamming texts include the appropriation or repurposing of images, video, sound, or text and that they are ironic or satirical in some sense.<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.22-23)</ref> Today, culture jamming can come in the form of internet memes and [[guerrilla marketing]].\n*Alternative computing deals with the material infrastructure of informational and communications technologies. It seeks to critique and reconfigure systems with the intention of subverting or evading commercial and political restraints on open access to information and information technologies.<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Chapter 4. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 98-108). Polity. (98)</ref> Some examples of alternative computing are [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]], [[open source software]] or systems, and [[file sharing]].\n*Participatory journalism refers to web-based sources of critical or radical news either in the form of online news services or blogs. These alternative outlets of news often adopt the philosophies of [[citizen journalism]] and view themselves as providing an alternative to mainstream news and opinion.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011 pp. 1\">Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.25)</ref> Participatory journalism projects may cover underreported groups and issues. Within this genre authors and readers of some of these alternative media projects have the ability contribute alike and therefore has the characteristic of being participatory or interactive. An example of participatory journalism is [[Indymedia]]\n*Mobilization media relate to communication practices that mobilization or organization social movements, identity, or cultural projects through the use of new media tools and platforms such as [[Facebook]] or [[YouTube]]. Characteristics of this genre include the cultivation of interpersonal networks, collective action towards social change, and making information much readily accessible.<ref name=\"Lievrouw, L. 2011 pp. 1\"/>\n*Commons knowledge as a genre refers to projects that provide alternatives to the traditional top-down creation and dissemination of knowledge. It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users, fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and [[Folksonomy|folksonomies]].<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Chapter 7. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 178). Polity. (p.178)</ref> [[Wikipedia]] is an excellent example of this genre.\n\nThinking of current forms of alternative media in terms of the genre not only allow us to identify the features and conventions of certain modes of communication, but also how \"they allow people to express themselves appropriately, and to achieve their various purposes or intentions.\"<ref>Lievrouw, L. (2011). Introduction. In Alternative and Activist New Media (pp. 1\u201327). Polity. (p.20)</ref> In other words, we can begin to understand how the creators and participants of alternative new media projects actively shape their communication practices.\n\nYouTube is considered to be not only a commercial enterprise but also a platform designed to encourage cultural participation by ordinary citizens. Although YouTube aimed to be foremost a commercial enterprise, nevertheless, it has become a community media as one of the forms of alternative media. Scholars assume that YouTube's commercial drive may have increased the probability of participation in online video culture for a broader spectrum of participants than before. This idea allows us to shift our concern away from the false contradiction between market-driven and non-market-driven culture towards the tensions between corporate logics and unruly and emergent traits of participatory culture, and the limits of YouTube model for cross-cultural diversity and global communication. In theory, YouTube stands as a site of cosmopolitan cultural citizenship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Jean|last2=Green|first2=Joshua|title=YouTube: Online video and participatory culture|date=2009|publisher=Polity|location=Boston, MA}}</ref> Uploading foreign soap opera episodes and dividing into several pieces to pass YouTube's content limits, can be seen as acts of cultural citizenship similar to the media sharing practices of diverse communities identified by Cunningham and Nguyen (2000).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=Stuart|last2=Nguyen|first2=T|title=Popular media of the Vietnamese Diaspora|date=2000|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Saint Lucia|pages=91\u2013135|edition=Floating lives: The media and Asian diasporas}}</ref> However, people who have the highest chance of encountering other cultural citizens are those who have the access to various contents, information and platforms; this is commonly referred to as the 'participation gap.' The notion of participation gap makes both digital literacy and digital divide such important issues for cultural politics. Therefore, it is still controversial whether YouTube is just another conduit for strengthening [[cultural imperialism]] or one of the alternative media.\n\n==Aesthetics==\nIn association with  experimental and innovative modes of production and collaboration, [[aesthetics]] in alternative media can be a political tool used to subvert dominant power. Like many makers of alternative media, scholar [[Crispin Sartwell]] identifies politics as an aesthetic environment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sartwell|first1=Crispin|title=Political Aesthetics|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalaesthet00sart|url-access=registration|date=2010|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=London}}</ref> As such, these art political systems not only use aesthetics as a tool to gain power but are also produced via aesthetic forms within all media. Thus, it is not uncommon for alternative media to seek new artistic, non-traditional, or avant-garde means to represent its content. In this case, the use of aesthetics allows alternative media to address otherwise banal content in a manner which re-aligns, re-negotiates, or exposes the politics at work within it.\n\n=== Form ===\nScholars have linked the [[Avant-Garde|Avante-garde]] art movements as one arena where alternative aesthetics are used as a political tool. Movements such as [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], and [[Situationism]] looked to challenge the formal rules regarding what art was, how it looked or sounded like, or where it could be in order to radically alter public and political ideology. The logic, reason, and rules of style and beauty, mandated by the dominant class, was rejected as an affirmation of subjugation.\n\n=== Appropriation  ===\nWhile some alternative makers look to radically break away from the suffocating restraints of the dominant class by rejecting their dominant visual dogma, others appropriate, twist, and remix in order to subvert dominant language and messaging through mimicry, mockery, and satire. The [[d\u00e9tournement]] (and its successor [[Culture jamming|culture-jamming]]) of the Situationists, the mimicry of [[Pop art|Pop Art]], and the reworking of normative narratives in [[slash fiction]] are examples of appropriation of mainstream media texts.\n\n===Participation ===\nAvant-garde movements that have emphasized audience participation include [[Futurism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]], [[Pop art]], [[Neo-concretism]], and the [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].<ref name=\"Intellect\">{{cite book|last1=Carpentiere|first1=Nico|title=Media and Participation: A Site of Ideological Democratic Struggle|date=2011|publisher=Intellect|location=Chicago|pages=55\u201364}}</ref> By inviting the audience to participate in the creation of media, collaborators look to subvert or critique hierarchical structures ([[capitalism]], the [[ivory tower]]) within society by embracing democratic modes of production. Strategies that involve the input or collaboration of all stakeholders often result in less formally 'correct' aesthetics.\n\n==Notable media scholars==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Chris Atton]]\n*[[Rodney Benson]]\n*[[Jean Burgess]]\n*[[John D.

They are also daring hunters, fearlessly attacking the lion and the elephant, whom they pierce with their poisoned arrows. Like the Yebirs, the Midgans also practise medicine, and have the reputation of being extremely clever charlatans.

The sextet of aspiring [[Hollywood]] actors and writers, as well as drifting lost souls, work small-time catering gigs while hoping for their break or some positive change in their lives.

He is most well known for a beer ad where his line \"Are we having fun yet?\" earned him fame but killed his career. Apathetic and a perpetual underachiever, he often plays straight man to the rest of his coworkers and is most often the most level-headed of the group. His sexual relationship with Casey is a recurring plot element in the show.\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Ronald Wayne \"Ron\" Donald, the prideful team leader of Party Down catering who is very uptight when it comes to work and strives for customer satisfaction. He is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, although he relapses when under pressure from work as he suffers from low self-esteem. His dream is to manage a Soup R' Crackers, a franchise that offers all-you-can-eat soup. After getting the money, the business shuts down after five months, forcing Ron to return to Party Down but not as team leader.\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Casey Klein, a struggling comedian and actress who often disregards authority, especially Ron's. She was married at the start of the series but got divorced and started a relationship with Henry to make a \"clean break\" from her marriage.\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as Kyle Bradway, an actor, model, and front man for the band Karma Rocket. He believes he is the \"total package\" and is just waiting for his big break.\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Roman DeBeers, a screenwriter who is a fan of [[hard science fiction]]. Often frustrated by his lack of success, he harshly judges his colleagues and party guests.\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Constance Carmell (season 1, episodes 1\u20138; guest star season 2, episode 10), a former actress who befriends and mentors aspiring actor Kyle.  Lynch did not appear in the last two episodes of the first season due to her commitment to ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.  Lynch guest starred in the final episode of the second season.\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Lydia Dunfree (season 2), a recent divorcee who has moved to Hollywood hoping to achieve stardom for her 13-year-old daughter Escapade.

There are scattered woodlands in the east, in Sasaram Block. In the southern part of the district is the [[Rohtas Plateau]], which is an eastern flank of the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya plateau]] with an average elevation of 300m above sea level. It covers parts of Nauhatta, Rohtas, Sheosagar, Sasaram, and Chenari Blocks. This area is hilly, with occasional forests throughout.
