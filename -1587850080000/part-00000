It shoots [[arrow]]-like [[projectile]]s called [[crossbow bolt|bolt]]s or quarrels.  The medieval European crossbow was called by many other names including crossbow itself, most of which were derived from the word ''[[ballista]]'', an [[ancient Greek]] torsion [[siege engine]] similar in appearance.<ref>{{Citation |last=Payne-Gallwey |first=Ralph |authorlink=Sir Ralph Frankland-Payne-Gallwey, 3rd Baronet |title=The Crossbow |origyear=1903 |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |isbn=978-1-60239-010-2 |page=2 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough having the same launch principle, crossbows differ from bows in that a bow's [[bow draw|draw]] must be maintained manually by the archer pulling the [[bowstring]] with fingers, arm and back muscles and holding that same [[form (exercise)|form]] in order to aim (which demands significant physical strength and stamina), while a crossbow uses a locking mechanism to maintain the draw, limiting the shooter's exertion to only pulling the string into lock and then releasing the shot via depressing a lever/[[trigger (firearms)|trigger]].  This not only enables a crossbowman to handle stronger draw weight, but also hold for longer with significantly less physical strain, thus capable of better precision.\n\nHistorically, crossbows played a significant role in the warfare of [[East Asia]] and [[Medieval]] [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tom Ukinski|title=Drones: Mankind's Always Had Them|url=http://guardianlv.com/2013/05/drones-mankinds-always-had-them/|accessdate=1 March 2015|work=Guardian Liberty Voice|date=23 May 2013}}</ref> The earliest crossbows in the world were invented in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]] and caused a major shift in the role of [[ranged weaponry|projectile weaponry]].  The traditional [[bow and arrow]] had long been a specialized [[weapon]] that required considerable training, physical strength and expertise to operate with any degree of practical efficiency.  In many cultures, [[archer]]s were considered a separate and superior warrior caste, despite usually being drawn from the [[commoner|common]] class, as their [[archery]] skill-set was essentially trained and strengthened from birth (similar to many [[cavalry|horseman]] cultures) and was impossible to reproduce outside a pre-established cultural tradition, which many nations lacked.  In contrast, the crossbow was the first ranged weapon to be simple, cheap and physically undemanding enough to be operated by large numbers of untrained [[conscript]] soldiers, thus enabling virtually any nation to field a potent force of crossbowmen with little expense beyond the cost of the weapons themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts and interesting information about Medieval Weapons, Armor and arms, specifically, the Crossbow|url=http://www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-weapons/crossbow.htm|website=medieval-life-and-times.info|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Firearm]]s have largely supplanted crossbows for use against humans.  Crossbows are still widely used for competitive [[shooting sport]]s and hunting, or for relatively silent shooting.\n\n==Terminology==\nA crossbowman or crossbow-maker is sometimes called an ''arbalist'' or ''arbalest''.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n''Arrow'', ''bolt'' and ''quarrel'' are all suitable terms for crossbow projectiles.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''lath'', also called the ''prod'', is the bow of the crossbow. According to W.F. Peterson, the ''prod'' came into usage in the 19th century as a result of mistranslating ''rodd'' in a 16th-century list of crossbow effects.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''stock'' is the wooden body on which the bow is mounted, although the medieval ''tiller'' is also used.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''lock'' refers to the release mechanism, including the string, sears, trigger lever, and housing.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Han crossbow trigger mechanism.jpg|thumb|Han crossbow trigger pieces.]]\n[[File:Noix corde carreau arbalette.svg|thumb|Crossbow nut: {{ordered list| Nut.| String.| Quarrel.| Trigger.}}]]\n[[File:Nuss Armbrust.jpg|thumb|16th century crossbow nut excavated at [[Harburger Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]], [[Hamburg Harburg]], [[Germany]]]]\nA crossbow is essentially a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] mounted on an elongated frame (called a '''tiller''' or '''stock''') with a built-in mechanism that holds the drawn [[bow string]], as well as a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] mechanism that allows the string to be released.\n\n===Chinese vertical trigger lock===\nThe Chinese trigger mechanism was a vertical lever composed of four bronze pieces secured together by two bronze rods.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n{{quotation|The ''nu'' [crossbow] is so called because it spreads abroad an aura of rage [nu]. Its stock is like the arm of a man, therefore it is called ''bi''.  That which hooks the bowstring is called ''ya'', for indeed it is like teeth. The part round about the teeth [i.e. the housing box] is called the \"outer wall\" [''guo''], since it surrounds the lug [''gui''] of the teeth [i.e. the nut].  Within [and below] there is the \"hanging knife\" [''xuan dao'', i.e. the trigger blade] so called because it looks like one. The whole assembly is called ''ji'', for it is just as ingenious as the [[loom]].{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=133}}|''[[Shiming]]''}}\n\n===European rolling nut lock===\nThe earliest European designs featured a transverse slot in the top surface of the frame, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out.  This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a ''tickler''. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a ''nut'' to retain the string.  This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal ''sear'' or trigger face, usually of metal.  These ''roller nuts'' were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally.  Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal.  Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little physical straining, allowing crossbowmen to aim better without fatiguing.<ref>Hanafi et al. 2011: 23</ref>\n\n===Bow===\nChinese crossbow bows were made of composite material from the start.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nEuropean crossbows from the 10th to 12th centuries used wood for the bow, also called the ''prod'' or ''lath'', which tended to be [[ash tree|ash]] or [[taxus|yew]].{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nComposite bows started appearing in Europe during the 13th century and could be made from layers of different material, often wood, horn, and sinew glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows made of several layers are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAs steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nTraditionally, the prod was often lashed to the stock with rope, [[whipcord]], or other strong cording. This cording is called the ''[[bridle]]''.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n===Spanning mechanism===\nThe Chinese used [[winch]]es for large mounted crossbows. Winches may have been used for hand held crossbows during the [[Han dynasty]] but there is only one known depiction of it.

The [[arbalest]] was a heavy crossbow that required special systems for pulling the sinew via windlasses.

These are usually much shorter than arrows, but can be several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads, some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a [[Quarrel (projectile)|quarrel]]. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.\n\nEven relatively small differences in arrow weight can have a considerable impact on its drop and, conversely, its flight trajectory.<ref name=\"CrossbowArrowDrop\">{{cite web|url=https://thebowside.com|title=Crossbow Arrow Drop - Charted Test Results|access-date=12 July 2019|website=TheBowSide.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\n[[File:Crossbow telescopic sight reticle.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The reticle of a modern crossbow [[telescopic sight]] allows the shooter to adjust for different ranges]]\n\nThe [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] crossbow often included a metal (i.e. bronze or steel) grid serving as [[iron sights]]. Modern crossbow sights often use similar technology to modern firearm sights, such as [[red dot sight]]s and [[telescopic sight]]s. Many crossbow scopes feature multiple [[crosshairs]] to compensate for the significant effects of [[gravity]] over different ranges.

This source refers to the use of a giant crossbow between the 6th and 5th centuries BC, corresponding to the late [[Spring and Autumn Period]]. [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (first appearance dated between 500 BC to 300 BC<ref>James Clavell, ''The Art of War'', prelude</ref>) refers to the characteristics and use of crossbows in chapters 5 and 12 respectively,<ref>https://www.gutenberg.org/files/132/132.txt</ref> and compares a drawn crossbow to \"might\".{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=34}}  The ''[[Huainanzi]]'' advises its readers not to use crossbows in marshland where the surface is soft and it is hard to arm the crossbow with the foot.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=141}} The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', completed in 94 BC, mentions that [[Sun Bin]] defeated [[Pang Juan]] by ambushing him with a body of crossbowmen at the [[Battle of Maling]] in 342 BC.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=139}}  The ''[[Book of Han]]'', finished 111 AD, lists two military treatises on crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=22}}<ref name=\"wright 2001 42\">Wright (2001), 42.</ref>\n\nHandheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the [[Terracotta Army]] in the tomb of [[Qin Shihuang]] (r. 221\u2013210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC\u2013220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Qin and Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as [[Chariots in ancient China|charioteers]] and [[Cavalry#East Asia|cavalry units]], and Han Dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|battles against the Xiongnu]] and [[Western Regions]] states to massed crossbow volleys.<ref>Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 6, 124\u2013128.</ref><ref>Lewis (2000a), 45.</ref> The bronze triggers were designed in such a way that they were able to store a large amount of energy within the bow when drawn, but was easily shot with little resistance and recoil when the trigger were pulled.  The trigger nut also had a long vertical spine that could be used like a primitive [[iron sight|rear sight]] for [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] adjustment, which allowed precision shooting over longer distances.  The Qin/Han-era crossbow was also an early example of [[modular design]], as the bronze trigger components were also mass-produced with relative high precision so they are interchangeable between different crossbows.  The trigger mechanism from one crossbow can be installed into another simply by dropping into a tiller slot of the same specifications and secured with [[dowel pin]]s.\n\nIt is clear from surviving inventory lists in [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]] that the crossbow was greatly favored by the Han dynasty.  For example, in one batch of slips there are only two mentions of bows, but thirty mentions of crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=141}} Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood stock and brass; a crossbow in 1068 could pierce a tree at 140 paces.<ref name=\"peers 130 131\">Peers, 130\u2013131.</ref> Crossbows were used in numbers as large as 50,000 starting from the Qin dynasty and upwards of several hundred thousand during the Han.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=143}} According to one authority, the crossbow had become \"nothing less than the standard weapon of the Han armies\", by the second century BC.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=22}} Han soldiers were required to pull a crossbow with a draw weight equivalent of {{convert|76|kg|lb|abbr=in}} to qualify as a crossbowman.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAfter the Han dynasty, the crossbow lost favor until it experienced a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=193}} [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] and Li Quan prescribed 20 percent of the infantry to be armed with crossbows.{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=52}}\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the crossbow received a huge upsurge in military usage. The crossbow overshadowed the bow 2 to 1. During this time period, a stirrup was added for ease of loading. The government attempted to restrict the spread of crossbows and sought ways to keep armour and crossbows out of civilian homes.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=145}}  Despite the ban on certain types of crossbows, the weapon experienced an upsurge in civilian usage as both a hunting weapon and pastime. The \"romantic young people from rich families, and others who had nothing particular to do\" formed crossbow shooting clubs as a way to pass time.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=146}}\n\nDuring the late [[Ming dynasty]], no crossbows were mentioned to have been produced in the three-year period from 1619 to 1622. With 21,188,366 taels, the Ming manufactured 25,134 cannons, 8,252 small guns, 6,425 muskets, 4,090 culverins, 98,547 polearms and swords, 26,214 great \"horse decapitator\" swords, 42,800 bows, 1,000 great axes, 2,284,000 arrows, 180,000 fire arrows, 64,000 bow strings, and hundreds of transport carts.{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=49}}\n\nMilitary crossbows were armed by treading, or basically placing the feet on the bow stave and drawing it using one's arms and back muscles. During the Song dynasty, stirrups were added for ease of drawing and to mitigate damage to the bow. Alternatively the bow could also be drawn by a belt claw attached to the waist, but this was done lying down, as was the case for all large crossbows. Winch-drawing was used for the large mounted crossbows as seen below, but evidence for its use in Chinese hand-crossbows is scant.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nOther sorts of crossbows also existed, such as the [[repeating crossbow]], multi-shot crossbow, larger field artillery crossbows, and repeating multi-shot crossbow.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Ref-chamballista.jpg|right|thumb|Wheelmounted and elephantmounted double-bow-arcuballistae of the [[Champa]] kingdom.]]\n\nIn [[Vietnam]]ese historical legend, general [[Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n]], who ruled over the ancient kingdom of [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] from 257 to 207&nbsp;BC, is said to have owed his power to a magic crossbow, capable of shooting thousands of bolts at once.\n\nThe native [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s of Vietnam's Central Highlands were also known to have used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later, an effective weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite web|title=Montagnard Crossbow, Vietnam|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C364947|website=awm.gov.au|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref> Montagnard fighters armed with crossbows proved a highly valuable asset to the US Special Forces operating in Vietnam, and it was not uncommon for the Green Berets to integrate Montagnard crossbowmen into their strike teams.<ref>DK/Smithsonian, ''The Vietnam War: The Definitive Illustrated History'' (London: DK (formerly Dorling Kindersley), 2017), 64-69. {{ISBN|1465466010}}</ref>\n\nCrossbow technology for crossbows with more than one prod was transferred from the Chinese to [[Champa]], which Champa used in its invasion of the [[Khmer Empire]]'s [[Angkor]] in 1177.<ref name=\"Grant2005\">{{cite book|author=R.

Later crossbows (sometimes referred to as [[arbalest]]s), utilizing all-steel prods, were able to achieve power close (and sometime superior) to longbows, but were more expensive to produce and slower to reload because they required the aid of mechanical devices such as the cranequin or [[windlass]] to draw back their extremely heavy bows.

Peterson, the ''prod'' came into usage in the 19th century as a result of mistranslating ''rodd'' in a 16th-century list of crossbow effects.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''stock'' is the wooden body on which the bow is mounted, although the medieval ''tiller'' is also used.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe ''lock'' refers to the release mechanism, including the string, sears, trigger lever, and housing.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Han crossbow trigger mechanism.jpg|thumb|Han crossbow trigger pieces.]]\n[[File:Noix corde carreau arbalette.svg|thumb|Crossbow nut: {{ordered list| Nut.| String.| Quarrel.| Trigger.}}]]\n[[File:Nuss Armbrust.jpg|thumb|16th century crossbow nut excavated at [[Harburger Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]], [[Hamburg Harburg]], [[Germany]]]]\nA crossbow is essentially a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] mounted on an elongated frame (called a '''tiller''' or '''stock''') with a built-in mechanism that holds the drawn [[bow string]], as well as a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] mechanism that allows the string to be released.\n\n===Chinese vertical trigger lock===\nThe Chinese trigger mechanism was a vertical lever composed of four bronze pieces secured together by two bronze rods.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n{{quotation|The ''nu'' [crossbow] is so called because it spreads abroad an aura of rage [nu].

To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out.  This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a ''tickler''. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a ''nut'' to retain the string.  This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal ''sear'' or trigger face, usually of metal.  These ''roller nuts'' were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally.  Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal.  Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little physical straining, allowing crossbowmen to aim better without fatiguing.<ref>Hanafi et al. 2011: 23</ref>\n\n===Bow===\nChinese crossbow bows were made of composite material from the start.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nEuropean crossbows from the 10th to 12th centuries used wood for the bow, also called the ''prod'' or ''lath'', which tended to be [[ash tree|ash]] or [[taxus|yew]].{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nComposite bows started appearing in Europe during the 13th century and could be made from layers of different material, often wood, horn, and sinew glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows made of several layers are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAs steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nTraditionally, the prod was often lashed to the stock with rope, [[whipcord]], or other strong cording.

The [[arbalest]] was a heavy crossbow that required special systems for pulling the sinew via windlasses.

These are usually much shorter than arrows, but can be several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads, some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a [[Quarrel (projectile)|quarrel]]. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.\n\nEven relatively small differences in arrow weight can have a considerable impact on its drop and, conversely, its flight trajectory.<ref name=\"CrossbowArrowDrop\">{{cite web|url=https://thebowside.com|title=Crossbow Arrow Drop - Charted Test Results|access-date=12 July 2019|website=TheBowSide.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\n[[File:Crossbow telescopic sight reticle.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The reticle of a modern crossbow [[telescopic sight]] allows the shooter to adjust for different ranges]]\n\nThe [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] crossbow often included a metal (i.e. bronze or steel) grid serving as [[iron sights]]. Modern crossbow sights often use similar technology to modern firearm sights, such as [[red dot sight]]s and [[telescopic sight]]s.

This source refers to the use of a giant crossbow between the 6th and 5th centuries BC, corresponding to the late [[Spring and Autumn Period]]. [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (first appearance dated between 500 BC to 300 BC<ref>James Clavell, ''The Art of War'', prelude</ref>) refers to the characteristics and use of crossbows in chapters 5 and 12 respectively,<ref>https://www.gutenberg.org/files/132/132.txt</ref> and compares a drawn crossbow to \"might\".{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=34}}  The ''[[Huainanzi]]'' advises its readers not to use crossbows in marshland where the surface is soft and it is hard to arm the crossbow with the foot.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=141}} The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', completed in 94 BC, mentions that [[Sun Bin]] defeated [[Pang Juan]] by ambushing him with a body of crossbowmen at the [[Battle of Maling]] in 342 BC.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=139}}  The ''[[Book of Han]]'', finished 111 AD, lists two military treatises on crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=22}}<ref name=\"wright 2001 42\">Wright (2001), 42.</ref>\n\nHandheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the [[Terracotta Army]] in the tomb of [[Qin Shihuang]] (r. 221\u2013210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC\u2013220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Qin and Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as [[Chariots in ancient China|charioteers]] and [[Cavalry#East Asia|cavalry units]], and Han Dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|battles against the Xiongnu]] and [[Western Regions]] states to massed crossbow volleys.<ref>Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 6, 124\u2013128.</ref><ref>Lewis (2000a), 45.</ref> The bronze triggers were designed in such a way that they were able to store a large amount of energy within the bow when drawn, but was easily shot with little resistance and recoil when the trigger were pulled.  The trigger nut also had a long vertical spine that could be used like a primitive [[iron sight|rear sight]] for [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] adjustment, which allowed precision shooting over longer distances.  The Qin/Han-era crossbow was also an early example of [[modular design]], as the bronze trigger components were also mass-produced with relative high precision so they are interchangeable between different crossbows.  The trigger mechanism from one crossbow can be installed into another simply by dropping into a tiller slot of the same specifications and secured with [[dowel pin]]s.\n\nIt is clear from surviving inventory lists in [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]] that the crossbow was greatly favored by the Han dynasty.  For example, in one batch of slips there are only two mentions of bows, but thirty mentions of crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=141}} Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood stock and brass; a crossbow in 1068 could pierce a tree at 140 paces.<ref name=\"peers 130 131\">Peers, 130\u2013131.</ref> Crossbows were used in numbers as large as 50,000 starting from the Qin dynasty and upwards of several hundred thousand during the Han.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=143}} According to one authority, the crossbow had become \"nothing less than the standard weapon of the Han armies\", by the second century BC.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=22}} Han soldiers were required to pull a crossbow with a draw weight equivalent of {{convert|76|kg|lb|abbr=in}} to qualify as a crossbowman.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAfter the Han dynasty, the crossbow lost favor until it experienced a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=193}} [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] and Li Quan prescribed 20 percent of the infantry to be armed with crossbows.{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=52}}\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the crossbow received a huge upsurge in military usage. The crossbow overshadowed the bow 2 to 1. During this time period, a stirrup was added for ease of loading. The government attempted to restrict the spread of crossbows and sought ways to keep armour and crossbows out of civilian homes.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=145}}  Despite the ban on certain types of crossbows, the weapon experienced an upsurge in civilian usage as both a hunting weapon and pastime. The \"romantic young people from rich families, and others who had nothing particular to do\" formed crossbow shooting clubs as a way to pass time.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=146}}\n\nDuring the late [[Ming dynasty]], no crossbows were mentioned to have been produced in the three-year period from 1619 to 1622. With 21,188,366 taels, the Ming manufactured 25,134 cannons, 8,252 small guns, 6,425 muskets, 4,090 culverins, 98,547 polearms and swords, 26,214 great \"horse decapitator\" swords, 42,800 bows, 1,000 great axes, 2,284,000 arrows, 180,000 fire arrows, 64,000 bow strings, and hundreds of transport carts.{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=49}}\n\nMilitary crossbows were armed by treading, or basically placing the feet on the bow stave and drawing it using one's arms and back muscles. During the Song dynasty, stirrups were added for ease of drawing and to mitigate damage to the bow. Alternatively the bow could also be drawn by a belt claw attached to the waist, but this was done lying down, as was the case for all large crossbows. Winch-drawing was used for the large mounted crossbows as seen below, but evidence for its use in Chinese hand-crossbows is scant.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nOther sorts of crossbows also existed, such as the [[repeating crossbow]], multi-shot crossbow, larger field artillery crossbows, and repeating multi-shot crossbow.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Ref-chamballista.jpg|right|thumb|Wheelmounted and elephantmounted double-bow-arcuballistae of the [[Champa]] kingdom.]]\n\nIn [[Vietnam]]ese historical legend, general [[Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n]], who ruled over the ancient kingdom of [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] from 257 to 207&nbsp;BC, is said to have owed his power to a magic crossbow, capable of shooting thousands of bolts at once.\n\nThe native [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s of Vietnam's Central Highlands were also known to have used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later, an effective weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite web|title=Montagnard Crossbow, Vietnam|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C364947|website=awm.gov.au|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref> Montagnard fighters armed with crossbows proved a highly valuable asset to the US Special Forces operating in Vietnam, and it was not uncommon for the Green Berets to integrate Montagnard crossbowmen into their strike teams.<ref>DK/Smithsonian, ''The Vietnam War: The Definitive Illustrated History'' (London: DK (formerly Dorling Kindersley), 2017), 64-69. {{ISBN|1465466010}}</ref>\n\nCrossbow technology for crossbows with more than one prod was transferred from the Chinese to [[Champa]], which Champa used in its invasion of the [[Khmer Empire]]'s [[Angkor]] in 1177.<ref name=\"Grant2005\">{{cite book|author=R.

Later crossbows (sometimes referred to as [[arbalest]]s), utilizing all-steel prods, were able to achieve power close (and sometime superior) to longbows, but were more expensive to produce and slower to reload because they required the aid of mechanical devices such as the cranequin or [[windlass]] to draw back their extremely heavy bows. Usually these could only shoot two bolts per minute versus twelve or more with a skilled archer, often necessitating the use of a [[pavise]] to protect the operator from enemy fire.<ref name=\"Robert Hardy 1992 p. 75\">Robert Hardy (1992). \"Longbow: A Social and Military History\".

The [[Battle of Cerignola]] in 1503 was largely won by Spain through the use of matchlock firearms, marking the first time a major battle was won through the use of firearms. Later, similar competing tactics would feature [[arquebus|harquebusiers]] or [[musket]]eers in formation with pikemen, pitted against cavalry firing [[pistol]]s or [[carbine]]s. While the military crossbow had largely been supplanted by firearms on the battlefield by 1525, the sporting crossbow in various forms remained a popular hunting weapon in Europe until the eighteenth century.<ref>Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey (1995). \"The Book of the Crossbow\".

They called it ''qaus al-rijl'' (foot-drawn bow), ''qaus al-zanb\u016brak'' (bolt bow) and ''qaus al-faranj\u012byah'' (Frankish bow).

There is no [[coproduct (category theory)|coproduct]] in '''Met'''.\n\nThe [[forgetful functor]] '''Met''' \u2192 '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' assigns to each metric space the underlying [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of its points, and assigns to each metric map the underlying set-theoretic function. This functor is [[Faithful functor|faithful]], and therefore '''Met''' is a [[concrete category]].\n\n==Related categories==\n'''Met''' is not the only category whose objects are metric spaces; others include the category of [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous functions]], the category of [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz functions]] and the category of [[quasi-Lipschitz mapping]]s. The metric maps are both uniformly continuous and Lipschitz, with Lipschitz constant at most one.\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation\n | author1-link = Nachman Aronszajn | last1 = Aronszajn | first1 = N. | last2 = Panitchpakdi | first2 = P.\n | title = Extensions of uniformly continuous transformations and hyperconvex metric spaces\n | journal = Pacific Journal of Mathematics\n | volume = 6\n | year = 1956\n | pages = 405\u2013439\n | url = http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1103043960 | doi=10.2140/pjm.1956.6.405| doi-access = free}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Deza | first1 = Michel Marie | author1-link = Michel Deza\n | last2 = Deza | first2 = Elena\n | contribution = Category of metric spaces\n | page = 38\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag\n | title = Encyclopedia of Distances\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LXEezzccwcoC&pg=PA38\n | year = 2009}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Isbell | first = J.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade<ref name=\"OoB\">Official Records of the American Civil War of the Union and Confederate Armies, U.S. War Department</ref> of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref><ref name=\"Dyer\">Dyer</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=\"Cities\">[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen<ref name=\"Dyer\" />. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer.

This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863<ref name=\"Dyer\" />.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>.

Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1, pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=\"SunSpencer\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade<ref name=\"OoB\">Official Records of the American Civil War of the Union and Confederate Armies, U.S. War Department</ref> of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref><ref name=\"Dyer\">Dyer</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=\"Cities\">[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen<ref name=\"Dyer\" />. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863<ref name=\"Dyer\" />.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>.

After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1, pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=\"SunSpencer\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

He was an influence on [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artists of the period such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]].\n\nAlthough fatherless and raised in poverty, he was an exceptionally studious child, publishing mature work by the age of 11. He was able to [[literary forgery|pass off his work]] as that of an imaginary 15th-century poet called Thomas Rowley, chiefly because few people at the time were familiar with medieval poetry, though he was denounced by [[Horace Walpole]]. \n\nAt 17, he sought outlets for his political writings in London, having impressed the Lord Mayor, [[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]], and the radical leader [[John Wilkes]], but his earnings were not enough to keep him, and he poisoned himself in despair. His unusual life and death attracted much interest among the romantic poets, and [[Alfred de Vigny]] wrote a play about him that is still performed today. The oil painting ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' by Pre-Raphaelite artist [[Henry Wallis]] has enjoyed lasting fame.\n\n==Childhood==\nChatterton was born in [[Bristol]] where the office of [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] of [[St Mary Redcliffe]] had long been held by the Chatterton family. The poet's father, also named Thomas Chatterton, was a musician, a poet, a [[numismatics|numismatist]], and a dabbler in the [[occult]]. He had been a [[Succentor|sub-chanter]] at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and master of the Pyle Street free school, near Redcliffe church.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:Chatterton house Bristol.jpg|thumb|left|The wall at the right of the house where Chatterton was raised is that of the {{circa|1739}} school where Chatterton's father was master. The school was demolished in 1939 to widen Pile Street into Redcliff Way, but the fa\u00e7ade was rebuilt on the line of the former back wall.]]\nAfter Chatterton's birth (15 weeks after his father's death on 7 August 1752),<ref>[[s:Chatterton, Thomas (DNB00)|Wikisource]]. Retrieved 14 March 2014</ref> his mother established a girls' school and took in sewing and ornamental needlework. Chatterton was admitted to [[Edward Colston]]'s Charity, a Bristol [[charity school]], in which the curriculum was limited to reading, writing, arithmetic and the [[catechism]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nChatterton, however, was always fascinated with his uncle the sexton and the church of St Mary Redcliffe. The knights, ecclesiastics and civic dignitaries on its [[altar tomb]]s became familiar to him. Then he found a fresh interest in oaken chests in the [[muniment]] room over the porch on the north side of the [[nave]], where parchment deeds, old as the [[Wars of the Roses]], lay forgotten. Chatterton learned his first letters from the illuminated capitals of an old musical folio, and he learned to read out of a black-letter Bible. His sister said he did not like reading out of small books. Wayward from his earliest years, and uninterested in the games of other children, he was thought to be educationally backward. His sister related that on being asked what device he would like painted on a bowl that was to be his, he replied, \"Paint me an angel, with wings, and a trumpet, to trumpet my name over the world.\"<ref>Kaplan 22</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFrom his earliest years, he was liable to fits of abstraction, sitting for hours in what seemed like a trance, or crying for no reason. His lonely circumstances helped foster his natural reserve, and to create the love of mystery which exercised such an influence on the development of his poetry. When Chatterton was age 6, his mother began to recognise his capacity; at age 8, he was so eager for books that he would read and write all day long if undisturbed; by the age of 11, he had become a contributor to [[Felix Farley]]'s ''[[Bristol Journal]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis [[confirmation]] inspired him to write some religious poems published in that paper. In 1763, a cross which had adorned the churchyard of St Mary Redcliffe for upwards of three centuries was destroyed by a churchwarden. The spirit of veneration was strong in Chatterton, and he sent to the local journal on 7 January 1764 a satire on the parish vandal. He also liked to lock himself in a little attic which he had appropriated as his study; and there, with books, cherished parchments, loot purloined from the muniment room of St Mary Redcliffe, and drawing materials, the child lived in thought with his 15th-century heroes and heroines.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==First \"medieval\" works==\nThe first of his literary mysteries, the [[dialogue]] of \"Elinoure and Juga,\" was written before he was 12, and he showed it to Thomas Phillips, the usher at the boarding school [[Colston's School|Colston's Hospital]] where he was a pupil, pretending it was the work of a 15th-century poet. Chatterton remained a boarder at Colston's Hospital for more than six years, and it was only his uncle who encouraged the pupils to write. Three of Chatterton's companions are named as youths whom Phillips's taste for poetry stimulated to rivalry; but Chatterton told no one about his own more daring literary adventures. His little pocket-money was spent on borrowing books from a [[circulating library]]; and he ingratiated himself with book collectors, in order to obtain access to [[John Weever]], [[William Dugdale]] and [[Arthur Collins (antiquarian)|Arthur Collins]], as well as to [[Thomas Speght]]'s edition of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] and other books.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} At some point he came across [[Elizabeth Cooper (dramatist)|Elizabeth Cooper's]] anthology of verse, which is said to have been a major source for his inventions.<ref>Yvonne Noble, \u2018Cooper, Elizabeth (b. in or before 1698, d. 1761?)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6217, accessed 11 Nov 2014]</ref>\n\nChatterton's \"[[:wikt:Rowleian|Rowleian]]\" jargon appears to have been chiefly the result of the study of [[John Kersey]]'s ''[[Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum]]'', and it seems his knowledge even of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] was very slight. His holidays were mostly spent at his mother's house, and much of them in the favourite retreat of his attic study there. He lived for the most part in an ideal world of his own, in the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], during the mid-[[15th century]], when the great Bristol merchant [[William II Canynges]] (d.1474), five times mayor of Bristol, patron and rebuilder of St Mary Redcliffe \"still ruled in Bristol's civic chair.\" Canynges was familiar to him from his recumbent effigy in Redcliffe church, and is represented by Chatterton as an enlightened patron of art and literature.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Adopts ''persona'' of Thomas Rowley==\nChatterton soon conceived the romance of Thomas Rowley, an imaginary monk of the 15th century, and adopted for himself the pseudonym Thomas Rowley for poetry and history. According to [[psychoanalyst]] Louise J. Kaplan, his being fatherless played a great role in his imposturous creation of Rowley.<ref>Kaplan 21</ref> The development of his masculine identity was held back by the fact that he was raised by two women: his mother Sarah and his sister Mary. Therefore, \"to reconstitute the lost father in fantasy,\"<ref>Kaplan 100</ref> he unconsciously created \"two interweaving family romances [fantasies], each with its own scenario.\"<ref>Kaplan 25</ref> The first of these was the romance of Rowley for whom he created a fatherlike, wealthy patron, William Canynge, while the second was as Kaplan named it his romance of \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]].\" He imagined he would become a famous poet who by his talents would be able to rescue his mother from poverty.<ref>Kaplan 23</ref>\n\n==Chatterton\u2019s search for a patron==\nTo bring his hopes to life, Chatterton started to look for a patron. At first, he was trying to do so in Bristol where he became acquainted with [[William Barrett (antiquarian)|William Barrett]], George Catcott and Henry Burgum. He assisted them by providing Rowley transcripts for their work. The antiquary William Barrett relied exclusively on these fake transcripts when writing his ''[[History and Antiquities of Bristol]]'' (1789) which became an enormous failure.<ref>Kaplan 247</ref> But since his Bristol patrons were not willing to pay him enough, he turned to the wealthier [[Horace Walpole]].<ref>Kaplan 90</ref> In 1769, Chatterton sent specimens of Rowley's poetry and \"The Ryse of Peyncteynge yn Englade\"<ref>Meyerstein 254-5</ref> to Walpole who offered to print them \"if they have never been printed.\"<ref>Walpole\u2019s letter to Chatterton dated 28 March 1769 quoted in Meyerstein, 256-7</ref> Later, however, finding that Chatterton was only 16 and that the alleged Rowley pieces might have been forgeries, he scornfully sent him away.<ref>Meyerstein 262</ref>\n\n==Political writings==\nBadly hurt by Walpole's snub, Chatterton wrote very little for a summer. Then, after the end of the summer, he turned his attention to periodical literature and politics, and exchanged Farley's ''Bristol Journal'' for the ''[[Town and Country Magazine]]'' and other London periodicals. Assuming the vein of the pseudonymous letter writer [[Junius]], then in the full blaze of his triumph, he turned his pen against the [[Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], the [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Earl of Bute]] and [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]], the [[Princess of Wales]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Leaving Bristol==\nHe had just dispatched one of his political diatribes to the ''Middlesex Journal'' when he sat down on Easter Eve, 17 April 1770, and penned his \"Last Will and Testament,\" a satirical compound of jest and earnest, in which he intimated his intention of ending his life the following evening. Among his satirical bequests, such as his \"humility\" to the Rev. Mr Camplin, his \"religion\" to Dean Barton, and his \"modesty\" along with his \"prosody and grammar\" to Mr Burgum, he leaves \"to Bristol all his spirit and disinterestedness, parcels of goods unknown on its quay since the days of Canynge and Rowley.\"<ref>Chatterton\u2019s Last Will and Testament quoted in Meyerstein 342</ref> In more genuine earnestness, he recalls the name of Michael Clayfield, a friend to whom he owed intelligent sympathy. The will was possibly prepared in order to frighten his master into letting him go. If so, it had the desired effect. John Lambert, the attorney to whom he was apprenticed, cancelled his indentures; his friends and acquaintances having donated money, Chatterton went to London.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==London==\n[[File:Thomas Chatterton.jpg|thumb|''Chatterton's Holiday Afternoon'' engraved by William Ridgway, after W.B. Morris, pub. 1875]]\nChatterton already was known to the readers of the ''Middlesex Journal'' as a rival of Junius under the [[Pen name|nom de plume]] of Decimus. He also had been a contributor to ''Hamilton's Town and Country Magazine'', and speedily found access to the ''Freeholder's Magazine'', another political miscellany supportive of [[John Wilkes]] and liberty. His contributions were accepted, but the editors paid little or nothing for them.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe wrote hopefully to his mother and sister, and spent his first earnings in buying gifts for them. Wilkes had noted his trenchant style \"and expressed a desire to know the author\";<ref>Chatterton\u2019s letter to his mother dated 6 May 1770 quoted in Meyerstein 360</ref> and [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] [[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]] graciously acknowledged a political address of his, and greeted him \"as politely as a citizen could.\"<ref>Chatterton\u2019s letter to his sister dated 30 May 1770 quoted in Meyerstein 372</ref> He was [[:wikt:abstemious|abstemious]] and extraordinarily diligent. He could assume the style of Junius or [[Tobias Smollett]], reproduce the satiric bitterness of [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], parody [[James Macpherson]]'s ''[[Ossian]]'', or write in the manner of [[Alexander Pope]] or with the polished grace of [[Thomas Gray]] and [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe wrote political letters, [[eclogue]]s, lyrics, operas and satires, both in prose and verse. In June 1770, after nine weeks in London, he moved from [[Shoreditch]], where he had lodged with a relative, to an attic in Brook Street, [[Holborn]] (now beneath [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s [[Holborn Bars]] building). He was still short of money; and now state prosecutions of the press rendered letters in the Junius vein no longer admissible, and threw him back on the lighter resources of his pen. In Shoreditch, he had shared a room; but now, for the first time, he enjoyed uninterrupted solitude. His bed-fellow at Mr Walmsley's, Shoreditch, noted that much of the night was spent by him in writing; and now he could write all night. The romance of his earlier years revived, and he transcribed from an imaginary parchment of the old priest Rowley his \"Excelente Balade of Charitie.\" This poem, disguised in archaic language, he sent to the editor of the ''Town and Country Magazine'', where it was rejected.<ref>Kaplan 173</ref>\n\nMr Cross, a neighbouring [[apothecary]], repeatedly invited him to join him at dinner or supper; but he refused. His landlady also, suspecting his necessity, pressed him to share her dinner, but in vain. \"She knew,\" as she afterwards said, \"that he had not eaten anything for two or three days.\"<ref>quoted in Kroese 559</ref> But he assured her that he was not hungry. The note of his actual receipts, found in his pocket-book after his death, shows that Hamilton, Fell and other editors who had been so liberal in flattery, had paid him at the rate of a shilling for an article, and less than eightpence each for his songs; much which had been accepted was held in reserve and still unpaid for. According to his foster-mother, he had wished to study medicine with Barrett, and in his desperation he wrote to Barrett for a letter to help him to an opening as a surgeon's assistant on board an African trader.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Death ==\nWhile walking along [[St Pancras Old Church|St Pancras Churchyard]], Chatterton much absorbed in thought, took no notice of an open grave, newly dug in his path, and subsequently tumbled into it. His walking companion, upon observing this event, helped Chatterton and told him in a jocular manner that he was happy in assisting at the resurrection of genius. Chatterton replied, \"My dear friend, I have been at war with the grave for some time now.\" Chatterton would commit suicide three days later.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Clinch | first1 = George | title = Marylebone and St. Pancras; their history, celebrities, buildings, and institutions | publisher = Truslove & Shirley | year = 1890 | location = London | pages = 136\u2013137 | url = https://archive.org/stream/marylebonestpanc00clinuoft/marylebonestpanc00clinuoft_djvu.txt | accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref> On 24 August 1770, he retired for the last time to his attic in Brook Street, carrying with him the [[arsenic]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/chatterton.htm |title=Thomas Chatterton |publisher=Poets' Graves |accessdate=16 November 2009 }}</ref> which he drank, after tearing into fragments whatever literary remains were at hand. He was 17 years and nine months old.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} There has been some speculation that Chatterton may have taken the arsenic as a treatment for a venereal disease, as it was commonly used for such at that time. <https://www.news-medical.net/health/History-of-Sexually-Transmitted-Disease.aspx>\n\nA few days later, one Dr Thomas Fry came to London with the intention of giving financial support to the young boy \"whether discoverer or author merely.\"<ref>Meyerstein 450</ref> A fragment, probably one of the last pieces written by the impostor-poet, was put together by Dr Fry from the shreds of paper that covered the floor of Thomas Chatterton's Brook Street attic on the morning of 25 August 1770. The would-have-been patron of the poet had an eye for literary forgeries, and purchased the scraps which the poet's landlady, Mrs Angel, swept into a box, cherishing the hope of discovering a suicide note among the pieces.<ref>Meyerstein 452</ref> This fragment, possibly one of the remnants of Chatterton's very last literary efforts, was identified by Dr Fry to be a modified ending of the poet's tragical interlude ''Aella''.<ref>Meyerstein 452</ref> The fragment is now in the possession of Bristol Public Library and Art Gallery.\n<poem>\nCoernyke.\nAwake!

However, according to Dr Fry, the character who utters the final lines must have been Birtha,<ref>Meyerstein 452-3</ref> whose last word might have been something like \"kisste.\"<ref>'kissed'</ref><ref>Meyerstein 453</ref>\n\n==Posthumous recognition==\nThe death of Chatterton attracted little notice at the time; for the few who then entertained any appreciative estimate of the Rowley poems regarded him as their mere transcriber. He was interred in a burying-ground attached to the [[Workhouse|Shoe Lane Workhouse]] in the parish of [[St Andrew, Holborn]], later the site of [[Farringdon Market]]. There is a discredited story that the body of the poet was recovered, and secretly buried by his uncle, Richard Phillips, in Redcliffe Churchyard. There a monument has been erected to his memory, with the appropriate inscription, borrowed from his \"Will,\" and so supplied by the poet's own pen. \"To the memory of Thomas Chatterton. Reader! judge not. If thou art a Christian, believe that he shall be judged by a Superior Power. To that Power only is he now answerable.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt was after Chatterton's death that the controversy over his work began. ''Poems supposed to have been written at Bristol by Thomas Rowley and others, in the Fifteenth Century'' (1777) was edited by [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]], a Chaucerian scholar who believed them genuine medieval works. However, the appendix to the following year's edition recognises that they were probably Chatterton's own work. [[Thomas Warton]], in his ''[[The History of English Poetry|History of English Poetry]]'' (1778)  included Rowley among 15th-century poets, but apparently did not believe in the antiquity of the poems. In 1782 a new edition of Rowley's poems appeared, with a \"Commentary, in which the antiquity of them is considered and defended,\" by [[Jeremiah Milles]], [[Dean of Exeter]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe controversy which raged round the Rowley poems is discussed in [[Andrew Kippis]], ''[[Biographia Britannica]]'' (vol. iv., 1789), where there is a detailed account by [[George Gregory (British writer)|George Gregory]] of Chatterton's life (pp.&nbsp;573\u2013619). This was reprinted in the edition (1803) of Chatterton's Works by [[Robert Southey]] and [[Joseph Cottle]], published for the benefit of the poet's sister. The neglected condition of the study of earlier English in the 18th century alone accounts for the temporary success of Chatterton's mystification. It has long been agreed that Chatterton was solely responsible for the Rowley poems; the language and style were analysed in confirmation of this view by [[W. W. Skeat]] in an introductory essay prefaced to vol. ii. of ''The Poetical Works of Thomas Chatterton'' (1871) in the \"[[Aldine Edition of the British Poets]].\" The Chatterton manuscripts originally in the possession of [[William Barrett (historian)|William Barrett]] of Bristol were left by his heir to the [[British Museum]] in 1800. Others are preserved in the Bristol library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Legacy==\nChatterton's genius and his death are commemorated by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in ''[[Adonais]]'' (though its main emphasis is the commemoration of [[John Keats|Keats]]), by [[William Wordsworth]] in \"[[Resolution and Independence]]\", by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in \"[[Monody on the Death of Chatterton]]\", by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in \"Five English Poets\", and in John Keats' sonnet \"To Chatterton\". Keats also inscribed ''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]'' \"to the memory of Thomas Chatterton\". Two of [[Alfred de Vigny]]'s works, ''Stello'' and the drama ''Chatterton'', give fictionalized accounts of the poet; in the former, there is a scene in which William Beckford's harsh criticism of Chatterton's work drives the poet to suicide. The three-act play ''Chatterton'' was first performed at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais]], Paris on 12 February 1835. [[Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet|Herbert Croft]], in his ''Love and Madness'', interpolated a long and valuable account of Chatterton, giving many of the poet's letters, and much information obtained from his family and friends (pp.&nbsp;125\u2013244, letter li.).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe most famous image of Chatterton in the 19th century was ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' (1856) by [[Henry Wallis]], now in [[Tate Britain]], London. Two smaller versions, sketches or replicas, are held by the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] and the [[Yale Center for British Art]]. The figure of the poet was modeled by the young [[George Meredith]].\n\nTwo of Chatterton's poems were set to music as [[glee (music)|glees]] by the English composer [[John Wall Callcott]]. These include separate settings of distinct verses within the ''Song to Aelle''. His best known poem, ''O synge untoe mie roundelaie'' was set to a five-part madrigal by [[Samuel Wesley]]. Chatterton has attracted operatic treatment a number of times throughout history, notably [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]]'s largely unsuccessful two-act ''Chatterton''; the German composer [[Matthias Pintscher]]'s modernistic ''Thomas Chatterton''; and Australian composer [[Matthew Dewey]]'s lyrical yet dramatically intricate one-man mythography entitled ''The Death of Thomas Chatterton''.\n\nThere is a collection of \"Chattertoniana\" in the British Library, consisting of works by Chatterton, newspaper cuttings, articles dealing with the Rowley controversy and other subjects, with manuscript notes by Joseph Haslewood, and several autograph letters. [[E. H. W. Meyerstein]], who worked for many years in the manuscript room of the British Museum wrote a definitive work&mdash;\"A Life of Thomas Chatterton\"&mdash;in 1930. [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s 1987 novel ''Chatterton'' was a literary re-telling of the poet's story, giving emphasis to the philosophical and spiritual implications of forgery. In Ackroyd's version, Chatterton's death was accidental.\n\nIn 1886, architect [[Herbert Horne]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] unsuccessfully attempted to have a plaque erected at [[Colston's School]], Bristol. Wilde, who lectured on Chatterton at this time, suggested the inscription: \"To the Memory of Thomas Chatterton, One of England's Greatest Poets, and Sometime pupil at this school.\"<ref>Hart-Davis, Rupert ed.

He was an influence on [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artists of the period such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]].\n\nAlthough fatherless and raised in poverty, he was an exceptionally studious child, publishing mature work by the age of 11. He was able to [[literary forgery|pass off his work]] as that of an imaginary 15th-century poet called Thomas Rowley, chiefly because few people at the time were familiar with medieval poetry, though he was denounced by [[Horace Walpole]]. \n\nAt 17, he sought outlets for his political writings in London, having impressed the Lord Mayor, [[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]], and the radical leader [[John Wilkes]], but his earnings were not enough to keep him, and he poisoned himself in despair. His unusual life and death attracted much interest among the romantic poets, and [[Alfred de Vigny]] wrote a play about him that is still performed today. The oil painting ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' by Pre-Raphaelite artist [[Henry Wallis]] has enjoyed lasting fame.\n\n==Childhood==\nChatterton was born in [[Bristol]] where the office of [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] of [[St Mary Redcliffe]] had long been held by the Chatterton family. The poet's father, also named Thomas Chatterton, was a musician, a poet, a [[numismatics|numismatist]], and a dabbler in the [[occult]]. He had been a [[Succentor|sub-chanter]] at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and master of the Pyle Street free school, near Redcliffe church.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:Chatterton house Bristol.jpg|thumb|left|The wall at the right of the house where Chatterton was raised is that of the {{circa|1739}} school where Chatterton's father was master. The school was demolished in 1939 to widen Pile Street into Redcliff Way, but the fa\u00e7ade was rebuilt on the line of the former back wall.]]\nAfter Chatterton's birth (15 weeks after his father's death on 7 August 1752),<ref>[[s:Chatterton, Thomas (DNB00)|Wikisource]]. Retrieved 14 March 2014</ref> his mother established a girls' school and took in sewing and ornamental needlework. Chatterton was admitted to [[Edward Colston]]'s Charity, a Bristol [[charity school]], in which the curriculum was limited to reading, writing, arithmetic and the [[catechism]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nChatterton, however, was always fascinated with his uncle the sexton and the church of St Mary Redcliffe. The knights, ecclesiastics and civic dignitaries on its [[altar tomb]]s became familiar to him. Then he found a fresh interest in oaken chests in the [[muniment]] room over the porch on the north side of the [[nave]], where parchment deeds, old as the [[Wars of the Roses]], lay forgotten. Chatterton learned his first letters from the illuminated capitals of an old musical folio, and he learned to read out of a black-letter Bible. His sister said he did not like reading out of small books. Wayward from his earliest years, and uninterested in the games of other children, he was thought to be educationally backward. His sister related that on being asked what device he would like painted on a bowl that was to be his, he replied, \"Paint me an angel, with wings, and a trumpet, to trumpet my name over the world.\"<ref>Kaplan 22</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFrom his earliest years, he was liable to fits of abstraction, sitting for hours in what seemed like a trance, or crying for no reason. His lonely circumstances helped foster his natural reserve, and to create the love of mystery which exercised such an influence on the development of his poetry. When Chatterton was age 6, his mother began to recognise his capacity; at age 8, he was so eager for books that he would read and write all day long if undisturbed; by the age of 11, he had become a contributor to [[Felix Farley]]'s ''[[Bristol Journal]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis [[confirmation]] inspired him to write some religious poems published in that paper. In 1763, a cross which had adorned the churchyard of St Mary Redcliffe for upwards of three centuries was destroyed by a churchwarden. The spirit of veneration was strong in Chatterton, and he sent to the local journal on 7 January 1764 a satire on the parish vandal. He also liked to lock himself in a little attic which he had appropriated as his study; and there, with books, cherished parchments, loot purloined from the muniment room of St Mary Redcliffe, and drawing materials, the child lived in thought with his 15th-century heroes and heroines.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==First \"medieval\" works==\nThe first of his literary mysteries, the [[dialogue]] of \"Elinoure and Juga,\" was written before he was 12, and he showed it to Thomas Phillips, the usher at the boarding school [[Colston's School|Colston's Hospital]] where he was a pupil, pretending it was the work of a 15th-century poet. Chatterton remained a boarder at Colston's Hospital for more than six years, and it was only his uncle who encouraged the pupils to write. Three of Chatterton's companions are named as youths whom Phillips's taste for poetry stimulated to rivalry; but Chatterton told no one about his own more daring literary adventures. His little pocket-money was spent on borrowing books from a [[circulating library]]; and he ingratiated himself with book collectors, in order to obtain access to [[John Weever]], [[William Dugdale]] and [[Arthur Collins (antiquarian)|Arthur Collins]], as well as to [[Thomas Speght]]'s edition of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] and other books.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} At some point he came across [[Elizabeth Cooper (dramatist)|Elizabeth Cooper's]] anthology of verse, which is said to have been a major source for his inventions.<ref>Yvonne Noble, \u2018Cooper, Elizabeth (b. in or before 1698, d. 1761?)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6217, accessed 11 Nov 2014]</ref>\n\nChatterton's \"[[:wikt:Rowleian|Rowleian]]\" jargon appears to have been chiefly the result of the study of [[John Kersey]]'s ''[[Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum]]'', and it seems his knowledge even of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] was very slight. His holidays were mostly spent at his mother's house, and much of them in the favourite retreat of his attic study there. He lived for the most part in an ideal world of his own, in the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], during the mid-[[15th century]], when the great Bristol merchant [[William II Canynges]] (d.1474), five times mayor of Bristol, patron and rebuilder of St Mary Redcliffe \"still ruled in Bristol's civic chair.\" Canynges was familiar to him from his recumbent effigy in Redcliffe church, and is represented by Chatterton as an enlightened patron of art and literature.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Adopts ''persona'' of Thomas Rowley==\nChatterton soon conceived the romance of Thomas Rowley, an imaginary monk of the 15th century, and adopted for himself the pseudonym Thomas Rowley for poetry and history. According to [[psychoanalyst]] Louise J. Kaplan, his being fatherless played a great role in his imposturous creation of Rowley.<ref>Kaplan 21</ref> The development of his masculine identity was held back by the fact that he was raised by two women: his mother Sarah and his sister Mary. Therefore, \"to reconstitute the lost father in fantasy,\"<ref>Kaplan 100</ref> he unconsciously created \"two interweaving family romances [fantasies], each with its own scenario.\"<ref>Kaplan 25</ref> The first of these was the romance of Rowley for whom he created a fatherlike, wealthy patron, William Canynge, while the second was as Kaplan named it his romance of \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]].\" He imagined he would become a famous poet who by his talents would be able to rescue his mother from poverty.<ref>Kaplan 23</ref>\n\n==Chatterton\u2019s search for a patron==\nTo bring his hopes to life, Chatterton started to look for a patron. At first, he was trying to do so in Bristol where he became acquainted with [[William Barrett (antiquarian)|William Barrett]], George Catcott and Henry Burgum. He assisted them by providing Rowley transcripts for their work. The antiquary William Barrett relied exclusively on these fake transcripts when writing his ''[[History and Antiquities of Bristol]]'' (1789) which became an enormous failure.<ref>Kaplan 247</ref> But since his Bristol patrons were not willing to pay him enough, he turned to the wealthier [[Horace Walpole]].<ref>Kaplan 90</ref> In 1769, Chatterton sent specimens of Rowley's poetry and \"The Ryse of Peyncteynge yn Englade\"<ref>Meyerstein 254-5</ref> to Walpole who offered to print them \"if they have never been printed.\"<ref>Walpole\u2019s letter to Chatterton dated 28 March 1769 quoted in Meyerstein, 256-7</ref> Later, however, finding that Chatterton was only 16 and that the alleged Rowley pieces might have been forgeries, he scornfully sent him away.<ref>Meyerstein 262</ref>\n\n==Political writings==\nBadly hurt by Walpole's snub, Chatterton wrote very little for a summer. Then, after the end of the summer, he turned his attention to periodical literature and politics, and exchanged Farley's ''Bristol Journal'' for the ''[[Town and Country Magazine]]'' and other London periodicals. Assuming the vein of the pseudonymous letter writer [[Junius]], then in the full blaze of his triumph, he turned his pen against the [[Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], the [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Earl of Bute]] and [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]], the [[Princess of Wales]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Leaving Bristol==\nHe had just dispatched one of his political diatribes to the ''Middlesex Journal'' when he sat down on Easter Eve, 17 April 1770, and penned his \"Last Will and Testament,\" a satirical compound of jest and earnest, in which he intimated his intention of ending his life the following evening. Among his satirical bequests, such as his \"humility\" to the Rev. Mr Camplin, his \"religion\" to Dean Barton, and his \"modesty\" along with his \"prosody and grammar\" to Mr Burgum, he leaves \"to Bristol all his spirit and disinterestedness, parcels of goods unknown on its quay since the days of Canynge and Rowley.\"<ref>Chatterton\u2019s Last Will and Testament quoted in Meyerstein 342</ref> In more genuine earnestness, he recalls the name of Michael Clayfield, a friend to whom he owed intelligent sympathy. The will was possibly prepared in order to frighten his master into letting him go. If so, it had the desired effect. John Lambert, the attorney to whom he was apprenticed, cancelled his indentures; his friends and acquaintances having donated money, Chatterton went to London.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==London==\n[[File:Thomas Chatterton.jpg|thumb|''Chatterton's Holiday Afternoon'' engraved by William Ridgway, after W.B. Morris, pub. 1875]]\nChatterton already was known to the readers of the ''Middlesex Journal'' as a rival of Junius under the [[Pen name|nom de plume]] of Decimus. He also had been a contributor to ''Hamilton's Town and Country Magazine'', and speedily found access to the ''Freeholder's Magazine'', another political miscellany supportive of [[John Wilkes]] and liberty. His contributions were accepted, but the editors paid little or nothing for them.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe wrote hopefully to his mother and sister, and spent his first earnings in buying gifts for them. Wilkes had noted his trenchant style \"and expressed a desire to know the author\";<ref>Chatterton\u2019s letter to his mother dated 6 May 1770 quoted in Meyerstein 360</ref> and [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] [[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]] graciously acknowledged a political address of his, and greeted him \"as politely as a citizen could.\"<ref>Chatterton\u2019s letter to his sister dated 30 May 1770 quoted in Meyerstein 372</ref> He was [[:wikt:abstemious|abstemious]] and extraordinarily diligent. He could assume the style of Junius or [[Tobias Smollett]], reproduce the satiric bitterness of [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], parody [[James Macpherson]]'s ''[[Ossian]]'', or write in the manner of [[Alexander Pope]] or with the polished grace of [[Thomas Gray]] and [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe wrote political letters, [[eclogue]]s, lyrics, operas and satires, both in prose and verse. In June 1770, after nine weeks in London, he moved from [[Shoreditch]], where he had lodged with a relative, to an attic in Brook Street, [[Holborn]] (now beneath [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s [[Holborn Bars]] building). He was still short of money; and now state prosecutions of the press rendered letters in the Junius vein no longer admissible, and threw him back on the lighter resources of his pen. In Shoreditch, he had shared a room; but now, for the first time, he enjoyed uninterrupted solitude. His bed-fellow at Mr Walmsley's, Shoreditch, noted that much of the night was spent by him in writing; and now he could write all night. The romance of his earlier years revived, and he transcribed from an imaginary parchment of the old priest Rowley his \"Excelente Balade of Charitie.\" This poem, disguised in archaic language, he sent to the editor of the ''Town and Country Magazine'', where it was rejected.<ref>Kaplan 173</ref>\n\nMr Cross, a neighbouring [[apothecary]], repeatedly invited him to join him at dinner or supper; but he refused. His landlady also, suspecting his necessity, pressed him to share her dinner, but in vain. \"She knew,\" as she afterwards said, \"that he had not eaten anything for two or three days.\"<ref>quoted in Kroese 559</ref> But he assured her that he was not hungry. The note of his actual receipts, found in his pocket-book after his death, shows that Hamilton, Fell and other editors who had been so liberal in flattery, had paid him at the rate of a shilling for an article, and less than eightpence each for his songs; much which had been accepted was held in reserve and still unpaid for. According to his foster-mother, he had wished to study medicine with Barrett, and in his desperation he wrote to Barrett for a letter to help him to an opening as a surgeon's assistant on board an African trader.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Death ==\nWhile walking along [[St Pancras Old Church|St Pancras Churchyard]], Chatterton much absorbed in thought, took no notice of an open grave, newly dug in his path, and subsequently tumbled into it. His walking companion, upon observing this event, helped Chatterton and told him in a jocular manner that he was happy in assisting at the resurrection of genius. Chatterton replied, \"My dear friend, I have been at war with the grave for some time now.\" Chatterton would commit suicide three days later.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Clinch | first1 = George | title = Marylebone and St. Pancras; their history, celebrities, buildings, and institutions | publisher = Truslove & Shirley | year = 1890 | location = London | pages = 136\u2013137 | url = https://archive.org/stream/marylebonestpanc00clinuoft/marylebonestpanc00clinuoft_djvu.txt | accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref> On 24 August 1770, he retired for the last time to his attic in Brook Street, carrying with him the [[arsenic]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/chatterton.htm |title=Thomas Chatterton |publisher=Poets' Graves |accessdate=16 November 2009 }}</ref> which he drank, after tearing into fragments whatever literary remains were at hand. He was 17 years and nine months old.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nA few days later, one Dr Thomas Fry came to London with the intention of giving financial support to the young boy \"whether discoverer or author merely.\"<ref>Meyerstein 450</ref> A fragment, probably one of the last pieces written by the impostor-poet, was put together by Dr Fry from the shreds of paper that covered the floor of Thomas Chatterton's Brook Street attic on the morning of 25 August 1770. The would-have-been patron of the poet had an eye for literary forgeries, and purchased the scraps which the poet's landlady, Mrs Angel, swept into a box, cherishing the hope of discovering a suicide note among the pieces.<ref>Meyerstein 452</ref> This fragment, possibly one of the remnants of Chatterton's very last literary efforts, was identified by Dr Fry to be a modified ending of the poet's tragical interlude ''Aella''.<ref>Meyerstein 452</ref> The fragment is now in the possession of Bristol Public Library and Art Gallery.\n<poem>\nCoernyke.\nAwake!

However, according to Dr Fry, the character who utters the final lines must have been Birtha,<ref>Meyerstein 452-3</ref> whose last word might have been something like \"kisste.\"<ref>'kissed'</ref><ref>Meyerstein 453</ref>\n\n==Posthumous recognition==\nThe death of Chatterton attracted little notice at the time; for the few who then entertained any appreciative estimate of the Rowley poems regarded him as their mere transcriber. He was interred in a burying-ground attached to the [[Workhouse|Shoe Lane Workhouse]] in the parish of [[St Andrew, Holborn]], later the site of [[Farringdon Market]]. There is a discredited story that the body of the poet was recovered, and secretly buried by his uncle, Richard Phillips, in Redcliffe Churchyard. There a monument has been erected to his memory, with the appropriate inscription, borrowed from his \"Will,\" and so supplied by the poet's own pen. \"To the memory of Thomas Chatterton. Reader! judge not. If thou art a Christian, believe that he shall be judged by a Superior Power. To that Power only is he now answerable.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt was after Chatterton's death that the controversy over his work began. ''Poems supposed to have been written at Bristol by Thomas Rowley and others, in the Fifteenth Century'' (1777) was edited by [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]], a Chaucerian scholar who believed them genuine medieval works. However, the appendix to the following year's edition recognises that they were probably Chatterton's own work. [[Thomas Warton]], in his ''[[The History of English Poetry|History of English Poetry]]'' (1778)  included Rowley among 15th-century poets, but apparently did not believe in the antiquity of the poems. In 1782 a new edition of Rowley's poems appeared, with a \"Commentary, in which the antiquity of them is considered and defended,\" by [[Jeremiah Milles]], [[Dean of Exeter]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe controversy which raged round the Rowley poems is discussed in [[Andrew Kippis]], ''[[Biographia Britannica]]'' (vol. iv., 1789), where there is a detailed account by [[George Gregory (British writer)|George Gregory]] of Chatterton's life (pp.&nbsp;573\u2013619). This was reprinted in the edition (1803) of Chatterton's Works by [[Robert Southey]] and [[Joseph Cottle]], published for the benefit of the poet's sister. The neglected condition of the study of earlier English in the 18th century alone accounts for the temporary success of Chatterton's mystification. It has long been agreed that Chatterton was solely responsible for the Rowley poems; the language and style were analysed in confirmation of this view by [[W. W. Skeat]] in an introductory essay prefaced to vol. ii. of ''The Poetical Works of Thomas Chatterton'' (1871) in the \"[[Aldine Edition of the British Poets]].\" The Chatterton manuscripts originally in the possession of [[William Barrett (historian)|William Barrett]] of Bristol were left by his heir to the [[British Museum]] in 1800. Others are preserved in the Bristol library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Legacy==\nChatterton's genius and his death are commemorated by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in ''[[Adonais]]'' (though its main emphasis is the commemoration of [[John Keats|Keats]]), by [[William Wordsworth]] in \"[[Resolution and Independence]]\", by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in \"[[Monody on the Death of Chatterton]]\", by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in \"Five English Poets\", and in John Keats' sonnet \"To Chatterton\". Keats also inscribed ''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]'' \"to the memory of Thomas Chatterton\". Two of [[Alfred de Vigny]]'s works, ''Stello'' and the drama ''Chatterton'', give fictionalized accounts of the poet; in the former, there is a scene in which William Beckford's harsh criticism of Chatterton's work drives the poet to suicide. The three-act play ''Chatterton'' was first performed at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais]], Paris on 12 February 1835. [[Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet|Herbert Croft]], in his ''Love and Madness'', interpolated a long and valuable account of Chatterton, giving many of the poet's letters, and much information obtained from his family and friends (pp.&nbsp;125\u2013244, letter li.).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe most famous image of Chatterton in the 19th century was ''[[The Death of Chatterton]]'' (1856) by [[Henry Wallis]], now in [[Tate Britain]], London. Two smaller versions, sketches or replicas, are held by the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] and the [[Yale Center for British Art]]. The figure of the poet was modeled by the young [[George Meredith]].\n\nTwo of Chatterton's poems were set to music as [[glee (music)|glees]] by the English composer [[John Wall Callcott]]. These include separate settings of distinct verses within the ''Song to Aelle''. His best known poem, ''O synge untoe mie roundelaie'' was set to a five-part madrigal by [[Samuel Wesley]]. Chatterton has attracted operatic treatment a number of times throughout history, notably [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]]'s largely unsuccessful two-act ''Chatterton''; the German composer [[Matthias Pintscher]]'s modernistic ''Thomas Chatterton''; and Australian composer [[Matthew Dewey]]'s lyrical yet dramatically intricate one-man mythography entitled ''The Death of Thomas Chatterton''.\n\nThere is a collection of \"Chattertoniana\" in the British Library, consisting of works by Chatterton, newspaper cuttings, articles dealing with the Rowley controversy and other subjects, with manuscript notes by Joseph Haslewood, and several autograph letters. [[E. H. W. Meyerstein]], who worked for many years in the manuscript room of the British Museum wrote a definitive work&mdash;\"A Life of Thomas Chatterton\"&mdash;in 1930. [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s 1987 novel ''Chatterton'' was a literary re-telling of the poet's story, giving emphasis to the philosophical and spiritual implications of forgery. In Ackroyd's version, Chatterton's death was accidental.\n\nIn 1886, architect [[Herbert Horne]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] unsuccessfully attempted to have a plaque erected at [[Colston's School]], Bristol. Wilde, who lectured on Chatterton at this time, suggested the inscription: \"To the Memory of Thomas Chatterton, One of England's Greatest Poets, and Sometime pupil at this school.\"<ref>Hart-Davis, Rupert ed. ''Selected Letters of Oscar Wilde'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979. p66-67.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, a plaque in memory of Chatterton was mounted on 39, Brooke Street, Holborn, bearing the inscription below.<ref>Wright, GW.

When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th-century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125154530/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=25 Nov 2017 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=\"royal\">{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/john-conway-11257/|title=John Conway|last=|first=|date=|website=The Royal Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992, was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th-century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125154530/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=25 Nov 2017 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=\"royal\">{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/john-conway-11257/|title=John Conway|last=|first=|date=|website=The Royal Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992, was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.
