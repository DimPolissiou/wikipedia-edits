In the [[Paleozoic]] clastic and volcanoclastic [[sediments]] deposited in the area, but later during [[Hercynian orogeny]], sediments were metamorphosed in the [[greenschist]] and [[amphibolite facies]] (forming large amount of [[paragneiss]]es and [[amphibolite]]s, only locally [[orthogneiss]]es, [[phyllite]]s and [[mica schist]]s). Regional and contact metamorphism was induced also by [[intrusion]]s of [[granite]]s, which accompanied the Hercynian collision (generally in the [[Carboniferous]]). Basement rocks were later exposed due to [[erosion]] and at the end of the Paleozoic affected by marine [[Transgression (geology)|transgression]] that lasted till the end of [[Mesozoic]]. During this period [[sedimentary rocks]], known as [[Tatric cover units]], deposited. They generally consists of [[Clastic rock|clastic]] and [[carbonate rock]]s.\n\n[[Image:Jadrove pohorie.png|thumb|left|Schematic cross section through the core mountain:\n{{legend|#ffc010|[[Gossau grup|Cretaceous]] and [[Inner Carpathian Paleogene|Paleogene]] sedimentary cover}}\n{{legend|#888888|[[Subtatric Nappes]]}}\n{{legend|#363636|[[Tatric cover units]]}}\n{{legend|#DA70D6|[[Tatric|Crystalline basement]]}}]]\n\nIn the [[Upper Cretaceous]] area of [[Tatric]] Unit, was affected by [[Eo-Alpine phase|Eo-Alpine]] of [[Alpine Orogeny]], that caused movement of large masses of rocks to the North and Northeast. To the South of the Tatric area a 2 superficial [[nappe]]s, so called [[Subtatric Nappes]], were detached and thrust over the Tatric. These nappes are generally composed of [[limestone]], [[marl]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and less by [[sandstone]]s and [[slate]]s. The lower nappes is called [[Kr\u00ed\u017ena Nappe]] (or the [[Fatric]]) and the upper is [[Cho\u010d Nappe]] (or the [[Hronic]]). Kr\u00ed\u017e\u0148a Nappe is dominantly composed of rock, that were formed in the Zliechov basin. It was situated in the Fatric area between the [[Tatric]] and [[Veporic]] units. Fatric had the same basement as the Veporic unit and is considered as former northern part of Veporic, but later during the thrusting its substratum was consumed and subducted. Surface occurrences of Fatric basement remained only as a remnants in the northern part of Veporic [[Ve\u013ek\u00fd Bok Unit]] and few other areas. Cho\u010d Nappe, was thrust from the southern area, but its roots were probably consumed entirely, so its paleogeographic position is not exactly known. Cho\u010d Nappe is considered as rootless nappe.\n\nAfter the end of main Eo-Alpine orogenic movement, the area of Western Carpathians was still not so mountainous. In the [[Paleogene]] subsidence along the normal faults caused formation of [[graben]]s - intra-mountain [[Inner Carpathian Paleogene Basin]] and [[Horst (geology)|horsts]] present day mountain ranges. In the Neogene, further orogene movement in the external part of Carpathian arc caused formation of [[back-arc basin|back-arc]] [[Pannonian Basin]]. Northern branches of Pannonian Basin were penetrating the Tatra-Fatra Area and formed inter-mountain basins. Simultaneously with the immersion of the horsts, ongoing and intense erosion is denuding the mountains and supplies the basin with clastic sediments. Among all of the rocks, the most erosion resistant were the crystalline schists and granites of the Tatric. Similar fold and thrust model of origin is known from the other areas of alpine system. In the [[English language|English]] terminology, similar model is called [[Fault-block mountain]], it is typical in the area of [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commons category}}\n{{Carpathian Mountains}}\n\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of the Western Carpathians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox mountain range\n<!-- *** Heading *** -->\n| name              = Fatra-Tatra\n| native_name       = \n| other_name        = \n<!-- *** Image *** -->\n| photo             = Jahnaci stit over Velke Biele pleso.jpg\n| photo_caption     = Kolov\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt and Jah\u0148ac\u00ed \u0161t\u00edt over Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Biele Pleso\n<!-- *** Name *** -->\n| etymology         = \n| nickname          = \n<!-- *** Country etc. *** -->\n| country           = Slovakia\n| country1          = Austria\n| country2          = Poland\n| state             = \n| region            = \n| district          = \n<!-- *** Family *** -->\n| parent            = Inner Western Carpathians\n| border            = \n| part_type         = Subdivisions\n| part              = [[Branisko (mountain range)|Branisko]]\n| part1             = Cho\u010d Mountains\n| part2             = Greater Fatra\n| part3             = Horehronsk\u00e9 podolie\n| part4             = Horn\u00e1d Basin\n| part5             = Kozie chrbty\n| part6             = Lesser Fatra\n| part7             = Little Carpathians\n| part8             = Low Tatras\n| part9             = Pova\u017esk\u00fd Inovec\n| part10            = Star\u00e9 Hory Mountains\n| part11            = Str\u00e1\u017eov Mountains\n| part12            = Sub-Tatra Basin\n| part13            = S\u00fa\u013eov Mountains\n| part14            = Tatras\n| part15            = Tr\u00edbe\u010d\n| part16            = Turiec Basin\n| part17            = Upper Nitra Basin\n| part18            = \u017dilina Basin\n| part19            = \u017diar\n<!-- *** Locations *** -->\n| highest           = Gerlachovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt\n| elevation_m = 2655\n| coordinates       = {{coord|49|10|N|20|8|E|type:mountain_scale:100000|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| map               = Slovakia \n| map_caption       = Location of the Fatra-Tatra Area in Slovakia\n<!-- Processed by Geoboxer 3.0 on 2007-11-01T21:18:37+01:00 --> }}\nThe '''Fatra-Tatra Area''' (in geomorphology)<ref>Maz\u00far, E., Lukni\u0161, M. 1986: ''Geomorfologick\u00e9 \u010dlenenie SSR a \u010cSSR. \u010cas\u0165 Slovensko.''

For example, in Japan, for historical reasons, the northern part of the country operates on 50 Hz, but the southern part uses 60 Hz. That makes it impossible to form a single synchronous network, which was problematic when the [[Fukushima Daiichi]] plant melted down.\n\nAlso, even when the networks have compatible standards, failure modes can be problematic. Phase and current limitations can be reached, which can cause widespread outages. The issues are sometimes solved by adding HVDC links within the network to permit greater control during off-nominal events.\n\nAs was discovered in the [[California electricity crisis]], there can be strong incentives among some market traders to create deliberate congestion and poor management of generation capacity on an interconnection network to inflate prices. Increasing transmission capacity and expanding the market by uniting with neighboring synchronous networks make such manipulations more difficult.\n\n===Frequency===\n\nAn entire synchronous grid runs at the same frequency. Where interconnection to a neighboring grid, operating at a different frequency, is required, a frequency converter is required. [[High voltage direct current]], [[solid-state transformer]] or [[variable-frequency transformer]]s links can connect two grids that operate at different frequencies or that are not maintaining synchronism.\n\nIn a synchronous grid all the generators must run at the same [[Utility frequency|frequency]], and must stay very nearly in phase with each other and the grid. For rotating generators, a local [[Governor (device)|governor]] regulates the driving torque, maintaining constant speed as loading changes. [[Droop speed control]] ensures that multiple parallel generators share load changes in proportion to their rating.   Generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid, because energy is consumed as it is produced.  Energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators.\n\nSmall deviations from the nominal system frequency are very important in regulating individual generators and assessing the equilibrium of the grid as a whole. When the grid is heavily loaded, the frequency slows, and governors adjust their generators so that more power is output ([[droop speed control]]). When the grid is lightly loaded the grid frequency runs above the nominal frequency, and this is taken as an indication by [[Automatic Generation Control]] systems across the network that generators should reduce their output.\n\nIn addition, there's often central control, which can change the parameters of the AGC systems over timescales of a minute or longer to further adjust the regional network flows and the operating frequency of the grid.\n\n===Timekeeping===\nFor timekeeping purposes, over the course of a day the operating frequency will be varied so as to balance out deviations and to prevent line-operated clocks from gaining or losing significant time by ensuring there are 4.32 million on 50\u00a0Hz, and 5.184 million cycles on 60 Hz systems each day.\n\nThis can, rarely, lead to problems. In 2018 [[Kosovo]] used more power than it generated due to a row with [[Serbia]], leading to the phase in the whole [[synchronous grid of Continental Europe]] lagging behind what it should have been. The frequency dropped to 49.996 Hz. Over time, this caused [[synchronous electric clock]]s to become six minutes slow until the disagreement was resolved.<ref>{{cite news |title=Serbia, Kosovo power grid row delays European clocks |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/serbia-kosovo-energy/serbia-kosovo-power-grid-row-delays-european-clocks-idUSL5N1QP2FF |agency=Reuters |date=Mar 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===DC interconnection===\n[[High-voltage direct current]] lines, [[solid-state transformer]]s or [[variable-frequency transformer]]s can be used to connect two alternating current interconnection networks which are not necessarily synchronized with each other.  This provides the benefit of interconnection without the need to synchronize an even wider area.  For example, compare the wide area synchronous grid map of Europe (above left) with the map of HVDC lines (below right). Solid state transformers have larger losses than conventional transformers, but DC lines lack reactive impedance and overall HVDC lines have lower losses sending power over long distances within a synchronous grid, or between them.\n\n==Deployed networks==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
