He was born in Toronto and raised in the [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] section of [[New York City]]. Chong is internationally recognized as a director, and a creator of interdisciplinary theater work. He is an early pioneer of interdisciplinary theater and the integration of media into it. Chong is considered a seminal figure in Asian American theater and the [[Asian American]] arts movement. His brother, Xin Ping Chong, is an investor who owns Ghizhou Toro, Chineses football team, and owns part of Huawei.\n\n==Career and Works==\nOriginally trained as a visual artist and filmmaker at the [[School of Visual Arts]] and [[Pratt Institute]], Chong studied dance/performance with Meredith Monk and began his theatrical career as a member of [[Meredith Monk]]'s company, The House in 1971. Chong was both a performer and collaborator in Monk's company. His co-created work include ''The Travelogue Series: Paris 1972'', ''Chacon 1974'', and ''Venice/Milan 1976''. His final collaboration with Monk was ''The Games'' 1983 which premiered at the Schaubuhne in Berlin, West Germany. He created his first independent theatre work, ''Lazarus'' in 1972. In this very 1st work Chong's interest in an interdisciplinary approach to theater as a guiding principal is apparent. His roots are in the visual arts, in film, in dance and in the Chinese Opera (both his grandfather and father were director/librettists). Central to Ping Chong's work is the theme of Otherness. As a non-white, immigrant and an artist growing up in a highly segregated NYC and white art world it is no surprise that this theme proved central to his work. In the earliest works such as ''Lazarus'' (1972), ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/fear-and-loathing-in-gotham/ Fear and Loathing in Gotham]'' (1975), and ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/humboldts-current/ Humboldt's Current]'' (1977), the theme of Otherness reflected Chong's personal sense of estrangement from the society he grew up in as a first generation immigrant. Later the theme of Otherness became more universal, encompassing a broader range of material.Many of Chong's works concern colonialism and the collision of cultures and/or issues of cultural diversity, and frequently draw on documentary and interview-based materials (as in the ''Undesirable Elements'' series.) \n\n[http://www.pingchong.org/ Ping Chong + Company] (originally called The Fiji Theatre Company) was founded in 1975. The company's mission is \"to explore the meaning of contemporary theatre and art on a national and international level,\" and \"to create and tour innovative multi-disciplinary works of theater and art, which explore the intersections of history, race, art and technology in the modern world.\" The company has created and toured more than 100 works by Chong and his collaborators, which have been presented at major theaters, performing arts centers, and arts festivals around the world. \n\nKey works in Chong's evolution in chronological order include ''Humboldt's Current'' (1977) from his first decade. It is an early work anticipating Chong's interest in geopolitical,and historical subjects. It received an [[Obie award]]. In 1980 Ping Chong formed a small ensemble and it is with this group of performers which includes, Jeannie Hutchins, Louise Smith, John Fleming, and Brian Hallas that he evolved his performance style. ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/am-am-the-articulated-man/ A.M./A.M - The Articulated Man]'' (1981) marked Chong's full bloom interest in evolving a choreographic, non-literary kind of theater. This, The 2nd decade of Ping Chong's works include 3 major works back to back. ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/nosferatu-a-symphony-of-darkness/ Nosferatu, A Symphony of Darkness]'' (1985), a work straddling the allegorical with Chong's increasing interest in art as activism. This was followed by another dance/theater work ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/angels-of-swedenborg/ Angels of Swedenborg]'' (1985) and ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/kind-ness/ Kind Ness]'' (1986), two very different works though nevertheless informed by a strong physicality. Both works speak to in very different ways, Chong's lifelong engagement with the profound issue of Otherness. ''Kind Ness'' was the recipient of an USA Playwright's Award in 1988. The 1990s, marked major changes and innovations in Ping Chong's work. It is at this time that he disbanded his decade old ensemble in order to explore new directions and collaborations. While the works of the early decades were devised, Chong would have a much more active role in writing new work often in collaboration with a partner. From 1990 with the ''East/West Quartet'': ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/deshima/ Deshima]'' (1990), ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/chinoiserie/ Chinoiserie]'' (1996), ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/after-sorrow/ After Sorrow]'' (1997), ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/pojagi/ Pojagi]'' (1999) and in 1992 with the launch of the Undesirable Elements series the work took a 180 degree turn toward poetic documentary and historical subjects. The exception to this are the puppet theater works beginning with ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/kwaidan/ Kwaidan]'' (1998) which largely nods toward Chong's earlier allegorical works.\n\nPing Chong's early interest in puppetry starting with ''Lazarus'' in 1972 was given full expression in the creation of large scale productions of puppet theatre works including, ''Kwaidan'' (1998) which received Unima-USA's Citation of Excellence in the Art of Puppetry, ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/obon/ Obon: Tales of Rain and Moonlight]'' (2002), the sequel to ''Kwaidan'', and ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/cathay-three-tales-of-china/ Cathay: Three Tales of China]'' (2005), ''Kwaidan'' and ''Obon'' were both based on Kwaidan, Japanese ghost stories collected and adapted by Lafcadio Hearn. ''Cathay'', commission by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was set in China and used three interconnected stories to explore three eras of Chinese history: the Tang Dynasty, the Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion during World War II, and contemporary China today. ''Cathay'' was named one of the Top 10 Shows of the 2005-2006 Season by NY Theatre Wire, and was awarded three Henry Hewes Awards for achievement in theatrical design.\n\nSince 1992, Chong and his collaborators has created over 70 works in the ''[http://www.pingchong.org/undesirable-elements/ Undesirable Elements]'' project, an ongoing series of oral-history theater works exploring issues of race, culture, and identity in the lives of individuals in specific communities. The development process includes an extended residency and rehearsal period during which Ping Chong and collaborators conduct intensive interviews with potential participants who are not generally performers, from the local community. These interviews then form the basis of a script, performed by the interviewees, that covers the historical and personal narratives of individuals who are in some way living between two cultures. Chong has often described the series as, \"Seated operas for the spoken word.\" One of the most recent entries in the series is ''Beyond Sacred: Voices of Muslim Identity'' which started touring in 2016. Beyond Sacred is an interview-based theatre production exploring the diverse experiences of Muslim communities in the United States. The five cast members of Beyond Sacred vary in many ways, but share the common experience of coming of age in a post-9/11 New York City, at a time of increasing Islamophobia. They are young men and women that reflect a wide range of Muslim identities, including those who have converted to Islam, those who were raised Muslim, but have since left the faith, those who identify as \u201cculturally\u201d Muslim, and those who are observant on a daily basis. It stars Tiffany Yasmin Abdelghani, Ferdous Dehqan, Kadin Herring, Amir Khafagy and Maha Syed.<ref>[https://www.bricartsmedia.org/events-performances/beyond-sacred-voices-muslim-identity]</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Chong and dramaturg/director/playwright Talvin Wilks created ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/collidescope/ Collidescope: Adventures in Pre- and Post-Racial America]'' in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate designers and actors in the University of Maryland School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies. Of the work, Chong says, \"In response to the recent killings of Trayvon Martin, shooting of Jordan Davis|Jordan Davis, shooting of Michael Brown and the seemingly endless killings of black men and boys for unarmed offenses, we have designed ''Collidescope'' to be a collision-course view of the legacy and psyche behind this history of racial violence, racism and social injustice in America.\"<ref>Snyder, Sarah.

Primarily an artist of the theater he also, when the opportunity arose created works of video art, pure dance works, and installations. The two dance works are, ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/i-will-not-be-sad-in-this-world/ I Will Not be Sad In This World]'' (1991), ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/collidescope/baldwin-now/ Baldwin/NOW]'' (2016). Video works include the video adaptation of ''I Will Not Be Sad In This World'' (1992) and ''Plage Concrete'' (1988). His installation work includes ''Kind Ness'' not to be confused with his play ''Kind Ness,'' a commission by [[MIT]]'s List Visual Arts Center in its inaugural season in 1985. Another highlight of Chong's installation work was ''Testimonial'' commissioned for the Venice Bienalle.\n\n==Awards and Honors==\nChong is the recipient of numerous awards and honors including, but not limited to the National Medal of Arts, Ford Foundation Art of Change Fellowship, Doris Duke Performing Artist Award, United States Artists Foundation's Prudential Fellowship, Yomiuri Theatrical Award, six NEA Fellowships, two Bessie Awards and two Obie awards.\n\n* 2016 [[Ford Foundation]] Art of Change fellowship <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/news/ford-foundation-awards-25-fellowships-to-us-artists-driving-social-change/|title=Ford Foundation awards 25 fellowships to US artists driving social change|website=Ford Foundation|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref>\n* 2014 [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/news/2015/president-obama-award-2014-national-medals-arts|title=President Obama to Award 2014 National Medals of Arts {{!}} NEA|website=www.arts.gov|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref>\n* 2014 Otto Rene Castillo Award for Political Theater\n* 2013 [[Doris Duke Performing Artist Award]]\n* 2012 [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] Artist's Fellowship (Inter-disciplinary)\n* 2010 [https://www.playshakespeare.com/falstaff-awards/falstaff-awards-2010 Falstaff Award for Best Director and for Best Script Adaptation/Dramaturgy of ''Throne of Blood'']\n* 2008 NYC/Urban Artists Initiative Fellowship\n* 2006 USA Prudential Fellowship of [[United States Artists]] Foundation [http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public/USAFellows2006/USAFellows2006/PingChong/index.cfm]\n* 2006 NY Theatre Wire\u2019s \"Top Ten\" Shows of the 2005-2006 Season for ''Cathay: Three Tales of China''\n* 2003 [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] Artist\u2019s Fellowship (Multidisciplinary/Performance Art)\n* 2002 [[Out Magazine]]\u2019s OUT100 Award\n* 2001 NY Theatre Wire\u2019s \"Top Ten\" Shows of the 2000-2001 Season for ''Secret History''\n* 2000 [[Obie Award]] for Sustained Achievement of Direction\n* 1999 [[Bessie Award]] for Outstanding Creative Achievement for ''SlutForArt''\n* 1999 After Dark Award for ''Undesirable Elements/Chicago''\n* 1999 AMagazine\u2019s A100 Award -

Primarily an artist of the theater he also, when the opportunity arose created works of video art, pure dance works, and installations. The two dance works are, ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/i-will-not-be-sad-in-this-world/ I Will Not be Sad In This World]'' (1991), ''[http://www.pingchong.org/interdisciplinary-performance/production-archive/collidescope/baldwin-now/ Baldwin/NOW]'' (2016). Video works include the video adaptation of ''I Will Not Be Sad In This World'' (1992) and ''Plage Concrete'' (1988). His installation work includes ''Kind Ness'' not to be confused with his play ''Kind Ness,'' a commission by [[MIT]]'s List Visual Arts Center in its inaugural season in 1985. Another highlight of Chong's installation work was ''Testimonial'' commissioned for the Venice Bienalle.\n\n==Awards and Honors==\nChong is the recipient of numerous awards and honors including, but not limited to the National Medal of Arts, Ford Foundation Art of Change Fellowship, Doris Duke Performing Artist Award, United States Artists Foundation's Prudential Fellowship, Yomiuri Theatrical Award, six NEA Fellowships, two Bessie Awards and two Obie awards.\n\n* 2016 [[Ford Foundation]] Art of Change fellowship <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/news/ford-foundation-awards-25-fellowships-to-us-artists-driving-social-change/|title=Ford Foundation awards 25 fellowships to US artists driving social change|website=Ford Foundation|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref>\n* 2014 [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/news/2015/president-obama-award-2014-national-medals-arts|title=President Obama to Award 2014 National Medals of Arts {{!}} NEA|website=www.arts.gov|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref>\n* 2014 Otto Rene Castillo Award for Political Theater\n* 2013 [[Doris Duke Performing Artist Award]]\n* 2012 [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] Artist's Fellowship (Inter-disciplinary)\n* 2010 [https://www.playshakespeare.com/falstaff-awards/falstaff-awards-2010 Falstaff Award for Best Director and for Best Script Adaptation/Dramaturgy of ''Throne of Blood'']\n* 2008 NYC/Urban Artists Initiative Fellowship\n* 2006 USA Prudential Fellowship of [[United States Artists]] Foundation [http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public/USAFellows2006/USAFellows2006/PingChong/index.cfm]\n* 2006 NY Theatre Wire\u2019s \"Top Ten\" Shows of the 2005-2006 Season for ''Cathay: Three Tales of China''\n* 2003 [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] Artist\u2019s Fellowship (Multidisciplinary/Performance Art)\n* 2002 [[Out Magazine]]\u2019s OUT100 Award\n* 2001 NY Theatre Wire\u2019s \"Top Ten\" Shows of the 2000-2001 Season for ''Secret History''\n* 2000 [[Obie Award]] for Sustained Achievement of Direction\n* 1999 [[Bessie Award]] for Outstanding Creative Achievement for ''SlutForArt''\n* 1999 After Dark Award for ''Undesirable Elements/Chicago''\n* 1999 AMagazine\u2019s A100 Award -

These differ a lot from widely quoted ones used by the UK government to track the teenage pregnancy rate, which use the age of the girl at conception, unlike pregnancy statistics in other countries. Using pregnancy statistics by age of girl at the outcome of her pregnancy allows more meaningful comparison with other countries. \n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|width=50%|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Teenage births in England and Wales (numbers & rates)'''<ref>Alison MacFarlane & Miranda Mugford (2000) ''Birth Counts Statistics of Pregnancy & Childbirth-Tables''</ref><ref>Birth Statistics Series FM1 ''Office For National Statistics''</ref>\n\n!

In this version the she-mouse marries the cat and she is usually eaten by the cat at the wedding night, though not always.\n\nOther variants have a third part in which the he-mouse falls into a broth and dies, and even there is a fourth part, in which all the friends of the she-mouse harm themselves somehow describing their actions with a jingle, because they feel sorry for her. Each of these characters increase the seriousness of their self-destructive actions, singing a different jingle, but with parallelisms with the previous one.\n\nThe main character of the story can also have different representations such as a little ant or a little cockroach.\n\n==Origin==\nThis tale seems to have been originated in the oral tradition and later moved to a literary form. Again, its literary form may have given birth to different variations. The earliest reference to this tale is found in [[Fern\u00e1n Caballero]]'s ''L\u00e1grimas'' (1839) and ''La Gaviota'' (1856), but the complete tale is not written until later, in her compilation of tales ''Cuentos, oraciones, adivinanzas y refranes populares'' (1877). In this early version, the little she-mouse is actually a little ant, but she still marries a mouse, called [[Rat\u00f3n P\u00e9rez]].

In fact, the tale is titled ''La Cucarachita Mandinga'' (''Mandinga, the Little Roach'') and ''Mandinga'' is just another name for the [[Mandinka people]]. This leads to believe of some influences from the slaves brought from Africa. The tales of the book became part of the Costa Rican folklore, but the Little Roach is also known in Cuba, Mexico and Panama. In Panama it became even more important as it is an important part of Panamanian folklore after it was turned into a children's theater play by [[Rogelio Sin\u00e1n]] and with music of Gonzalo Brenes.\n\nIn some versions, the cockroach is not ''Mandinga'', but ''Mondinga'' and in the Cuban and Caribbean version it seems to be ''Martina''.

It's also useful in order to teach the little kids about the animals and their different sounds, or to make them participate doing the sounds.

Finally, some sense of danger can be taught to the audience in the first part of the tale, by mentioning objects that can harm them or things they shouldn't play with.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://pacomova.eresmas.net/paginas/R/la_ratita_presumida.htm Version of the tale (in Spanish)]\n*[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/La_hormiguita Fern\u00e1n Caballero's version (in Spanish)]\n*[http://www.guiascostarica.com/panchita/tp07.htm Version of the tale as it appears in ''Cuentos de mi T\u00eda Panchita'' (in Spanish)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060714164000/http://autordelasemana.uchile.cl/caballero/lagaviota.pdf ''La Gaviota'' (in Spanish)]\n*[http://bdigital.binal.ac.pa/bdp/lobo1.pdf ''La Cucarachita Mandinga'', Theater Play by Rogelio Sinan (in Spanish)]\n*[http://www.culturaspopulares.org/textos%20I-1/articulos/Hernandez.pdf ''T\u00f3picos literarios y motivos folcl\u00f3ricos en el cuento popular'']\n*[http://www.pps.k12.or.us/depts-c/mc-me/be-hi-la.pdf ''An Overview of Hispanic Literature with Special Emphasis on the Literature of Hispanics in the United States'']\n*[http://cvc.cervantes.es/obref/aih/pdf/07/aih_07_1_031.pdf ''Cuento Folkl\u00f3rico y Literaturas del Siglo XIX'']\n*[http://lmri.ucsb.edu/pipermail/reformanet/2002-August/009347.html English version of ''Martina the Roach'']{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080106085453/http://pan.intrasun.tcnj.edu/501/projects/Muserlian/LaCucarachita.htm#CucarachSpanish Dual version (Spanish and English) of ''Martina the Roach'']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vain Little Mouse, The}}\n[[Category:American fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Latin American folklore]]\n[[Category:Spanish legendary creatures]]\n[[Category:Spanish fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Fictional mice and rats]]\n[[Category:Spanish folklore]]\n[[Category:Animal tales]]\n[[Category:Female characters in fairy tales]]\n", "name_user": "Jmg38", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOrigin:14-year-old redlink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vain_Little_Mouse"}

The 1870 and 1880 censuses report three older half-siblings, but later interviews with Smith's family and contemporaries contain no mention of them against her siblings.\n\nShe was the daughter of Laura (born Snow) and William Urie, a laborer and part-time [[Baptist]] preacher (he was listed in the 1870 census as a \"minister of the [[gospel]]\", in [[Moulton, Alabama|Moulton, Lawrence County, Alabama]]). He died while his daughter was too young to remember him. By the time Bessie was nine, her mother and a brother had also died. Her older sister Viola took charge of caring for her siblings.<ref name=Albertson2003>Albertson, Chris (2003). ''Bessie'' (rev. expanded ed.).

She sang and danced as he played the guitar. Their favorite location was in front of the White Elephant Saloon at Thirteenth and Elm streets, in the heart of the city's African-American community.\n\nIn 1904, her oldest brother Clarence left home, joining a small traveling troupe owned by [[Moses Stokes]]. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"<ref>Albertson, 2003, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Clarence returned to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and arranged an audition for his sister with the troupe managers, Lonnie and Cora Fisher. She was hired as a dancer rather than a singer, because the company already included the well-known singer [[Ma Rainey]]. Smith eventually moved on to performing in various chorus lines, making the \"81\" Theater in Atlanta her home base. She also performed in shows on the black-owned ([[Theater Owners Booking Association]]) (T.O.B.A.) circuit and became its biggest star after she signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].\n\nSmith's recording career began in 1923.<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books |location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=978-1-85868-255-6}}</ref> Despite her success, neither she nor her music was accepted in all circles. She once auditioned for Black Swan records ([[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was on its board of directors) and was dismissed because she was considered too rough, she supposedly stopped singing to spit.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fact, even her admirers, white and black, considered her a \"rough\" (i.e., working class or even \"low class\") woman. She was then living in Philadelphia, when she met Jack Gee, a security guard, whom she married on June 7, 1923, just as her first record was being released. During the marriage Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car.

In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, [[Gertrude Saunders]], Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce.\n\nSmith later entered a [[common-law marriage]] with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was [[Lionel Hampton]]'s uncle. She stayed with him until her death.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bessiesmith3.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Smith by Carl Van Vechten]]\nAll contemporary accounts indicate that while Rainey did not teach Smith to sing, she probably helped her develop a stage presence.<ref>Albertson, 2003, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Smith began forming her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theater. By 1920, she had established a reputation in the [[American South|South]] and along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nIn 1920, sales of over 100,000 copies of \"Crazy Blues,\" recorded for [[Okeh Records]] by the singer [[Mamie Smith]] (no relation), pointed to a new market. The recording industry had not directed its product to black people, but the success of the record led to a search for female blues singers. Bessie Smith was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1923 by [[Frank Buckley Walker|Frank Walker]], a talent agent who had seen her perform years earlier. Her first session for Columbia was on February 15, 1923; it was engineered by [[Dan Hornsby]]. For most of 1923, her records were issued on Columbia's regular A-series. When the company established a \"[[race records]]\" series, Smith's \"Cemetery Blues\" (September 26, 1923) was the first issued.\n\nBoth sides of her first record, \"[[Downhearted Blues]]\" backed with \"Gulf Coast Blues\", were hits (an earlier recording of \"Downhearted Blues\" by its co-writer [[Alberta Hunter]] had previously been released by [[Paramount Records]]).<ref>Lieb, Sandra R.

Smith's music stressed independence, fearlessness, and sexual freedom, implicitly arguing that working-class women did not have to alter their behavior to be worthy of respect.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=|title=Women and Rhetoric between the Wars|last=George|first=Ann|last2=Weiser|first2=M.

The advent of electrical recording made the power of her voice even more evident. Her first electrical recording was \"Cake Walking Babies [From Home]\", recorded on May 5, 1925.<ref>Albertson, Chris. CD booklet. ''Bessie Smith, The Complete Recordings Vol. 2''. Columbia COL 468767 2.</ref> Smith also benefited from the new technology of radio broadcasting, even on stations in the segregated South. For example, after giving a concert to a white-only audience at a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, in October 1923, she performed a late-night concert on station WMC, which was well received by the radio audience.<ref>\"Hit on Radio\", ''Chicago Defender'', October 6, 1923, p. 8.</ref>\n\nShe made 160 recordings for Columbia, often accompanied by the finest musicians of the day, notably [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[James P. Johnson]], [[Joe Smith (musician)|Joe Smith]], and [[Charlie Green (musician)|Charlie Green]].\n\n=== Themes in her music ===\nSongs like ''Jail House Blues'', ''Work House Blues'', ''Prison Blues'', ''Sing Sing Prison Blues'' and ''Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair'' dealt critically with important issues of the day like the [[chain gang]], the [[convict lease]] system and capital punishment. ''Poor Man's Blues'' and ''Washwoman's Blues'' are widely considered to be an early form of African American protest music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rabaka |first=Reiland |title=Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Movement |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2012 |page=78}}</ref>\n\nWhat becomes evident after listening to her music and studying her lyrics is that Smith emphasized and channeled a subculture within the African American working class. Additionally, she incorporated commentary on social issues like poverty, intra-racial conflict, and female sexuality into her lyrics. Her lyrical sincerity and public behavior were not widely accepted as appropriate expressions for African American women; therefore, her work was often written off as distasteful or unseemly, rather than as an accurate representation of the African-American experience. Her work challenged elitist norms by encouraging working-class women to embrace their right to drink, party, and satisfy their sexual needs as a means of coping with stress and dissatisfaction in their daily lives. Smith advocated for a wider vision of African-American womanhood beyond domesticity, piety, and conformity; she sought empowerment and happiness through independence, sassiness, and sexual freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Smith was a voice for many minority groups and one of the most gifted blues performers of her time, the themes in her music were precocious, which led to many believing that her work was undeserving of serious recognition.\n\n===Broadway===\nSmith's career was cut short by the Great Depression, which nearly put the recording industry out of business, and the advent of [[sound film|sound in film]], which spelled the end of vaudeville. She never stopped performing, however. The days of elaborate vaudeville shows were over, but Smith continued touring and occasionally sang in clubs. In 1929, she appeared in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''Pansy''. The play was a flop; top critics said she was its only asset.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:St Louis Blues (1929).webm|thumb|thumbtime=396|start=396|end=633|''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', Smith's only film,1929]]\nIn 1929, Smith made her only film appearance, starring in a [[short film|two-reeler]], ''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', based on [[W. C. Handy]]'s [[St. Louis Blues (song)|song]] of the same name. In the film, directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and shot in [[Astoria, Queens]], she sings the title song accompanied by members of [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra, the Hall Johnson Choir, the pianist [[James P. Johnson]] and a string section\u2014a musical environment radically different from that of any of her recordings.\n\n===Swing era===\nIn 1933, [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who also mentored [[Billie Holiday]], asked Smith to record four sides for Okeh (which had been acquired by Columbia Records in 1925). He claimed to have found her in semi-obscurity, working as a hostess in a speakeasy on Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia.<ref>Hammond, John. ''John Hammond on Record''. p. 120.</ref> Smith worked at Art's Cafe on Ridge Avenue, but not as a hostess and not until the summer of 1936. In 1933, when she made the Okeh sides, she was still touring. Hammond was known for his selective memory and gratuitous embellishments.<ref>Albertson, ''Bessie'', pp. 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nSmith was paid a non-royalty fee of $37.50 for each selection on these Okeh sides, which were her last recordings. Made on November 24, 1933, they serve as a hint of the transformation she made in her performances as she shifted her blues artistry into something that fit the [[swing era]]. The relatively modern accompaniment is notable. The band included such swing era musicians as the [[trombone|trombonist]] [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpeter [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]], the [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Chu Berry]], the pianist Buck Washington, the guitarist Bobby Johnson, and the bassist [[Billy Taylor]]. [[Benny Goodman]], who happened to be recording with [[Ethel Waters]] in the adjoining studio, dropped by and is barely audible on one selection. Hammond was not entirely pleased with the results, preferring to have Smith revisit her old blues sound. \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" and \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)\", both written by [[Wesley Wilson]], were among her most popular recordings.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Death==\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was critically injured in a car crash on [[U.S. Route 61]] between [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving, and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.\n\nThe first person on the scene was a Memphis surgeon, Dr. Hugh Smith (no relation). In the early 1970s, Hugh Smith gave a detailed account of his experience to Bessie's biographer Chris Albertson. This is the most reliable eyewitness testimony about the events surrounding her death.\n\nArriving at the scene, Hugh Smith examined Smith, who was lying in the middle of the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half pint of blood, and immediately noted a major traumatic injury: her right arm was almost completely severed at the elbow.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a2VGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ecMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1073,6477849&dq=theater+owners+booking+association&hl=en|title=Blues Legend Bessie Smith Dead 50 Years|date=September 26, 1987|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Though the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.<ref>Albertson, Chris (1972). ''Bessie: Empress of the Blues''. London: Sphere Books. pp. 192\u2013195. {{ISBN|0-300-09902-9}}.</ref>\n\nHenry Broughton (a fishing partner of Dr. Smith's) helped him move Bessie Smith to the shoulder of the road. Dr. Smith dressed her arm injury with a clean handkerchief and asked Broughton to go to a house about 500 feet off the road to call an ambulance.\n\nBy the time Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed with no sign of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith suggested that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.<ref>Albertson (1972), p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe young couple in the new car did not have life-threatening injuries. Two ambulances then arrived from Clarksdale\u2014one from the black hospital, summoned by Broughton, the other from the white hospital, acting on a report from the truck driver, who had not seen the accident victims.\n\nBessie Smith was taken to the [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale, Mississippi)|G.&nbsp;T. Thomas Afro-American Hospital]] in Clarksdale, where her right arm was [[amputate]]d. She died that morning without regaining consciousness. After her death, an often repeated but now discredited story emerged that she died because a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] hospital in Clarksdale refused to admit her. The jazz writer and producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] gave this account in an article in the November 1937 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine. The circumstances of Smith's death and the rumor promoted by Hammond formed the basis for [[Edward Albee]]'s 1959 one-act play ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]''.<ref name=Love-1997>{{cite book|last=Love|first=Spencie|title=One Blood: The Death and Resurrection of Charles R.

They altered the apparent [[Key signature|key]] of her performances (sometimes raised or lowered by as much as a [[semitone]]). The \"center hole\" in some of the master recordings had not been in the true middle of the master disc, so that there were wide variations in tone, pitch, key and phrasing, as commercially released records revolved around the spindle.\n\nGiven those historic limitations, the current [[Remaster|digitally remastered]] versions of her work deliver significant improvements in the sound quality of Smith's performances. Some critics believe that the American [[Columbia Records]] compact disc releases are somewhat inferior to subsequent transfers made by the late [[John R. T. Davies]] for [[Frog Records]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/6515486/100-Best-Jazz-Recordings.html |title=100 Best Jazz Recordings |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The popular musical ''Bessie: The Life & Music of Bessie Smith'', by the playwright Douglas M.

He died while his daughter was too young to remember him. By the time Bessie was nine, her mother and a brother had also died. Her older sister Viola took charge of caring for her siblings.<ref name=Albertson2003>Albertson, Chris (2003). ''Bessie'' (rev. expanded ed.).

She sang and danced as he played the guitar. Their favorite location was in front of the White Elephant Saloon at Thirteenth and Elm streets, in the heart of the city's African-American community.\n\nIn 1904, her oldest brother Clarence left home, joining a small traveling troupe owned by [[Moses Stokes]]. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"<ref>Albertson, 2003, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Clarence returned to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and arranged an audition for his sister with the troupe managers, Lonnie and Cora Fisher. She was hired as a dancer rather than a singer, because the company already included the well-known singer [[Ma Rainey]]. Smith eventually moved on to performing in various chorus lines, making the \"81\" Theater in Atlanta her home base. She also performed in shows on the black-owned ([[Theater Owners Booking Association]]) (T.O.B.A.) circuit and became its biggest star after she signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].\n\nSmith's recording career began in 1923.<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books |location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=978-1-85868-255-6}}</ref> Despite her success, neither she nor her music was accepted in all circles. She once auditioned for Black Swan records ([[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was on its board of directors) and was dismissed because she was considered too rough, she supposedly stopped singing to spit.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fact, even her admirers, white and black, considered her a \"rough\" (i.e., working class or even \"low class\") woman. She was then living in Philadelphia, when she met Jack Gee, a security guard, whom she married on June 7, 1923, just as her first record was being released. During the marriage Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car. Their marriage was stormy with infidelity on both sides, including numerous female lovers for Bessie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Devi|first1=Debra|title=Bessie Smith: Music's Original, Bitchinest Bad Girl|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-devi/bessie-smith_b_1450477.html|accessdate=February 17, 2017|work=HuffPost|date=June 25, 2012}}</ref> Gee was impressed by the money but never adjusted to show business life or to Smith's [[bisexuality]]. In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, [[Gertrude Saunders]], Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce.\n\nSmith later entered a [[common-law marriage]] with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was [[Lionel Hampton]]'s uncle. She stayed with him until her death.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bessiesmith3.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Smith by Carl Van Vechten]]\nAll contemporary accounts indicate that while Rainey did not teach Smith to sing, she probably helped her develop a stage presence.<ref>Albertson, 2003, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Smith began forming her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theater. By 1920, she had established a reputation in the [[American South|South]] and along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nIn 1920, sales of over 100,000 copies of \"Crazy Blues,\" recorded for [[Okeh Records]] by the singer [[Mamie Smith]] (no relation), pointed to a new market. The recording industry had not directed its product to black people, but the success of the record led to a search for female blues singers. Bessie Smith was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1923 by [[Frank Buckley Walker|Frank Walker]], a talent agent who had seen her perform years earlier. Her first session for Columbia was on February 15, 1923; it was engineered by [[Dan Hornsby]]. For most of 1923, her records were issued on Columbia's regular A-series. When the company established a \"[[race records]]\" series, Smith's \"Cemetery Blues\" (September 26, 1923) was the first issued.\n\nBoth sides of her first record, \"[[Downhearted Blues]]\" backed with \"Gulf Coast Blues\", were hits (an earlier recording of \"Downhearted Blues\" by its co-writer [[Alberta Hunter]] had previously been released by [[Paramount Records]]).<ref>Lieb, Sandra R.

The advent of electrical recording made the power of her voice even more evident. Her first electrical recording was \"Cake Walking Babies [From Home]\", recorded on May 5, 1925.<ref>Albertson, Chris. CD booklet. ''Bessie Smith, The Complete Recordings Vol. 2''. Columbia COL 468767 2.</ref> Smith also benefited from the new technology of radio broadcasting, even on stations in the segregated South. For example, after giving a concert to a white-only audience at a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, in October 1923, she performed a late-night concert on station WMC, which was well received by the radio audience.<ref>\"Hit on Radio\", ''Chicago Defender'', October 6, 1923, p. 8.</ref>\n\nShe made 160 recordings for Columbia, often accompanied by the finest musicians of the day, notably [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[James P. Johnson]], [[Joe Smith (musician)|Joe Smith]], and [[Charlie Green (musician)|Charlie Green]].\n\n=== Themes in her music ===\nSongs like ''Jail House Blues'', ''Work House Blues'', ''Prison Blues'', ''Sing Sing Prison Blues'' and ''Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair'' dealt critically with important issues of the day like the [[chain gang]], the [[convict lease]] system and capital punishment. ''Poor Man's Blues'' and ''Washwoman's Blues'' are widely considered to be an early form of African American protest music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rabaka |first=Reiland |title=Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Movement |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2012 |page=78}}</ref>\n\nWhat becomes evident after listening to her music and studying her lyrics is that Smith emphasized and channeled a subculture within the African American working class. Additionally, she incorporated commentary on social issues like poverty, intra-racial conflict, and female sexuality into her lyrics. Her lyrical sincerity and public behavior were not widely accepted as appropriate expressions for African American women; therefore, her work was often written off as distasteful or unseemly, rather than as an accurate representation of the African-American experience. Her work challenged elitist norms by encouraging working-class women to embrace their right to drink, party, and satisfy their sexual needs as a means of coping with stress and dissatisfaction in their daily lives. Smith advocated for a wider vision of African-American womanhood beyond domesticity, piety, and conformity; she sought empowerment and happiness through independence, sassiness, and sexual freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Smith was a voice for many minority groups and one of the most gifted blues performers of her time, the themes in her music were precocious, which led to many believing that her work was undeserving of serious recognition.\n\n===Broadway===\nSmith's career was cut short by the Great Depression, which nearly put the recording industry out of business, and the advent of [[sound film|sound in film]], which spelled the end of vaudeville. She never stopped performing, however. The days of elaborate vaudeville shows were over, but Smith continued touring and occasionally sang in clubs. In 1929, she appeared in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''Pansy''. The play was a flop; top critics said she was its only asset.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:St Louis Blues (1929).webm|thumb|thumbtime=396|start=396|end=633|''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', Smith's only film,1929]]\nIn 1929, Smith made her only film appearance, starring in a [[short film|two-reeler]], ''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', based on [[W. C. Handy]]'s [[St. Louis Blues (song)|song]] of the same name. In the film, directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and shot in [[Astoria, Queens]], she sings the title song accompanied by members of [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra, the Hall Johnson Choir, the pianist [[James P. Johnson]] and a string section\u2014a musical environment radically different from that of any of her recordings.\n\n===Swing era===\nIn 1933, [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who also mentored [[Billie Holiday]], asked Smith to record four sides for Okeh (which had been acquired by Columbia Records in 1925). He claimed to have found her in semi-obscurity, working as a hostess in a speakeasy on Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia.<ref>Hammond, John. ''John Hammond on Record''. p. 120.</ref> Smith worked at Art's Cafe on Ridge Avenue, but not as a hostess and not until the summer of 1936. In 1933, when she made the Okeh sides, she was still touring. Hammond was known for his selective memory and gratuitous embellishments.<ref>Albertson, ''Bessie'', pp. 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nSmith was paid a non-royalty fee of $37.50 for each selection on these Okeh sides, which were her last recordings. Made on November 24, 1933, they serve as a hint of the transformation she made in her performances as she shifted her blues artistry into something that fit the [[swing era]]. The relatively modern accompaniment is notable. The band included such swing era musicians as the [[trombone|trombonist]] [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpeter [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]], the [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Chu Berry]], the pianist Buck Washington, the guitarist Bobby Johnson, and the bassist [[Billy Taylor]]. [[Benny Goodman]], who happened to be recording with [[Ethel Waters]] in the adjoining studio, dropped by and is barely audible on one selection. Hammond was not entirely pleased with the results, preferring to have Smith revisit her old blues sound. \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" and \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)\", both written by [[Wesley Wilson]], were among her most popular recordings.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Death==\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was critically injured in a car crash on [[U.S. Route 61]] between [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving, and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.\n\nThe first person on the scene was a Memphis surgeon, Dr. Hugh Smith (no relation). In the early 1970s, Hugh Smith gave a detailed account of his experience to Bessie's biographer Chris Albertson. This is the most reliable eyewitness testimony about the events surrounding her death.\n\nArriving at the scene, Hugh Smith examined Smith, who was lying in the middle of the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half pint of blood, and immediately noted a major traumatic injury: her right arm was almost completely severed at the elbow.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a2VGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ecMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1073,6477849&dq=theater+owners+booking+association&hl=en|title=Blues Legend Bessie Smith Dead 50 Years|date=September 26, 1987|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Though the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.<ref>Albertson, Chris (1972). ''Bessie: Empress of the Blues''. London: Sphere Books. pp. 192\u2013195. {{ISBN|0-300-09902-9}}.</ref>\n\nHenry Broughton (a fishing partner of Dr. Smith's) helped him move Bessie Smith to the shoulder of the road. Dr. Smith dressed her arm injury with a clean handkerchief and asked Broughton to go to a house about 500 feet off the road to call an ambulance.\n\nBy the time Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed with no sign of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith suggested that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.<ref>Albertson (1972), p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe young couple in the new car did not have life-threatening injuries. Two ambulances then arrived from Clarksdale\u2014one from the black hospital, summoned by Broughton, the other from the white hospital, acting on a report from the truck driver, who had not seen the accident victims.\n\nBessie Smith was taken to the [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale, Mississippi)|G.&nbsp;T. Thomas Afro-American Hospital]] in Clarksdale, where her right arm was [[amputate]]d. She died that morning without regaining consciousness. After her death, an often repeated but now discredited story emerged that she died because a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] hospital in Clarksdale refused to admit her. The jazz writer and producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] gave this account in an article in the November 1937 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine. The circumstances of Smith's death and the rumor promoted by Hammond formed the basis for [[Edward Albee]]'s 1959 one-act play ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]''.<ref name=Love-1997>{{cite book|last=Love|first=Spencie|title=One Blood: The Death and Resurrection of Charles R.

They altered the apparent [[Key signature|key]] of her performances (sometimes raised or lowered by as much as a [[semitone]]). The \"center hole\" in some of the master recordings had not been in the true middle of the master disc, so that there were wide variations in tone, pitch, key and phrasing, as commercially released records revolved around the spindle.\n\nGiven those historic limitations, the current [[Remaster|digitally remastered]] versions of her work deliver significant improvements in the sound quality of Smith's performances. Some critics believe that the American [[Columbia Records]] compact disc releases are somewhat inferior to subsequent transfers made by the late [[John R. T. Davies]] for [[Frog Records]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/6515486/100-Best-Jazz-Recordings.html |title=100 Best Jazz Recordings |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The popular musical ''Bessie: The Life & Music of Bessie Smith'', by the playwright Douglas M.

Dexter Southfield was founded in 1926 as the Dexter School.  In 2013 the Dexter School merged with the sister school [[Southfield School (Massachusetts)|Southfield School]] to form Dexter Southfield with which it had shared its campus since 1992.<ref>[http://www.dextersouthfield.org/Page/ABOUT/Mission-Statement--School-History!Mission Statement and School History]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Dexter School was founded in 1926 in response to the closure of the Noble & Greenough Lower School and lack of educational opportunities for boys in the Brookline area. The Dexter School opened on Freeman Street in the affluent Cottage Farm neighborhood educating boys through ninth grade. The school developed a strong bond with many of Boston\u2019s leading families with ties to the leading preparatory and Ivy League schools. In 1966, Dexter sold its campus on Freeman Street and moved to their present location on a hill on Newton Street on the South Brookline/Jamaica Plain line. The school bought the property from the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America who had resided on the site since 1945.  The property was the former estate of Richard and Anna Sears, who had built a Mediterranean Revival Style villa on the site in 1928. As Dexter expanded, the school continued the style of the white stucco fa\u00e7ade and red terra-cotta roof of the Sears House. Today, the original house remains the central structure on campus and houses the Senior Lounge, Business Office and Admissions Office. In preparation for the school\u2019s move in 1968, the A building, Fisk Hall, and pool and gymnasium were built to the west of the Sears House. The Thorndike Hockey rink was added to the campus in 1973. From its long tradition as a boy\u2019s lower school, Dexter has undergone a vast transformation over the last 25 years. In the 1990s, further additions were made to the campus including the construction of the Mid-Rise and original lower school building. In 1992, the Southfield School was established on the same campus to expand Dexter\u2019s educational philosophy to young girls. In 2002, the Upper School was established to enable both the Dexter and Southfield schools to continue the school\u2019s mission into the competitive secondary school market. The Clay Center was also constructed to the east of the Sears House greatly altering the school campus. The new center included a new auditorium, dining hall and fifth floor observatory. In 2011 Mr. and Mrs. William Phinney, who had led the school since 1964, and oversaw its move and expansion, retired after 47 years at the school. In 2013, the school was rededicated as the Dexter Southfield School, after received formal accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) Today, Dexter Southfield students offers single-sex classrooms in Pre-K through 8 and co-education in grades 9 through 12.\n\n== Campus ==\nThe 36-acre campus on the Boston-Brookline border included buildings such as Fiske Hall and the Sears Building grace the campus. Of particular note is the Clay Center for Science and Technology which provided students with classroom opportunities as well as an astronomical observatory.\n\n== Academics ==\nDexter Southfield School's curriculum includes arts as painting, wood shop, choir, and much more. Beginning in Kindergarten 2, each homeroom does one public speaking event per year. Starting in sixth grade, every student takes Latin through eighth grade. When in seventh grade, each student takes Latin and a modern language. Every student in the 7th and 8th grades is required to take a language and all students take six classes in grade 8. In the high school, there are approximately fifteen AP courses offering anything from AP Physics to AP European History to AP Latin. There are also honors and normal level classes for most courses.

Dexter Southfield was founded in 1926 as the Dexter School.  In 2013 the Dexter School merged with the sister school [[Southfield School (Massachusetts)|Southfield School]] to form Dexter Southfield with which it had shared its campus since 1992.<ref>[http://www.dextersouthfield.org/Page/ABOUT/Mission-Statement--School-History!Mission Statement and School History]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Dexter School was founded in 1926 in response to the closure of the Noble & Greenough Lower School and lack of educational opportunities for boys in the Brookline area. The Dexter School opened on Freeman Street in the affluent Cottage Farm neighborhood educating boys through ninth grade. The school developed a strong bond with many of Boston\u2019s leading families with ties to the leading preparatory and Ivy League schools. In 1966, Dexter sold its campus on Freeman Street and moved to their present location on a hill on Newton Street on the South Brookline/Jamaica Plain line. The school bought the property from the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America who had resided on the site since 1945.  The property was the former estate of Richard and Anna Sears, who had built a Mediterranean Revival Style villa on the site in 1928. As Dexter expanded, the school continued the style of the white stucco fa\u00e7ade and red terra-cotta roof of the Sears House. Today, the original house remains the central structure on campus and houses the Senior Lounge, Business Office and Admissions Office. In preparation for the school\u2019s move in 1968, the A building, Fisk Hall, and pool and gymnasium were built to the west of the Sears House. The Thorndike Hockey rink was added to the campus in 1973. From its long tradition as a boy\u2019s lower school, Dexter has undergone a vast transformation over the last 25 years. In the 1990\u2019s, further additions were made to the campus including the construction of the Mid-Rise and original lower school building. In 1992, the Southfield School was established on the same campus to expand Dexter\u2019s educational philosophy to young girls. In 2002, the Upper School was established to enable both the Dexter and Southfield schools to continue the school\u2019s mission into the competitive secondary school market. The Clay Center was also constructed to the east of the Sears House greatly altering the school campus. The new center included a new auditorium, dining hall and fifth floor observatory. In 2011 Mr. and Mrs. William Phinney, who had led the school since 1964, and oversaw its move and expansion, retired after 47 years at the school. In 2013, the school was rededicated as the Dexter Southfield School, after received formal accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) Today, Dexter Southfield students offers single-sex classrooms in Pre-K through 8 and co-education in grades 9 through 12.\n\n== Campus ==\nThe 36-acre campus on the Boston-Brookline border included buildings such as Fiske Hall and the Sears Building grace the campus. Of particular note is the Clay Center for Science and Technology which provided students with classroom opportunities as well as an astronomical observatory.\n\n== Academics ==\nDexter Southfield School's curriculum includes arts as painting, wood shop, choir, and much more. Beginning in Kindergarten 2, each homeroom does one public speaking event per year. Starting in sixth grade, every student takes Latin through eighth grade. When in seventh grade, each student takes Latin and a modern language. Every student in the 7th and 8th grades is required to take a language and all students take six classes in grade 8. In the high school, there are approximately fifteen AP courses offering anything from AP Physics to AP European History to AP Latin. There are also honors and normal level classes for most courses. There were many upper class electives in history, English, and science.\n[[File:Dexter Southfield Sears House.jpg|right|thumb|Dexter Southfield's Sears House]]\n== Athletics ==\nDexter's Varsity Tennis in 2012 was in NEPSAC Class A and beat teams like Phillips Andover and Phillips Exeter and advanced to the semifinals of the Class A tournament.
