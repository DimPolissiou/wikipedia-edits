It uses a number of innovative technologies to enable it to operate with zero energy use.  It was designed by the architect [[Bill Dunster]] to support a more sustainable lifestyle. The project was led by the Peabody Trust in partnership with Bill Dunster Architects, Ellis & Moore Consulting Engineers, BioRegional, Arup and the cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald.\n\nThe 99 homes, and 1,405 square metres of work space were built between 2000 and 2002. It is the UK's largest and first carbon-neutral eco-community. The buildings are constructed of materials that store heat during warm conditions and release heat at cooler times, and where possible, they have been built from natural, recycled or reclaimed materials. The first residents moved in (to the Helios Road part of the development) during March 2002.\n\nBedZED receives power from a small-scale combined heat and power plant (CHP). In conventional energy generation, the heat that is produced as a by-product of generating electricity is lost. With CHP technology, this heat can be harnessed and put to use. At BedZED, the heat from the CHP provides hot water, which is distributed around the site via a district heating system of super-insulated pipes. Should residents or workers require a heating boost, each home or office has a domestic hot water tank that doubles as a radiator.\n\nThe CHP plant at BedZED is powered by off-cuts from tree surgery waste that would otherwise go to landfill. Wood is a carbon neutral fuel because the CO<sub>2</sub> released when the wood is burned is equal to that absorbed by the tree as it grew.\n\nThe development has attracted wide interest and acclaim over the past decade since it was built, and, has won numerous awards. Among other examples of recognition, it was shortlisted for the [[Stirling Prize]] for architecture in October 2003, and won awards from the London Evening Standard and RIBA in 2002.\n\n;Sutton Ecology Centre\n[[Sutton Ecology Centre Grounds|The Sutton Ecology Centre]] is located in the Carshalton Village part of Sutton borough.<ref>[https://www.sutton.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1627 London Borough of Sutton \u2013 Sutton Ecology Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203101923/https://www.sutton.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1627 |date=3 February 2015 }}.

The M25 skirts the south of the borough, linking Sutton with other parts of London and the surrounding counties. The [[A24 road|A24]] passes through the north western part of the borough, through North Cheam and onto Epsom, Dorking, Horsham, Worthing, Bognor Regis and Chichester. This follows, in part, the course of [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]], an old Roman road linking London and Chichester. The [[A232 road|A232]] links Sutton with other towns in the borough, also the boroughs of Kingston, Croydon and Bromley.\n\n===Air===\nSutton is located about {{convert|15|mi|km}} from both [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Gatwick Airport]]. Heathrow is served by [[London Buses route X26]] and Gatwick by the [[National Express Coaches]] A3 route, which stops outside Sutton railway station. [[Luton Airport]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} to the north, is connected to Sutton by [[Thameslink|a direct train]]. [[Croydon Airport]] which was partly in the borough of Sutton served as London's main airport in the years prior to the second world war but closed in the 1950s.\n\n===Cycling===\n[[File:Cyclists in Cheam VilIage IMG 0830.jpg|thumb|Cyclists in Cheam Village]]\nAlthough hilly, Sutton is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it.

In the west of the borough is the large [[Nonsuch Park]].\n\nJust to the north of Sutton town centre there is more extensive green space in the form of Sutton Common, which originally (until the beginning of the 19th century) encompassed the aforementioned Sutton Green. Today, a small portion of Sutton Common is given over to a major junior tennis facility. The common extends both to the east and west of Angel Hill.\nSlightly further in the opposite direction out of Sutton lie Banstead Common and Banstead Downs\u2014these start a few hundred yards from the southern end of the town, and extend for an additional mile south in the direction of neighbouring [[Banstead]].\n\n[[Manor Park, Sutton|Manor Park]] was created in 1914 on a site in the town centre opposite the police station. Its grounds include the Sutton War Memorial, which was added in 1921. A fountain was added in 1924. In 2010 its new caf\u00e9 of straw-bale construction was London's first environmentally friendly building to use this building method.\n\nFeatures of interest in the Victorian [[Grove Park, Carshalton|Grove Park]] include a white [[Portland stone]] bridge, known as the ''Leoni Bridge'' where ''Lower Pond'' meets the park. Upper Mill is recent reconstruction of a [[watermill]] that has existed here from Anglo-Saxon times. The cascade is near the footbridge towards the Stone Court corner of the park. The 1.5m fall is now ornamental in design and was reconstructed in the 1960s. Its original purpose was to create a head of water to power Upper Mill.\n\n[[Oaks Park, Carshalton|Oaks Park]] has a long history. It was substantially laid out for the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] in the 1770s, but its villa dates back to around 1750 and is in that era's fashionable landscape style, with trees forming a perimeter screen and placed in artful clumps to suggest a natural landscape.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oaks & Oaks Park, London Borough of Sutton |url=http://www.sutton.gov.uk/leisure/heritage/Carshalton/oaksandpark.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507113955/http://www.sutton.gov.uk/leisure/heritage/Carshalton/oaksandpark.htm |archivedate=7 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[Nonsuch Park]] near [[Cheam]] in the west is the last surviving part of the Little Park of Nonsuch, a deer hunting park established by [[Henry VIII of England]] surrounding the former [[Nonsuch Palace]].

It uses a number of innovative technologies to enable it to operate with zero energy use.  It was designed by the architect [[Bill Dunster]] to support a more sustainable lifestyle. The project was led by the Peabody Trust in partnership with Bill Dunster Architects, Ellis & Moore Consulting Engineers, BioRegional, Arup and the cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald.\n\nThe 99 homes, and 1,405 square metres of work space were built between 2000 and 2002. It is the UK's largest and first carbon-neutral eco-community. The buildings are constructed of materials that store heat during warm conditions and release heat at cooler times, and where possible, they have been built from natural, recycled or reclaimed materials. The first residents moved in (to the Helios Road part of the development) during March 2002.\n\nBedZED receives power from a small-scale combined heat and power plant (CHP). In conventional energy generation, the heat that is produced as a by-product of generating electricity is lost. With CHP technology, this heat can be harnessed and put to use. At BedZED, the heat from the CHP provides hot water, which is distributed around the site via a district heating system of super-insulated pipes. Should residents or workers require a heating boost, each home or office has a domestic hot water tank that doubles as a radiator.\n\nThe CHP plant at BedZED is powered by off-cuts from tree surgery waste that would otherwise go to landfill. Wood is a carbon neutral fuel because the CO<sub>2</sub> released when the wood is burned is equal to that absorbed by the tree as it grew.\n\nThe development has attracted wide interest and acclaim over the past decade since it was built, and, has won numerous awards. Among other examples of recognition, it was shortlisted for the [[Stirling Prize]] for architecture in October 2003, and won awards from the London Evening Standard and RIBA in 2002.\n\n;Sutton Ecology Centre\n[[Sutton Ecology Centre Grounds|The Sutton Ecology Centre]] is located in the Carshalton Village part of Sutton borough.<ref>[https://www.sutton.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1627 London Borough of Sutton \u2013 Sutton Ecology Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203101923/https://www.sutton.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1627 |date=3 February 2015 }}.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits.

Langhans|pages=156\u2013164}}</ref> Garrick having engaged him for [[Drury Lane]], he remained there until retirement in 1788. Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal. However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>W. Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London 1825), II, pp. 1287\u20131291.</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'':<blockquote>\"...it was then the fashion to cry down John Kemble, who took the part after Smith; but, I thought, very unjustly. Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy. He had not to expiate the fault of having pleased beforehand in lofty declamation. He had no sins of Hamlet or of Richard to atone for. His failure in these parts was a passport to success in one of so opposite a tendency.\"<ref>C. Lamb, 'On the artificial comedy of the last century', in ''Essays of Elia'' pp. 192-201, [https://archive.org/details/essaysofelia00lambrich/page/200/mode/2up at p. 200] (Internet Archive).</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of the [[Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was loved by the youngsters of Bury whom he often obliged with sweets from the candy-shop.<ref>W.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal. However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>W. Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London 1825), II, pp. 1287\u20131291.</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'', in the \"Essay upon Old Actors\". On 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of the [[Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was loved by the youngsters of Bury whom he often obliged with sweets from the candy-shop.<ref>W.

The new name was a \u201cconscious imitation\u201d of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. Rockwell wanted a more \"ecumenical\" approach and felt that the swastika banner was impeding organizational growth. Rockwell was assassinated by a former member. Matt Koehl, although a purist National Socialist, succeeded Rockwell as the new leader and this ended the American Nazi Party. Thereafter, the members engaged in internecine disputes, and they were either expelled by Koehl or they resigned. After the assassination of Rockwell, the party dissipated and ad hoc organizations usurped the American Nazi Party logo. Those included James Burford in Chicago and John Bishop in Iowa.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pages=1\u20133}}\n\nThe years 1966 and 1967 were possibly the height of Rockwell's profile.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pages=1\u20133}} He was interviewed by ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, an event that stirred controversy within the ranks.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pages=1\u20133}}<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Alex |last1=Haley |authorlink1=Alex Haley |url=https://archive.org/details/1966PlayboyInterview |title=Playboy Interview: George Lincoln Rockwell |year=1966 |journal=Playboy Magazine |via=[[Internet Archive|Internet archive]] |accessdate=May 12, 2016}}</ref> At the time Rockwell had about 500 followers.{{sfn|Green|Stabler|2015|page=390}}\n\nBefore he could fully implement party reforms, Rockwell was assassinated on August 25, 1967, by a disgruntled follower, [[John Patler]], who was part of a splinter group.{{sfn|Green|Stabler|2015|page=390}}\n\n=== Assassination of Rockwell ===\nAn assassination attempt was made on Rockwell on June 28, 1967. As Rockwell returned from shopping, he drove into the long driveway of the \"Stormtrooper barracks\" located in Arlington's Dominion Hills subdivision and found it blocked by a felled tree and brush. Rockwell assumed that it was another prank by local teens. As a party member cleared the obstruction, two shots were fired at Rockwell from behind one of the swastika-embossed brick driveway pillars. One of the shots ricocheted off the car, right next to his head. Leaping from the car, Rockwell pursued the gunman. On June 30, Rockwell petitioned the Arlington County Circuit Court for a gun permit; no action was ever taken on his request.\n\nOn August 25, 1967, while leaving the Econowash laundromat at the Dominion Hills Shopping Center, an assassin, hiding on the roof of the building, fired two bullets into Rockwell's car through the windshield. One missed, the other hit his chest and ruptured his heart. His car slowly rolled backwards to a stop and Rockwell staggered out of the front passenger side door of the car, stood briefly while pointing upward at the strip mall's rooftop where the shots had come from, and then collapsed on the pavement. He was pronounced dead at the scene.{{sfn|Schmaltz|2013}}<ref name=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/25/newsid_3031000/3031928.stm|title=1967: 'American Hitler' shot dead|accessdate=2009-08-07 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=August 25, 1967}}</ref> Rockwell's assailant was [[John Patler]], a former ANP/NSWPP member whom Rockwell had ejected from the party for allegedly trying to introduce [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine into the party's platforms.\n\n{{Nazism sidebar}}\n\n=== Koehl succession and ideological divisions ===\nRockwell's second in command, Deputy Commander [[Matt Koehl]], a staunch [[Hitler]]ist, assumed the leadership role after a council agreed that he should retain command. Koehl continued some of Rockwell's restructuring of the group by dropping the use of negative verbal and written attacks against racial minorities. Koehl also began emphasizing the positive aspects of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and the glories of a future all-white society. Koehl retained the swastika-festooned party literature and the pseudo-Nazi uniforms of the party's \"Storm Troopers\" which were modeled on those worn by the [[Nazi Party]]'s [[Sturmabteilung]]. In 1968, Koehl moved the party to a new headquarters on 2507 North Franklin Road, clearly visible from [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]]'s main thoroughfare, Wilson Boulevard. He also established a printing press, a \"[[George Lincoln Rockwell]] Memorial Book Store\", and member living quarters on property nearby.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe party began to experience ideological divisions among its followers as it entered the 1970s. In 1970, member [[Frank Collin]], who was himself secretly the son of a Jewish father, broke away from the group and founded the [[National Socialist Party of America]] in [[Chicago]], which became famous for its attempt to march through [[Skokie, Illinois]], home to many [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors. This led to the United States Supreme Court case, [[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie]]. Other dissatisfied members of the NSWPP chose to support [[William Luther Pierce]], and formed the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] in 1974.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nFurther membership erosion occurred as Koehl, drawing heavily upon the teachings of Hitlerian mystic [[Savitri Devi]], began to suggest that [[National Socialism]] was more akin to a religious movement than a political one. He espoused the belief that [[Adolf Hitler]] was the gift of an inscrutable divine providence sent to rescue the white race from decadence and gradual extinction caused by a declining birth rate and [[miscegenation]]. Hitler's death in 1945 was viewed as a type of martyrdom; a voluntary, Christ-like self-sacrifice, that looked forward to a spiritual resurrection of National Socialism at a later date when the [[Aryan race]] would need it the most. These esoteric beliefs led to disputes with the [[World Union of National Socialists]], which Rockwell had founded and whose leader, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[neo-Nazi]] [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]], had been appointed by Koehl. Undaunted, Koehl continued to recast the party as a new religion in formation. Public rallies were gradually phased out in favor of low-key gatherings in private venues. On [[Labor Day]] 1979, in a highly unpopular move for some members, Koehl disbanded the party's paramilitary \"Storm Troopers.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nOn November 3, 1979, some members of the NSWPP and a [[Ku Klux Klan]] group attacked a [[Communist Workers' Party (United States)|Communist Workers' Party]] protest march in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. The alliance of neo-Nazis and Klansmen shot and killed five marchers. Forty Klansmen and neo-Nazis were involved in the shootings with sixteen Klansmen and neo-Nazis being arrested. The six strongest cases were brought to trial first, but the two criminal trials resulted in the acquittal of the defendants by [[all-white jury|all-white juries]]. However, in a 1985 civil lawsuit, the survivors won a $350,000 judgment against the city, the Klansmen, and the neo-Nazis for violating the civil rights of the demonstrators. The shootings became known as the \"[[Greensboro Massacre]].\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===New Order===\nThe Koehl organization changed its name to New Order on January 1, 1983, reflecting the group's [[Nazi mysticism]], and it is still known by that name today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northernvirginiamag.com/culture/news/2010/12/30/death-of-an-arlington-nazi/|title=Death of an Arlington Nazi|website=www.northernvirginiamag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref>\n\nThe organization briefly attracted the media's attention in October 1983, when it held a private meeting at [[Yorktown High School (Virginia)|Yorktown High School]] in Arlington, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/swastikas-on-wilson/|title=Swastikas on Wilson - Arlington Magazine|date=2013-08-12|work=Arlington Magazine|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}</ref> A non-uniformed gathering of members was held indoors while the police kept a crowd of counter-protesters at bay outside. This event marked the last publicized appearance of Koehl and the New Order in Arlington. From that point forward the only outward sign that the group was still operational was the annual appearance of the [[swastika]] and [[Betsy Ross]] [[American Revolutionary War]] flags flying from the party's nondescript headquarters building on North Franklin Road every April 20 ([[Hitler's birthday]]).\n\nIn 1982 the [[Internal Revenue Service]] took action to foreclose on the group's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=156}} Koehl ceased printing the organization's [[White nationalism#White power|White Power]] newspaper, sold its Arlington, Virginia, real estate holdings, and dispersed the group's various operations to scattered locations in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. A secluded {{convert|88|acre|m2|adj=on}} rural property called \"Nordland\" was purchased in [[New Berlin, Wisconsin]], to serve as living quarters and to host annual meetings and ceremonial events.\n\nToday the New Order operates quietly far from the public spotlight, eschewing the confrontational public rallies that were once a hallmark of its previous incarnations. It maintains a web page and a [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], post office box providing information and template material promoting National Socialism. It has no members but rather \"registered supporters\" who pledge to mail in donations on a monthly basis. Financing is also obtained through sales of books and other merchandise under an affiliate business, NS Publications of [[Wyandotte, Michigan]]. The ''NS Bulletin'', a newsletter, is sent to supporters on a quarterly basis. The group holds occasional ceremonial gatherings at undisclosed private locations such as an annual observance of Hitler's birthday each April 20.\n\nNew Order's Chief of Staff, Martin Kerr, claims that the group is no longer a white supremacist group and focuses on advocating \"in favor of [white] people, not against other races or ethnicities. ... We consider the white people of the world to be a gigantic family of racial brothers and sisters, united by ties of common ancestry and common heritage. Being for our own family does not mean that we hate other families.\"  The SPLC still classifies them as neo-Nazis and as a \"hate group.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2017/11/a-look-at-wisconsins-hate-groups/|title=A look at Wisconsin's 'hate' groups {{!}} WisconsinWatch.org|website=www.wisconsinwatch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28|date=2017-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/11/12/documenting-hate-across-wisconsin-recent-rises-in-hate-bias-incidents-spark-concern|title=Across Wisconsin, recent rises in hate, bias incidents spark concern|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref>\n\n== Namesake organizations ==\nSince the late 1960s, there have been a number of small groups that have used the name \"American Nazi Party.\"\n* Perhaps the first was led by James Warner and Allen Vincent and it consisted of members of the California branch of the NSWPP.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pages=1-3, 558-62}} This group announced its existence on January 1, 1968.

This inspired him to end the rancorous \"Phase One\" party tactics and begin \"Phase Two\", a plan to recast the group as a legitimate political party by toning down the verbal and written attacks against non-whites, replacing the party rallying cry of \"[[Sieg Heil]]!\" with \"[[White nationalism#White power|White Power]]!\", limiting public display of the swastika, and entering candidates in local elections.

The new name was a \u201cconscious imitation\u201d of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. Rockwell wanted a more \"ecumenical\" approach and felt that the swastika banner was impeding organizational growth. Rockwell was assassinated by a former member. Matt Koehl, although a purist National Socialist, succeeded Rockwell as the new leader and this ended the American Nazi Party. Thereafter, the members engaged in internecine disputes, and they were either expelled by Koehl or they resigned. After the assassination of Rockwell, the party dissipated and ad hoc organizations usurped the American Nazi Party logo. Those included James Burford in Chicago and John Bishop in Iowa.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pages=1\u20133}}\n\nThe years 1966 and 1967 were possibly the height of Rockwell's profile.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pages=1\u20133}} He was interviewed by ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, an event that stirred controversy within the ranks.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pages=1\u20133}}<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Alex |last1=Haley |authorlink1=Alex Haley |url=https://archive.org/details/1966PlayboyInterview |title=Playboy Interview: George Lincoln Rockwell |year=1966 |journal=Playboy Magazine |via=[[Internet Archive|Internet archive]] |accessdate=May 12, 2016}}</ref> At the time Rockwell had about 500 followers.{{sfn|Green|Stabler|2015|page=390}}\n\nBefore he could fully implement party reforms, Rockwell was assassinated on August 25, 1967, by a disgruntled follower, [[John Patler]], who was part of a splinter group.{{sfn|Green|Stabler|2015|page=390}}\n\n=== Assassination of Rockwell ===\nAn assassination attempt was made on Rockwell on June 28, 1967. As Rockwell returned from shopping, he drove into the long driveway of the \"Stormtrooper barracks\" located in Arlington's Dominion Hills subdivision and found it blocked by a felled tree and brush. Rockwell assumed that it was another prank by local teens. As a party member cleared the obstruction, two shots were fired at Rockwell from behind one of the swastika-embossed brick driveway pillars. One of the shots ricocheted off the car, right next to his head. Leaping from the car, Rockwell pursued the gunman. On June 30, Rockwell petitioned the Arlington County Circuit Court for a gun permit; no action was ever taken on his request.\n\nOn August 25, 1967, while leaving the Econowash laundromat at the Dominion Hills Shopping Center, an assassin, hiding on the roof of the building, fired two bullets into Rockwell's car through the windshield. One missed, the other hit his chest and ruptured his heart. His car slowly rolled backwards to a stop and Rockwell staggered out of the front passenger side door of the car, stood briefly while pointing upward at the strip mall's rooftop where the shots had come from, and then collapsed on the pavement. He was pronounced dead at the scene.{{sfn|Schmaltz|2013}}<ref name=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/25/newsid_3031000/3031928.stm|title=1967: 'American Hitler' shot dead|accessdate=2009-08-07 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=August 25, 1967}}</ref> Rockwell's assailant was [[John Patler]], a former ANP/NSWPP member whom Rockwell had ejected from the party for allegedly trying to introduce [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine into the party's platforms.\n\n{{Nazism sidebar}}\n\n=== Koehl succession and ideological divisions ===\nRockwell's second in command, Deputy Commander [[Matt Koehl]], a staunch [[Hitler]]ist, assumed the leadership role after a council agreed that he should retain command. Koehl continued some of Rockwell's restructuring of the group by dropping the use of negative verbal and written attacks against racial minorities. Koehl also began emphasizing the positive aspects of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and the glories of a future all-white society. Koehl retained the swastika-festooned party literature and the pseudo-Nazi uniforms of the party's \"Storm Troopers\" which were modeled on those worn by the [[Nazi Party]]'s [[Sturmabteilung]]. In 1968, Koehl moved the party to a new headquarters on 2507 North Franklin Road, clearly visible from [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]]'s main thoroughfare, Wilson Boulevard. He also established a printing press, a \"[[George Lincoln Rockwell]] Memorial Book Store\", and member living quarters on property nearby.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe party began to experience ideological divisions among its followers as it entered the 1970s. In 1970, member [[Frank Collin]], who was himself secretly the son of a Jewish father, broke away from the group and founded the [[National Socialist Party of America]] in [[Chicago]], which became famous for its attempt to march through [[Skokie, Illinois]], home to many [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors. This led to the United States Supreme Court case, [[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie]]. Other dissatisfied members of the NSWPP chose to support [[William Luther Pierce]], and formed the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] in 1974.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nFurther membership erosion occurred as Koehl, drawing heavily upon the teachings of Hitlerian mystic [[Savitri Devi]], began to suggest that [[National Socialism]] was more akin to a religious movement than a political one. He espoused the belief that [[Adolf Hitler]] was the gift of an inscrutable divine providence sent to rescue the white race from decadence and gradual extinction caused by a declining birth rate and [[miscegenation]]. Hitler's death in 1945 was viewed as a type of martyrdom; a voluntary, Christ-like self-sacrifice, that looked forward to a spiritual resurrection of National Socialism at a later date when the [[Aryan race]] would need it the most. These esoteric beliefs led to disputes with the [[World Union of National Socialists]], which Rockwell had founded and whose leader, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[neo-Nazi]] [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]], had been appointed by Koehl. Undaunted, Koehl continued to recast the party as a new religion in formation. Public rallies were gradually phased out in favor of low-key gatherings in private venues. On [[Labor Day]] 1979, in a highly unpopular move for some members, Koehl disbanded the party's paramilitary \"Storm Troopers.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nOn November 3, 1979, some members of the NSWPP and a [[Ku Klux Klan]] group attacked a [[Communist Workers' Party (United States)|Communist Workers' Party]] protest march in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. The alliance of neo-Nazis and Klansmen shot and killed five marchers. Forty Klansmen and neo-Nazis were involved in the shootings with sixteen Klansmen and neo-Nazis being arrested. The six strongest cases were brought to trial first, but the two criminal trials resulted in the acquittal of the defendants by [[all-white jury|all-white juries]]. However, in a 1985 civil lawsuit, the survivors won a $350,000 judgment against the city, the Klansmen, and the neo-Nazis for violating the civil rights of the demonstrators. The shootings became known as the \"[[Greensboro Massacre]].\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===New Order===\nThe Koehl organization changed its name to New Order on January 1, 1983, reflecting the group's [[Nazi mysticism]], and it is still known by that name today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northernvirginiamag.com/culture/news/2010/12/30/death-of-an-arlington-nazi/|title=Death of an Arlington Nazi|website=www.northernvirginiamag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref>\n\nThe organization briefly attracted the media's attention in October 1983, when it held a private meeting at [[Yorktown High School (Virginia)|Yorktown High School]] in Arlington, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/swastikas-on-wilson/|title=Swastikas on Wilson - Arlington Magazine|date=2013-08-12|work=Arlington Magazine|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}</ref> A non-uniformed gathering of members was held indoors while the police kept a crowd of counter-protesters at bay outside. This event marked the last publicized appearance of Koehl and the New Order in Arlington. From that point forward the only outward sign that the group was still operational was the annual appearance of the [[swastika]] and [[Betsy Ross]] [[American Revolutionary War]] flags flying from the party's nondescript headquarters building on North Franklin Road every April 20 ([[Hitler's birthday]]).\n\nIn 1982 the [[Internal Revenue Service]] took action to foreclose on the group's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=156}} Koehl ceased printing the organization's [[White nationalism#White power|White Power]] newspaper, sold its Arlington, Virginia, real estate holdings, and dispersed the group's various operations to scattered locations in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. A secluded {{convert|88|acre|m2|adj=on}} rural property called \"Nordland\" was purchased in [[New Berlin, Wisconsin]], to serve as living quarters and to host annual meetings and ceremonial events.\n\nToday the New Order operates quietly far from the public spotlight, eschewing the confrontational public rallies that were once a hallmark of its previous incarnations. It maintains a web page and a [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], post office box providing information and template material promoting National Socialism. It has no members but rather \"registered supporters\" who pledge to mail in donations on a monthly basis. Financing is also obtained through sales of books and other merchandise under an affiliate business, NS Publications of [[Wyandotte, Michigan]]. The ''NS Bulletin'', a newsletter, is sent to supporters on a quarterly basis. The group holds occasional ceremonial gatherings at undisclosed private locations such as an annual observance of Hitler's birthday each April 20.\n\nNew Order's Chief of Staff, Martin Kerr, claims that the group is no longer a white supremacist group and focuses on advocating \"in favor of [white] people, not against other races or ethnicities. ...

Her 1929 play ''[[The Danton Case]]'', which examines the conflict between [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Georges Danton]], is considered to be one of the most exemplary works about the Revolution, and was adapted (albeit with significant ideological edits) by Polish filmmaker [[Andrzej Wajda]] for his 1983 film ''[[Danton (1983 film)|Danton]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nPrzybyszewska was born Stanis\u0142awa Paj\u0105k\u00f3wna on 1 October 1901, in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. She was the illegitimate child of the Polish [[impressionist]] painter [[Aniela Paj\u0105k\u00f3wna]] and the writer [[Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski]], the latter a famous and notoriously dissolute modernist who was one of the founding members of the [[Young Poland]] movement. From 1902-1906 she lived with her mother in [[Lviv]]. From 1907 to 1916 she lived in [[Western Europe]]. As a child, Przybyszewska traveled across [[Europe]] with her mother ([[Vienna]], [[Munich]], Gries near [[Bolzano]], and [[Paris]]). Having lost her mother in 1912 (she died in Paris from [[pneumonia]]), she changed cities following her guardians. Initially her parents' friends Wac\u0142aw and Zofia Moraczewski paid for the studies, but from 1914 it was Stanis\u0142awa's aunt (her mother's sister) Helena Barli\u0144ska who took care of the girl. Between the ages of ten and fifteen Przybyszewska attended four different schools in three countries: [[France]] (Paris), [[Switzerland]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], 1912-1914), and [[Austria]] (Vienna and Oberhollabrunn). In Austria she took [[violin]] lessons and began writing poetry and stories which she destroyed, dissatisfied with her own accomplishments.<ref name=\"alifeofsolitude1\">{{cite book |last1=Kosicka |first1=Jadwiga |last2=Gerould |first2=Daniel |title=A Life of Solitude |publisher=Quartet Books |location=London |pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1916 to 1919 she attended the Teachers Institute for Women in Krak\u00f3w. Kosicka and Gerould wrote: \"(...) she enrolled in the Teachers Institute, a highly regarded training school, which her mother before her had attended. Although she was an outstanding student, Stanis\u0142awa was sharply critical of both how and what she was taught, and she considered herself essentially self-educated, since her own special interests led her to the exact sciences, above all [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]].\"<ref name=alifeofsolitude1 /> As a part of her studies she spent the required year of teaching practice at the elementary school in [[Nowy S\u0105cz]]. She passed her Gymnasium examinations ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1920. In August 1919 she met her father for the first time as an adult; the period of initial fascination with his ideas did not last long, and later in life Przybyszewska was very critical about her father's works.\n\nIn 1920, not without Przybyszewski\u2019s involvement, Stanis\u0142awa moved to [[Pozna\u0144]] where she established connections with the expressionistic circle of the journal, ''The Source'', and studied music at the conservatory. She also enrolled into a philology course at the [[Pozna\u0144 University]] and for one term followed a diverse curriculum it proposed: the courses of French and English literature (of the nineteenth and the eighteenth centuries respectively), [[medieval literature]], history of philosophy, Spanish, Latin and Greek languages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Przybyszewska|first1=Stanis\u0142awa|title=Listy, vol. 1 |date=1978 |page=60n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 she moved to [[Warsaw]] and found a job as a salesgirl in a Communist bookstore; this employment, in the recent aftermath of the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War|Polish-Soviet War]], led to her being arrested for a week in Pozna\u0144 (her official place of residence) before being released for lack of evidence. Kosicka and Gerould noted that \"she took only a theoretical interest in Marxism and remained incapable of becoming directly involved in politics. Stanis\u0142awa made not a single lasting frindship during her year in Warsaw, but as a result of her incarceration she grew obsessed with the victims of unjust imprisonment and judicial oppression, starting with Robespierre and going up to [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] in her own time.\"<ref name=\"alifeofsolitude2\">{{cite book |last1=Kosicka |first1=Jadwiga |last2=Gerould |first2=Daniel |title=A Life of Solitude |date=1986 |publisher=Quartet Books |location=London |pages=30\u201360}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her marriage to an artist Jan Panie\u0144ski (from Pozna\u0144 circle) Stanis\u0142awa moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]] where Panie\u0144ski got a job as an art teacher in Polish Gymnasium (her father had been instrumental in the creation of the school). The couple participated in the activities of a local group Friends of Science and Art. Though not motivated by love, the marriage proved to be a happy one, as they grew attached to each other. It was not, however, very long: in November 1925, while on an art scholarship in Paris, Panie\u0144ski died from [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=alifeofsolitude2 />\n\nThe next ten years of Przybyszewska's life were marked by growing isolation and dedication to her work. She only left Gda\u0144sk on a few occasions, one of them being her father's funeral in 1927. There she met her half-sister Iwi Bennet ([[Dagny Juel]]'s daughter from Przybyszewski), who became, along with her aunt, one of her closest friends and correspondents. Between March 1928 and 9 March 1929 she wrote ''The Danton Case'' and as Kosicka and Gerould noted: \"began to dream of a European career, 'like [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]]', as a way of overcoming her isolation and alienation.\"<ref name=alifeofsolitude2 /> She devoted much time to the study of contemporary German literature. From Polish writers she valued [[Joseph Conrad]]<ref>She wrote in her letter to Helena Barli\u0144ska (18-25 November 1929): \"I have no doubts whatsoever, either of Conrad's essentially Polish origin, or of his delightful mixture of cultures (apparently he hated [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]] - I can well believe it, since on the ''one'' level of their fundamental natures they are as similar as twins); and I do not have the slightest doubt about his being a genius. This foreigner was for [[England]] - for Olympian, literary England - a precious find.\"</ref> and [[Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski]], and considered [[Stefan \u017beromski]] as having huge talent which didn't develop.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Przybyszewska|first1=Stanis\u0142awa|title=Listy, vol. 1 |date=1978 |page=452}}</ref>\n\nShe did not have any stable financial income: the state scholarship that she received in unequal amounts from 1929 to 1933 was not enough to survive, so Przybyszewska depended heavily on the support from Barli\u0144ska and Bennet. She lived in poor conditions in the wooden barracks belonging to the Polish Gymnasium. Suffering from poverty and numerous illnesses, she was prescribed increased dosages of morphine by her German doctor [[:de:Paul Ehmke|Paul Ehmke]]. Kosicka and Gerould wrote: \"During the last eight months of Stanis\u0142awa's life, nothing was heard from her; all letters, sent and unsent, stopped. She had grown so weak from gradual emaciation that she could no longer type or hold a pen. Her money gone, even the morphine that had sustained her for so long ran out. On 14 August 1935 in her room am Weissen Turm 1, Baracke Nr. 12, Stanis\u0142awa Przybyszewska died alone, the official cause of death [[tuberculosis]].\"<ref name=alifeofsolitude2 /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nadolny |first1=Roman |title=Nowe fakty z ostatnich chwil \u017cycia i \u015bmierci Stanis\u0142awy Przybyszewskiej (New facts about Stanis\u0142awa Przybyszewska's last moments) |journal=Nasz Gda\u0144sk |date=January 2016 |issue=1 (174) |pages=12\u201313 |url=http://www.nasz.gdansk.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NG-01-2016-do-internetu.pdf |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=Polish}}</ref>\n\n==Works and themes==\nPrzybyszewska was fixated upon [[Maximilien Robespierre]], and attributed to him, in her writing, extraordinary brilliance and powers of foresight. \"I have the calm certainty,\" she wrote to a friend, \"that I understand Robespierre better than anyone whose works are known to me.\" Przybyszewska depicted Robespierre as having predicted the disastrous rise of [[capitalism]]. Robespierre was the central figure in both of her surviving plays, ''The Danton Case'' (Sprawa Dantona, 1929), and an earlier unfinished play, ''Thermidor'' (1925).\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nBritish author [[Hilary Mantel]] remarks of her that she was \"the woman who died of Robespierre.\"<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n07/mant01_.html LRB \u00b7 Hilary Mantel: \u0091What a man this is, with his crowd of women around him!\u0092<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.lrb.co.uk</ref> Przybyszewska left a collection of letters written from 1913 to 1934 in several languages to publishers, her friends, and famous European writers like [[Georges Bernanos]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and Thomas Mann; which were published in Gda\u0144sk in original languages and in Polish in three volumes as ''Listy'' (Volume 1 in 1978, Volume 2 in 1983, and Volume 3 in 1985). The production of ''The Danton Case'' by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1986 was a realization of the playwright's dream that one day she would be performed in London.

As a child, Przybyszewska traveled across [[Europe]] with her mother ([[Vienna]], [[Munich]], Gries near [[Bolzano]], and [[Paris]]). Having lost her mother in 1912 (she died in Paris from [[pneumonia]]), she changed cities following her guardians. Initially her parents' friends Wac\u0142aw and Zofia Moraczewski payed for the studies, but from 1914 it was Stanis\u0142awa's aunt (her mother's sister) Helena Barli\u0144ska who took care of the girl. Between the ages of ten and fifteen Przybyszewska attended four different schools in three countries: [[France]] (Paris), [[Switzerland]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], 1912-1914), and [[Austria]] (Vienna and Oberhollabrunn). In Austria she took [[violin]] lessons and began writing poetry and stories which she destroyed, dissatisfied with her own accomplishments.<ref name=\"alifeofsolitude1\">{{cite book |last1=Kosicka |first1=Jadwiga |last2=Gerould |first2=Daniel |title=A Life of Solitude |publisher=Quartet Books |location=London |pages=22-23}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1916 to 1919 she attended the Teachers Institute for Women in Krak\u00f3w. Kosicka and Gerould wrote: \"(...) she enrolled in the Teachers Institute, a highly regarded training school, which her mother before her had attended. Although she was an outstanding student, Stanis\u0142awa was sharply critical of both how and what she was taught, and she considered herself essentially self-educated, since her own special interests led her to the exact sciences, above all [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]].\"<ref name=alifeofsolitude1></ref> As a part of her studies she spent the required year of teaching practice at the elementary school in [[Nowy S\u0105cz]]. She passed her Gymnasium examinations ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1920. In August 1919 she met her father for the first time as an adult; the period of initial fascination with his ideas did not last long, and later in life Przybyszewska was very critical about her father's works.\n\nIn 1920, not without Przybyszewski\u2019s involvement, Stanis\u0142awa moved to [[Pozna\u0144]] where she established connections with the expressionistic circle of the journal, ''The Source'', and studied music at the conservatory. She also enrolled into a philology course at the [[Pozna\u0144 University]] and for one term followed a diverse curriculum it proposed: the courses of French and English literature (of the nineteenth and the eighteenth centuries respectively), [[medieval literature]], history of philosophy, Spanish, Latin and Greek languages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Przybyszewska|first1=Stanis\u0142awa|title=Listy, vol. 1 |date=1978 |page=60n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 she moved to [[Warsaw]] and found a job as a salesgirl in a Communist bookstore; this employment, in the recent aftermath of the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War|Polish-Soviet War]], led to her being arrested for a week in Pozna\u0144 (her official place of residence) before being released for lack of evidence. Kosicka and Gerould noted that \"she took only a theoretical interest in Marxism and remained incapable of becoming directly involved in politics. Stanis\u0142awa made not a single lasting frindship during her year in Warsaw, but as a result of her incarceration she grew obsessed with the victims of unjust imprisonment and judical oppression, starting with Robespierre and going up to [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] in her own time.\"<ref name=\"alifeofsolitude2\">{{cite book |last1=Kosicka |first1=Jadwiga |last2=Gerould |first2=Daniel |title=A Life of Solitude |date=1986 |publisher=Quartet Books |location=London |pages=30-60}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her marriage to an artist Jan Panie\u0144ski (from Pozna\u0144 circle) Stanis\u0142awa moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]] where Panie\u0144ski got a job as an art teacher in Polish Gymnasium (her father had been instrumental in the creation of the school). The couple participated in the activities of a local group Friends of Science and Art. Though not motivated by love, the marriage proved to be a happy one, as they grew attached to each other. It was not, however, very long: in November 1925, while on an art scholarship in Paris, Panie\u0144ski died from [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=alifeofsolitude2></ref>\n\nThe next ten years of Przybyszewska's life were marked by growing isolation and dedication to her work. She only left Gda\u0144sk on a few occasions, one of them being her father's funeral in 1927. There she met her half-sister Iwi Bennet ([[Dagny Juel]]'s daughter from Przybyszewski), who became, along with her aunt, one of her closest friends and correspondents. Between March 1928 and 9 March 1929 she wrote ''The Danton Case'' and as Kosicka and Gerould noted: \"began to dream of a European career, 'like [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]]', as a way of overcoming her isolation and alienation.\"<ref name=alifeofsolitude2></ref> She devoted much time to the study of contemporary German literature. From Polish writers she valued [[Joseph Conrad]]<ref>She wrote in her letter to Helena Barli\u0144ska (18-25 November 1929): \"I have no doubts whatsoever, either of Conrad's essentially Polish origin, or of his delightful mixture of cultures (apparently he hated [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]] - I can well believe it, since on the ''one'' level of their fundamental natures they are as similar as twins); and I do not have the slightest doubt about his being a genius. This foreigner was for [[England]] - for Olympian, literary England - a precious find.\"</ref> and [[Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski]], and considered [[Stefan \u017beromski]] as having huge talent which didn't develop.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Przybyszewska|first1=Stanis\u0142awa|title=Listy, vol. 1 |date=1978 |page=452}}</ref>\n\nShe did not have any stable financial income: the state scholarship that she received in unequal amounts from 1929 to 1933 was not enough to survive, so Przybyszewska depended heavily on the support from Barli\u0144ska and Bennet. She lived in poor conditions in the wooden barracks belonging to the Polish Gymnasium. Suffering from poverty and numerous illnesses, she was prescribed incresed dosages of morphine by her German doctor [[:de:Paul Ehmke|Paul Ehmke]]. Kosicka and Gerould wrote: \"During the last eight months of Stanis\u0142awa's life, nothing was heard from her; all letters, sent and unsent, stopped. She had grown so weak from gradual emaciation that she could no longer type or hold a pen. Her money gone, even the morphine that had sustained her for so long ran out. On 14 August 1935 in her room am Weissen Turm 1, Baracke Nr. 12, Stanis\u0142awa Przybyszewska died alone, the official cause of death [[tuberculosis]].\"<ref name=alifeofsolitude2></ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nadolny |first1=Roman |title=Nowe fakty z ostatnich chwil \u017cycia i \u015bmierci Stanis\u0142awy Przybyszewskiej (New facts about Stanis\u0142awa Przybyszewska's last moments) |journal=Nasz Gda\u0144sk |date=January 2016 |issue=1 (174) |pages=12-13 |url=http://www.nasz.gdansk.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NG-01-2016-do-internetu.pdf |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=Polish}}</ref> \n\n==Works and themes==\nPrzybyszewska was fixated upon [[Maximilien Robespierre]], and attributed to him, in her writing, extraordinary brilliance and powers of foresight. \"I have the calm certainty,\" she wrote to a friend, \"that I understand Robespierre better than anyone whose works are known to me.\" Przybyszewska depicted Robespierre as having predicted the disastrous rise of [[capitalism]]. Robespierre was the central figure in both of her surviving plays, ''The Danton Case'' (Sprawa Dantona, 1929), and an earlier unfinished play, ''Thermidor'' (1925).\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nBritish author [[Hilary Mantel]] remarks of her that she was \"the woman who died of Robespierre.\"<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n07/mant01_.html LRB \u00b7 Hilary Mantel: \u0091What a man this is, with his crowd of women around him!\u0092<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.lrb.co.uk</ref> Przybyszewska left a collection of letters written from 1913 to 1934 in several languages to publishers, her friends, and famous European writers like [[Georges Bernanos]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and Thomas Mann; which were published in Gda\u0144sk in original languages and in Polish in three volumes as ''Listy'' (Volume 1 in 1978, Volume 2 in 1983, and Volume 3 in 1985). The production of ''The Danton Case'' by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1986 was a realization of the playwright's dream that one day she would be performed in London. This first English-language staging was directed by Ron Daniels and adapted by [[Pam Gems]] as ''The Danton Affair''. One of Hilary Mantel's 2017 [[Reith Lectures]] on [[BBC Radio Four]], ''Silence Grips the Town'', was delivered in [[Antwerp]] and was dedicated to Przybyszewska.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mantel|first1=Hilary|title=Silence Grips the Town|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08vy0y6|website=BBC Radio 4|date=2017}}</ref> Jolanta Kajzer discovered haiku poetry in Przybyszewska's writings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kajzer|first1=Jolanta|title=Haiku for Stanis\u0142awa Przybyszewska|date=2017|publisher=Marpress|isbn=978-83-7528-144-6|url=http://sklep.marpress.pl/produkt/haiku-dla-stanislawy-przybyszewskiej-haiku-for-stanislawa-przybyszewska-115-haiku-w-115-rocznice-urodzin/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kajzer |first1=Jolanta |title=Haiku dla Stanis\u0142awy Przybyszewskiej / Haiku for Stanis\u0142awa Przybyszewska |journal=Nasz Gda\u0144sk |date=February 2018 |issue=2 (199) |pages=13-14 |url=http://www.nasz.gdansk.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NG-II-2018-do-netu-1.pdf |accessdate=30 August 2018 |language=Polish}}</ref>\n\n==Published works==\n* ''Ostatnie noce vent\u00f4se\u2019a'' (''The Last Nights of Vent\u00f4se'').
