The title character is a tall, leather-clad [[Espionage|secret agent]] from the nation of Monica, skilled in [[assassination]] and [[acrobatics]]. Her mission is to infiltrate the strongholds of the neighboring country of Bregna, which is led by her sometimes-nemesis and sometimes-lover [[Trevor Goodchild]].

Chung intended the cartoon to be a reaction to heroic Hollywood action films, not as a spoof, but rather as a way to make the audience wonder about the wider context of these action heroes and evoke thought.<ref name=\"soundmag\">{{cite web|url=http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Media/Tv/chung.iv|title=Interview with Peter Chung|author=Ed Stastny|work=Sound magazine|date=November 1992|access-date=June 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165823/http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Media/Tv/chung.iv|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''\u00c6on Flux'' is therefore notable as one of the very few American [[adult animation|adult animated series]] to be a drama rather than a comedy, as well as one of the only such series to air for more than one season.\n\nOne peculiarity of the early shorts is the violent death of \u00c6on Flux, which occurs in each installment. According to the commentary by Peter Chung in the 2005 DVD release, she dies in every short episode after the initial six-part pilot because he never intended to make more episodes and felt the best solution was to have her keep dying; by contrast, she only \"dies\" once in the half-hour series. Often her death is caused by fate, while other times she dies due to her own incompetence. One of the half-hour episodes, \"A Last Time for Everything\", ends with the original \u00c6on being killed and replaced by an identical [[Cloning|clone]]. (In the episode \"Chronophasia\", \u00c6on is apparently killed repeatedly by a monstrous baby, but the reality of these events is ambiguous. In \"Ether Drift Theory\", \u00c6on is suspended indefinitely in an inanimate state, but remains technically alive.)\n\n===Style===\nChung describes the style of the show as \"academic\": \"I was interested in experimenting with visual narrative, telling a story without dialogue and also trying to create a style of telling a story with animation that wasn't influenced by the usual kinds of things that you see.\"<ref name=\"soundmag\" /> Graphic [[violence]] and [[human sexuality|sexuality]], including [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] and [[Dominance and submission|domination]], are frequently depicted in ''\u00c6on Flux''. In the featurette ''Investigation: The History of \u00c6on Flux'' (included on the 2005 [[DVD-Video|DVD]] release), Peter Chung says the visual style was also influenced by the animated series ''[[Rugrats]]''; Chung had worked on ''Rugrats'' prior to ''\u00c6on Flux'' and had been extremely frustrated by the limitations of the characters.\n\nWith the exceptions of the exclamation \"No!\" in the pilot and the single word \"plop\" in the episode \"Leisure\", all of the short episodes are completely devoid of intelligible [[speech]]. Instead, the sound track employs a variety of sound effects, including sounds such as laughter, grunts, and sighs. It would not be until the beginning of Season 3 that dialogue would be used much more extensively.\n\n===Music===\nThe music and sound design for the original television series was created by [[Drew Neumann]], who also created music for ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' and ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]''. Peter Stone (of [[Xorcist]]) served as assistant sound editor for the original MTV series. The music was later compiled on the album ''Eye Spy, Ears Only Confidential''. The initials \"AF\" were used on song titles and in the credits to replace the words \"\u00c6on Flux\" due to the lack of licensing permissions from MTV. The album includes two discs worth of material from the series and also from the defunct original (1995) [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation]] video-game project. A CD, ''\u00c6on Flux: Music from the Animated Series'', was included as a bonus with certain editions of the 2005 series compilation DVD that included 11 songs from the show with dialogue snippets featuring \u00c6on and Trevor in-between the songs as standalone tracks. The extended fully remastered soundtrack ''Eye Spy: Declassified, Freedom of Information Act'' was re-released in 2010 as high-quality MP3s with new artwork by Peter Chung and a previously unreleased third volume of music.<ref>[http://www.droomusic.com/dn_prodmusic.php Animated Series Soundtrack] at droomusic.com</ref>\n\nA soundtrack is also available for the 2005 live-action film, composed by [[Graeme Revell]].<ref>[http://www.aeonflux.com/soundtrack.html ''\u00c6on Flux'' Motion Picture Soundtrack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301211833/http://www.aeonflux.com/soundtrack.html |date=2012-03-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of \u00c6on Flux episodes}}\n\n==Broadcast history==\nMTV was the exclusive broadcaster of the series in the United States. In Canada, the shorts aired on [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]] and the third season aired a year or so later on the youth-oriented network [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], in a late-night timeslot, during a period when the network was trying to appeal to an older audience. In Australia and New Zealand, during the early to mid-1990s, the ''Liquid Television'' shorts and the first series were shown on the program ''[[Eat Carpet]]'' on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] television. In [[Southeast Asia]] the third season was broadcast in 1996 via the [[MTV (Southeast Asia)|MTV Southeast Asia]] channel, which at the time was free to anyone with a satellite dish. In the UK, [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] first showed the shorts and the 30-minute episodes from 1992. In the mid-1990s, the [[BBC]] showed the ''Liquid Television'' shorts, which included all of the ''\u00c6on Flux'' shorts. [[Locomotion (TV channel)|Locomotion]] played the third season repeatedly, between 1998\u20131999 and 2002\u20132003, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Latin America]]. The series was also aired on Norwegian channel [[NRK2]], a sister channel to state channel [[NRK]], alongside ''[[The Maxx]]'', ''[[Phantom 2040]]'', and ''[[The Head]]'' in the late 1990s. [[Teletoon at Night|Teletoon Detour]] also aired it with ''The Maxx''.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2006 international release of ''\u00c6on Flux'' on DVD and the live-action movie, MTV UK replayed the third season of ''\u00c6on Flux'' from October to November in 2005. The episodes were played at 2 a.m. on weeknights. [[MTV (Australia and New Zealand)|MTV Australia]] followed with replays of the third season beginning in December 2005, scheduled at 1 a.m. on weeknights. The episodes were titled ''\u00c6on Flux Animation,'' and they were not played in the original order from 1995.\n\nAs of 2009, MTV2 shows ''\u00c6on Flux'' shorts as a part of the block ''MTV2 Legit.'' During January and February 2011, ''\u00c6on Flux'' was aired once again in [[El Salvador]] on [[VH1]], in English language with Spanish subtitles.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS===\nThe entire series was issued as three [[VHS]] tapes between 1996 and 1998, entitled ''\u00c6on Flux'', ''Mission Infinite'', and ''Operative Terminus''. These were later collected in a [[box set]]. A few of the shorts also appeared on a ''Best of Liquid Television'' compilation around the same time. The first VHS volume (which contained four of the half hour shows, and all of the shorts, sans \"Night\") was later released in 1997 on a now-out-of-print DVD that was distinct as it did not utilize any menus.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Aeon-Flux-Volume-Release/822 1997 Aeon Flux DVD at [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713141048/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Aeon-Flux-Volume-Release/822 |date=2015-07-13 }}</ref>\n\n===DVD===\nWith the 2005 release of the live-action movie, the complete series including the shorts and the episodic series was collected in a DVD box set, which was released on November 22, 2005.<ref>{{Cite AV media | people = Denise Poirier (Actor), John Rafter Lee (Actor), Howard E.

Among the many changes to the dialogue in the DVD release, the voice of the character Clavius in the episode \"Utopia or Deuteranopia\", originally recorded by voice actor Joseph Drelich, was re-recorded by series executive producer [[Japhet Asher]] for the 2005 release.\n\nIn some releases, the first disc of the DVD set opens with a [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] short created to promote the movie's tie-in video game, with Flux taking on the likeness of the Charlize Theron version. The short, which ran about the same length as one of the ''Liquid Television'' shorts, sees Flux conducting an unclear mission, killing many Breen soldiers while pursuing some small, insect-like robots. In a throwback to the ongoing theme of the original shorts, the character is ultimately killed due to human error.\n\n===UMD===\nThe PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld system received a 2-[[Universal Media Disc]] set release of the complete animated series in January 2008. This set included all ten digitally-remastered episodes and the original MTV pilot and shorts.\n\n==Reception==\nReviewing its 2005 DVD release, [[IGN]] gave the animated series 9 out of 10, while giving the whole package (shorts, extras and general condition included) a 7 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/11/24/aeon-flux-the-complete-animated-collection?page=1|title=Aeon Flux: The Complete Animated Collection|author=Todd Gilchrist|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 23, 2005|access-date=2013-07-28}}</ref>\n\nCyberpunkReview.com gave the series a glowing review, saying the series was \"one of the really creative shows to come out of United States Television.

While it does take a number of major liberties with the character and concept of the series (such as making the character of Una into \u00c6on's sister and giving Trevor a previously-unmentioned brother who plays a major role), the film also incorporates characters, themes, gadgets, and even specific scenes as featured in the television version, most notably a reenactment of the television show's most iconic image: \u00c6on trapping a fly in her eyelashes. This minor detail was not nearly enough to avoid having the movie become a critical and [[Box-office bomb|box office disappointment]].\n\nThe creator of ''\u00c6on Flux'', Peter Chung, gave an interview to the \"Monican Spies\" community on [[LiveJournal]] in 2006. He was asked many questions about \u00c6on Flux and her [[fictional universe|universe]], including how he really felt about the movie. Chung called the movie \"a [[wikt:travesty|travesty]]\", relating that its public screening made him feel \"helpless, humiliated, and sad\". He described his primary objection to the film as being its portrayal of the \u00c6on and Trevor characters and their re-imagined history and relationship.

The title character is a tall, leather-clad [[Espionage|secret agent]] from the nation of Monica, skilled in [[assassination]] and [[acrobatics]]. Her mission is to infiltrate the strongholds of the neighboring country of Bregna, which is led by her sometimes-nemesis and sometimes-lover [[Trevor Goodchild]].

Chung intended the cartoon to be a reaction to heroic Hollywood action films, not as a spoof, but rather as a way to make the audience wonder about the wider context of these action heroes and evoke thought.<ref name=\"soundmag\">{{cite web|url=http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Media/Tv/chung.iv|title=Interview with Peter Chung|author=Ed Stastny|work=Sound magazine|date=November 1992|access-date=June 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165823/http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Media/Tv/chung.iv|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''\u00c6on Flux'' is therefore notable as one of the very few American [[adult animation|adult animated series]] to be a drama rather than a comedy, as well as one of the only such series to air for more than one season.\n\nOne peculiarity of the early shorts is the violent death of \u00c6on Flux, which occurs in each installment. According to the commentary by Peter Chung in the 2005 DVD release, she dies in every short episode after the initial six-part pilot because he never intended to make more episodes and felt the best solution was to have her keep dying; by contrast, she only \"dies\" once in the half-hour series. Often her death is caused by fate, while other times she dies due to her own incompetence. One of the half-hour episodes, \"A Last Time for Everything\", ends with the original \u00c6on being killed and replaced by an identical [[Cloning|clone]]. (In the episode \"Chronophasia\", \u00c6on is apparently killed repeatedly by a monstrous baby, but the reality of these events is ambiguous. In \"Ether Drift Theory\", \u00c6on is suspended indefinitely in an inanimate state, but remains technically alive.)\n\n===Style===\nChung describes the style of the show as \"academic\": \"I was interested in experimenting with visual narrative, telling a story without dialogue and also trying to create a style of telling a story with animation that wasn't influenced by the usual kinds of things that you see.\"<ref name=\"soundmag\" /> Graphic [[violence]] and [[human sexuality|sexuality]], including [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] and [[Dominance and submission|domination]], are frequently depicted in ''\u00c6on Flux''. In the featurette ''Investigation: The History of \u00c6on Flux'' (included on the 2005 [[DVD-Video|DVD]] release), Peter Chung says the visual style was also influenced by the animated series ''[[Rugrats]]''; Chung had worked on ''Rugrats'' prior to ''\u00c6on Flux'' and had been extremely frustrated by the limitations of the characters.\n\nWith the exceptions of the exclamation \"No!\" in the pilot and the single word \"plop\" in the episode \"Leisure\", all of the short episodes are completely devoid of intelligible [[speech]]. Instead, the sound track employs a variety of sound effects, including sounds such as laughter, grunts, and sighs. It would not be until the beginning of Season 3 that dialogue would be used much more extensively.\n\n===Music===\nThe music and sound design for the original television series was created by [[Drew Neumann]], who also created music for ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' and ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]''. Peter Stone (of [[Xorcist]]) served as assistant sound editor for the original MTV series. The music was later compiled on the album ''Eye Spy, Ears Only Confidential''. The initials \"AF\" were used on song titles and in the credits to replace the words \"\u00c6on Flux\" due to the lack of licensing permissions from MTV. The album includes two discs worth of material from the series and also from the defunct original (1995) [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation]] video-game project. A CD, ''\u00c6on Flux: Music from the Animated Series'', was included as a bonus with certain editions of the 2005 series compilation DVD that included 11 songs from the show with dialogue snippets featuring \u00c6on and Trevor in-between the songs as standalone tracks. The extended fully remastered soundtrack ''Eye Spy: Declassified, Freedom of Information Act'' was re-released in 2010 as high-quality MP3s with new artwork by Peter Chung and a previously unreleased third volume of music.<ref>[http://www.droomusic.com/dn_prodmusic.php Animated Series Soundtrack] at droomusic.com</ref>\n\nA soundtrack is also available for the 2005 live-action film, composed by [[Graeme Revell]].<ref>[http://www.aeonflux.com/soundtrack.html ''\u00c6on Flux'' Motion Picture Soundtrack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301211833/http://www.aeonflux.com/soundtrack.html |date=2012-03-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of \u00c6on Flux episodes}}\n\n==Broadcast history==\nMTV was the exclusive broadcaster of the series in the United States. In Canada, the shorts aired on [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]] and the third season aired a year or so later on the youth-oriented network [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], in a late-night timeslot, during a period when the network was trying to appeal to an older audience. In Australia and New Zealand, during the early to mid-1990s, the ''Liquid Television'' shorts and the first series were shown on the program ''[[Eat Carpet]]'' on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] television. In [[Southeast Asia]] the third season was broadcast in 1996 via the [[MTV (Southeast Asia)|MTV Southeast Asia]] channel, which at the time was free to anyone with a satellite dish. In the UK, [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] first showed the shorts and the 30-minute episodes from 1992. In the mid-1990s, the [[BBC]] showed the ''Liquid Television'' shorts, which included all of the ''\u00c6on Flux'' shorts. [[Locomotion (TV channel)|Locomotion]] played the third season repeatedly, between 1998\u20131999 and 2002\u20132003, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Latin America]]. The series was also aired on Norwegian channel [[NRK2]], a sister channel to state channel [[NRK]], alongside ''[[The Maxx]]'', ''[[Phantom 2040]]'', and ''[[The Head]]'' in the late 1990s. [[Teletoon at Night|Teletoon Detour]] also aired it with ''The Maxx''.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2006 international release of ''\u00c6on Flux'' on DVD and the live-action movie, MTV UK replayed the third season of ''\u00c6on Flux'' from October to November in 2005. The episodes were played at 2 a.m. on weeknights. [[MTV (Australia and New Zealand)|MTV Australia]] followed with replays of the third season beginning in December 2005, scheduled at 1 a.m. on weeknights. The episodes were titled ''\u00c6on Flux Animation,'' and they were not played in the original order from 1995.\n\nAs of 2009, MTV2 shows ''\u00c6on Flux'' shorts as a part of the block ''MTV2 Legit.'' During January and February of 2011, ''\u00c6on Flux'' was aired once again in [[El Salvador]] on [[VH1]], in English language with Spanish subtitles.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS===\nThe entire series was issued as three [[VHS]] tapes between 1996 and 1998, entitled ''\u00c6on Flux'', ''Mission Infinite'', and ''Operative Terminus''. These were later collected in a [[box set]]. A few of the shorts also appeared on a ''Best of Liquid Television'' compilation around the same time. The first VHS volume (which contained four of the half hour shows, and all of the shorts, sans \"Night\") was later released in 1997 on a now-out-of-print DVD that was distinct as it did not utilize any menus.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Aeon-Flux-Volume-Release/822 1997 Aeon Flux DVD at [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713141048/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Aeon-Flux-Volume-Release/822 |date=2015-07-13 }}</ref>\n\n===DVD===\nWith the 2005 release of the live-action movie, the complete series including the shorts and the episodic series was collected in a DVD box set, which was released on November 22, 2005.<ref>{{Cite AV media | people = Denise Poirier (Actor), John Rafter Lee (Actor), Howard E.

Among the many changes to the dialogue in the DVD release, the voice of the character Clavius in the episode \"Utopia or Deuteranopia\", originally recorded by voice actor Joseph Drelich, was re-recorded by series executive producer [[Japhet Asher]] for the 2005 release.\n\nIn some releases, the first disc of the DVD set opens with a [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] short created to promote the movie's tie-in video game, with Flux taking on the likeness of the Charlize Theron version. The short, which ran about the same length as one of the ''Liquid Television'' shorts, sees Flux conducting an unclear mission, killing many Breen soldiers while pursuing some small, insect-like robots. In a throwback to the ongoing theme of the original shorts, the character is ultimately killed due to human error.\n\n===UMD===\nThe PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld system received a 2-[[Universal Media Disc]] set release of the complete animated series in January 2008. This set included all ten digitally-remastered episodes and the original MTV pilot and shorts.\n\n==Reception==\nReviewing its 2005 DVD release, [[IGN]] gave the animated series 9 out of 10, while giving the whole package (shorts, extras and general condition included) a 7 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/11/24/aeon-flux-the-complete-animated-collection?page=1|title=Aeon Flux: The Complete Animated Collection|author=Todd Gilchrist|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 23, 2005|access-date=2013-07-28}}</ref>\n\nCyberpunkReview.com gave the series a glowing review, saying the series was \"one of the really creative shows to come out of United States Television.

While it does take a number of major liberties with the character and concept of the series (such as making the character of Una into \u00c6on's sister and giving Trevor a previously-unmentioned brother who plays a major role), the film also incorporates characters, themes, gadgets, and even specific scenes as featured in the television version, most notably a reenactment of the television show's most iconic image: \u00c6on trapping a fly in her eyelashes. This minor detail was not nearly enough to avoid having the movie become a critical and [[Box-office bomb|box office disappointment]].\n\nThe creator of ''\u00c6on Flux'', Peter Chung, gave an interview to the \"Monican Spies\" community on [[LiveJournal]] in 2006. He was asked many questions about \u00c6on Flux and her [[fictional universe|universe]], including how he really felt about the movie. Chung called the movie \"a [[wikt:travesty|travesty]]\", relating that its public screening made him feel \"helpless, humiliated, and sad\". He described his primary objection to the film as being its portrayal of the \u00c6on and Trevor characters and their re-imagined history and relationship.

After realizing that they all shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start their own band. Masafumi Gotoh became the [[lead vocalist]] and played [[rhythm guitar]], Kensuke Kita played [[lead guitar]] and sang [[backup vocals|backup]] and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer [[Kiyoshi Ijichi]] joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local [[Yokohama]] area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having [[Caramelman and Asian Kung-Fu Generation|collaborated]] with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first [[Indie (music)|indie]] [[Extended play|EP]] in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in [[English (language)|English]]. The four spent the remainder of the year playing in clubs and hosting independent events.\n\nThe year after, the band made an attempt to attain airplay on indie radio stations for their first Japanese single, {{nihongo|\"Konayuki\"|\u7c89\u96ea|}}. The song was eventually picked up by a popular radio DJ and put into heavy rotation on the station [[FM Yokohama]] upon the demand of listeners. AKFG then released another indie EP, ''[[I'm Standing Here]]''. This time, however, the band wrote songs in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]. At this time, the band had begun drawing an increasingly large number of audiences to their shows held in clubs in the districts of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], [[Shimokitazawa]], [[Kichij\u014dji]], and [[Tokyo]].<ref name=\"ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work= Sony Music Website |publisher=[[Ki/oon Records|Ki/oon Records Inc]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025080610/http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html| archivedate= 25 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' and ''Kimi Tsunagi Five M''===\n{{Main|H\u014dkai Amplifier|Kimi Tsunagi Five M}}\nOn November 25, 2002, after contributing to the Under Flowers Records compilation, ''Whatch You Gonna Do?'', Asian Kung\u2013Fu Generation officially released their first major-label [[Extended play|mini-album]], {{nihongo|''[[H\u014dkai Amplifier]]''|\u5d29\u58ca\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |title=Under Flower Label \u2014 Release discography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work=Under Flower Label |publisher=Under-flower Co., Ltd |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107011123/http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |archivedate=2009-01-07 }} {{in lang|ja}}<!--Japanese--></ref> The group enlisted [[internet radio]] host and graphic artist Yusuke Nakamura to design and compose their single and album covers.<ref name=\"digmeout\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |title=digmeout ARTISTS [Yusuke Nakamura] |accessdate=2007-04-07 |work=DigMeOut.net |publisher=digmeout |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006075642/http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |archivedate=2007-10-06 }}</ref> The critically acclaimed EP topped the High Line Records' weekly chart for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number thirty-five on the [[Oricon]] indies sales chart.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rhoades |first=Reginald |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 2004 |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume= |issue= |page=59 |id= |url=http://www.akfgfan.com/pictures/akfgmag02.jpg |accessdate=2008-12-14 |quote= }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of its success, ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' was re-released on April 23, 2003, by the band's new record label, [[Ki/oon Records]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Japan]].

After realizing that they all shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start their own band. Masafumi Gotoh became the [[lead vocalist]] and played [[rhythm guitar]], Kensuke Kita played [[lead guitar]] and sang [[backup vocals|backup]] and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer [[Kiyoshi Ijichi]] joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local [[Yokohama]] area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having [[Caramelman and Asian Kung-Fu Generation|collaborated]] with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first [[Indie (music)|indie]] [[Extended play|EP]] in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in [[English (language)|English]]. The four spent the remainder of the year playing in clubs and hosting independent events.\n\nThe year after, the band made an attempt to attain airplay on indie radio stations for their first Japanese single, {{nihongo|\"Konayuki\"|\u7c89\u96ea|}}. The song was eventually picked up by a popular radio DJ and put into heavy rotation on the station [[FM Yokohama]] upon the demand of listeners. AKFG then released another indie EP, ''[[I'm Standing Here]]''. This time, however, the band wrote songs in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]. At this time, the band had begun drawing an increasingly large number of audiences to their shows held in clubs in the districts of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], [[Shimokitazawa]], [[Kichij\u014dji]], and [[Tokyo]].<ref name=\"ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work= Sony Music Website |publisher=[[Ki/oon Records|Ki/oon Records Inc]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025080610/http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html| archivedate= 25 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' and ''Kimi Tsunagi Five M''===\n{{Main|H\u014dkai Amplifier|Kimi Tsunagi Five M}}\nOn November 25, 2002, after contributing to the Under Flowers Records compilation, ''Whatch You Gonna Do?'', Asian Kung\u2013Fu Generation officially released their first major-label [[Extended play|mini-album]], {{nihongo|''[[H\u014dkai Amplifier]]''|\u5d29\u58ca\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |title=Under Flower Label \u2014 Release discography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work=Under Flower Label |publisher=Under-flower Co., Ltd |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107011123/http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |archivedate=2009-01-07 }} {{in lang|ja}}<!--Japanese--></ref> The group enlisted [[internet radio]] host and graphic artist Yusuke Nakamura to design and compose their single and album covers.<ref name=\"digmeout\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |title=digmeout ARTISTS [Yusuke Nakamura] |accessdate=2007-04-07 |work=DigMeOut.net |publisher=digmeout |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006075642/http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |archivedate=2007-10-06 }}</ref> The critically acclaimed EP topped the High Line Records' weekly chart for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number thirty-five on the [[Oricon]] indies sales chart.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rhoades |first=Reginald |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 2004 |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume= |issue= |page=59 |id= |url=http://www.akfgfan.com/pictures/akfgmag02.jpg |accessdate=2008-12-14 |quote= }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of its success, ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' was re-released on April 23, 2003, by the band's new record label, [[Ki/oon Records]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Japan]].

[[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral and parish church in [[Llandaff]], [[Cardiff]], Wales. It is the seat of the [[Bishop of Llandaff]], head of the [[Church in Wales]] [[Diocese of Llandaff]]. It is dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], and three [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[saint]]s: [[Dubricius]] ({{lang-cy|Dyfrig}}), [[Teilo]] and [[Oudoceus]] ({{lang-cy|Euddogwy}}). It is one of two cathedrals in Cardiff, the other being the Roman Catholic [[Cardiff Cathedral]] in the city centre.\n\nThe current building was constructed in the 12th century over the site of an earlier church. Severe damage was done to the church in 1400 during the rebellion of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], during the [[English Civil War]] when it was overrun by Parliamentarian troops, and during the [[Great Storm of 1703]]. By 1717, the damage to the cathedral was so extensive that the church seriously considered removal of the [[Episcopal see|see]]. Following further storms in the early 1720s, construction of a new cathedral began in 1734, designed by [[John Wood, the Elder]]. During the [[Cardiff Blitz]] of the [[Second World War]] in January 1941, the cathedral was severely damaged when a parachute mine was dropped; blowing the roof off the nave, south aisle and chapter house. The stonework which remains from the medieval period is primarily Somerset Dundry stone, though local [[blue lias]] constitutes most of the stonework done in the post-Reformation period. The work done on the church since World War II is primarily concrete and Pennant sandstone, and the roofs, of Welsh slate and lead, were added during the post-war rebuilding. In February 2007, the organ was damaged during a severe lightning strike, prompting a fundraiser of \u00a31.5 million to raise money for an entirely new organ.\n\nFor many years, the cathedral had the traditional Anglican [[choir]] of boys and men, and more recently a girls' choir, with the only dedicated choir school in the Church in Wales, [[the Cathedral School, Llandaff]]. The cathedral contains a number of notable tombs, including [[Dubricius]], a 6th-century [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[saint]] who evangelised [[Ergyng]] (now Archenfield) and much of [[South Wales|South-East Wales]], [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]], King of Gwent, [[Teilo]], a 6th-century [[Wales|Welsh]] clergyman, church founder and saint, and many Bishops of Llandaff, from the 7th century [[Oudoceus]] to the 19th century [[Alfred Ollivant (bishop)|Alfred Ollivant]], who was bishop from 1849 to 1882.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Llandaff Cathedral Nave.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The nave of the ruined Llandaff Cathedral]]\nThere is common consensus that the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] cathedral was constructed on the site of an ancient [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic church]], but there is little consensus on the original church's age, importance or size. Welsh tradition associates the church's founding with [[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], the legendary [[King of the Britons]] and the first Christian convert in Britain. This tradition attributes the church's founding to [[Saint Dyfan]] and [[Saint Fagan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ollivant |first1=Alfred |title=Some Account of the Condition of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral chiefly from 1575 to the present time. |date=1860 |publisher=Rivingtons |pages=[https://archive.org/details/someaccountofcon00olli/page/4 4] |url=https://archive.org/details/someaccountofcon00olli}}</ref><ref name=CathedralHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.llandaffcathedral.org.uk/history.htm |title=A short history |work=Llandaff Cathedral website |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Llandaff Cathedral |accessdate=10 October 2007 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217100106/http://www.llandaffcathedral.org.uk/history.htm |archivedate=17 December 2007 }}</ref>{{efn|An account in the [[Book of Llandaff]] is that in 156AD, [[Lucius of Britain|King Lucius]] sent two ambassadors, Elfan and Medwy, to [[Pope Eleutherius]] asking that he be made a Christian and that his subjects might also become Christians. Both ambassadors were baptised and ordained, with Elfan being made a bishop. Both men returned to Britain where they taught and converted many in the court of King Lucius. Elfan is said to have become the first Bishop of Llandaff.{{sfn|Clifton|Willmott|1907|p=19}}}}\n\nFurther legends were popularised by pseudo-historical writings such as those of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Iolo Morgannwg]]. These would include the re-establishment of a Christian community at Llandaff by [[Dubricius|Saint Dyfrig (Dubricius)]] and his successor [[Saint Teilo]]. The most notable legends surrounding these two would state that Saint Dyfrig was made Archbishop by [[Saint Germanus of Auxerre]] while he travelled through Britain to oppose the Pelagian heresy, and linked both saints with [[King Arthur]].\n\nThe Normans considered Dyfrig and Teilo as the cathedral's original founders and today, they are the modern Cathedral's [[patron saints]], along with their successor [[Oudoceus]].<ref name=CathedralHistory/> The modern [[Bishop of Llandaff]] holds Saint Dyfrig to be the first bishop at Llandaff and the continuation of a Post-Roman church at the site is supported by secular and ecclesiastical writings, as well as by the remains of an ancient [[Celtic cross]] at the Bishop's Court's well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3439006/3439011/41/llandaff%20celtic%20cross|title=Llandaff|publisher=Monmouthshire Merlin|date=14 May 1870|page=5|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4467365/4467368/35/llandaff%20celtic%20cross|title=Singular Discovery of an Ancient Cross at Llandaff|date=12 May 1870|page=3 |publisher=The western Mail|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Norman cathedral===\nThe Normans occupied [[Glamorgan]] early in the [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman conquest]], appointing [[Urban, Bishop of Llandaff|Urban]] their first bishop in 1107.{{sfn|Clifton|Willmott|1907|pp=20\u201321}}{{efn|When Urban became bishop, he found the present cathedral in a half ruined state. He also felt that the size of the existing cathedral was not large enough to house the remains of Saint [[Dubricius]].{{sfn|James|1898|p=23}} Urban described a structure which was about the size of a chapel, with the total length of the building being about 40 feet. He appealed to the Holy See for funds to construct a new cathedral in 1119.{{sfn|Clifton|Willmott|1907|pp=20\u201321}}}} He began construction of the cathedral in 1120{{sfn|Willis|1719|p=3}} and had the remains of Saint [[Dubricius|Dyfrig]] transferred from [[Bardsey Island|Bardsey]].{{sfn|Rees|1840|p=622}}{{efn|A description of the church built by Urban is recorded in the ''Archaeologica Cambrensis''. It was a small church consisting of a nave and chancel with possibly one polygonal tower. The nave of Urban's church eventually became the presbytery and his chancel the Lady Chapel.{{sfn|Isaac|1859|p=97}}}}  After the death of Urban, it is believed the work was completed some time in the last years of Bishop Nicholas ap Gwrgant, who died in 1183.{{sfn|Bond|1912|p=455}} The cathedral was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, Dubricius, Teilo and Oudoceus.{{sfn|Clifton|Willmott|1907|p=22}}\n\nBishop [[Henry de Abergavenny]] organised the Llandaff [[Cathedral chapter]] circa 1214.

It is the seat of the [[Bishop of Llandaff]], head of the [[Church in Wales]] [[Diocese of Llandaff]]. It is dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], and three [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[saint]]s: [[Dubricius]] ({{lang-cy|Dyfrig}}), [[Teilo]] and [[Oudoceus]] ({{lang-cy|Euddogwy}}). It is one of two cathedrals in Cardiff, the other being the Roman Catholic [[Cardiff Cathedral]] in the city centre.\n\nThe current building was constructed in the 12th century over the site of an earlier church. Severe damage was done to the church in 1400 during the rebellion of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], during the [[English Civil War]] when it was overrun by Parliamentarian troops, and during the [[Great Storm of 1703]]. By 1717, the damage to the cathedral was so extensive that the church seriously considered removal of the [[Episcopal see|see]]. Following further storms in the early 1720s, construction of a new cathedral began in 1734, designed by [[John Wood, the Elder]]. During the [[Cardiff Blitz]] of the [[Second World War]] in January 1941, the cathedral was severely damaged when a parachute mine was dropped; blowing the roof off the nave, south aisle and chapter house. The stonework which remains from the medieval period is primarily Somerset Dundry stone, though local [[blue lias]] constitutes most of the stonework done in the post-Reformation period. The work done on the church since World War II is primarily concrete and Pennant sandstone, and the roofs, of Welsh slate and lead, were added during the post-war rebuilding. In February 2007, the organ was damaged during a severe lightning strike, prompting a fundraiser of \u00a31.5 million to raise money for an entirely new organ.\n\nFor many years, the cathedral had the traditional Anglican [[choir]] of boys and men, and more recently a girls' choir, with the only dedicated choir school in the Church in Wales, [[the Cathedral School, Llandaff]]. The cathedral contains a number of notable tombs, including [[Dubricius]], a 6th-century [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[saint]] who evangelised [[Ergyng]] (now Archenfield) and much of [[South Wales|South-East Wales]], [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]], King of Gwent, [[Teilo]], a 6th-century [[Wales|Welsh]] clergyman, church founder and saint, and many Bishops of Llandaff, from the 7th century [[Oudoceus]] to the 19th century [[Alfred Ollivant (bishop)|Alfred Ollivant]], who was bishop from 1849 to 1882.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Llandaff Cathedral Nave.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The nave of the ruined Llandaff Cathedral]]\nThere is common consensus that the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] cathedral was constructed on the site of an ancient [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic church]], but there is little consensus on the original church's age, importance or size. Welsh tradition associates the church's founding with [[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], the legendary [[King of the Britons]] and the first Christian convert in Britain. This tradition attributes the church's founding to [[Saint Dyfan]] and [[Saint Fagan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ollivant |first1=Alfred |title=Some Account of the Condition of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral chiefly from 1575 to the present time. |date=1860 |publisher=Rivingtons |pages=[https://archive.org/details/someaccountofcon00olli/page/4 4] |url=https://archive.org/details/someaccountofcon00olli}}</ref><ref name=CathedralHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.llandaffcathedral.org.uk/history.htm |title=A short history |work=Llandaff Cathedral website |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Llandaff Cathedral |accessdate=10 October 2007 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217100106/http://www.llandaffcathedral.org.uk/history.htm |archivedate=17 December 2007 }}</ref>{{efn|An account in the [[Book of Llandaff]] is that in 156AD, [[Lucius of Britain|King Lucius]] sent two ambassadors, Elfan and Medwy, to [[Pope Eleutherius]] asking that he be made a Christian and that his subjects might also become Christians. Both ambassadors were baptised and ordained, with Elfan being made a bishop. Both men returned to Britain where they taught and converted many in the court of King Lucius. Elfan is said to have become the first Bishop of Llandaff.{{sfn|Clifton|Willmott|1907|p=19}}}}\n\nFurther legends were popularised by pseudo-historical writings such as those of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Iolo Morgannwg]]. These would include the re-establishment of a Christian community at Llandaff by [[Dubricius|Saint Dyfrig (Dubricius)]] and his successor [[Saint Teilo]]. The most notable legends surrounding these two would state that Saint Dyfrig was made Archbishop by [[Saint Germanus of Auxerre]] while he travelled through Britain to oppose the Pelagian heresy, and linked both saints with [[King Arthur]].\n\nThe Normans considered Dyfrig and Teilo as the cathedral's original founders and today, they are the modern Cathedral's [[patron saints]], along with their successor [[Oudoceus]].<ref name=CathedralHistory/> The modern [[Bishop of Llandaff]] holds Saint Dyfrig to be the first bishop at Llandaff and the continuation of a Post-Roman church at the site is supported by secular and ecclesiastical writings, as well as by the remains of an ancient [[Celtic cross]] at the Bishop's Court's well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3439006/3439011/41/llandaff%20celtic%20cross|title=Llandaff|publisher=Monmouthshire Merlin|date=14 May 1870|page=5|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4467365/4467368/35/llandaff%20celtic%20cross|title=Singular Discovery of an Ancient Cross at Llandaff|date=12 May 1870|page=3 |publisher=The western Mail|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Norman cathedral===\nThe Normans occupied [[Glamorgan]] early in the [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman conquest]], appointing [[Urban, Bishop of Llandaff|Urban]] their first bishop in 1107.{{sfn|Clifton|Willmott|1907|pp=20\u201321}}{{efn|When Urban became bishop, he found the present cathedral in a half ruined state.

It contained low, narrow aisles with an apsidal ''[[porticus]]'' measuring {{convert|12|ft}} long.{{sfn|Newman|Hughes|Ward|1995|p=239}} Construction began of a grander building under the orders of the second Norman bishop of Llandaff, Urban, in the 1120s, to administer power over the newly formed diocese. It doesn't appear to have lasted long as an extensive construction was ordered between 1193 and 1218 during the episcopate of Henry of Abergavenny. The western parts replaced those that Urban had built, and the nave and front of this side remain today. The fine craftsmanship and subtlety of the architecture show a clear similarity to those of [[Glastonbury Abbey]] and [[Wells Cathedral]], so it is probable that several of the leading craftsman of [[Somerset]] were hired for the building.{{sfn|Newman|Hughes|Ward|1995|p=239}}\n\nThough some remodeling work was done in the 13th and 14th centuries, with a northwest tower funded by Jasper Tudor, lord of Glamorgan from 1484\u201395,{{sfn|Newman|Hughes|Ward|1995|p=248}} by the late 16th century the church had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1594 the bishop complained that the cathedral was \"more like a desolate and profane place than like a house of prayer and holy exercises\". The church continued to exist in a poor state, so that by 1692 choral services had to be suspended in fear that the roof would collapse. The battlements of the northwestern tower blew away during a storm in 1703, and the southwest tower fell down in 1722.{{sfn|Newman|Hughes|Ward|1995|p=240}} In 1734, John Wood of Bath was hired to restore the cathedral, but his work on the temple was still not complete by 1752 and remained that way.

In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, [[Glyn Simon]], saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.{{sfn|Newman|Hughes|Ward|1995|p=241}}\n[[File:Chapter House, Llandaff Cathedral.JPG|thumb|upright|Chapter House]]\nThe material of the church which remains from the medieval period is primarily Somerset Dundry stone, though Sutton stone and local blue [[Lias Group|lias]] also make up the stonework, with the latter constituting most of the stonework done in the post-Reformation period.

Microscopic examination of these tissues typically shows medium-sized to large-sized lymphocytes located within small- to medium-sized blood vessels of the skin, lung, and other tissues or the sinusoids of the [[Liver sinusoid|liver]], [[bone marrow#Stroma|bone marrow]],  and [[spleen]]. On occasion, these malignant cells have the appearance of [[Reed-Sternberg cell]]s. The lesions should show no or very little extension outside of blood vessels. As determined by [[immunohistochemistry]] analyses, the intravascular malignant lymphocytes express typical B-cell proteins, particularly [[CD20]], which is found in almost all cases, [[CD79a]] and [[PAX5|Pax5]], which are  found in most cases,<ref name=\"pmid30111607\"/> and [[MUM1]] and [[Bcl-2]], which are found in 95% and 91% of cases, respectively.<ref name=\"pmid27271843\"/> These B-cells are usually (80% of cases) non-germinal center B-cells (see Pathophysiology section) and may express one or more of the gene, chromosome, and gene expression abnormalities described in the above Pathophysiology section. Since the classical variant can present with a wide range of clinical signs, symptoms, and organ involvements, its presence may not be apparent, particularly in cases that do not exhibit clinically apparent skin lesions.

In the absence of long- or short-term, controlled [[clinical trial]]s on treating this lymphoma, individuals with IVBCL have been treated with the standard regimen used to treat [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]s viz., the [[CHOP]] chemotherapy regimen which consists of [[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydaunorubicin]] (also termed doxorubicin or adriamycin), [[oncovin]] (also teremed vincristine), and a [[corticosteroid]] (i.e. either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]) plus the [[monoclonal antibody]] immunotherapy agent, Rituximab. This immunochemotherapeutic regimen has achieved an [[Survival rate#Overall survival|overall survival rate]] at 3 years of 81%; this overall survival rate using CHOP before Retuximab was added to the regimen was only 33%. However, highly toxic reactions to Rituximab such as pulmonary failure may occur and require delay or interrupting the use of this drug.

On occasion, these malignant cells have the appearance of [[Reed-Sternberg cell]]s. The lesions should show no or very little extension outside of blood vessels. As determined by [[immunohistochemistry]] analyses, the intravascular malignant lymphocytes express typical B-cell proteins, particularly [[CD20]], which is found in almost all cases, [[CD79a]] and [[PAX5|Pax5]], which are  found in most cases,<ref name=\"pmid30111607\"/> and [[MUM1]] and [[Bcl-2]], which are found in 95% and 91% of cases, respectively.<ref name=\"pmid27271843\"/> These B-cells are usually (80% of cases) non-germinal center B-cells (see Pathophysiology section) and may express one or more of the gene, chromosome, and gene expression abnormalities described in the above Pathophysiology section. Since the classical variant can present with a wide range of clinical signs, symptoms, and organ involvements, its presence may not be apparent, particularly in cases that do not exhibit clinically apparent skin lesions.

In the absence of long- or short-term, controlled [[clinical trial]]s on treating this lymphoma, individuals with IVBCL have been treated with the standard regimen used to treat [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]s viz., the [[CHOP]] chemotherapy regimen which consists of [[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydaunorubicin]] (also termed doxorubicin or adriamycin), [[oncovin]] (also teremed vincristine), and a [[corticosteroid]] (i.e. either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]) plus the [[monoclonal antibody]] immunotherapy agent, Rituximab. This immunochemotherapeutic regimen has achieved an [[Survival rate#Overall survival|overall survival rate]] at 3 years of 81%; this overall survival rate using CHOP before Retuximab was added to the regimen was only 33%.
