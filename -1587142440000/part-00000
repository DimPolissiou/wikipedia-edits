It can mean a pause between two parts of a stage production, synonymous to an [[intermission]] (this is nowadays the more common meaning in French), but it more often (in English) indicates a piece of music performed between acts of a theatrical production.\n\nIn the case of stage musicals, the ''entr'acte'' serves as the [[overture]] of act 2 (and sometimes acts 3 and 4, as in ''[[Carmen]]''). In films that were meant to be shown with an intermission, there was frequently a specially recorded ''entr'acte'' on the soundtrack between the first and second half of the film, although this practice died.\n\n==Origin==\nOriginally ''entr'actes'' resulted from stage curtains being closed for set or costume changes: to fill time as not to halt the dramatic action, to make a transition from the mood of one act to the next, or to prevent the public from becoming restless. In front of the closed curtains, the action could be continued during these ''entr'actes'', albeit involving only players with no scenery other than the curtain, and a minimum of [[theatrical property|props]].\n\nAn ''entr'acte'' can take the action from one part of a large-scale drama to the next by completing the missing links.  The Spanish [[Sainete]] often performed a similar function.\n\n==Role of music==\nIn traditional theatre, [[incidental music]] could also bridge the 'closed curtain' periods: [[ballet]], [[opera]] and [[drama]] each have a rich tradition of such musical interludes. The literal meaning of the German word ''{{Lang|de|Verwandlungsmusik}}'' refers to its original function \u2013 \"change music\". Eventually, ''entr'actes'' (or ''intermezzi'') would develop into a separate genre of short theatrical realizations (often with a plot completely independent from the main piece) that could be produced with a minimum of requisites during intermissions of other elaborate theatre pieces. These later ''entr'actes'' were distinctly intended to ''break'' the action or mood with something different, such as comedy or dance. Such pieces also allowed the chief players of the main piece to have a break. Eventually the idea of being an insert into a greater whole became looser: ''interlude'' sometimes has no other connotation than a \"short play\".\n\n==Other dramatic devices==\nWhen the insert was intended only to shift the mood before returning to the main action, without a change of scene being necessary, authors could revert to a \"[[play within a play]]\" technique, or have some accidental guests in a ballroom perform a dance, etc. In this case the insert is a ''[[divertimento]]'' (the term is Italian; the French ''[[divertissement]]'' is also used) rather than an ''entr'acte''.\n\nIn the French opera tradition of the end of the 17th century and early 18th century ([[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], for example) such ''divertissements'' would become compulsory in the form of an inserted ballet passage, a tradition that continued until well into the 19th century. This was eventually parodied by [[Jacques Offenbach]]: for example, the [[cancan]] ending ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''.\n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, a ''divertimento'' had become a separate genre of light music as well. These ''divertimenti'' could be used as interludes in stage works, many of the ''divertimenti'' composed in the last half of the 18th century appears to have lost the relation to the theatre, the music in character only having to be a \"diversion\" in one or another way.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Alexandre Lunois - Pendant l'entracte.jpg|thumb|''Pendant l'entracte'' (During the entr'acte): [[lithography]] by [[Alexandre Lunois]] published in ''[[L'Artiste]]'' (1894).]]\n\nSome more or less elaborate or independent ''entr'actes'' or ''intermezzi'' became famous in their own right, in some cases eclipsing the theatre productions for which they were originally written:\n* ''[[La serva padrona]]'', a two-act ''[[opera buffa]]'' by [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]], was intended to break the seriousness of his ''[[opera seria]]'' ''Il prigioner superbo'' (1733). Eventually the ''intermezzo'' got more attention than the large-scale work to which it was added (see ''[[Querelle des Bouffons]]'').\n* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] shows his mastery in the finale of the first act of ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', where he mixes the ''divertimento''-like dancing (accompanied by a small [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] on the scene) with the actual singing. The characters mingle, performing light dances, while they are supposed to be chasing each other for murder and rape. The diversion and the drama become a single multi-layered item.\n* Bizet's opera ''[[Carmen]]'' has ''entr'actes'' before acts 2, 3 and 4; the one before act 3, featuring flute and harp, is often played in concert performances.\n* A comparable 'filmic' interlude was foreseen in the early 1930s by [[Alban Berg]] for his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', between the two scenes of the central act. In this case Berg only composed the music and gave a short schematic scenario for a film, that was not yet realised when he died in 1935. The ''Lulu'' interlude film, in contrast to the previous example, was intended to chain the action between the first and second half of the opera. Because of the completely symmetrical structure of this opera, the filmic interlude of ''Lulu'' is, in a manner of speaking, the axis of the opera.\n* Interludes of the ''divertimento'' kind can be found in [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]'s last, sombre opera ''[[From the House of the Dead]]'' (1928): releasing the tension after Skuratov's disheartening tale at the centre of the second act, two an \"opera\" and a \"pantomime\" within the larger opera are executed consecutively by a cast of prisoners, both presentations [[farce|farcical]] variations on the [[Don Juan]] theme, and mirroring the religious ceremony ''divertimento'' before the Skuratov tale.\n* Also, the first publicly performed [[furniture music]] composed by [[Erik Satie]] was [[premiere]]d as ''entr'acte'' music (1920 \u2013 the play for which it was written fell into oblivion), with this variation that it was intended as [[background music]] to the sounds the public would usually produce at intermission, walking around and talking. Allegedly, the public did not obey Satie's intention: they kept silently in their places and listened, trained by a habit of incidental music, much to the frustration of the ''[[avant-garde]]'' musicians, who tried to save their idea by inciting the public to get up, talk, and walk around.\n* Most of the film adaptations of Broadway musicals shown in  feature ''entr'actes'' during the intermission, which make use of music from the production.\n* Many [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] presentations of films from the 1950s through to the 1970s were provided with entr'actes that took the form of overtures to the second part, including most of the adaptations of Broadway musicals released at that time, but the practice soon spread to drama films. In many cases it was the same piece as was used for the overture (as in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' in 1962 and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' in 1968), but others such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959) and ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962) employ different pieces.\n* Many roadshow theatrical releases have the intermission/entr'acte after a major turning point during the movie. In the case of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', it is the shock from audiences that came with the identity of infamous Bolshevik commander Strelnikov.\n* The 1968 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States of America|American]] film ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' has an ''entr'acte'' mid-way into the film just after the car drives down the cliff by accident and just before Chitty sprouts wings.\n* The 1970 film ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' was not provided with an overture in any of its releases but did feature a 107-second entr'acte, a different arrangement and orchestration of the main title.\n* The 2005 film ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' features a 158-second entr'acte that includes a performance of ''Wall Breached'' by Harry Gregson-Williams.\n* Roadshow releases of the 2015 film ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' were provided with an original orchestral overture composed by [[Ennio Morricone]], but unusually for any media used a [[Crystal Gayle]] performance of the country song \"[[Ready for the Times to Get Better]]\" as the entr'acte.\n* The 2016 [[Dream Theater (band)|Dream Theater]] album ''[[The Astonishing]]'' features an ''entr'acte'' track entitled \"2285 Entr'acte\" which bridges the first and second acts of the album.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Fisher, Stephen C (1992), 'Interlude' in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed.

The buildings are now B-listed and home of [[Clydebank Museum]].]]\nAt the start of the 1870s, however, the growing trade and industry in [[Glasgow]] resulted in the Clyde Navigation Trustees needing additional space for shipping quays in Glasgow. They used their statutory powers to compulsorily purchase the area occupied by the [[John Brown & Company|Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard]] in [[Govan]], which belonged to [[George Thomson (shipbuilder)|J & G Thomson]]. Forced to find another site for their shipyard, J & G Thomson looked at various sites further down the [[River Clyde]], and eventually purchased, from the estates of Miss Hamilton of Cochno, some suitably flat land on the \"West Barns o'Clyde\" on the north bank of the river, opposite the point where the [[River Cart]] flows into the [[River Clyde]]. The land was situated close to the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] and to the main road running west out of Glasgow to Dumbarton, and so was conveniently positioned for transporting materials and workers to and from the shipyard. The position opposite the mouth of the [[River Cart]] was to also to prove important as the shipyard grew, since it enabled the company to build much bigger, heavier ships than would otherwise have been possible that far up the Clyde. Construction of the new shipyard started on 1 May 1871.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite book |title=The History of Clydebank |pages=3\u20135 |first=John |last=Hood |year=1988 |publisher=The Parthenon Publishing Group Ltd |isbn=1-85070-147-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the company transported workers to and from the shipyard by [[paddle steamer]] (passenger steamers were commonly used by people to travel up and down the Clyde well into the second half of the 20th century). However it was not ideal, having to ship workers to and fro all the time, so the company also started building blocks of [[Apartment#Scotland|tenement flats]] to house the workers. These first blocks of housing became known unofficially as \"Tamson's (Thomson's) Buildings\", after the name of the company.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nGradually, as the shipyard grew, so did the cluster of buildings grow nearby. More houses, a school, a large shed which served as canteen, community hall and church (known as the \"Tarry [[Kirk]]\"), then finally two proper churches in 1876 and 1877. As the resident population grew, so did the needs and problems associated with a growing population. Other manufacturers and employers moved into the area, and by 1880 approximately 2,000 men were living and working there.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn 1882 a railway line was built running from Glasgow out to the new shipyard (the [[Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway]]). This was followed by the [[Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway]] during the 1890s. Then, between 1882 and 1884, the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Company]] built a massive [[sewing machine]] factory in Kilbowie, less than {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} north of the Clyde Bank shipyard. More people moved into the area, and finally, in 1886, the local populace petitioned for the creation of a [[police burgh]], on the basis that the area now qualified as a \"populous place\". The petition was granted, and the new town was named after the shipyard which had given birth to it \u2013 Clydebank.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Clydebank blitz===\nOn 13 and 14 March 1941, [[Luftwaffe]] bombers attacked various targets in and around Clydebank.

West Dunbartonshire Council, the unitary [[Local government in Scotland|local authority]], is based in [[Dumbarton]] and is responsible for local government. For local electoral purposes, West Dunbartonshire is split into [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] electing either three or four councillors. The Clydebank Waterfront ward broadly covers the area between the River Clyde and the Forth and Clyde Canal, including the town centre, [[Whitecrook]] and part of [[Dalmuir]]; it also includes neighbouring [[Old Kilpatrick]]. The Clydebank Central ward includes Kilbowie, [[Linnvale]], Radnor Park, Parkhall and the northern part of Dalmuir.\n\nWest Dunbartonshire is also divided into [[community council]] areas: those covering Clydebank include Dalmuir and Mountblow; Parkhall, North Kilbowie and Central; Linnvale and Drumry; and Clydebank East.\n\nThe area that is now Clydebank was once in the territory of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and has been part of the [[Counties of Scotland|historic county]] of [[Dunbartonshire]] since medieval times. From 1890 onwards, Dunbartonshire was an area of local government administered by a [[county council]]. Although Dunbartonshire ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975, it continues to exist as both a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|Lieutenancy area]] and [[registration county]]. Clydebank is also within the ancient [[Parish (administrative division)#Scotland, Wales and Ireland|parish]] of Old Kilpatrick. The town became a [[burgh]] in 1886; as such, it exercised most local government functions independently of the county council.\n\nFollowing the abolition of administrative counties in 1975, a new Clydebank District was created within [[Strathclyde Region]] under the new [[Regions and districts of Scotland|two tier system of local government]]. As well as Clydebank itself and its suburbs, the district also covered a wider area including [[Old Kilpatrick]] and [[Bowling, West Dunbartonshire|Bowling]]. This lasted until the creation of the present unitary authorities in 1996.\n\n==Geography==\nClydebank is in Scotland's west [[Central Lowlands]], on the north bank of the [[River Clyde]]. Part of the [[Greater Glasgow]] conurbation, the town is just outside the boundaries of [[Glasgow]] itself, {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} northwest of the city centre. Although Clydebank is the largest town in the West Dunbartonshire council area, the local authority is based in Dumbarton, which is {{convert|7|mi|km}} to the northwest.\n\nWhat is now Clydebank was a rural area known as the Barns o' Clyde up until the late 19th century, when the growth of the shipbuilding industry on the river led to the foundation of the village that became Clydebank. As the area rapidly urbanised, Clydebank grew into a town and absorbed older neighbouring settlements such as Dalmuir, Kilbowie and [[Yoker]] (although the latter area was largely annexed by Glasgow in 1926).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Maver|first1=Irene|title=No Mean City: 1914 to 1950s: Neighbourhoods|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSEG|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Glasgow Story}}</ref>\n\n===Areas===\nThe town has lacked any strictly defined administrative boundaries since the abolition of the burgh in 1975. For modern UK Census purposes, the locality of Clydebank is defined as the town centre and surrounding areas, mainly lying south of the [[A82 road]]. While this roughly corresponds to the burgh boundaries prior to the Second World War, it excludes outlying areas such as [[Faifley]], [[Hardgate]] and [[Duntocher]] which were either annexed to the burgh in the postwar era or included in the post-1975 district, and which are often considered to be part of Clydebank.\n\nAreas within the Clydebank census locality include [[Dalmuir]], Linnvale, Mountblow, Radnor Park,<ref name=bbc>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/radnor_park/|title=Scotland's Landscape: Radnor Park|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=|accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> and Kilbowie.\n\nThe Linnvale housing estate was rebuilt in the late 1940s after being destroyed during the Clydebank Blitz, with its new streets named after members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of the time, such as [[Clement Attlee|Attlee Avenue]] and [[Ernest Bevin|Bevin Avenue]]. The area has one non-denominational primary school, Linnvale Primary, which also runs a nursery service. Linnvale Parish Church of Scotland was opened under the [[Church of Scotland]]'s church extension scheme of the 1950s. During the 1980s, Linnvale was one of the areas included in the East End Initiative, and a support team helped to set up groups and clubs and to enable them to become self-sufficient.\n\n'''Whitecrook''' is an area in the southeast of the town of Clydebank, [[West Dunbartonshire]], [[Greater Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], [[UK]]. It occupies the area between the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] to the north, and Glasgow Road to the southwest. The neighbourhood is named after Whitecrook farm, which used to stand there. Whitecrook has one [[non-denominational]] [[primary school]] (Whitecrook Primary), a Catholic primary school (Our Holy Redeemer's \u2013 usually referred to as O.H.R.), and formerly had a Roman Catholic [[high school]] ([[Saint Andrew's High School (Clydebank)|Saint Andrew's High School]]). It also has Saint Margaret's [[Hospice]], which has recently completed development to add a new wing. Local amenities include John Brown's park on Barns Street, two [[bowls|bowling]] clubs and Clydebank Rugby Club which plays at Whitecrook sports ground. Frequent buses go along Barns St/East Barns Street, providing easy and fast transport to [[Glasgow]] City Centre. Whitecrook is served by two local stations \u2013 Clydebank to the west and Yoker to the east.\n\n==Demography==\nFor census purposes, Clydebank is classed as a [[List of census localities in Scotland|locality]] within the settlement of West Dumbartonshire. The census definition of Clydebank covers the traditional core area of the town, but excludes outlying areas which have historically been associated with the burgh or district such as Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley and Old Kilpatrick. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011]], Clydebank had a total resident population of 28,799. The population is 93% White Scottish, with white people as a whole making up 98.1% of the total. 63.7% of the population identified as Christian (35.8% Roman Catholic, 25.3% Church of Scotland and 2.6% other Christian denominations), with 28.3% stating they had no religion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Area Profiles|url=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/area.html|website=Scotland's Census|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe mid-2012 population estimate suggested the population of Clydebank had decreased to 26,640.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estimated population of localities by broad age groups, mid-2012|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/special-area/mid-2012-settlements/2012-pop-est-sett-local-main-tab3a.pdf|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Bruce Street swimming baths - geograph.org.uk - 673311.jpg|thumb|right|The former swimming baths on Bruce Street were opened in 1932 and was one of the few buildings in the town to survive the Clydebank Blitz. It originally had a variety of facilities, including [[Turkish Bath]]s, Russian Vapour Baths, a laundry and a massage room. Although disused since the early 1990s, the building is C-listed, and controversy has surrounded recent attempts by West Dunbartonshire Council to demolish it.]]\nIn the early 20th century the town was synonymous with the Scottish socialist movements led by the shipyard workers along the river Clyde, giving rise to the title of [[Red Clydeside]].\n\nThe 11,000 workers at the largest factory of [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] sewing machines went on [[Strike action|strike]] in March\u2013April 1911, ceasing to work in solidarity of 12 female colleagues protesting against work process reorganisation. Following the end of the strike, Singer fired 400 workers, including all strike leaders and purported members of the [[Industrial Workers of Great Britain]], among whom [[Arthur McManus]], who later went on to become the first chairman of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] between 1920 and 1922.<ref name=Singer1911>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyeve01.htm The Singer strike 1911], ''Glasgow Digital Library''</ref>\n\nLabour unrest, in particular by women and unskilled labour, greatly increased between 1910 and 1914 in Clydeside, with four times more days on strike than between 1900 and 1910. During these four years preceding [[World War I]], membership of those affiliated to the [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]] rose from 129,000 in 1909 to 230,000 in 1914.<ref name=Singer1911/>\n\nThe town is part of a single urban area (officially the Glasgow City Metropolitan Area) with the terms [[Glasgow]] and [[Greater Glasgow]] often used interchangeably, with context being important to establish meaning as for some Clydebank residents the claiming of the town as part of the City of Glasgow could be a sensitive issue. This Glasgow City Metropolitan Area includes places falling within the limits of the following local authorities: [[West Dunbartonshire]] (Clydebank), all of [[East Dunbartonshire]], [[North Lanarkshire]], [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Renfrewshire]], all of [[East Renfrewshire]] and all of the [[City of Glasgow]]. These areas form a single health service area, [[NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde]]. Like these areas, most of Clydebank uses the Glasgow telephone area code \"0141\", however the northern & western portions of the Clydebank area use \"01389\". The G81 postcode is the most widely used in the area, but the Bowling and Old Kilpatrick areas of the town use G60.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Primary schools===\n\n* Cunard School<ref>{{cite web |title=Cunard School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/cunard-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Edinbarnet Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=Edinbarnet Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/edinbarnet-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Kilbowie Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=Kilbowie Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/kilbowie-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Our Holy Redeemer's Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Holy Redeemer's Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/our-holy-redeemers-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* St Eunan's Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=St Eunan's Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/st-eunans-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* St Mary's Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=St Mary's Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/st-marys-primary-school-clydebank |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Linnvale Primary school\n* St Stephens Primary School\n\n===Secondary schools===\n\n* [[Clydebank High School]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Clydebank High School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/clydebank-high-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* [[St Peter the Apostle High School]]<ref>{{cite web |title=St Peter the Apostle High School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/st-peter-the-apostle-high-school/|publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Further education===\n\n* [[West College Scotland]] has a campus in Clydebank.<ref>{{cite news |title=Repairs totalling \u00a3530,000 to be carried out at West College Scotland |url=https://www.clydebankpost.co.uk/news/16203947.repairs-totalling-530000-to-be-carried-out-at-west-college-scotland/ |accessdate=25 October 2018 |work=Clydebank Post |date=3 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Schools that have closed===\n\n* Boquhanran Public School<ref>{{cite web |title=Boquhanran Public School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and-galleries/collections/buildings/schools-and-colleges/schools-and-colleges-clydebank/boquhanran-public-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MacLeod2011\">{{cite book|author=John MacLeod|title=River of Fire: The Clydebank Blitz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9G8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT158|accessdate=25 October 2018|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Birlinn|isbn=978-0-85790-086-9|pages=158\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"McGregor\">{{cite news |title=Obituary \u2013 Dick McGregor, former president of the EIS |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15287714.obituary-dick-mcgregor-former-president-of-the-eis/ |accessdate=25 October 2018 |work=HeraldScotland |date=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n* The Bothy School<ref>{{cite web |title=Bothy School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and-galleries/collections/buildings/schools-and-colleges/schools-and-colleges-clydebank/bothy-school/|publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Dalmuir Public School<ref>{{cite web |title=Dalmuir Public School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and-galleries/collections/buildings/schools-and-colleges/schools-and-colleges-clydebank/dalmuir-public-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"McGregor\"/>\n\n==Sport==\nClydebank has two semi-professional [[football (soccer)|football]] teams, [[Clydebank F.C.]] and [[Yoker Athletic F.C.]].

The design was described disparagingly by [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] as a ''fine healthy specimen of home-made heraldry''.<ref>A.C. Fox-Davies, ''The Book of Public Arms'', 2nd edition, London, 1915</ref>\n\nThe design comprised a shield surmounted by a [[mural crown]], above which was a helm bearing a wreath and crest. In the centrepiece of the shield was a Lennox Cross representative of the ancient Earls of Lennox. In chief position was a sewing machine representing the [[Singer Corporation]] and in base position \"on the waves of the sea\" was a representation of the battleship {{HMS|Ramillies|1892|6}} built at J & G Thomson's Clydebank Shipyard in 1892. In the dexter fess position was a stag's head taken from the coat of arms of shipbuilder James Rodger Thomson, the first Provost of the Burgh. In sinister fess position there was a lion rampant taken from the coat of arms of local landowner, Alexander Dunn Pattison of Dalmuir.\n\nThe crest was a garb or wheatsheaf representing the agricultural interests of the area.\n\nThe [[Latin]] motto below the shield was ''Labore et Scientia'' or ''by work and by knowledge''.\n\nIn 1929 there was a concerted campaign by the office of [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] to ensure that all burghs using unmatriculated arms regularised their position, and more than fifty burghs registered arms between 1929 and 1931. This led to Clydebank's arms being matriculated on 6 February 1930. The 1930 grant was almost identical to the 1892 device.<ref>R. M. Urquhart, ''Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry'', London, 1973</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the burgh was abolished, becoming part of larger Clydebank District, and the burgh arms went out of use. Clydebank District Council was granted new arms on 3 September 1975. This consisted of a red saltire on a white field for the ancient province of [[Lennox (district)|Lennox]] and for the town's more recent historic links to Ireland which previously used the same flag. The cog-wheel symbolised all the local industries and the demi-figure of [[Saint Patrick]] referred to Old Kilpatrick, a burgh of barony from 1672, and where the saint is reputed to have been born. A representation of part of the Roman [[Antonine Wall]] was included as the Wall and Roman forts at [[Old Kilpatrick]] and Greenhill were features common to the burgh and to the villages in the District. The [[lymphad]] (galley ship) was for Clyde shipbuilding. The burgh motto was retained.<ref>R.M. Urquhart, ''Scottish Civic Heraldry'', London, 1979</ref> At the request of the district council, the arms were rematriculated on 19 April 1985 with the addition of a dove of peace in the centre of the saltire. The coat of arms went out of use in 1996 with the abolition of the District Council. In 1998 the successor West Dunbartonshire Council was granted very similar arms.<ref>R.M.

Clydebank held its own 'last tram' day on 6 September 1962, four days after the official end of tramway operation in Glasgow, bringing to an end the operation of the last major tramway system in Great Britain.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of places in West Dunbartonshire]]\n*[[Morison Memorial church]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* I.M.M.

A long-standing local legend is that the village of [[Old Kilpatrick]] derived its name from being the birthplace of [[Saint Patrick]], the patron saint of [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"statacct1\">{{cite book |title=The Statistical Account of Scotland 1791\u20131799 |volume=Volume 5 |pages=229\u2013240 |chapter=Number XV.

It consisted of some villages (Kilbowie, Drumry, [[Hardgate]], [[Faifley]], [[Duntocher]], [[Dalmuir]], [[Old Kilpatrick]]), farms and estates (Dalnotter House, Mountblow House, Dalmuir House, Auchentoshan House, Park Hall, Boquhanran House, and West Barns of Clyde), with some small scale mining operations ([[coal]], [[limestone]] and [[whinstone]]), several paper and [[cotton mill]]s and some small boatbuilding yards.<ref name=\"statacct1\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland 1834\u20131845 |volume=Volume 8 |pages=15\u201335 |chapter=Parish of Old Kilpatrick (Presbytery of Dumbarton, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr) |author=Barclay, The Rev.

The buildings are now B-listed and home of [[Clydebank Museum]].]]\nAt the start of the 1870s, however, the growing trade and industry in [[Glasgow]] resulted in the Clyde Navigation Trustees needing additional space for shipping quays in Glasgow. They used their statutory powers to compulsorily purchase the area occupied by the [[John Brown & Company|Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard]] in [[Govan]], which belonged to [[George Thomson (shipbuilder)|J & G Thomson]]. Forced to find another site for their shipyard, J & G Thomson looked at various sites further down the [[River Clyde]], and eventually purchased, from the estates of Miss Hamilton of Cochno, some suitably flat land on the \"West Barns o'Clyde\" on the north bank of the river, opposite the point where the [[River Cart]] flows into the [[River Clyde]]. The land was situated close to the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] and to the main road running west out of Glasgow to Dumbarton, and so was conveniently positioned for transporting materials and workers to and from the shipyard. The position opposite the mouth of the [[River Cart]] was to also to prove important as the shipyard grew, since it enabled the company to build much bigger, heavier ships than would otherwise have been possible that far up the Clyde. Construction of the new shipyard started on 1 May 1871.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite book |title=The History of Clydebank |pages=3\u20135 |first=John |last=Hood |year=1988 |publisher=The Parthenon Publishing Group Ltd |isbn=1-85070-147-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the company transported workers to and from the shipyard by [[paddle steamer]] (passenger steamers were commonly used by people to travel up and down the Clyde well into the second half of the 20th century). However it was not ideal, having to ship workers to and fro all the time, so the company also started building blocks of [[Apartment#Scotland|tenement flats]] to house the workers. These first blocks of housing became known unofficially as \"Tamson's (Thomson's) Buildings\", after the name of the company.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nGradually, as the shipyard grew, so did the cluster of buildings grow nearby. More houses, a school, a large shed which served as canteen, community hall and church (known as the \"Tarry [[Kirk]]\"), then finally two proper churches in 1876 and 1877. As the resident population grew, so did the needs and problems associated with a growing population. Other manufacturers and employers moved into the area, and by 1880 approximately 2,000 men were living and working there.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn 1882 a railway line was built running from Glasgow out to the new shipyard (the [[Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway]]). This was followed by the [[Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway]] during the 1890s. Then, between 1882 and 1884, the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Company]] built a massive [[sewing machine]] factory in Kilbowie, less than {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} north of the Clyde Bank shipyard. More people moved into the area, and finally, in 1886, the local populace petitioned for the creation of a [[police burgh]], on the basis that the area now qualified as a \"populous place\". The petition was granted, and the new town was named after the shipyard which had given birth to it \u2013 Clydebank.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Clydebank blitz===\nOn 13 and 14 March 1941, [[Luftwaffe]] bombers attacked various targets in and around Clydebank.

West Dunbartonshire Council, the unitary [[Local government in Scotland|local authority]], is based in [[Dumbarton]] and is responsible for local government. For local electoral purposes, West Dunbartonshire is split into [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] electing either three or four councillors. The Clydebank Waterfront ward broadly covers the area between the River Clyde and the Forth and Clyde Canal, including the town centre, [[Whitecrook]] and part of [[Dalmuir]]; it also includes neighbouring [[Old Kilpatrick]]. The Clydebank Central ward includes Kilbowie, [[Linnvale]], Radnor Park, Parkhall and the northern part of Dalmuir.\n\nWest Dunbartonshire is also divided into [[community council]] areas: those covering Clydebank include Dalmuir and Mountblow; Parkhall, North Kilbowie and Central; Linnvale and Drumry; and Clydebank East.\n\nThe area that is now Clydebank was once in the territory of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and has been part of the [[Counties of Scotland|historic county]] of [[Dunbartonshire]] since medieval times. From 1890 onwards, Dunbartonshire was an area of local government administered by a [[county council]]. Although Dunbartonshire ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975, it continues to exist as both a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|Lieutenancy area]] and [[registration county]]. Clydebank is also within the ancient [[Parish (administrative division)#Scotland, Wales and Ireland|parish]] of Old Kilpatrick. The town became a [[burgh]] in 1886; as such, it exercised most local government functions independently of the county council.\n\nFollowing the abolition of administrative counties in 1975, a new Clydebank District was created within [[Strathclyde Region]] under the new [[Regions and districts of Scotland|two tier system of local government]]. As well as Clydebank itself and its suburbs, the district also covered a wider area including [[Old Kilpatrick]] and [[Bowling, West Dunbartonshire|Bowling]]. This lasted until the creation of the present unitary authorities in 1996.\n\n==Geography==\nClydebank is in Scotland's west [[Central Lowlands]], on the north bank of the [[River Clyde]]. Part of the [[Greater Glasgow]] conurbation, the town is just outside the boundaries of [[Glasgow]] itself, {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} northwest of the city centre. Although Clydebank is the largest town in the West Dunbartonshire council area, the local authority is based in Dumbarton, which is {{convert|7|mi|km}} to the northwest.\n\nWhat is now Clydebank was a rural area known as the Barns o' Clyde up until the late 19th century, when the growth of the shipbuilding industry on the river led to the foundation of the village that became Clydebank. As the area rapidly urbanised, Clydebank grew into a town and absorbed older neighbouring settlements such as Dalmuir, Kilbowie and [[Yoker]] (although the latter area was largely annexed by Glasgow in 1926).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Maver|first1=Irene|title=No Mean City: 1914 to 1950s: Neighbourhoods|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSEG|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Glasgow Story}}</ref>\n\n===Areas===\nThe town has lacked any strictly defined administrative boundaries since the abolition of the burgh in 1975. For modern UK Census purposes, the locality of Clydebank is defined as the town centre and surrounding areas, mainly lying south of the [[A82 road]]. While this roughly corresponds to the burgh boundaries prior to the Second World War, it excludes outlying areas such as [[Faifley]], [[Hardgate]] and [[Duntocher]] which were either annexed to the burgh in the postwar era or included in the post-1975 district, and which are often considered to be part of Clydebank.\n\nAreas within the Clydebank census locality include [[Dalmuir]], Linnvale, Mountblow, Radnor Park,<ref name=bbc>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/radnor_park/|title=Scotland's Landscape: Radnor Park|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=|accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> and Kilbowie.\n\nThe Linnvale housing estate was rebuilt in the late 1940s after being destroyed during the Clydebank Blitz, with its new streets named after members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of the time, such as [[Clement Attlee|Attlee Avenue]] and [[Ernest Bevin|Bevin Avenue]]. The area has one non-denominational primary school, Linnvale Primary, which also runs a nursery service. Linnvale Parish Church of Scotland was opened under the [[Church of Scotland]]'s church extension scheme of the 1950s. During the 1980s, Linnvale was one of the areas included in the East End Initiative, and a support team helped to set up groups and clubs and to enable them to become self-sufficient.\n\n'''Whitecrook''' is an area in the southeast of the town of Clydebank, [[West Dunbartonshire]], [[Greater Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], [[UK]]. It occupies the area between the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] to the north, and Glasgow Road to the southwest. The neighbourhood is named after Whitecrook farm, which used to stand there. Whitecrook has one [[non-denominational]] [[primary school]] (Whitecrook Primary), a Catholic primary school (Our Holy Redeemer's \u2013 usually referred to as O.H.R.), and formerly had a Roman Catholic [[high school]] ([[Saint Andrew's High School (Clydebank)|Saint Andrew's High School]]). It also has Saint Margaret's [[Hospice]], which has recently completed development to add a new wing. Local amenities include John Brown's park on Barns Street, two [[bowls|bowling]] clubs and Clydebank Rugby Club which plays at Whitecrook sports ground. Frequent buses go along Barns St/East Barns Street, providing easy and fast transport to [[Glasgow]] City Centre. Whitecrook is served by two local stations \u2013 Clydebank to the west and Yoker to the east.\n\n==Demography==\nFor census purposes, Clydebank is classed as a [[List of census localities in Scotland|locality]] within the settlement of Greater Glasgow. The census definition of Clydebank covers the traditional core area of the town, but excludes outlying areas which have historically been associated with the burgh or district such as Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley and Old Kilpatrick. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011]], Clydebank had a total resident population of 28,799. The population is 93% White Scottish, with white people as a whole making up 98.1% of the total. 63.7% of the population identified as Christian (35.8% Roman Catholic, 25.3% Church of Scotland and 2.6% other Christian denominations), with 28.3% stating they had no religion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Area Profiles|url=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/area.html|website=Scotland's Census|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe mid-2012 population estimate suggested the population of Clydebank had decreased to 26,640.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estimated population of localities by broad age groups, mid-2012|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/special-area/mid-2012-settlements/2012-pop-est-sett-local-main-tab3a.pdf|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Bruce Street swimming baths - geograph.org.uk - 673311.jpg|thumb|right|The former swimming baths on Bruce Street were opened in 1932 and was one of the few buildings in the town to survive the Clydebank Blitz. It originally had a variety of facilities, including [[Turkish Bath]]s, Russian Vapour Baths, a laundry and a massage room. Although disused since the early 1990s, the building is C-listed, and controversy has surrounded recent attempts by West Dunbartonshire Council to demolish it.]]\nIn the early 20th century the town was synonymous with the Scottish socialist movements led by the shipyard workers along the river Clyde, giving rise to the title of [[Red Clydeside]].\n\nThe 11,000 workers at the largest factory of [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] sewing machines went on [[Strike action|strike]] in March\u2013April 1911, ceasing to work in solidarity of 12 female colleagues protesting against work process reorganisation. Following the end of the strike, Singer fired 400 workers, including all strike leaders and purported members of the [[Industrial Workers of Great Britain]], among whom [[Arthur McManus]], who later went on to become the first chairman of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] between 1920 and 1922.<ref name=Singer1911>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyeve01.htm The Singer strike 1911], ''Glasgow Digital Library''</ref>\n\nLabour unrest, in particular by women and unskilled labour, greatly increased between 1910 and 1914 in Clydeside, with four times more days on strike than between 1900 and 1910. During these four years preceding [[World War I]], membership of those affiliated to the [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]] rose from 129,000 in 1909 to 230,000 in 1914.<ref name=Singer1911/>\n\nThe town is part of a single urban area (officially the Glasgow City Metropolitan Area) with the terms [[Glasgow]] and [[Greater Glasgow]] often used interchangeably, with context being important to establish meaning as for some Clydebank residents the claiming of the town as part of the City of Glasgow could be a sensitive issue. This Glasgow City Metropolitan Area includes places falling within the limits of the following local authorities: [[West Dunbartonshire]] (Clydebank), all of [[East Dunbartonshire]], [[North Lanarkshire]], [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Renfrewshire]], all of [[East Renfrewshire]] and all of the [[City of Glasgow]]. These areas form a single health service area, [[NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde]]. Like these areas, most of Clydebank uses the Glasgow telephone area code \"0141\", however the northern & western portions of the Clydebank area use \"01389\". The G81 postcode is the most widely used in the area, but the Bowling and Old Kilpatrick areas of the town use G60.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Primary schools===\n\n* Cunard School<ref>{{cite web |title=Cunard School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/cunard-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Edinbarnet Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=Edinbarnet Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/edinbarnet-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Kilbowie Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=Kilbowie Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/kilbowie-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Our Holy Redeemer's Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Holy Redeemer's Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/our-holy-redeemers-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* St Eunan's Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=St Eunan's Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/st-eunans-primary-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* St Mary's Primary School<ref>{{cite web |title=St Mary's Primary School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/st-marys-primary-school-clydebank |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Linnvale Primary school\n* St Stephens Primary School\n\n===Secondary schools===\n\n* [[Clydebank High School]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Clydebank High School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/clydebank-high-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* [[St Peter the Apostle High School]]<ref>{{cite web |title=St Peter the Apostle High School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/schools/school-search/st-peter-the-apostle-high-school/|publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Further education===\n\n* [[West College Scotland]] has a campus in Clydebank.<ref>{{cite news |title=Repairs totalling \u00a3530,000 to be carried out at West College Scotland |url=https://www.clydebankpost.co.uk/news/16203947.repairs-totalling-530000-to-be-carried-out-at-west-college-scotland/ |accessdate=25 October 2018 |work=Clydebank Post |date=3 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Schools that have closed===\n\n* Boquhanran Public School<ref>{{cite web |title=Boquhanran Public School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and-galleries/collections/buildings/schools-and-colleges/schools-and-colleges-clydebank/boquhanran-public-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"MacLeod2011\">{{cite book|author=John MacLeod|title=River of Fire: The Clydebank Blitz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9G8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT158|accessdate=25 October 2018|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Birlinn|isbn=978-0-85790-086-9|pages=158\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"McGregor\">{{cite news |title=Obituary \u2013 Dick McGregor, former president of the EIS |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15287714.obituary-dick-mcgregor-former-president-of-the-eis/ |accessdate=25 October 2018 |work=HeraldScotland |date=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n* The Bothy School<ref>{{cite web |title=Bothy School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and-galleries/collections/buildings/schools-and-colleges/schools-and-colleges-clydebank/bothy-school/|publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n* Dalmuir Public School<ref>{{cite web |title=Dalmuir Public School |url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and-galleries/collections/buildings/schools-and-colleges/schools-and-colleges-clydebank/dalmuir-public-school/ |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"McGregor\"/>\n\n==Sport==\nClydebank has two semi-professional [[football (soccer)|football]] teams, [[Clydebank F.C.]] and [[Yoker Athletic F.C.]].

The site has been redeveloped, with tourist attractions such as the [[Titan Clydebank]] Crane and a new campus for [[Clydebank College]], part of the merged institution [[West College Scotland]].\n\n[[Singer Corporation]] was also a major industry in Clydebank, providing thousands of jobs to the townsfolk but closed in 1980, with the Clydebank Business Park later created where its famous building used to stand (next to where [[Singer railway station]] is now).\n\nThe town is home to the independent [[Clydebank Co-operative Society]] which has a number of outlets in the town.

The design was described disparagingly by [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] as a ''fine healthy specimen of home-made heraldry''.<ref>A.C. Fox-Davies, ''The Book of Public Arms'', 2nd edition, London, 1915</ref>\n\nThe design comprised a shield surmounted by a [[mural crown]], above which was a helm bearing a wreath and crest. In the centrepiece of the shield was a Lennox Cross representative of the ancient Earls of Lennox. In chief position was a sewing machine representing the [[Singer Corporation]] and in base position \"on the waves of the sea\" was a representation of the battleship {{HMS|Ramillies|1892|6}} built at J & G Thomson's Clydebank Shipyard in 1892. In the dexter fess position was a stag's head taken from the coat of arms of shipbuilder James Rodger Thomson, the first Provost of the Burgh. In sinister fess position there was a lion rampant taken from the coat of arms of local landowner, Alexander Dunn Pattison of Dalmuir.\n\nThe crest was a garb or wheatsheaf representing the agricultural interests of the area.\n\nThe [[Latin]] motto below the shield was ''Labore et Scientia'' or ''by work and by knowledge''.\n\nIn 1929 there was a concerted campaign by the office of [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] to ensure that all burghs using unmatriculated arms regularised their position, and more than fifty burghs registered arms between 1929 and 1931. This led to Clydebank's arms being matriculated on 6 February 1930. The 1930 grant was almost identical to the 1892 device.<ref>R. M. Urquhart, ''Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry'', London, 1973</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the burgh was abolished, becoming part of larger Clydebank District, and the burgh arms went out of use. Clydebank District Council was granted new arms on 3 September 1975. This consisted of a red saltire on a white field for the ancient province of [[Lennox (district)|Lennox]] and for the town's more recent historic links to Ireland which previously used the same flag. The cog-wheel symbolised all the local industries and the demi-figure of [[Saint Patrick]] referred to Old Kilpatrick, a burgh of barony from 1672, and where the saint is reputed to have been born. A representation of part of the Roman [[Antonine Wall]] was included as the Wall and Roman forts at [[Old Kilpatrick]] and Greenhill were features common to the burgh and to the villages in the District. The [[lymphad]] (galley ship) was for Clyde shipbuilding. The burgh motto was retained.<ref>R.M. Urquhart, ''Scottish Civic Heraldry'', London, 1979</ref> At the request of the district council, the arms were rematriculated on 19 April 1985 with the addition of a dove of peace in the centre of the saltire. The coat of arms went out of use in 1996 with the abolition of the District Council. In 1998 the successor West Dunbartonshire Council was granted very similar arms.<ref>R.M. Urquhart, ''Scottish Civic Heraldry 2'', Hamilton, 2001</ref>\n\n==Local transport==\n[[File:Clyde Shopping Centre bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Bridge linking the two parts of the Clyde Shopping Centre.

Bus connections to Glasgow, Dumbarton and the surrounding areas of Clydebank use the bus terminus at the southern end of the Clyde Shopping Centre.\n\nFormerly, the town was connected to the once extensive [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways|Glasgow tramway system]], being served by routes 9 (via Dumbarton Road) and 1A (via Anniesland). Route 20 served Duntocher. Route 9 (to Dalmuir) was the last service to close. Clydebank held its own 'last tram' day on 6 September 1962, four days after the official end of tramway operation in Glasgow, bringing to an end the operation of the last major tramway system in Great Britain.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of places in West Dunbartonshire]]\n*[[Morison Memorial church]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* I.M.M.

Created by [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard Carpenter]], it was produced by [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] in association with [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]], and ran from 1984 to 1986 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. In the United States it was shown on the premium cable TV channel [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows|editor1=Tim Brooks|editor2=Earle Marsh|date=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/completedirector0006broo/page/930 930]|isbn=978-0345397362|url=https://archive.org/details/completedirector0006broo/page/930|publisher=New York : Ballantine Books}}</ref> and, later, on [[PBS]]. The show starred [[Michael Praed]] and [[Jason Connery]] as two different incarnations of the title character. Unlike previous adaptations of the Robin Hood legend, ''Robin of Sherwood'' combined a gritty, authentic production design with elements of real-life history, 20th century fiction, and [[paganism|pagan]] myth.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\">[[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]], ''The Guinness Book of Classic British TV''.

Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], 2015. {{ISBN|0719098939}}, (pp. 138, 152\u2013165)</ref> For their next project, Carpenter and Knight decided to do an adaption of the Robin Hood legend. HTV and Goldcrest Films agreed to fund the series. ''Robin of Sherwood'' was more expensive than Carpenter and Knight's previous series; each episode of ''Robin of Sherwood'' cost around \u00a3500,000 to film.<ref name=\"jc\"/> There were three series, composed of a two-hour opening episode and 24 one-hour long episodes, although the pilot is sometimes screened as two one-hour episodes. The episodes comprising \"The Swords of Wayland\" were transmitted as one episode in the UK on their original screening, on a bank holiday weekend in 1985.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" /> The show was shot on film and almost entirely on location, mostly in the northeast and southwest of England; HTV West in Bristol was the base of operations, and most of the filming was done in and around Bristol and its surrounding counties. Primary locations were the Blaise Castle Estate in North Bristol and Vassals Park to the south. Some of the forest scenes were shot near [[Bradford-on-Avon]].\n\n''Robin of Sherwood'' is one of the most influential treatments of the core Robin Hood legend since ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', featuring a realistic period setting and introducing the character of a [[Saracen]] outlaw. Carpenter also added fantasy elements to the story (which had not appeared in previous TV versions of the legend). These included Robin's supernatural mentor [[Herne the Hunter]], Robin gaining a [[magic sword]] called Albion, and the outlaws battling against [[black magic]]ians and [[demon]]s as well as the Sheriff and his henchmen.<ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\n[[Michael Praed]] played Robin of Loxley in the first two series. His 'Merry Men' consisted of [[Will Scarlet]] ([[Ray Winstone]]), [[Little John]] ([[Clive Mantle]]), [[Friar Tuck]] ([[Phil Rose (actor)|Phil Rose]]), [[Much the Miller's Son|Much]] ([[Peter Llewellyn Williams]]), the [[Saracen]] Nasir ([[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]]) and [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]] ([[Judi Trott]]). He is also assisted by [[Herne the Hunter]] ([[John Abineri]]). As in the legend, Robin is opposed by the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] ([[Nickolas Grace]]) and [[Guy of Gisbourne|Guy of Gisburne]] ([[Robert Addie]]), as well as the Sheriff's brother Abbot Hugo ([[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]]) (representing all the greedy abbots in the legends).\n\nIn the opening story, ''Robin Hood and the Sorcerer'', Robin and his half-brother Much fall foul of the Sheriff's henchman, Sir Guy of Gisburne and are imprisoned in Nottingham Castle. They manage to escape, and gather a team of fellow rebels to fight back against the Sheriff's authority.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" /><ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\nAt the end of the second series, Robin of Loxley is killed, and Robert of Huntingdon (played by [[Jason Connery]]) replaces him as Robin Hood. The third series had the same episode count as the first two combined, so each incarnation of Robin featured in the same number of episodes.\n\nDuring the course of the third series, the new Robin discovers that he is the half-brother of his nemesis Guy of Gisburne (an idea suggested to Carpenter by the fact that both actors had blond hair). This particular story arc was never resolved, as the show's intended fourth (and final) series was never made.  The sudden cancellation also broke off Robin and Marion's intended marriage and left Marion at Halstead Abbey as a novice. Carpenter later said that had he known the third season would be last, that he would have married Robin and Marion.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" />\n\nAt the conclusion of Series Three, [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]] was forced to pull out of the venture, due to a downturn in the fortunes of their film arm. Goldcrest had been responsible for critical and commercial hits such as ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981) and ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982) earlier in the 1980s, but had hit a lean period with such films as ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' (1985) and ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986).  The series was expensive to produce; [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] could not afford to finance it alone, and so ''Robin of Sherwood'' came to an unexpected end.<ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\nAfter the series ended, Carpenter and Knight tried several times to revive the show. First Knight tried to gain funding from US producers for a fourth season, but was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"jc\" /> Carpenter then wrote a script for a feature film adaption of the series, and tried to get funding for it. However, the appearance of two Robin Hood films in 1991 (''[[Robin Hood (1991 British film)|Robin Hood]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' ) meant that Carpenter and Knight could not interest potential producers in a third Robin Hood film.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" />\n\n==Temporal setting==\n''Robin of Sherwood'' is set in the usual period for Robin Hood stories \u2013 England in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, during the reigns of the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]] kings [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]].<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" /><ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\n''Robin Hood and the Sorcerer'' opens in the year 1180 AD, before flashing forward fifteen years ahead. The Season Two episode \"The Prophecy\" is set in the year 1199 AD, when Prince John becomes King of England.<ref name=\"jc\"/> In the Season Three episode \"The Time of the Wolf (Part One)\", the Sheriff dictates a legal document dated for the year 1211 AD, and the plot of the episode involves\nKing John raising an army to fight [[Llywelyn the Great|Llywelyn]] of Wales (a historical event which took place in that same year).<ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===The Merry Men===\n* ''[[Robin Hood|Robin of Loxley]]'' ([[Michael Praed]])<br />Born the son of Anglo-Saxon nobleman Ailric of Loxley, Robin was raised by his uncle, the local miller, after Ailric was murdered. As an adult, Robin accepts the charge of Herne the Hunter and becomes the prophesied \"Hooded Man,\" champion of the oppressed. Hiding in Sherwood Forest, he assembles a number of friends and fights for freedom and justice.  He is killed at the end of Series Two by Norman crossbowmen, on the orders of the Sheriff of Nottingham \u2013 the same manner in which his father died.\n* ''[[Much the Miller's Son|Much]]'' ([[Peter Llewellyn Williams]])<br />Son of the miller who raised Robin, he admires Robin as his big brother. He is dubbed \"the half-wit\" by Guy of Gisburne, but he is more uneducated and naive than [[intellectual disability|intellectually impaired]]. He matures more after the first Robin's death.\n* ''[[Will Scarlet]]'' ([[Ray Winstone]])<br />Originally called Will Scathlock. When his wife, Elena, is raped and trampled to death with horses by mercenaries, he changes his name after slaying several of her killers. Hot-headed and filled with hatred of all things Norman, he is contrasted with the more collected Robin, which frequently leads to conflicts. He has a brother who owns an inn in Lichfield.\n* ''[[Little John]]'' ([[Clive Mantle]])<br />Originally John Little from [[Hathersage]], this giant of a man is placed under a spell by the Baron de Belleme. When Robin defeats the Baron and frees John from the spell, John becomes a loyal friend to Robin (and later, to Robert of Huntington). His hulking figure and immense strength is contrasted by his soft heart.\n* ''[[Maid Marian|Lady Marion of Leaford]]'' ([[Judi Trott]])<br />Daughter of a Saxon nobleman believed to be killed in battle, Marion lives as a ward of Abbot Hugo, who is keen on gaining her inheritance. She first enters a nunnery, but when Simon de Belleme desires her as his bride (actually intending to sacrifice her), she escapes into Sherwood Forest, where she falls in love with and marries Robin Hood. She is later rescued from another unwanted marriage, by Robert of Huntingdon.\n* ''[[Friar Tuck]]'' ([[Phil Rose (actor)|Phil Rose]])<br />Chaplain to the Sheriff of Nottingham, he helps Lady Marion escape into Sherwood and joins the Merry Men, forming a fast friendship with Little John.\n* ''Nasir'' ([[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]])<br />A [[Saracen]] [[Assassination|assassin]], he was captured in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] by the Baron de Belleme and brought back to England to work as his henchman. After the Baron is killed by Robin, Nasir \u2013 having found respect for Robin during a crucial sword fight \u2013 decides to join the Merry Men. Throughout the series, he speaks very little.\n* ''[[Robin Hood#References to Robin as Earl of Huntington|Robert of Huntingdon]]'' ([[Jason Connery]])<br />Chosen as Robin's successor by Herne, Robert frees the Merry Men, but thinks himself inadequate to take up the mantle of the Hooded Man, despite his sympathies towards the downtrodden. He changes his mind after Lady Marion is taken by Lord Owen of Clun, and sets out to rescue her, reassembling the scattered Merry Men in the process. Though slightly insecure about taking over, in light of his predecessor, Robert proves to be an excellent leader. He later discovers that he is the half-brother of Guy of Gisburne.\n* ''[[Herne the Hunter]]'' ([[John Abineri]])<br />A shamanic figure who often incarnates a forest spirit representing the powers of light and goodness, inspiring and protecting the Hooded Man.\n\n===Main antagonists===\n* ''[[Sheriff of Nottingham|Robert de Rainault, Sheriff of Nottingham]]'' ([[Nickolas Grace]])<br />The king's chief representative in Nottingham and Sherwood, he is mainly interested in increasing his own power and wealth, competing with his younger brother, the Abbot. He considers his serfs mere chattels and hates women. He frequently relies on the brawn of Guy of Gisburne, whom he nonetheless disrespects and ridicules for his failures. His ambition results in strained relations with fellow noblemen (who consider him a \"dreadful little man\"), and with a succession of kings.\n* ''Hugo de Rainault, Abbot of St. Mary's'' ([[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]])<br />The sheriff's younger brother and highest-ranking church man in Nottingham, his main interest lies in acquiring land, especially that of his temporary ward, Lady Marion, and her father.\n* ''[[Guy of Gisbourne|Sir Guy of Gisburne]]'' ([[Robert Addie]])<br />Steward over the abbot's lands and gamekeeper of Sherwood, he is the chief military commander in the area. Self-identifying \"a warrior and not a courtier\", he is prone to disregard diplomacy and tact in favour of brute force but he is sometimes also able to use cunning. He resents the Sheriff for frequently taunting him and Robin for being the cause of these taunts. After a rocky start he gained the (limited) respect of Prince John. Later, it is revealed that he is the Earl of Huntingdon's illegitimate son and thus the second Robin's half-brother.\n* ''Baron Simon de Belleme'' ([[Anthony Valentine]])<br />A nobleman and also a devil worshipper. As master of the black arts, he controlled both Little John and Nasir, having captured the latter during the Crusades. He desires Lady Marion to sacrifice her to his demons. He is killed by Robin in Series One but his remaining disciples still work towards and actually succeed in his resurrection in Series Two. However he is not heard of or seen in Series Three.\n* ''[[John I of England|Prince John, later King of England]]'' ([[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]])\n* ''Gulnar'' ([[Richard O'Brien]])<br />A pagan sorcerer in the entourage of Lord Owen of Clun, he bewitches Lady Marion. After Owen is killed, he sets out to avenge Owen's death \u2013 and his own disgrace \u2013 on Robin and the Merry Men.\n\n===Other notable characters===\n* ''[[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart, King of England]] ([[John Rhys-Davies]])''<br />First encountered by Robin's band in Sherwood while returning to Nottingham from the Crusades in disguise. He initially appears to be an ally, removing de Rainault from the Sheriff's office and pardoning the outlaws. A warrior by nature and not inclined to remain in and properly govern England, Richard tries to get Robin to join his army, but when Robin, realising what sort of man Richard really is, publicly refuses, he orders Robin killed (unsuccessfully). He subsequently returns to Normandy and is killed by an enemy arrow; the news of his death reaches Nottingham while Prince John is visiting, and Gisburne is the first to declare John the new king.\n* ''The Old Prisoner'' ([[Stuart Linden]])<br />The mainstay of the Nottingham dungeon, he repeatedly refuses to flee, as he will not part with his pet rat Arthur, and advises all prisoners that the only way out is \"feet first\".\n* ''Edward of Wickham'' ([[Jeremy Bulloch]])<br />The headman of the village of Wickham, he and all of the villagers are sympathetic to Robin Hood's band and assist them occasionally.\n* ''Richard of Leaford'' ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]])<br />The father of Lady Marion, important Anglo-Saxon landowner and loyal follower of King Richard, he was captured during the Crusades and presumed dead. Later released by Saladin, he is captured and secretly brought to Nottingham by Prince John, but freed by Robin. Later, he is reconciled to King John (by paying a large sum of money, which also bought a pardon for Marion) and returns to his estates, which are still coveted by the de Rainault brothers.\n* ''Earl of Huntingdon'' ([[Michael Craig (actor)|Michael Craig]])<br />An important nobleman and a careful politician, he is father to the second Robin Hood and (unknown to him) also to Guy of Gisburne. When Robert becomes the new Robin Hood, the Earl disinherits him; the two later reconcile emotionally.\n* ''Lord Owen of Clun'' ([[Oliver Cotton]])<br />A half-Welsh nobleman holding strategically important lands on the Welsh border, he is courted by the Earl of Huntingdon on behalf of King John. Desiring Lady Marion as his wife, he has her kidnapped and bewitched, but he is outsmarted by the Merry Men and killed during their escape.\n* ''Meg of Wickham'' ([[Claire Toeman]])<br />Little John's girlfriend who lives in the outlaw-friendly village of Wickham.\n* ''[[Alan-a-Dale]]'' (Peter Hutchinson)<br />The former minstrel (and not a very good one!) to the Baron de Bracy, he is in love with the Baron's daughter Mildred.\n* ''Mildred de Bracy'' ([[Stephanie Tague]])<br />The object of an arranged marriage to the Sheriff of Nottingham (who is after her dowry money), but in love with Alan-a-Dale.\n* ''Morgwyn of Ravenscar'' ([[Rula Lenska]])<br />Outwardly the Abbess in charge of Ravenscar Abbey near the village of Uffcombe-on-the-Rock, she is secretly an evil witch and the leader of the Cauldron of [[Lucifer]], a powerful [[coven]] dedicated to the raising of [[Lucifer]]. She seeks the Seven Swords of Wayland to use their power, but one of them (Albion) is in Robin Hood's possession.

After beginning its crowdfunding campaign on [[Indiegogo]] in September 2015, the production set a goal of \u00a310,000 within 30 days to cover production costs; due to enthusiastic fan support, however, the goal was reached in just under 24 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Robin-Sherwood-TV-fans-help-audio-project-step/story-27826158-detail/story.html|title=Robin of Sherwood TV fans help audio project move a step closer|work=Nottingham Post|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919220409/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Robin-Sherwood-TV-fans-help-audio-project-step/story-27826158-detail/story.html|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The audio play was released in 2016, with proceeds going to the Sherwood Forest Trust and the [[British Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-07-23/robin-of-sherwood-to-return-with-stars-jason-connery-ray-winstone-judi-trott-and-clive-mantle |title=Robin of Sherwood to return with stars Jason Connery, Ray Winstone, Judi Trott and Clive Mantle |publisher=Radiotimes.com |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robin-of-sherwood.co.uk/about.html |title=Robin of Sherwood |publisher=Robin of Sherwood |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the play led to Spiteful Puppet announcing a set of four further 'Robin of Sherwood' plays for 2017, two featuring Jason Connery and two featuring Michael Praed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spitefulpuppet.com/shopp.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303122616/https://spitefulpuppet.com/shopp.php |archivedate=3 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This release was later pushed back to 2018 however a series of enhanced audiobooks was announced, with the first four being released in December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spitefulpuppet.com/all-good-things/|title=All Good Things...|last=|first=|date=14 September 2017|website=Spiteful Puppet|access-date=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Spiteful Puppet Robin of Sherwood Full Cast Audio Plays\n!Title\n!Author\n!Release Date\n!Notes / Chronology\n|-\n|\"The Knights of the Apocalypse (Part 1)\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spitefulpuppet.com/product/robin-of-sherwood-the-knights-of-the-apocalypse-deluxe-3-disc-box-set/|title=Robin of Sherwood - The Knights of the Apocalypse (Deluxe 3 disc box Limited Edition set)|accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> \n| rowspan=\"2\" |Richard Carpenter\n| rowspan=\"2\" |30 June 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Set after \"The Time of the Wolf\" and \"What Was Lost\"\n|-\n|\"The Knights of the Apocalypse (Part 2)\"\n|-\n|\"The Trial of John Little\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spitefulpuppet.com/product/robin-of-sherwood-a-new-adventure-4-disc-box-set/|title=Robin of Sherwood - A New Adventure|accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n|Tony Lee\n| rowspan=\"5\" |10 December 2018\n|Part of the \"Robin of Sherwood \u2013 A New Adventure\" boxset.

Created by [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard Carpenter]], it was produced by [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] in association with [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]], and ran from 1984 to 1986 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. In the United States it was shown on the premium cable TV channel [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows|editor1=Tim Brooks|editor2=Earle Marsh|date=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/completedirector0006broo/page/930 930]|isbn=978-0345397362|url=https://archive.org/details/completedirector0006broo/page/930|publisher=New York : Ballantine Books}}</ref> and, later, on [[PBS]]. The show starred [[Michael Praed]] and [[Jason Connery]] as two different incarnations of the title character. Unlike previous adaptations of the Robin Hood legend, ''Robin of Sherwood'' combined a gritty, authentic production design with elements of real-life history, 20th century fiction, and [[paganism|pagan]] myth.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\">[[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]], ''The Guinness Book of Classic British TV''.

Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], 2015. {{ISBN|0719098939}}, (pp. 138, 152\u2013165)</ref> For their next project, Carpenter and Knight decided to do an adaption of the Robin Hood legend. HTV and Goldcrest Films agreed to fund the series. ''Robin of Sherwood'' was more expensive than Carpenter and Knight's previous series; each episode of ''Robin of Sherwood'' cost around \u00a3500,000 to film.<ref name=\"jc\"/> There were three series, composed of a two-hour opening episode and 24 one-hour long episodes, although the pilot is sometimes screened as two one-hour episodes. The episodes comprising \"The Swords of Wayland\" were transmitted as one episode in the UK on their original screening, on a bank holiday weekend in 1985.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" /> The show was shot on film and almost entirely on location, mostly in the northeast and southwest of England; HTV West in Bristol was the base of operations, and most of the filming was done in and around Bristol and its surrounding counties. Primary locations were the Blaise Castle Estate in North Bristol and Vassals Park to the south. Some of the forest scenes were shot near [[Bradford-on-Avon]].\n\n''Robin of Sherwood'' is one of the most influential treatments of the core Robin Hood legend since ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', featuring a realistic period setting and introducing the character of a [[Saracen]] outlaw. Carpenter also added fantasy elements to the story (which had not appeared in previous TV versions of the legend). These included Robin's supernatural mentor [[Herne the Hunter]], Robin gaining a [[magic sword]] called Albion, and the outlaws battling against [[black magic]]ians and [[demon]]s as well as the Sheriff and his henchmen.<ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\n[[Michael Praed]] played Robin of Loxley in the first two series. His 'Merry Men' consisted of [[Will Scarlet]] ([[Ray Winstone]]), [[Little John]] ([[Clive Mantle]]), [[Friar Tuck]] ([[Phil Rose (actor)|Phil Rose]]), [[Much the Miller's Son|Much]] ([[Peter Llewellyn Williams]]), the [[Saracen]] Nasir ([[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]]) and [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]] ([[Judi Trott]]). He is also assisted by [[Herne the Hunter]] ([[John Abineri]]). As in the legend, Robin is opposed by the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] ([[Nickolas Grace]]) and [[Guy of Gisbourne|Guy of Gisburne]] ([[Robert Addie]]), as well as the Sheriff's brother Abbot Hugo ([[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]]) (representing all the greedy abbots in the legends).\n\nIn the opening story, ''Robin Hood and the Sorcerer'', Robin and his half-brother Much fall foul of the Sheriff's henchman, Sir Guy of Gisburne and are imprisoned in Nottingham Castle. They manage to escape, and gather a team of fellow rebels to fight back against the Sheriff's authority.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" /><ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\nAt the end of the second series, Robin of Loxley is killed, and Robert of Huntingdon (played by [[Jason Connery]]) replaces him as Robin Hood. The third series had the same episode count as the first two combined, so each incarnation of Robin featured in the same number of episodes.\n\nDuring the course of the third series, the new Robin discovers that he is the half-brother of his nemesis Guy of Gisburne (an idea suggested to Carpenter by the fact that both actors had blond hair). This particular story arc was never resolved, as the show's intended fourth (and final) series was never made.  The sudden cancellation also broke off Robin and Marion's intended marriage and left Marion at Halstead Abbey as a novice. Carpenter later said that had he known the third season would be last, that he would have married Robin and Marion.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" />\n\nAt the conclusion of Series Three, [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]] was forced to pull out of the venture, due to a downturn in the fortunes of their film arm. Goldcrest had been responsible for critical and commercial hits such as ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981) and ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982) earlier in the 1980s, but had hit a lean period with such films as ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' (1985) and ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986).  The series was expensive to produce; [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] could not afford to finance it alone, and so ''Robin of Sherwood'' came to an unexpected end.<ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\nAfter the series ended, Carpenter and Knight tried several times to revive the show. First Knight tried to gain funding from US producers for a fourth season, but was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"jc\" /> Carpenter then wrote a script for a feature film adaption of the series, and tried to get funding for it. However, the appearance of two Robin Hood films in 1991 (''[[Robin Hood (1991 British film)|Robin Hood]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' ) meant that Carpenter and Knight could not interest potential producers in a third Robin Hood film.<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" />\n\n==Temporal setting==\n''Robin of Sherwood'' is set in the usual period for Robin Hood stories \u2013 England in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, during the reigns of the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]] kings [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]].<ref name=\"tgbocbt\" /><ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\n''Robin Hood and the Sorcerer'' opens in the year 1180 AD, before flashing forward fifteen years ahead. The Season Two episode \"The Prophecy\" is set in the year 1199 AD, when Prince John becomes King of England.<ref name=\"jc\"/> In the Season Three episode \"The Time of the Wolf (Part One)\", the Sheriff dictates a legal document dated for the year 1211 AD, and the plot of the episode involves\nKing John raising an army to fight [[Llywelyn the Great|Llywelyn]] of Wales (a historical event which took place in that same year).<ref name=\"jc\"/>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===The Merry Men===\n* ''[[Robin Hood|Robin of Loxley]]'' ([[Michael Praed]])<br />Born the son of Anglo-Saxon nobleman Ailric of Loxley, Robin was raised by his uncle, the local miller, after Ailric was murdered. As an adult, Robin accepts the charge of Herne the Hunter and becomes the prophesied \"Hooded Man,\" champion of the oppressed. Hiding in Sherwood Forest, he assembles a number of friends and fights for freedom and justice.  He is killed at the end of Series Two by Norman crossbowmen, on the orders of the Sheriff of Nottingham \u2013 the same manner in which his father died.\n* ''[[Much the Miller's Son|Much]]'' ([[Peter Llewellyn Williams]])<br />Son of the miller who raised Robin, he admires Robin as his big brother. He is dubbed \"the half-wit\" by Guy of Gisburne, but he is more uneducated and naive than [[intellectual disability|intellectually impaired]]. He matures more after the first Robin's death.\n* ''[[Will Scarlet]]'' ([[Ray Winstone]])<br />Originally called Will Scathlock. When his wife, Elena, is raped and trampled to death with horses by mercenaries, he changes his name after slaying several of her killers. Hot-headed and filled with hatred of all things Norman, he is contrasted with the more collected Robin, which frequently leads to conflicts. He has a brother who owns an inn in Lichfield.\n* ''[[Little John]]'' ([[Clive Mantle]])<br />Originally John Little from [[Hathersage]], this giant of a man is placed under a spell by the Baron de Belleme. When Robin defeats the Baron and frees John from the spell, John becomes a loyal friend to Robin (and later, to Robert of Huntington). His hulking figure and immense strength is contrasted by his soft heart.\n* ''[[Maid Marian|Lady Marion of Leaford]]'' ([[Judi Trott]])<br />Daughter of a Saxon nobleman believed to be killed in battle, Marion lives as a ward of Abbot Hugo, who is keen on gaining her inheritance. She first enters a nunnery, but when Simon de Belleme desires her as his bride (actually intending to sacrifice her), she escapes into Sherwood Forest, where she falls in love with and marries Robin Hood. She is later rescued from another unwanted marriage, by Robert of Huntingdon.\n* ''[[Friar Tuck]]'' ([[Phil Rose (actor)|Phil Rose]])<br />Chaplain to the Sheriff of Nottingham, he helps Lady Marion escape into Sherwood and joins the Merry Men, forming a fast friendship with Little John.\n* ''Nasir'' ([[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]])<br />A [[Saracen]] [[Assassination|assassin]], he was captured in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] by the Baron de Belleme and brought back to England to work as his henchman. After the Baron is killed by Robin, Nasir \u2013 having found respect for Robin during a crucial sword fight \u2013 decides to join the Merry Men. Throughout the series, he speaks very little.\n* ''[[Robin Hood#References to Robin as Earl of Huntington|Robert of Huntingdon]]'' ([[Jason Connery]])<br />Chosen as Robin's successor by Herne, Robert frees the Merry Men, but thinks himself inadequate to take up the mantle of the Hooded Man, despite his sympathies towards the downtrodden. He changes his mind after Lady Marion is taken by Lord Owen of Clun, and sets out to rescue her, reassembling the scattered Merry Men in the process. Though slightly insecure about taking over, in light of his predecessor, Robert proves to be an excellent leader. He later discovers that he is the half-brother of Guy of Gisburne.\n* ''[[Herne the Hunter]]'' ([[John Abineri]])<br />A shamanic figure who often incarnates a forest spirit representing the powers of light and goodness, inspiring and protecting the Hooded Man.\n\n===Main antagonists===\n* ''[[Sheriff of Nottingham|Robert de Rainault, Sheriff of Nottingham]]'' ([[Nickolas Grace]])<br />The king's chief representative in Nottingham and Sherwood, he is mainly interested in increasing his own power and wealth, competing with his younger brother, the Abbot. He considers his serfs mere chattels and hates women. He frequently relies on the brawn of Guy of Gisburne, whom he nonetheless disrespects and ridicules for his failures. His ambition results in strained relations with fellow noblemen (who consider him a \"dreadful little man\"), and with a succession of kings.\n* ''Hugo de Rainault, Abbot of St. Mary's'' ([[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]])<br />The sheriff's younger brother and highest-ranking church man in Nottingham, his main interest lies in acquiring land, especially that of his temporary ward, Lady Marion, and her father.\n* ''[[Guy of Gisbourne|Sir Guy of Gisburne]]'' ([[Robert Addie]])<br />Steward over the abbot's lands and gamekeeper of Sherwood, he is the chief military commander in the area. Self-identifying \"a warrior and not a courtier\", he is prone to disregard diplomacy and tact in favour of brute force but he is sometimes also able to use cunning. He resents the Sheriff for frequently taunting him and Robin for being the cause of these taunts. After a rocky start he gained the (limited) respect of Prince John. Later, it is revealed that he is the Earl of Huntingdon's illegitimate son and thus the second Robin's half-brother.\n* ''Baron Simon de Belleme'' ([[Anthony Valentine]])<br />A nobleman and also a devil worshipper. As master of the black arts, he controlled both Little John and Nasir, having captured the latter during the Crusades. He desires Lady Marion to sacrifice her to his demons. He is killed by Robin in Series One but his remaining disciples still work towards and actually succeed in his resurrection in Series Two. However he is not heard of or seen in Series Three.\n* ''[[John I of England|Prince John, later King of England]]'' ([[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]])\n* ''Gulnar'' ([[Richard O'Brien]])<br />A pagan sorcerer in the entourage of Lord Owen of Clun, he bewitches Lady Marion. After Owen is killed, he sets out to avenge Owen's death \u2013 and his own disgrace \u2013 on Robin and the Merry Men.\n\n===Other notable characters===\n* ''[[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart, King of England]] ([[John Rhys-Davies]])''<br />First encountered by Robin's band in Sherwood while returning to Nottingham from the Crusades in disguise. He initially appears to be an ally, removing de Rainault from the Sheriff's office and pardoning the outlaws. A warrior by nature and not inclined to remain in and properly govern England, Richard tries to get Robin to join his army, but when Robin, realising what sort of man Richard really is, publicly refuses, he orders Robin killed (unsuccessfully). He subsequently returns to Normandy and is killed by an enemy arrow; the news of his death reaches Nottingham while Prince John is visiting, and Gisburne is the first to declare John the new king.\n* ''The Old Prisoner'' ([[Stuart Linden]])<br />The mainstay of the Nottingham dungeon, he repeatedly refuses to flee, as he will not part with his pet rat Arthur, and advises all prisoners that the only way out is \"feet first\".\n* ''Edward of Wickham'' ([[Jeremy Bulloch]])<br />The headman of the village of Wickham, he and all of the villagers are sympathetic to Robin Hood's band and assist them occasionally.\n* ''Richard of Leaford'' ([[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]])<br />The father of Lady Marion, important Anglo-Saxon landowner and loyal follower of King Richard, he was captured during the Crusades and presumed dead. Later released by Saladin, he is captured and secretly brought to Nottingham by Prince John, but freed by Robin. Later, he is reconciled to King John (by paying a large sum of money, which also bought a pardon for Marion) and returns to his estates, which are still coveted by the de Rainault brothers.\n* ''Earl of Huntingdon'' ([[Michael Craig (actor)|Michael Craig]])<br />An important nobleman and a careful politician, he is father to the second Robin Hood and (unknown to him) also to Guy of Gisburne. When Robert becomes the new Robin Hood, the Earl disinherits him; the two later reconcile emotionally.\n* ''Lord Owen of Clun'' ([[Oliver Cotton]])<br />A half-Welsh nobleman holding strategically important lands on the Welsh border, he is courted by the Earl of Huntingdon on behalf of King John. Desiring Lady Marion as his wife, he has her kidnapped and bewitched, but he is outsmarted by the Merry Men and killed during their escape.\n* ''Meg of Wickham'' ([[Claire Toeman]])<br />Little John's girlfriend who lives in the outlaw-friendly village of Wickham.\n* ''[[Alan-a-Dale]]'' (Peter Hutchinson)<br />The former minstrel (and not a very good one!) to the Baron de Bracy, he is in love with the Baron's daughter Mildred.\n* ''Mildred de Bracy'' ([[Stephanie Tague]])<br />The object of an arranged marriage to the Sheriff of Nottingham (who is after her dowry money), but in love with Alan-a-Dale.\n* ''Morgwyn of Ravenscar'' ([[Rula Lenska]])<br />Outwardly the Abbess in charge of Ravenscar Abbey near the village of Uffcombe-on-the-Rock, she is secretly an evil witch and the leader of the Cauldron of [[Lucifer]], a powerful [[coven]] dedicated to the raising of [[Lucifer]]. She seeks the Seven Swords of Wayland to use their power, but one of them (Albion) is in Robin Hood's possession. She succeeds in bewitching the Merry Men and turning them against Robin and Marion for a time, but Robin foils her plans, and she is ultimately destroyed by her own demon riders.\n* ''Bertrand de Nivelles'' ([[Oliver Tobias]])<br />The leader of a band of mercenaries called in by Guy of Gisburne to destroy Robin Hood and his men.\n* ''Ralph of Huntingdon'' ([[Trevor Clarke]])<br />A young captain who briefly becomes the Sheriff's new favourite.  He is killed by Guy of Gisburne at Castle Belleme.\n* ''Isadora'' ([[Cathryn Harrison]])<br />The daughter of Lord Agravaine and privy to the secret of [[Caerleon]].\n* ''Lord Agravaine'' ([[Cyril Cusack]])<br />Robert of Huntington's godfather and guardian of a secret treasure in the castle of [[Caerleon]].\n* ''Philip Mark'' ([[Lewis Collins]])<br />The brutal former Head Forester of Lincolnshire who is appointed by King John to take Robert de Rainault's place as Sheriff of Nottingham; his tenure as Sheriff is extremely brief.\n* ''Sarak'' ([[Valentine Pelka]])<br />A Saracen with a scarred face hidden by a mask, he is the right-hand man of Philip Mark and a former ''[[Order of Assassins|hashashin]]'' who betrayed the brotherhood's secrets for money. He bears a grudge against Nasir, who was sent after him to kill him, but only scarred him.\n* ''Roger de Carnac'' ([[Matt Frewer]])<br />On King John's orders, he and his men impersonate the second Robin and the Merry Men in a plan to discredit them with the people.\n* ''Queen Hadwisa'' ([[Patricia Hodge]])<br />King John's first wife who is unceremoniously cast aside when King John chooses the 11-year-old Isabella as his new wife and who hatches a complex plot to depose John.\n* ''[[Adam Bell]]'' (Bryan Marshall)<br />A famous outlaw who returns to Nottingham from the North after many years.\n* ''Edgar of Huntingdon'' ([[Ian Ogilvy]])<br />The second Robin's uncle, who has a hidden agenda against his brother, the Earl.\n* ''Mad Mab'' ([[Annabelle Lee (actress)|Annabelle Lee]])<br />A madwoman accused of witchcraft, and defended by the Merry Men.  Ultimately it is revealed that she is indeed a witch.\n* ''Grendel'' ([[James Coombes (actor)|James Coombes]])<br />Gulnar's right-hand man under Owen of Clun, he later becomes the fanatical leader of the Sons of Fenris.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n!
