It is the successor to [[Windows Mail]] in [[Windows Vista]], which was the successor to [[Outlook Express]] in [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows 98]]. Windows Live Mail is designed to run on [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]], but is also compatible with [[Windows 8]]<ref name=\"system-requirements\">{{cite web|title=Windows Essentials 2012 system requirements|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-essentials-2012-system-requirements|website=Microsoft Windows Help|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> and [[Windows 10]], even though Microsoft bundles a new email client, named [[Mail (Windows)|Windows Mail]], with the latter.<ref name=\"intowindows\">{{cite web|title=Download Windows Live Mail For Windows 10|url=http://www.intowindows.com/download-windows-live-mail-for-windows-10/|website=Into Windows|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105111532/http://www.intowindows.com/download-windows-live-mail-for-windows-10/|archivedate=5 Jan 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nSince around 2013, serious problems with Windows Live Mail 2012 (but not with Windows Live Mail 2011) have been reported on various blog sites (including Microsoft forums). One problem is that deleted emails keep returning day after day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Live Mail 2012 Can't delete emails |url=https://www.windows10forums.com/threads/live-mail-2012-cant-delete-emails.10486/ |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref> Another development that caused complaints is the Live Mail '''Sent''' folder erroneously containing the name of the '''Sender''' rather than the '''Recipient''' in the '''To''' column, while omitting the sender's account name in the  '''Account''' column (as the fault only affects that folder, a workaround is to move sent items into a new folder, named - for example - \"Sent 2019\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Windows Live Mail sent folder not showing recipient |url=https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-live-mail-sent-folder-not-showing/3b84ed96-0911-4d5a-84c7-7765fa427386 |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref> Discussions on the forums have provided no clear solutions to these issues.\n\nWindows Live Mail moved away from the older Microsoft mail programs, such as Outlook Express, which stored all e-mails comprising a folder (such as the Inbox) in a single .dbx file. In order to provide greater flexibility (and to avoid the problem where corruption of a single .dbx file could delete multiple emails), Windows Live Mail stores each email message as a separate .eml file. Only the folder structure is maintained in a single database file, using the ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) database structure, named Mail.MSMessageStore (which also holds some metadata for each .eml file on the system, so can be a huge file). The program also maintains a backup copy of that file, in the Backup sub-folder, so problems are rare. At a pinch, the Mail.MSMessageStore file can be recreated from the data in the .eml files.\n\n==History==\n===Version 12 (Wave 2)===\nThe first version of Windows Live Mail was released on 6 November 2007. The Windows Live Mail version numbering starts at 12 because this application is an advancement of Windows Mail, not an entirely new application. Windows Live Mail is developed by the same team that wrote Windows Mail.\n\nWindows Live Mail has all of the features of Windows Mail. It also adds the following new features:\n* Support for Web-based email accounts including [[Hotmail]], [[Gmail]], and [[Yahoo! Mail]] Plus.\n* A different user interface which matches the other Windows Live \"Wave 2\" applications.\n* Synchronization with [[Windows Live Contacts]].\n* Support for [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds. Notable features include the ability to reply directly via email to the author of an item that appears in an RSS feed, and the ability to aggregate multiple feeds into a single folder. The RSS functionality requires [[Internet Explorer 7]] or newer.\n* Multi-line message lists.\n* [[Emoticon]]s can be used in emails and other functions.\n* In-line spell checking.\n* Separate inbox folders for different POP accounts.\n* Support for sending picture files in emails through the ''Photo email'' feature, which uploads pictures to a web-based service and sends the URL and thumbnails in the mail. It can also perform basic photo correction and apply different border effects to pictures.\n\n====Comparison with Windows Mail====\nWhile Windows Live Mail is the successor to [[Windows Mail]] on [[Windows Vista]], there were several differences in functionality between Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail when it was released in 2007. These include:\n* Ability to view and edit HTML email by source has been removed in Windows Live Mail\n* Ability to set margins has been removed\n* Scripted Stationery for Windows Live Mail 2011 is available from Cloudeight Stationery\n* Locally installed help documentation is not available for Windows Live Mail\n* Support for using different mailboxes with separate folders (inbox, junk and so on) was added in Windows Live Mail\n* Support for [[DeltaSync]], a proprietary protocol for access to [[Windows Live Hotmail]] email accounts, was added in Windows Live Mail\n* Support for [[WebDAV]], a HTTP-based protocol (web-based email accounts), developed for Outlook Express, was added in Windows Live Mail\n* Ability to perform a full-text index-based search in Windows Live Mail if [[Windows Search]] is installed\n\n===Version 2009 (Wave 3)===\nA beta version of Windows Live Mail was released in September 2008. It features a new user interface which, like the other Windows Live \"Wave 3\" beta applications released at the same time, has no icons on the toolbar buttons. It also features a new calendaring function; calendar events automatically synchronize between Windows Live Mail and the Web-based [[Windows Live Calendar]]. A \"beta refresh\" version of Windows Live Mail was released on 15 December 2008, and this version was officially released as the final version on 8 January 2009. This was the last version to support Windows XP.<ref name=dl-op>{{cite web|title=Windows Essentials download options|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/download-windows-essentials|website=microsoft.com|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nVersion 2009 still contains the same MIME problem with signed mail<ref>[news://msnews.microsoft.com/e2chbtd8JHA.3556@TK2MSFTNGP04.phx.gbl newsgroup example showing a use of both OpenPGP/MIME and S/MIME]</ref> that [[Outlook Express#Handling of PGP/MIME signed messages|Outlook Express]] has.\n\n===Version 2011 (Wave 4)===\nThe first beta became available on 24 June 2010, sporting [[ribbon (computing)|ribbons]] in the user interface and a calendar pane. The second beta came with a new start-up screen and other minor updates. The final version of Windows Live Mail 2011 was released on 30 September 2010, along with the [[Windows Live Essentials|Windows Live Essentials 2011]] suite. It requires Windows Vista or newer; Windows XP is no longer supported.<ref name=dl-op />\n\n===Version 2012 (Wave 5)===\nOn 7 August 2012, Microsoft released a new version of [[Windows Essentials]] 2012, which included Windows Live Mail 2012. It requires Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8,<ref name=\"system-requirements\"/> or Windows 10.<ref name=intowindows/> Windows Vista is no longer supported.<ref name=dl-op /> \n\nThere are no significant differences from Windows Live Mail 2011, save the discontinuance of support for Vista and DeltaSync. The only technical difference is the replacement in Windows Live Mail 2012 of DeltaSync by Exchange ActiveSync. User forums report significant problems with the upgrade software, KB3093594, so it is recommended not to attempt to upgrade from Windows Live Mail 2011,<ref>[https://messengergeek.wordpress.com/2015/12/11/the-craziness-of-windows-live-mail-patch-kb3093594/ The craziness of Windows Live Mail patch KB3093594]</ref><ref>Patch KB 3093594 reported as freezing Windows</ref> and there are no benefits in doing so, as both versions are identical, unless you desire to use Exchange ActiveSync. But by switching from Deltasync to IMAP, Windows Live Mail 2011 continues to work, without needing either Windows Live Mail 2012 or the upgrade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-live-mail-stopped-syncing-hotmail-outlook-and-other-microsoft-email-accounts/|title=Replace DeltaSync with IMAP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828200448/https://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-live-mail-stopped-syncing-hotmail-outlook-and-other-microsoft-email-accounts/|archivedate=28 August 2017|url-status=live}} This reference says to use port 25 for SMTP but you may need to use port 587.</ref>\n\n===Replacement===\nMicrosoft announced that [[Outlook.com]] was discontinuing support for Windows Live Mail during 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.office.com/2016/05/05/using-windows-live-mail-2012-with-outlook-com-time-to-update-your-email-application/|title=Using Windows Live Mail 2012 with Outlook.com?

It is the successor to [[Windows Mail]] in [[Windows Vista]], which was the successor to [[Outlook Express]] in [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows 98]].

One problem is that deleted emails keep returning day after day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Live Mail 2012 Can't delete emails |url=https://www.windows10forums.com/threads/live-mail-2012-cant-delete-emails.10486/ |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref> Another development that caused complaints is the Live Mail '''Sent''' folder erroneously containing the name of the '''Sender''' rather than the '''Recipient''' in the '''To''' column, while omitting the sender's account name in the  '''Account''' column (as the fault only affects that folder, a workaround is to move sent items into a new folder, named - for example - \"Sent 2019\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Windows Live Mail sent folder not showing recipient |url=https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-live-mail-sent-folder-not-showing/3b84ed96-0911-4d5a-84c7-7765fa427386 |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref> Discussions on the forums have provided no clear solutions to these issues.\n\nWindows Live Mail moved away from the older Microsoft mail programs, such as Outlook Express, which stored all e-mails comprising a folder (such as the Inbox) in a single .dbx file. In order to provide greater flexibility (and to avoid the problem where corruption of a single .dbx file could delete multiple emails), Windows Live Mail stores each email message as a separate .eml file. Only the folder structure is maintained in a single database file, using the ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) database structure, named Mail.MSMessageStore (which also holds some metadata for each .eml file on the system, so can be a huge file). The program also maintains a backup copy of that file, in the Backup sub-folder, so problems are rare. At a pinch, the Mail.MSMessageStore file can be recreated from the data in the .eml files.\n\n==History==\n===Version 12 (Wave 2)===\nThe first version of Windows Live Mail was released on 6 November 2007. The Windows Live Mail version numbering starts at 12 because this application is an advancement of Windows Mail, not an entirely new application. Windows Live Mail is developed by the same team that wrote Windows Mail.\n\nWindows Live Mail has all of the features of Windows Mail. It also adds the following new features:\n* Support for Web-based email accounts including [[Hotmail]], [[Gmail]], and [[Yahoo! Mail]] Plus.\n* A different user interface which matches the other Windows Live \"Wave 2\" applications.\n* Synchronization with [[Windows Live Contacts]].\n* Support for [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds. Notable features include the ability to reply directly via email to the author of an item that appears in an RSS feed, and the ability to aggregate multiple feeds into a single folder. The RSS functionality requires [[Internet Explorer 7]] or newer.\n* Multi-line message lists.\n* [[Emoticon]]s can be used in emails and other functions.\n* In-line spell checking.\n* Separate inbox folders for different POP accounts.\n* Support for sending picture files in emails through the ''Photo email'' feature, which uploads pictures to a web-based service and sends the URL and thumbnails in the mail. It can also perform basic photo correction and apply different border effects to pictures.\n\n====Comparison with Windows Mail====\nWhile Windows Live Mail is the successor to [[Windows Mail]] on [[Windows Vista]], there were several differences in functionality between Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail when it was released in 2007. These include:\n* Ability to view and edit HTML email by source has been removed in Windows Live Mail\n* Ability to set margins has been removed\n* Scripted Stationery for Windows Live Mail 2011 is available from Cloudeight Stationery\n* Locally installed help documentation is not available for Windows Live Mail\n* Support for using different mailboxes with separate folders (inbox, junk and so on) was added in Windows Live Mail\n* Support for [[DeltaSync]], a proprietary protocol for access to [[Windows Live Hotmail]] email accounts, was added in Windows Live Mail\n* Support for [[WebDAV]], a HTTP-based protocol (web-based email accounts), developed for Outlook Express, was added in Windows Live Mail\n* Ability to perform a full-text index-based search in Windows Live Mail if [[Windows Search]] is installed\n\n===Version 2009 (Wave 3)===\nA beta version of Windows Live Mail was released in September 2008. It features a new user interface which, like the other Windows Live \"Wave 3\" beta applications released at the same time, has no icons on the toolbar buttons. It also features a new calendaring function; calendar events automatically synchronize between Windows Live Mail and the Web-based [[Windows Live Calendar]]. A \"beta refresh\" version of Windows Live Mail was released on 15 December 2008, and this version was officially released as the final version on 8 January 2009. This was the last version to support Windows XP.<ref name=dl-op>{{cite web|title=Windows Essentials download options|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/download-windows-essentials|website=microsoft.com|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nVersion 2009 still contains the same MIME problem with signed mail<ref>[news://msnews.microsoft.com/e2chbtd8JHA.3556@TK2MSFTNGP04.phx.gbl newsgroup example showing a use of both OpenPGP/MIME and S/MIME]</ref> that [[Outlook Express#Handling of PGP/MIME signed messages|Outlook Express]] has.\n\n===Version 2011 (Wave 4)===\nThe first beta became available on 24 June 2010, sporting [[ribbon (computing)|ribbons]] in the user interface and a calendar pane. The second beta came with a new start-up screen and other minor updates. The final version of Windows Live Mail 2011 was released on 30 September 2010, along with the [[Windows Live Essentials|Windows Live Essentials 2011]] suite. It requires Windows Vista or newer; Windows XP is no longer supported.<ref name=dl-op />\n\n===Version 2012 (Wave 5)===\nOn 7 August 2012, Microsoft released a new version of [[Windows Essentials]] 2012, which included Windows Live Mail 2012. It requires Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8,<ref name=\"system-requirements\"/> or Windows 10.<ref name=intowindows/> Windows Vista is no longer supported.<ref name=dl-op /> \n\nThere are no significant differences from Windows Live Mail 2011, save the discontinuance of support for Vista and DeltaSync. The only technical difference is the replacement in Windows Live Mail 2012 of DeltaSync by Exchange ActiveSync. User forums report significant problems with the upgrade software, KB3093594, so it is recommended not to attempt to upgrade from Windows Live Mail 2011,<ref>[https://messengergeek.wordpress.com/2015/12/11/the-craziness-of-windows-live-mail-patch-kb3093594/ The craziness of Windows Live Mail patch KB3093594]</ref><ref>Patch KB 3093594 reported as freezing Windows</ref> and there are no benefits in doing so, as both versions are identical, unless you desire to use Exchange ActiveSync. But by switching from Deltasync to IMAP, Windows Live Mail 2011 continues to work, without needing either Windows Live Mail 2012 or the upgrade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-live-mail-stopped-syncing-hotmail-outlook-and-other-microsoft-email-accounts/|title=Replace DeltaSync with IMAP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828200448/https://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-live-mail-stopped-syncing-hotmail-outlook-and-other-microsoft-email-accounts/|archivedate=28 August 2017|url-status=live}} This reference says to use port 25 for SMTP but you may need to use port 587.</ref>\n\n===Replacement===\nMicrosoft announced that [[Outlook.com]] was discontinuing support for Windows Live Mail during 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.office.com/2016/05/05/using-windows-live-mail-2012-with-outlook-com-time-to-update-your-email-application/|title=Using Windows Live Mail 2012 with Outlook.com?

He also served on [[Ammanford Urban District Council]].\n\n==Parliamentary candidate==\nIn 1926, Sir [[Alfred Mond]] the Liberal MP for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] defected to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] over the issue of land policy and the proposal by [[David Lloyd George]] that some agricultural land be nationalised.  The policy had been set out in the publication ''Land and the Nation'' or the ''Green Book'' in October 1925 but it caused great debate in the Liberal Party and another MP, [[Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Hilton Young]], who sat for [[Norwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Norwich]] also left the party for the Tories along with a couple of former MPs.<ref>Roy Douglas, ''Liberals: The History of the Liberal and Liberal Democrat Parties''; Hambledon and London, 2005 p212</ref> Mond decided not to resign and fight a by-election but there was an election to choose a successor to him to stand as a Liberal at the next election. This was initially contested by six candidates but four withdrew and the choice was between Jones and [[Richard Thomas Evans]] of Cardiff. Jones won in a close contest by 149 votes to 147, having made clear he was an opponent of the ''Green Book'' land policy whereas Evans, who had worked closely with Lloyd George on other Liberal policies, was in favour.<ref>The Times, 8.3.26</ref> Evans however was later become MP for Carmarthen, sitting from 1931\u201335. At the time of the by-election, and in other sources referring to him in 1882, Jones was described variously as Lieutenant-Colonel or Colonel Jones but no indication of his army history is available in those sources.\n\n==Carmarthen by-election, 1928==\n{{main|Carmarthen by-election, 1928}}\nIn the event Jones did not have to wait until the next general election as Mond accepted a [[peerage]] in 1928 and caused a [[by-election]] in Carmarthen. At the previous general election in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]] the Conservatives had not fielded a candidate and Mond had won easily in a straight fight with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].  However this time, they put up the barrister, Sir Courtenay Mansel,  another escapee from the Liberal Party in 1926 who had been MP for [[Penryn and Falmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn and Falmouth]] from 1922\u201323 but who had local connections in Carmarthenshire and was also a [[Justice of the Peace]] there.  The Labour candidate was the Welsh barrister (and future MP) Dan Hopkin. There was briefly the prospect of a four-cornered contest when the [[Plaid Cymru|National Party of Wales]] announced their intention to stand a candidate but in the end they decided not to fight.<ref>The Times, 7.5.28</ref> The by-election took place on 28 June 1928 and Jones emerged as the narrow winner.  Jones had made his opposition to the land policy a feature of the campaign in an attempt to retain the support of the division's farmers, many of whom shared Mond's concern about the nationalisation proposals. In any event the ''Green Book'' had by this time been withdrawn as a full statement of Liberal land policy.<ref>The Times, 28.6.28</ref> Instead, Jones promoted as the main object of Liberal land policy the desire to give security of tenure to tenant farmers.  Many of those reliant on the land for their livelihood seemed to prefer the less radical solution of the government of [[Stanley Baldwin]] for the relief of rates on agricultural land.<ref>The Times, 27.6.28</ref>\n\n==Polling==\nPolling day itself was affected by bad weather with heavy rain dampening the candidates\u2019 enthusiasm on the day and, it was reported, having a detrimental effect on turnout.<ref>The Times, 29.6.28</ref> However the official figures showed a turnout of 76.6% an improvement over the previous general election when only 68% had turned out to vote.<ref>C Cook & J Ramsden, ''By-elections in British Politics''; UCL Press, 1997 p275</ref> In the end, Jones had majority of just 47 votes over his Labour opponent, polling 10,201 to Hopkins's 10,154 with Mansel for the Tories on 8,361. The drastic reduction in the size of the majority, even taking into account the fact that the Tories contested the seat, was a disappointment to the Liberals. Perhaps Liberal supporters felt they had been taken for granted by their party.  Of their two previous MPs one had resigned to cause a by-election to find a seat for Sir Alfred Mond and then Mond himself had defected to the Tories without standing down to seek a mandate for his new party.\n\n==Later elections==\nThe by-election did presage a change in political fortunes in the constituency. At the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] Jones lost the seat to Dan Hopkin in another three-cornered fight.  Evans regained it for the Liberals in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] but lost to Hopkin in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. The seat returned to the Liberals in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] when it was won by Sir [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] but was recaptured for Labour in 1957 at the by-election which was caused by Hopkin Morris\u2019 death; the successful Labour candidate being Lady [[Megan Lloyd George]] who had herself defected from Liberal to Labour.\n\n==Death==\nJones died suddenly at [[Llanwrtyd Wells]] on 24 May 1934, aged 76.

There was briefly the prospect of a four-cornered contest when the [[Plaid Cymru|National Party of Wales]] announced their intention to stand a candidate but in the end they decided not to fight.<ref>The Times, 7.5.28</ref> The by-election took place on 28 June 1928 and Jones emerged as the narrow winner.  Jones had made his opposition to the land policy a feature of the campaign in an attempt to retain the support of the division\u2019s farmers, many of whom shared Mond\u2019s concern about the nationalisation proposals. In any event the ''Green Book'' had by this time been withdrawn as a full statement of Liberal land policy.<ref>The Times, 28.6.28</ref> Instead, Jones promoted as the main object of Liberal land policy the desire to give security of tenure to tenant farmers.  Many of those reliant on the land for their livelihood seemed to prefer the less radical solution of the government of [[Stanley Baldwin]] for the relief of rates on agricultural land.<ref>The Times, 27.6.28</ref>\n\n==Polling==\nPolling day itself was affected by bad weather with heavy rain dampening the candidates\u2019 enthusiasm on the day and, it was reported, having a detrimental effect on turnout.<ref>The Times, 29.6.28</ref> However the official figures showed a turnout of 76.6% an improvement over the previous general election when only 68% had turned out to vote.<ref>C Cook & J Ramsden, ''By-elections in British Politics''; UCL Press, 1997 p275</ref> In the end, Jones had majority of just 47 votes over his Labour opponent, polling 10,201 to Hopkins\u2019s 10,154 with Mansel for the Tories on 8,361. The drastic reduction in the size of the majority, even taking into account the fact that the Tories contested the seat, was a disappointment to the Liberals. Perhaps Liberal supporters felt they had been taken for granted by their party.  Of their two previous MPs one had resigned to cause a by-election to find a seat for Sir Alfred Mond and then Mond himself had defected to the Tories without standing down to seek a mandate for his new party.\n\n==Later elections==\nThe by-election did presage a change in political fortunes in the constituency. At the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] Jones lost the seat to Dan Hopkin in another three-cornered fight.  Evans regained it for the Liberals in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]] but lost to Hopkin in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. The seat returned to the Liberals in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] when it was won by Sir [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] but was recaptured for Labour in 1957 at the by-election which was caused by Hopkin Morris\u2019 death; the successful Labour candidate being Lady [[Megan Lloyd George]] who had herself defected from Liberal to Labour.\n\n==Death==\nJones died suddenly at [[Llanwrtyd Wells]] on 24 May 1934, aged 76. He died intestate, leaving an estate of gross value \u00a375,950.<ref>The Times, 27.7.34</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Other sources==\n* ''Who was Who'', OUP 2007\n* [http://www.terrynorm.ic24.net/aberlash.htm Ammanford, Carmarthenshire web site \u2013 An Aberlash Millionaire<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.terrynorm.ic24.net ''An Aberlash Millionaire: The Rags To Riches Life of David Davies, Aberlash''\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Hansard-contribs | mr-william-jones-2 | William Nathaniel Jones }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]]\n | years  = [[1928 Carmarthen by-election|1928]] \u2013 [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]\n | before = [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Alfred Mond]]\n | after  = [[Daniel Hopkin]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, William Nathaniel}}\n[[Category:1858 births]]\n[[Category:1934 deaths]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1924\u20131929]]\n[[Category:Members of Carmarthenshire County Council]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Carmarthenshire constituencies]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nathaniel_Jones"}
