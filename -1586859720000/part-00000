In the Qualifying Final against Premiership favourites the Brisbane Lions, Didak came on in the last quarter and kicked two legendary goals to win the match which remain Collingwood folklore to this day. \n\nIn 2005, Didak's season was disrupted by injuries and problems.

Didak placed 4th in the club's Best & Fairest, and was a hero of Collingwood's 15th premiership.\n\nDidak started off 2011 strongly in a dominant Collingwood side, however he began to succumb to injuries which became a common theme until he was delisted at the end of the 2013 season after 13 seasons.<ref>[http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2013-09-10/collingwood-makes-six-list-changes Collingwood makes six list changes]</ref>\n\n== Post AFL career ==\nDidak played one game for the [[Glenorchy Football Club]] in the [[Tasmanian Football League|TSL]] in 2014.<ref>http://www.themercury.com.au/sport/afl/alan-didak-hoping-to-turn-on-show-for-glenorchy-fans/news-story/12028bf6699d45a7933f1233402faa88</ref>\n\nDidak finished his AFL Career with 218 games and 274 goals, placing him 8th on the all-time Collingwood goalkicking list.

According to police, Didak left the [[Spearmint Rhino]] with Hudson, where Hudson then allegedly fired random shots before travelling to the Hells Angels' East County Chapter headquarters in [[Campbellfield]]. Police believe that Didak was later dropped off near Southbank after the shooting incidents about 6.00am.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/pies-star-quizzed-on-shooting/2007/06/28/1182624084999.html Magpie star regrets night out with accused CBD killer \u2013 National \u2013 theage.com.au]</ref>\n\nOn 3 August 2008, Didak was a passenger in a car being driven by intoxicated teammate [[Heath Shaw]] which collided with another parked car.

According to police, Didak left the [[Spearmint Rhino]] with Hudson, where Hudson then allegedly fired random shots before travelling to the Hells Angels' East County Chapter headquarters in [[Campbellfield]].

In 1994, Sakalai managed to win the LKAL Championship and in June 1994, the [[Lietuvos krep\u0161inio lyga|Lithuanian Basketball League]] (LKL) Committee accepted them into the LKL.\n\n===LKL debut (1994\u20131995)===\nIn their debut season, Sakalai finished in 8th place (17 wins and 23 losses), and were coached by [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Sakalauskas]]. Their first win was against [[:lt:Kauno NECA|NECA Kaunas]], 100\u201388. In the playoffs, Sakalai lost the series 0\u20132 in the first round to [[BC \u017dalgiris]]. [[Andrius Giedraitis]] lead the team in scoring. Sakalai also played in the [[FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup]], qualifying, but losing to [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios Athens]] in the second round.\n\n===LKL and Kora\u0107 Cup (1995\u20131999)===\nIn the 1995\u201396 LKL season, Sakalai finished in 5th place, lead by players like Giedraitis and [[Gintautas \u0160ivickas]], and lost to favorites [[LSU-Atletas|Atletas Kaunas]] 0-2 in the playoffs. In the 1996-97 LKL season, Giedraitis lead the LKL in scoring, though Sakalai were largely inconsistent, finishing in 7th place, losing to [[BC Olimpas]] in the playoffs, 1-2, though giving fight to the team that eventually reached the LKL finals. During the season, [[Ram\u016bnas \u0160i\u0161kauskas]] made his pro debut in the LKL. Players like [[Erikas Ku\u010diauskas]], [[Rolandas Matulis]] and [[Arnas Kazlauskas]], who played in the team since the first LKL season, also had their best seasons to date. Throught this time, Sakalai also had a rivalry with the other Vilnius team, [[BC Statyba]], with Sakalai winning most of their matches. \n\nIn the 1997-98 LKL season, Sakalai had their best season to date. Under coach Sakalauskas, coaching the team since their LKL debut, Sakalai finished second in the LKL regular season standings. Giedraitis lead the team in scoring once again, and \u0160i\u0161kauskas showed a lot of improvement in his second LKL season. Sakalai also played in the Baltic Cup tournament. In the playoffs of the LKL, however, Sakalai lost to Ateltas Kaunas 0-2 in the semifinals, preventing the team from reaching the LKL finals. In the bronze medal series, Sakalai lost to the new team in Vilnius, [[BC Rytas|Statyba-Lietuvos rytas]], in somewhat a shocker, 1-2. Sakalai finished in 4th place. \n\nIn the 1998-99 LKL season, coach Sakalauskas left the team during the season, becoming head coach for the rival [[BC Lietuvos rytas]] team. Giedraitis also left the team to sign with Lietuvos rytas, and during the season, \u0160i\u0161kauskas, who became the team leader in Sakalai, also left to sign with Lietuvos rytas. Assistan coach [[R\u016btenis Paulauskas]] became the head coach for the team, at just 27 years old. Sakalai then signed [[Virginijus Sirvydis]], [[Egidijus Mikalaj\u016bnas]] and [[Rolandas Skaisgirys]], who were let go by Lietuvos rytas. Sirvydis, in particular, became the new team leader. [[Dainius \u0160alenga]] made his LKL debut during the season. In the LKL, Sakalai finished only in 6th place in the regular season, but eliminated the heavilly favored [[BC Alita]] in the quaterfinals 2-1. In the semifinals, Sakalai gave fight, but lost to Lietuvos rytas 0-2 in the semifinals. In the bronze medal series, once again underdogs, shocked everyone again, defeating [[BC \u0160iauliai]] 2-1, winning the final match away, and finishing in 3rd place in the LKL. The win also helped Sakalai qualify for the [[Saporta Cup]] for the next season.\n\n=== Saporta Cup, LKL and BBL (1999\u20132008)===\nThe 1999-00 season was a very tumultuos one for Sakalai, who started the season by building a very powerful team for the Saporta Cup. By December, however, coach Paulauskas had resigned, and much of the team had also left, with point guards [[Jemeil Rich]] and [[Rolandas Jarutis]], who signed with rivals Lietuvos rytas, being the most significant. Assistant coach and former player in the first LKL seasons [[Linas \u0160alkus]] became the new head coach. Sakalai recovered, thanks to solid play from Sirvydis, Matulis, \u0160alenga and Skaisgirys. Sakalai managed to qualify for the Saporta Cup playoffs, giving fight, but succumbing to [[KK Split]] in the playoffs. In the LKL, Sakalai once again reached the semifinals, again losing to Lietuvos rytas, 0-3. Sakalai once again faced [[BC \u0160iauliai]] in the bronze medal series, holding homecourt advantage this season, but this time, \u0160iauliai won the series 3-1, with Sakalai finishing in 4th place. Sakalai still qualified for the Saporta Cup the next season. [[Saulius Kuzminskas]] made his LKL debut during the season. \n\nDuring the 2000-01 LKL season, coached by \u0160alkus again, Sakalai remained stable throught the season. \u0160alenga, playing his best year, left during the season to sign with [[BC \u017dalgiris|\u017dalgiris Kaunas]]. [[Simas Jasaitis]] made his LKL debut for the team. Sakalai were eliminated from the Saporta Cup after the regular season. In the LKL, Skaisgirys and Matulis led the team. Sakalai once again faced \u0160iauliai in the playoffs, this time in the quaterfinals, losing the series 0-2 and finishing in 5th place for the season. Throught the next 2 seasons, in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, Sakalai were once again competitive, finishing in 6th and 5th places repectably. [[Mindaugas Lukauskis]], who played in the team during the 2001-2002 season, had his best year and breakout season with Sakalai. \n\nIn 2003\u201304 and 2004\u201305 LKL seasons, Sakalai were one away from 3rd place, but lost to [[BC \u0160iauliai|\u0160iauliai]] both times. Also, in 2005, Sakalai competed in the first [[Baltic Basketball League]] season, finishing in 6th place. During this time, Sakalai had formed a core with longtime team players like Matulis, Skaisgirys and Ku\u010diauskas, also players like Eligijus Redeckas, also signing talented young players like [[Renaldas Seibutis]] and [[Steponas Babrauskas]], who became leaders of the team. [[Martynas Gecevi\u010dius]] made his LKL debut during the 2004-2005 season. \n\nOver the next few seasons, however, results started to decline. During the 2005-06 season, Sakalai still had a solid season in the LKL, finishing in 5th place and in the BBL, where they finished in 8th place, just narrowly missing qualification for the Final Six tournament. During the season, Skaisgirys left the team, though the team core still remained. During the 2006-07 season, Sakalai signed talented young players like [[Mindaugas Kuzminskas]], [[Vytautas \u0160arakauskas]], [[Simas Buterlevi\u010dius]], [[Aidas Viskontas]] and [[Justas Sinica]]. Redeckas had retired, while Matulis and Ku\u010diauskas remained with the team. This time, Sakalai struggled, playing an unsuccessful season in both the BBL and LKL. Coach \u0160alkus resigned and was replaced by [[Rimas Kurtinaitis]], while team leader Gecevi\u010dius signed with Lietuvos rytas. Results largely remained the same, with Sakalai finishing in 7th place in the LKL and failing to qualify for the playoffs in the BBL. During the 2007-08 season, Kurtinatis left the team early to take a coaching job in Poland, leaving assistant coach [[Romualdas Petronis]] to take over the team. Lead by [[Justas Sinica]], Sakalai played better than expected, finishing in 7th place in both the LKL, and BBL Challenge Cup.\n\n===BBL Challenge Cup winners (2008\u20132009)=== \nThe 2008-09 season looked to become the turning point for Sakalai. Under new coach Nerijus Zabarauskas, Sakalai won the BBL Challenge Cup, defeating [[BK VEF R\u012bga|VEF R\u012bga]] 84\u201377 in the finals, and making a comeback to the BBL Elite division - where they fought, but lost, to [[BC Nev\u0117\u017eis|Nev\u0117\u017eis K\u0117dainiai]]. Sakalai were lead by their young core, consisting of [[Arvydas \u0160ik\u0161nius]], who was the Challenge Cup MVP, \u0160arakauskas, [[Vilmantas Dilys]], [[Laurynas Sam\u0117nas]] and [[Arnas Labuckas]]. Rolandas Matulis still played with the team, while Ku\u010diauskas retired after the 2007-08 season and became the club director for Sakalai. In the LKL, Sakalai finished in 7th place, and qualified for the LKL playoffs, losing to Lietuvos rytas in the quaterfinals. Though a very successful season for Sakalai, this season did not become a comeback for the team.\n\n===Decline (2009\u20132013)===\nOver the next few seasons, the team completely plummeted. Club director and longtime player Ku\u010diauskas became the head coach for the team. During the summer, much of the young core left the team, with only Sam\u0117nas remaining. Skaisgirys and Sirvydis returned to the team, with Sirvydis still showing great form and becoming team leader. In the BBL Challenge Cup, Sakalai played dissapointingly, not even coming close to reaching their previous season heights. In the LKL, for the first time in club history, Sakalai didn't even qualify for the LKL playoffs. During this time, Sakalai also lost much of their popularity in Vilnius, with Lietuvos rytas and [[BC Perlas]] becoming the most popular teams in Vilnius. The 9th place finish was the worst for Sakalai at the time. \n\nIn the 2010-11 LKL season, Ku\u010diauskas remained as head coach, while [[Andrius Giedraitis]] returned to the team as an assistant coach. During the season, [[Arnas Butkevi\u010dius]] made his pro debut, while more young players for the team like [[Augustas Pe\u010diukevi\u010dius]] and [[Ovidijus Varanauskas]] played a lot more solidly. Sirvydis and Matulis still lead the team. After a dissapointing start, [[R\u016btenis Paulauskas]] briefly returned to the team, taking over as head coach. Sakalai finished the season in 11th place in the LKL, and once again failed to qualify for the BBL Challenge Cup playoffs.\n\nBefore the 2011-12 season, Sakalai signed [[Kazys Maksvytis]] as the new head coach for the team. Maksvytis had coached the Lithuanian U16, U18 and U19 teams, winning gold medals in both the European and World championships. Sakalai also signed [[Deividas Pukis]], who was one of the team leaders. Maksvytis gave more playing time for the young players of the team, such as Butkevi\u010dius, Sam\u0117nas, [[Evaldas Baniulis]] and Pukis, while also playing veterans Sirvysis and Matulis. While in the LKL, Sakalai did not have much success, finishing in 10th place, they did have success in the BBL Challenge Cup, where they reached the playoffs and won 3rd place. \n\nThe 2012-13 season turned out to be the last one for Sakalai. Over the last few seasons, Sakalai had many financial issues. During the summer, Maksvytis left the team, and former coach Romualdas Petronis returned to become the head coach for the team, while Sirvydis, who retired in the summer, became the assistant head coach. Rolandas Matulis remained for the team, for the 19th season, with only playing one season away, in 2001-2002, with \u017dalgiris. During the season, players like [[Justas Sinica]] briefly returned to the team, but left just as quick due to the financial situation. [[Edvinas \u0160e\u0161kus]] and [[Paulius Dambrauskas]], on loan from Lietuvos rytas, suffered season ending injuries, while much of the talented young players, like Pukis and Butkevi\u010dius, left during the summer. Sakalai played dissapointingly in both the BBL, and the LKL. After conflicts with management, coach Petronis resigned, and Sirvydis finished the season as head coach. In the LKL, Sakalai finished in 10th place. Due to the financial issues, Sakalai were suspended by the LKL for the 2013-14 season, and were dissolved in the summer of 2014.\n\n==Season by season==\n[[File:SimasJasaitis.jpg|thumb|[[Simas Jasaitis]] was one of the BC Sakalai team leaders in 2000\u201301 season.]]\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season\n!League\n!Pos.\n!Significant events\n!Baltic League\n!Pos.\n![[LKF Cup]]\n!European competitions\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1993\u201394\n| [[LKAL]]\n| style=\"background:gold\" align=\"center\"|1\n| style=\"background:#ACE1AF\"|Promoted\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1994\u201395\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|8\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| Played [[Kora\u0107 Cup]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1995\u201396\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|5\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| -\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1996\u201398\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1998\u201399\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|3\n| style=\"background:#CD7F32;\"|Bronze medal\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| Played [[Saporta Cup]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1999\u201300\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|4\n| style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"|Semifinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| Played [[Saporta Cup]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2000\u201301\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|6\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2001\u201302\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|6\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2002\u201303\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|5\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2003\u201304\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|4\n| style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"|Semifinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2004\u201305\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|4\n| style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"|Semifinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|6\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2005\u201306\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|5\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|8\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2006\u201307\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|13\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2007\u201308\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|17\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2008\u201309\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| style=\"background:gold\" align=\"center\"|1\n| Eighth finalist\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2009\u201310\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|9\n| \u2013\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| align=\"center\"|3\n| Second round\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2010\u201311\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|11\n| \u2013\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|[[2011\u201312 LKL season|2011\u201312]]\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|10\n| \u2013\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| align=\"center\"|3\n| First round\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|[[2012\u201313 LKL season|2012\u201313]]\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|10\n| -

In 1994, Sakalai managed to win the LKAL Championship and in June 1994, the [[Lietuvos krep\u0161inio lyga|Lithuanian Basketball League]] (LKL) Committee accepted them into the LKL.\n\n===LKL debut (1994\u20131995)===\nIn their debut season, Sakalai finished in 8th place (17 wins and 23 losses), and were coached by [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Sakalauskas]]. Their first win was against [[:lt:Kauno NECA|NECA Kaunas]], 100\u201388. In the playoffs, Sakalai lost the series 0\u20132 in the first round to [[BC \u017dalgiris]]. [[Andrius Giedraitis]] lead the team in scoring. Sakalai also played in the [[FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup]], qualifying, but losing to [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios Athens]] in the second round.\n\n===LKL and Kora\u0107 Cup (1995\u20131999)===\nIn the 1995\u201396 LKL season, Sakalai finished in 5th place, lead by players like Giedraitis and [[Gintautas \u0160ivickas]], and lost to favorites [[LSU-Atletas|Atletas Kaunas]] 0-2 in the playoffs. In the 1996-97 LKL season, Giedraitis lead the LKL in scoring, though Sakalai were largely inconsistent, finishing in 7th place, losing to [[BC Olimpas]] in the playoffs, 1-2, though giving fight to the team that eventually reached the LKL finals. During the season, [[Ram\u016bnas \u0160i\u0161kauskas]] made his pro debut in the LKL. Players like [[Erikas Ku\u010diauskas]], [[Rolandas Matulis]] and [[Arnas Kazlauskas]], who played in the team since the first LKL season, also had their best seasons to date. Throught this time, Sakalai also had a rivalry with the other Vilnius team, [[BC Statyba]], with Sakalai winning most of their matches. \n\nIn the 1997-98 LKL season, Sakalai had their best season to date. Under coach Sakalauskas, coaching the team since their LKL debut, Sakalai finished second in the LKL regular season standings. Giedraitis lead the team in scoring once again, and \u0160i\u0161kauskas showed a lot of improvement in his second LKL season. Sakalai also played in the Baltic Cup tournament. In the playoffs of the LKL, however, Sakalai lost to Ateltas Kaunas 0-2 in the semifinals, preventing the team from reaching the LKL finals. In the bronze medal series, Sakalai lost to the new team in Vilnius, [[BC Rytas|Statyba-Lietuvos rytas]], in somewhat a shocker, 1-2. Sakalai finished in 4th place. \n\nIn the 1998-99 LKL season, coach Sakalauskas left the team during the season, becoming head coach for the rival [[BC Lietuvos rytas]] team. Giedraitis also left the team to sign with Lietuvos rytas, and during the season, \u0160i\u0161kauskas, who became the team leader in Sakalai, also left to sign with Lietuvos rytas. Assistan coach [[R\u016btenis Paulauskas]] became the head coach for the team, at just 27 years old. Sakalai then signed [[Virginijus Sirvydis]], [[Egidijus Mikalaj\u016bnas]] and [[Rolandas Skaisgirys]], who were let go by Lietuvos rytas. Sirvydis, in particular, became the new team leader. [[Dainius \u0160alenga]] made his LKL debut during the season. In the LKL, Sakalai finished only in 6th place in the regular season, but eliminated the heavilly favored [[BC Alita]] in the quaterfinals 2-1. In the semifinals, Sakalai gave fight, but lost to Lietuvos rytas 0-2 in the semifinals. In the bronze medal series, once again underdogs, shocked everyone again, defeating [[BC \u0160iauliai]] 2-1, winning the final match away, and finishing in 3rd place in the LKL. The win also helped Sakalai qualify for the [[Saporta Cup]] for the next season.\n\n=== Saporta Cup, LKL and BBL (1999\u20132008)===\nThe 1999-00 season was a very tumultuos one for Sakalai, who started the season by building a very powerful team for the Saporta Cup. By December, however, coach Paulauskas had resigned, and much of the team had also left, with point guards [[Jemeil Rich]] and [[Rolandas Jarutis]], who signed with rivals Lietuvos rytas, being the most significant. Assistant coach and former player in the first LKL seasons [[Linas \u0160alkus]] became the new head coach. Sakalai recovered, thanks to solid play from Sirvydis, Matulis, \u0160alenga and Skaisgirys. Sakalai managed to qualify for the Saporta Cup playoffs, giving fight, but succumbing to [[KK Split]] in the playoffs. In the LKL, Sakalai once again reached the semifinals, again losing to Lietuvos rytas, 0-3. Sakalai once again faced [[BC \u0160iauliai]] in the bronze medal series, holding homecourt advantage this season, but this time, \u0160iauliai won the series 3-1, with Sakalai finishing in 4th place. Sakalai still qualified for the Saporta Cup the next season. [[Saulius Kuzminskas]] made his LKL debut during the season. \n\nDuring the 2000-01 LKL season, coached by \u0160alkus again, Sakalai remained stable throught the season. \u0160alenga, playing his best year, left during the season to sign with [[BC \u017dalgiris|\u017dalgiris Kaunas]]. [[Simas Jasaitis]] made his LKL debut for the team. Sakalai were eliminated from the Saporta Cup after the regular season. In the LKL, Skaisgirys and Matulis led the team. Sakalai once again faced \u0160iauliai in the playoffs, this time in the quaterfinals, losing the series 0-2 and finishing in 5th place for the season. Throught the next 2 seasons, in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, Sakalai were once again competitive, finishing in 6th and 5th places repectably. [[Mindaugas Lukauskis]], who played in the team during the 2001-2002 season, had his best year and breakout season with Sakalai. \n\nIn 2003\u201304 and 2004\u201305 LKL seasons, Sakalai were one away from 3rd place, but lost to [[BC \u0160iauliai|\u0160iauliai]] both times. Also, in 2005, Sakalai competed in the first [[Baltic Basketball League]] season, finishing in 6th place. During this time, Sakalai had formed a core with longtime team players like Matulis, Skaisgirys and Ku\u010diauskas, also players like Eligijus Redeckas, also signing talented young players like [[Renaldas Seibutis]] and [[Steponas Babrauskas]], who became leaders of the team. [[Martynas Gecevi\u010dius]] made his LKL debut during the 2004-2005 season. \n\nOver the next few seasons, however, results started to decline. During the 2005-06 season, Sakalai still had a solid season in the LKL, finishing in 5th place and in the BBL, where they finished in 8th place, just narrowly missing qualification for the Final Six tournament. During the season, Skaisgirys left the team, though the team core still remained. During the 2006-07 season, Sakalai signed talented young players like [[Mindaugas Kuzminskas]], [[Vytautas \u0160arakauskas]], [[Simas Buterlevi\u010dius]], [[Aidas Viskontas]] and [[Justas Sinica]]. Redeckas had retired, while Matulis and Ku\u010diauskas remained with the team. This time, Sakalai struggled, playing an unsuccessful season in both the BBL and LKL. Coach \u0160alkus resigned and was replaced by [[Rimas Kurtinaitis]], while team leader Gecevi\u010dius signed with Lietuvos rytas. Results largely remained the same, with Sakalai finishing in 7th place in the LKL and failing to qualify for the playoffs in the BBL. During the 2007-08 season, Kurtinatis left the team early to take a coaching job in Poland, leaving assistant coach [[Romualdas Petronis]] to take over the team. Lead by [[Justas Sinica]], Sakalai played better than expected, finishing in 7th place in both the LKL, and BBL Challenge Cup.\n\n===BBL Challenge Cup winners (2008\u20132009)=== \nThe 2008-09 season looked to become the turning point for Sakalai. Under new coach Nerijus Zabarauskas, Sakalai won the BBL Challenge Cup, defeating [[BK VEF R\u012bga|VEF R\u012bga]] 84\u201377 in the finals, and making a comeback to the BBL Elite division - where they fought, but lost, to [[BC Nev\u0117\u017eis|Nev\u0117\u017eis K\u0117dainiai]]. Sakalai were lead by their young core, consisting of [[Arvydas \u0160ik\u0161nius]], who was the Challenge Cup MVP, \u0160arakauskas, [[Vilmantas Dilys]], [[Laurynas Sam\u0117nas]] and [[Arnas Labuckas]]. Rolandas Matulis still played with the team, while Ku\u010diauskas retired after the 2007-08 season and became the club director for Sakalai. In the LKL, Sakalai finished in 7th place, and qualified for the LKL playoffs, losing to Lietuvos rytas in the quaterfinals. Though a very successful season for Sakalai, this season did not become a comeback for the team.\n\n===Decline (2009\u20132013)===\nOver the next few seasons, the team completely plummeted. Club director and longtime player Ku\u010diauskas became the head coach for the team. During the summer, much of the young core left the team, with only Sam\u0117nas remaining. Skaisgirys and Sirvydis returned to the team, with Sirvydis still showing great form and becoming team leader. In the BBL Challenge Cup, Sakalai played dissapointingly, not even coming close to reaching their previous season heights. In the LKL, for the first time in club history, Sakalai didn't even qualify for the LKL playoffs. During this time, Sakalai also lost much of their popularity in Vilnius, with Lietuvos rytas and [[BC Perlas]] becoming the most popular teams in Vilnius. The 9th place finish was the worst for Sakalai at the time. \n\nIn the 2010-11 LKL season, Ku\u010diauskas remained as head coach, while [[Andrius Giedraitis]] returned to the team as an assistant coach. During the season, [[Arnas Butkevi\u010dius]] made his pro debut, while more young players for the team like [[Augustas Petkevi\u010dius]] and [[Ovidijus Varanauskas]] played a lot more solidly. Sirvydis and Matulis still lead the team. After a dissapointing start, [[R\u016btenis Paulauskas]] briefly returned to the team, taking over as head coach. Sakalai finished the season in 11th place in the LKL, and once again failed to qualify for the BBL Challenge Cup playoffs.  \n\nBefore the 2011-12 season, Sakalai signed [[Kazys Maksvytis]] as the new head coach for the team. Maksvytis had coached the Lithuanian U16, U18 and U19 teams, winning gold medals in both the European and World championships. Sakalai also signed [[Deividas Pukis]], who was one of the team leaders. Maksvytis gave more playing time for the young players of the team, such as Butkevi\u010dius, Sam\u0117nas, [[Evaldas Baniulis]] and Pukis, while also playing veterans Sirvysis and Matulis. While in the LKL, Sakalai did not have much success, finishing in 10th place, they did have success in the BBL Challenge Cup, where they reached the playoffs and won 3rd place. \n\nThe 2012-13 season turned out to be the last one for Sakalai. Over the last few seasons, Sakalai had many financial issues. During the summer, Maksvytis left the team, and former coach Romualdas Petronis returned to become the head coach for the team, while Sirvydis, who retired in the summer, became the assistant head coach. Rolandas Matulis remained for the team, for the 19th season, with only playing one season away, in 2001-2002, with \u017dalgiris. During the season, players like [[Justas Sinica]] briefly returned to the team, but left just as quick due to the financial situation. [[Edvinas \u0160e\u0161kus]] and [[Paulius Dambrauskas]], on loan from Lietuvos rytas, suffered season ending injuries, while much of the talented young players, like Pukis and Butkevi\u010dius, left during the summer. Sakalai played dissapointingly in both the BBL, and the LKL. After conflicts with management, coach Petronis resigned, and Sirvydis finished the season as head coach. In the LKL, Sakalai finished in 10th place. Due to the financial issues, Sakalai were suspended by the LKL for the 2013-14 season, and were dissolved in the summer of 2014.\n\n==Season by season==\n[[File:SimasJasaitis.jpg|thumb|[[Simas Jasaitis]] was one of the BC Sakalai team leaders in 2000\u201301 season.]]\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season\n!League\n!Pos.\n!Significant events\n!Baltic League\n!Pos.\n![[LKF Cup]]\n!European competitions\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1993\u201394\n| [[LKAL]]\n| style=\"background:gold\" align=\"center\"|1\n| style=\"background:#ACE1AF\"|Promoted\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1994\u201395\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|8\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| Played [[Kora\u0107 Cup]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1995\u201396\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|5\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| -\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1996\u201398\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1998\u201399\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|3\n| style=\"background:#CD7F32;\"|Bronze medal\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| Played [[Saporta Cup]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1999\u201300\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|4\n| style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"|Semifinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| Played [[Saporta Cup]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2000\u201301\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|6\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2001\u201302\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|6\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2002\u201303\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|5\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2003\u201304\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|4\n| style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"|Semifinalist\n| \u2013\n| align=\"center\"| \u2013\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2004\u201305\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|4\n| style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"|Semifinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|6\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2005\u201306\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|5\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|8\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2006\u201307\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|13\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2007\u201308\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Elite Division]]\n| align=\"center\"|17\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2008\u201309\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\"|Quarterfinalist\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| style=\"background:gold\" align=\"center\"|1\n| Eighth finalist\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2009\u201310\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|9\n| \u2013\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| align=\"center\"|3\n| Second round\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2010\u201311\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|11\n| \u2013\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| align=\"center\"|7\n| Quarterfinalist\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|[[2011\u201312 LKL season|2011\u201312]]\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|10\n| \u2013\n| [[Baltic Basketball League|Challenge Cup]]\n| align=\"center\"|3\n| First round\n| \u2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|[[2012\u201313 LKL season|2012\u201313]]\n| [[Lithuanian Basketball League|LKL]]\n| align=\"center\"|10\n| -

However, an alternative approach, prepared by English civil engineering firm G. Maunsell & Partners, was soon submitted by another English firm, Reed & Mallik Ltd which had teamed up with Sydney-based builders Stuart Brothers.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nGuy Maunsell, having recently split from his professional business partners and seeking new international engineering opportunities, recognised that a concrete arch bridge would be a much better suited and economical solution for the new Gladesville Bridge than the steel truss the DMR had designed. However, winning the Gladesville Bridge contract was perhaps considered a long shot by the firm's partners and scarce resources were invested into the project from the outset. The firm's first graduate recruit, 22-year old Anthony Gee, was given the task of developing Maunsell's preliminary drawings into a viable design from which Reed & Mallik Ltd and Stuart Brothers, could formulate a price. Due in part to the unprecedented nature of the design, the proposal was independently reviewed by internationally revered engineer, and pioneer of pre-stressed concrete methods, Eugene Freyssinet. Among the last works of Freyssinet's life, the proposed {{convert|910|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}}, six-lane, high level concrete arch bridge was soon extended to {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, the design accepted and the contract to build was issued.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nDMR intended the new $6.3 million Gladesville Bridge to be part of the North-Western Expressway, a larger program of road works that would act as a main artery to link Sydney with the northern suburbs, and through to Newcastle. Although the strategic project was finally abandoned in the 1970s, the new Gladesville Bridge started in December 1959, and took five years to complete.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> It was officially opened by [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent|Princess Marina]] on 2 October 1964.<ref>{{cite book |title=The history and description of Sydney Harbour |author=Stephensen, Percy Reginald |year=1967 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-589-50243-3}}</ref> The bridge was originally opened with six traffic lanes, but the extra-wide outer lanes enabled a later reconfiguration to take place. The bridge now has three northbound lanes and four southbound lanes, separated by a concrete median.\n\n====Design and construction====\nAt the time when the bridge was planned, it was anticipated that extremely large vessels would need to pass underneath it in the years to come. This, as well as the topography of the site, explains why the bridge was designed with such a high clearance.\n\nThe construction of the new Gladesville Bridge was a noteworthy engineering achievement for its time and, being both daring and untried, its innovative design and construction set several new standards on the international stage. In many ways the construction echoed the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] method of building arches using segmented units built over a temporary [[formwork]]. In Gladesville's case, these were hollow [[precast concrete]] blocks which were hoisted up from barges on the river, then moved down a railway on the top of the formwork into position. Every few blocks, special inflatable [[rubber]] [[gasket]]s were inserted. When all of the blocks in the arch (there are four [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] arches altogether, not seen in the picture) were in place, the gaskets were 'inflated' using synthetic [[hydraulic fluid]], expanding the entire arch and lifting it away from the formwork to support its own weight. Once adjusted to the correct position, the gaskets were filled with liquid concrete, driving out the oil and setting to form a permanent solid arch. The formwork was then moved sideways and the next arch constructed in the same fashion. Once all four arches were erected, the deck was laid on top built from further precast concrete units. The arches bed into solid [[sandstone]] bedrock on either side of the river.\n\nThe bridge as originally tendered for this location was a rather conventional [[steel]] [[cantilever bridge]], but one of the contractors tendered the alternative [[catenary arch]] design, recognising it was pushing the envelope of existing bridge-building knowledge. The contractor's designer was G Maunsell & Partners of London. Their alternative was accepted after submission to the famous bridge engineer Eug\u00e8ne Freyssinet, who approved the design with recommendations. The inflatable gasket method for example had been pioneered by Freyssinet on much earlier designs.\n\nGladesville Bridge was the first {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} span concrete bridge in the world and had a substantial number of engineering and technical elements that made it a world-leading bridge design and construction achievement. It was also the first bridge, if not one of the first bridges, to utilise computer programming in its construction. As there was no suitable proprietary engineering software available at that time, the bridge designer (Anthony Gee of G. Maunsell & Partners) also wrote a suite of five computer programs for analysis and detailed design to guide its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nHaving eclipsed Sweden's Sando Bridge (built in 1943 at {{convert|866|ft|m|0|order=flip}} to become the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world, the new Gladesville Bridge was an unprecedented success that attracted world-wide attention and interest. Measuring {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length, {{convert|200|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above the water level, and {{convert|72|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, with {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} wide pathways on either side, the scale of the new Gladesville Bridge established it as one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nIn the 1970s, the roadway of Gladesville Bridge was widened from six to seven-lanes (without structural modification) to accommodate an increased traffic flow over the bridge. This widening was achieved by narrowing the generous width of the pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway. Despite this widening, achieved without structural modification to the bridge, Gladesville Bridge has remained relatively unchanged since its completion in 1964.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nGladesville Bridge named an Engineering Heritage International Marker upon its 50th anniversary on 1 October 2014; and was named an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark on 15 December 2015.<ref name=nswshr-1935/>\n\n== Description == \nThe Gladesville Bridge connects the suburbs of Gladesville (located on the northern bank of the Parramatta River) and Drummoyne (located on its southern and eastern sides).<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge is a four-box pre-stressed concrete arch with a [[Span (architecture)|span]] of {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. Its total length (including approaches) is {{convert|579.4|m|ft|0}}. The roadway across the bridge is includes seven roadway lanes with pathway on either side.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nThe arch of the bridge is supported by concrete thrust blocks embedded into [[sandstone]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] on either side of Parramatta River. The bridge was constructed as four arches, each made from precast concrete box sections. Each rib of blocks was erected on a falsework system supported on piles. When the four arches were in place, they were stressed together (using the Freyssinet stressing system) by transverse cables passing through diaphragms.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nOn completion of the arch, the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] (stressed vertically using the Lee McCall system) were constructed on both the arch and approaches. These supported the deck which is a waffle construction of eight longitudinal precast prestressed \"T\" beams with four intermediate cast-in-place transverse beams per span, and with cast in place fillers between the \"T\" beams. At its northern end, the deck flares out from its six lanes to accommodate the diverging traffic lanes feeding both Victoria Road and Burns Bay Road.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n=== Condition === \nStill in active operation and serving heavy inner-city road traffic on a daily basis, the Gladesville Bridge appears to be in good physical condition due to regular maintenance works.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n=== Modifications and dates === \nIn the 1970s, the roadway of Gladesville Bridge was widened from six to seven-lanes (without structural modification) to accommodate an increased traffic flow over the bridge. This widening was achieved by taking in some of the generous width of the pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Fencing along the north eastern side of the Gladesville Bridge appears to have been a later addition.<ref name=nswshr-1935/>\n\n===Bicycle and pedestrian access===\nThe bridge has a footpath on both sides of the bridge. The path on the west side is under a metre wide, much too narrow to cycle on. The path on the east side is listed as a shared cycle path, but it is also only {{convert|1.7|m|adj=on}} wide bound between a low barrier with a steel hand rail on the road side and a {{convert|2|m|adj=on|spell=on}} fence on the drop side. These barriers make the effective path approximately {{convert|1|m|adj=on}} wide for two way cycle and pedestrian traffic.\n\nAccess from the northern end is via a pedestrian tunnel off Huntleys Point Road, directly under the bridge. The bridge is not wheelchair accessible.\n\n== Heritage listing == \n\nAs at 19 December 2013, Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world at the time of its completion in 1964, being {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. One of only two of its type in NSW, Gladesville Bridge is considered to be a leading example of technical and engineering achievement on the international stage.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> An innovative design that set new global standards for design and construction, Gladesville Bridge was one of the first bridges in the world (if not, the first) to utilise computer programming in its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> With particular social significance and an important association with a number of internationally acclaimed engineers and engineering firms (including G. Maunsell & Partners and Eugene Freyssinet), Gladesville Bridge is one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 1 October 2014 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1935/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world at the time of its completion in 1964 (at 1000 feet, this record was held for 15 years until 1980).<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Considered to be a leading example of technical and engineering achievement, the Gladesville Bridge was an innovative design that set new standards for design and construction on the international stage.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> One of the landmark engineering achievements of the world, Gladesville Bridge was one of the first bridges in the world (if not, the first) to utilise computer programming in its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its association with a number of internationally acclaimed engineers and engineering firms.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Designed by English firm G. Maunsell & Partners, the vision of the new Gladesville Bridge being a concrete arch bridge, rather than a more standard steel truss bridge, is attributed to Guy Maunsell. Maunsell was a revered British engineer and early developer of prestressed concrete. In the mid-20th century, at the time of the construction of Gladesville Bridge, G. Maunsell & Partners were applying their creative methods to building iconic bridges across the world.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge is also associated with the celebrated French engineer, Eugene Freyssinet who reviewed the innovative and unprecedented design. A pioneer in using pre-stressed concrete in bridge construction, Freyssinet's contribution to the design of Gladesville Bridge was among the last works of his life.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n \nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its aesthetic and technical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Upon its construction in 1964, Gladesville Bridge was the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world and its innovative design set new standards for design and construction on the international stage. An internationally-leading example of technical and engineering achievement, Gladesville Bridge was considered to be one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Built in an era when aesthetic qualities were given high priority, particularly on high profile infrastructure projects, Gladesville Bridge is an impressive and visually distinctive structure that serves as an inner-city landmark from the road and river.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its social value to the community of NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> The replacement of the 1881 Gladesville Bridge, and the development of the unrealised North-Western Expressway, was a major Department of Main Roads project that was instigated by, and responded directly to, the demands of the Sydney community.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> The crossing of Parramatta River at this point was considered to be a critical connection between the city and the northern suburbs. A critical link in the planned expressway to Newcastle, the new Gladesville Bridge was to alleviate traffic congestion and provide better access for the new residential suburbs and communities that were developing in the post-war period.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Today, Gladesville Bridge is a landmark structure that continues to be a major arterial roadway servicing the Sydney community.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its technical significance and, as such, may have potential to reveal information about its world-class standards of design and construction that led to the structure being considered a leading example of technical and engineering achievement.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as a rare example of a concrete arch span bridge in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge is one of only two of its type in the state-the other is the nearby [[Tarban Creek Bridge]] which is a 300 foot bridge, built in 1965 as part of the same unrealised North-Western Expressway project that was also responsible for the construction of Gladesville Bridge. Although both were built by the same team, both Gladesville Bridge and Tarban Creek Bridge are distinctly different in their structural specifications and construction methods.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> The longest concrete arch span bridge in the world upon its construction (a record held for 15 years), Gladesville Bridge is now the seventh longest bridge of its type (in excess of 1000 feet) in the world. Eclipsed by the1280 foot Krk Bridge in Croatia (built in 1980), Gladesville Bridge continues to be the longest concrete arch span bridge in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge is a representative example of the technological advancement of bridge design and construction in NSW. From the peak of the arch, one can witness the evolution of bridge engineering in Sydney - from the Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932), to the Gladesville Bridge (1964) to the [[ANZAC Bridge]] (1995).<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Replacing an earlier 1881 swing bridge and ferry service, Gladesville Bridge is also a representative example of a critical transport crossing across the Parramatta River.<ref name=nswshr-1935/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSydney from Gladesville Bridge.jpg|The view of Sydney from the current Gladesville Bridge\nGladesville Bridge from Paramatta River in December 2014.jpg|The western side of the Gladesville Bridge\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|New South Wales|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Sydney]]\n* [[List of the largest arch bridges]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography === \n* {{cite journal|author=|date=1962|title=Concrete arches to a world record |journal=Engineering News-Record}} \n* {{cite book|author=Gee, Anthony F.|date=|title=Gladesville Bridge at 50}} \n* {{cite book|last=Muirhead|first=John|date=2019|title='Gladesville Bridge, Sydney, NSW'}} \n* {{cite book|author=NSW Transport: Roads and Maritime Services|date=2014|title=Gladesville Bridge: Notes in support of Engineers Australia Engineering Landmark nomination}} \n* {{cite web|author=Roads & Traffic Authority|date=2005|title=Concrete Slab and Arch Bridges: Heritage Study of Pre-1948 Concrete Slab and Arch Road Bridges|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/environment/downloads/heritage/bridge-types_historical-overviews_2006-concreteslabarch.pdf}} \n* {{cite book|author=Roads & Traffic Authority|date=2001|title=Oral History: Construction of the Gladesville Bridge}} \n* {{cite book|author=Sydney Engineering Heritage Committee|date=2014|title=Nomination of Gladesville Bridge NSW as an Engineering Heritage International Marker}}\n\n=== Attribution === \n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Gladesville Bridge|dno=5062219|id=1935|year=2020|accessdate=18 February 2020}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |author1=Baxter, J.

The sandstone piers are all that remain today of the original bridge, with the northern pier adjacent to the [[Huntleys Point ferry wharf]], and the southern in Howley Park in Drummoyne.\n\n===Current bridge===\nBy the 1950s, due to a rapid growth in private car ownership and road freight transport in Sydney during the interwar and post war period, the traffic crossing Gladesville Bridge was becoming increasingly congested.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/GladesvilleBr/gladesvillebr.htm |title=Gladesville Bridge & the Drummoyne to Lane Cove section of the North Western Freeway |work=OZROADS: The Australian Roads Website |date= |access-date=}}{{Self-published source|date=December 2013}}</ref> With consistent interruptions and delays from the [[Trams in Sydney|tramline]] and from shipping transportation along the Parramatta River, it was soon realised that a new bridge was required to alleviate the problem.<ref name=nswshr-1935/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.gov.au/agd/EMA/rwpattach.nsf/viewasattachmentpersonal/(30A3EE7646E852BEBD7F907D5B33CE5A)~3877+WEMA+hazards.pdf/$file/3877+WEMA+hazards.pdf |title=Hazards, Disasters and Your Community |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016204725/http://www.ema.gov.au/agd/EMA/rwpattach.nsf/viewasattachmentpersonal/(30A3EE7646E852BEBD7F907D5B33CE5A)~3877+WEMA+hazards.pdf/$file/3877+WEMA+hazards.pdf |archive-date=16 October 2007 |work=Emergency Management Australia |date= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s, the [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] (DMR) intended the replacement Gladesville Bridge to be a conventional steel truss of its own design. However, an alternative approach, prepared by English civil engineering firm G. Maunsell & Partners, was soon submitted by another English firm, Reed & Mallik Ltd which had teamed up with Sydney-based builders Stuart Brothers.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nGuy Maunsell, having recently split from his professional business partners and seeking new international engineering opportunities, recognised that a concrete arch bridge would be a much better suited and economical solution for the new Gladesville Bridge than the steel truss the DMR had designed. However, winning the Gladesville Bridge contract was perhaps considered a long shot by the firm's partners and scarce resources were invested into the project from the outset. The firm's first graduate recruit, 22-year old Anthony Gee, was given the task of developing Maunsell's preliminary drawings into a viable design from which Reed & Mallik Ltd and Stuart Brothers, could formulate a price. Due in part to the unprecedented nature of the design, the proposal was independently reviewed by internationally revered engineer, and pioneer of pre-stressed concrete methods, Eugene Freyssinet. Among the last works of Freyssinet's life, the proposed {{convert|910|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}}, six-lane, high level concrete arch bridge was soon extended to {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, the design accepted and the contract to build was issued.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nDMR intended the new $6.3 million Gladesville Bridge to be part of the North-Western Expressway, a larger program of road works that would act as a main artery to link Sydney with the northern suburbs, and through to Newcastle. Although the strategic project was finally abandoned in the 1970s, the new Gladesville Bridge started in December 1959, and took five years to complete.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> It was officially opened by [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent|Princess Marina]] on 2 October 1964.<ref>{{cite book |title=The history and description of Sydney Harbour |author=Stephensen, Percy Reginald |year=1967 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-589-50243-3}}</ref> The bridge was originally opened with six traffic lanes, but the extra-wide outer lanes enabled a later reconfiguration to take place. The bridge now has three northbound lanes and four southbound lanes, separated by a concrete median.\n\n====Design and construction====\nAt the time when the bridge was planned, it was anticipated that extremely large vessels would need to pass underneath it in the years to come. This, as well as the topography of the site, explains why the bridge was designed with such a high clearance.\n\nThe construction of the new Gladesville Bridge was a noteworthy engineering achievement for its time and, being both daring and untried, its innovative design and construction set several new standards on the international stage. In many ways the construction echoed the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] method of building arches using segmented units built over a temporary [[formwork]]. In Gladesville's case, these were hollow [[precast concrete]] blocks which were hoisted up from barges on the river, then moved down a railway on the top of the formwork into position. Every few blocks, special inflatable [[rubber]] [[gasket]]s were inserted. When all of the blocks in the arch (there are four [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] arches altogether, not seen in the picture) were in place, the gaskets were 'inflated' using synthetic [[hydraulic fluid]], expanding the entire arch and lifting it away from the formwork to support its own weight. Once adjusted to the correct position, the gaskets were filled with liquid concrete, driving out the oil and setting to form a permanent solid arch. The formwork was then moved sideways and the next arch constructed in the same fashion. Once all four arches were erected, the deck was laid on top built from further precast concrete units. The arches bed into solid [[sandstone]] bedrock on either side of the river.\n\nThe bridge as originally tendered for this location was a rather conventional [[steel]] [[cantilever bridge]], but one of the contractors tendered the alternative [[catenary arch]] design, recognising it was pushing the envelope of existing bridge-building knowledge. The contractor's designer was G Maunsell & Partners of London. Their alternative was accepted after submission to the famous bridge engineer Eug\u00e8ne Freyssinet, who approved the design with recommendations. The inflatable gasket method for example had been pioneered by Freyssinet on much earlier designs.\n\nGladesville Bridge was the first {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} span concrete bridge in the world and had a substantial number of engineering and technical elements that made it a world-leading bridge design and construction achievement. It was also the first bridge, if not one of the first bridges, to utilise computer programming in its construction. As there was no suitable proprietary engineering software available at that time, the bridge designer (Anthony Gee of G. Maunsell & Partners) also wrote a suite of five computer programs for analysis and detailed design to guide its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nHaving eclipsed Sweden's Sando Bridge (built in 1943 at {{convert|866|ft|m|0|order=flip}} to become the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world, the new Gladesville Bridge was an unprecedented success that attracted world-wide attention and interest. Measuring {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length, {{convert|200|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above the water level, and {{convert|72|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, with {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} wide pathways on either side, the scale of the new Gladesville Bridge established it as one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nIn the 1970s, the roadway of Gladesville Bridge was widened from six to seven-lanes (without structural modification) to accommodate an increased traffic flow over the bridge. This widening was achieved by narrowing the generous width of the pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway. Despite this widening, achieved without structural modification to the bridge, Gladesville Bridge has remained relatively unchanged since its completion in 1964.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nGladesville Bridge named an Engineering Heritage International Marker upon its 50th anniversary on 1 October 2014; and was named an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark on 15 December 2015.<ref name=nswshr-1935/>\n\n== Description == \nThe Gladesville Bridge connects the suburbs of Gladesville (located on the northern bank of the Parramatta River) and Drummoyne (located on its southern and eastern sides).<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge is a four-box pre-stressed concrete arch with a [[Span (architecture)|span]] of {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. Its total length (including approaches) is {{convert|579.4|m|ft|0}}. The roadway across the bridge is includes seven roadway lanes with pathway on either side.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nThe arch of the bridge is supported by concrete thrust blocks embedded into [[sandstone]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] on either side of Parramatta River. The bridge was constructed as four arches, each made from precast concrete box sections. Each rib of blocks was erected on a falsework system supported on piles. When the four arches were in place, they were stressed together (using the Freyssinet stressing system) by transverse cables passing through diaphragms.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\nOn completion of the arch, the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] (stressed vertically using the Lee McCall system) were constructed on both the arch and approaches. These supported the deck which is a waffle construction of eight longitudinal precast prestressed \"T\" beams with four intermediate cast-in-place transverse beams per span, and with cast in place fillers between the \"T\" beams. At its northern end, the deck flares out from its six lanes to accommodate the diverging traffic lanes feeding both Victoria Road and Burns Bay Road.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n=== Condition === \nStill in active operation and serving heavy inner-city road traffic on a daily basis, the Gladesville Bridge appears to be in good physical condition due to regular maintenance works.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n=== Modifications and dates === \nIn the 1970s, the roadway of Gladesville Bridge was widened from six to seven-lanes (without structural modification) to accommodate an increased traffic flow over the bridge. This widening was achieved by taking in some of the generous width of the pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Fencing along the north eastern side of the Gladesville Bridge appears to have been a later addition.<ref name=nswshr-1935/>\n\n===Bicycle and pedestrian access===\nThe bridge has a footpath on both sides of the bridge. The path on the west side is under a metre wide, much too narrow to cycle on. The path on the east side is listed as a shared cycle path, but it is also only {{convert|1.7|m|adj=on}} wide bound between a low barrier with a steel hand rail on the road side and a {{convert|2|m|adj=on|spell=on}} fence on the drop side. These barriers make the effective path approximately {{convert|1|m|adj=on}} wide for two way cycle and pedestrian traffic.\n\nAccess from the northern end is via a pedestrian tunnel off Huntleys Point Road, directly under the bridge. The bridge is not wheelchair accessible.\n\n== Heritage listing == \n\nAs at 19 December 2013, Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world at the time of its completion in 1964, being {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. One of only two of its type in NSW, Gladesville Bridge is considered to be a leading example of technical and engineering achievement on the international stage.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> An innovative design that set new global standards for design and construction, Gladesville Bridge was one of the first bridges in the world (if not, the first) to utilise computer programming in its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> With particular social significance and an important association with a number of internationally acclaimed engineers and engineering firms (including G. Maunsell & Partners and Eugene Freyssinet), Gladesville Bridge is one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 1 October 2014 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1935/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world at the time of its completion in 1964 (at 1000 feet, this record was held for 15 years until 1980).<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Considered to be a leading example of technical and engineering achievement, the Gladesville Bridge was an innovative design that set new standards for design and construction on the international stage.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> One of the landmark engineering achievements of the world, Gladesville Bridge was one of the first bridges in the world (if not, the first) to utilise computer programming in its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its association with a number of internationally acclaimed engineers and engineering firms.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Designed by English firm G. Maunsell & Partners, the vision of the new Gladesville Bridge being a concrete arch bridge, rather than a more standard steel truss bridge, is attributed to Guy Maunsell. Maunsell was a revered British engineer and early developer of prestressed concrete. In the mid-20th century, at the time of the construction of Gladesville Bridge, G. Maunsell & Partners were applying their creative methods to building iconic bridges across the world.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge is also associated with the celebrated French engineer, Eugene Freyssinet who reviewed the innovative and unprecedented design. A pioneer in using pre-stressed concrete in bridge construction, Freyssinet's contribution to the design of Gladesville Bridge was among the last works of his life.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n \nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its aesthetic and technical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Upon its construction in 1964, Gladesville Bridge was the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world and its innovative design set new standards for design and construction on the international stage.

A critical link in the planned expressway to Newcastle, the new Gladesville Bridge was to alleviate traffic congestion and provide better access for the new residential suburbs and communities that were developing in the post-war period.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Today, Gladesville Bridge is a landmark structure that continues to be a major arterial roadway servicing the Sydney community.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its technical significance and, as such, may have potential to reveal information about its world-class standards of design and construction that led to the structure being considered a leading example of technical and engineering achievement.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> \n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nGladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as a rare example of a concrete arch span bridge in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> Gladesville Bridge is one of only two of its type in the state-the other is the nearby [[Tarban Creek Bridge]] which is a 300 foot bridge, built in 1965 as part of the same unrealised North-Western Expressway project that was also responsible for the construction of Gladesville Bridge. Although both were built by the same team, both Gladesville Bridge and Tarban Creek Bridge are distinctly different in their structural specifications and construction methods.<ref name=nswshr-1935/> The longest concrete arch span bridge in the world upon its construction (a record held for 15 years), Gladesville Bridge is now the seventh longest bridge of its type (in excess of 1000 feet) in the world.

It is located approximately 18&nbsp;km southwest of [[Baden-Baden]] and 19&nbsp;km northeast of [[Offenburg]].  Achern is the fourth largest city in the county of [[Ortenaukreis|Ortenau]] (Ortenaukreis), after Offenburg, [[Lahr|Lahr / Black Forest]] and Kehl.\n\nAs subsequent to the district reform in the 1970s the population passed the 20,000 mark, Achern requested to be awarded the status of ''[[:de:Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt|Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]]''.  The status was granted by the State government effective January 1, 1974.  Achern collaborates with the communities of Lauf, Sasbach, and Sasbachwalden in administrative matters.\n\nBesides Achern itself, the municipality includes the boroughs of Fautenbach, [[Gamshurst]], [[Gro\u00dfweier]], M\u00f6sbach, Oberachern, [[\u00d6nsbach]], Sasbachried and Wagshurst.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Geographic location ===\nAchern is located in the northern [[Black Forest]] near the [[Hornisgrinde]], at the entrance to the Acher Valley and not far from the eastern edge of the [[Upper Rhine]] Valley.  Coming from the Black Forest, the [[Acher River|Acher]] enters the city from the southeast and passes Oberachern on its way to the center of town with the historic center, the ''Altstadt'', situated on the right bank.  The Acher then continues on in northwesterly direction between Fautenbach and Gro\u00dfweier and south of Gamshurst, before leaving the city to head for the [[Rhine]].  The river gave the city its name.\n\nThe city contains several artificially created lakes, some of which still produce gravel and sand.  The largest lake is called Achernsee, near the Achern Autobahn ramp, in the West of the city.\n\n=== Neighboring communities ===\nAchern is surrounded by the following communities (starting clockwise from the north): [[Lichtenau (Rastatt)|Lichtenau]] and [[Ottersweier]] (both [[Rastatt (district)|Rastatt County]]), as well as [[Sasbach/Ortenau|Sasbach (Ortenau)]], [[Lauf (Baden)]], [[Sasbachwalden]], [[Kappelrodeck]], [[Renchen]], and [[Rheinau (Baden)]], all part of Ortenau County.\n\n=== City boroughs ===\nWithin the municipal borders of Achern, the city is made up of the city center (Kernstadt), and the boroughs that were redistricted into Achern during the District Reform in the 1970s, namely, Fautenbach, Gamshurst, Gro\u00dfweier, M\u00f6sbach, Oberachern, [[\u00d6nsbach]], Sasbachried and Wagshurst.\n\nExcept Oberachern, the boroughs also have community status under state administrative law, which entitles them to a borough council, elected by registered voters in municipal elections.  The borough councils are headed up by the Borough President.\n\nIn some cases, named neighborhoods or developments are part of the boroughs, though often with few residents and not clearly defined limits.  Examples of such neighborhoods are Litzloch, Michelbuch and Ziegelh\u00fctte in [[Gamshurst]], Malghurst in Sasbachried, Lindenhof in Fautenbach and Schollenhof in Wagshurst.\n\n== History ==\nAchern was first mentioned in 1095 as Acchara and developed later into Oberachern and Niederachern.  Eventually, Niederachern was referred to only as Achern.  During the High [[Middle Ages]] the town became part of the German Reich, courtesy of the [[Staufenberger]] and [[Z\u00e4hringer]] families, and was included in the ''Landsvogtei'' of [[Ortenaukreis|Ortenau]].  In 1334, together with Ortenau Achern became part of [[Baden]], in 1351 it went to [[Strasbourg]], in 1405 to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], and in 1504 to [[F\u00fcrstenberg-F\u00fcrstenberg]].  In 1551 the town became part of [[Further Austria]] and part of the ''[[Vogt|Reichlandsvogtei]]'' Ortenau.  In 1495 and then again in 1637 Achern burned to the ground and was uninhabited for several years thereafter.\n\nIn 1805 Achern again became part of what was then the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] and was made a district court seat.  In 1808 it was awarded City status.  In 1924 the district of Achern was dissolved and became part of the district of [[B\u00fchl (Baden)|B\u00fchl]] which was awarded County status in 1939.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], B\u00fchl County was part of the State of Baden and from 1952 part of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of South Baden.  Pursuant to the district reform B\u00fchl County was dissolved, effective January 1, 1973.  Its southern part \u2014 and with it the city of Achern \u2014 was made part of the newly created [[Ortenaukreis]].\n\n=== History of the boroughs ===\nThe boroughs all came under the rule of Baden in 1805 largely as part of the district of Achern.  Exceptions are M\u00f6sbach, which first belonged to the district of Oberkirch and was joined into the Achern district in 1859, and Wagshurst, which first belonged to the district of [[Appenweier]] and became part of the Achern district in 1819.  When the district of Achern was dissolved in 1924, all of its communities except Wagshurst were joined with the district, and in 1939, County of B\u00fchl.  Wagshurst became part of the County of [[Kehl]].\n\n* '''Fautenbach''' was first mentioned circa 1100 as ''Vultenbach''.  Via the cloister in [[Hirsau]] it gained Gro\u00dfweier und Schauenburg.\n* '''[[Gamshurst]]''' was first mentioned in 902 as ''Hurst des Gaman'' and was an expansion of Sasbach.\n* '''[[Gro\u00dfweier]]''' was first mentioned around 1115 as ''Crosvvilare''. It remained ''Croschweier'' well into the 19th century.  Like Gamshurst it was an expansion of Sasbach.  Gro\u00dfweier had been given to a family as a fief by the Duke of Baden.  That vassal family lived in and took its name from the castle in town.  When the last of the vassal family died, Gro\u00dfweier became the property of the Lords of Seldeneck whose kin sold it back to Baden in 1583.  The [[moated castle]] was then the seat of the district court until it was moved to B\u00fchl after the castle's destruction in 1689 by French troops during the [[Nine Years' War]].\n* '''M\u00f6sbach''' was first mentioned in 1386 as ''Mestbach''.  It belonged to Strasbourg before it became part of Baden.\n* '''Oberachern''' was first mentioned in 1347 as ''Obernacher''. Before that date no distinction was made between Oberachern and Niederachern. It belonged to the Staufenberg family as early as 1100 though parts of it belonged to the cloister in Hirsau. Before 1130 Oberachern belonged to the cloister [[Sankt Georgen (Black Forest)|St. Georgen]]. In the 12th century a noble and free family who apparently also supplied the judges for Achern, named itself after the city. This family lived in a moated castle the remains of which were later used in the construction of the Stephanus church tower in Oberachern. While Oberachern was part of the district court Achern und as such shared in Achern's luck, it had always been an independent village until it was annexed in 1971.\n* '''[[\u00d6nsbach]]''' was first mentioned in the 13th century as ''Ongisbach''. The cloisters in [[Lichtenstein (Reutlingen)|Honau]], [[Ettenheim]] and Allerheiligen all owned property in the village. The village was part of the district of Achern.\n* '''Sasbachried''' was first mentioned in 1697 as ''aus dem Rieth''. It grew out of Sasbach and, like Sasbach, it used to belong to Strasbourg. In the 19th century, Sasbachried split from Sasbach and became an independent community.\n* '''Wagshurst''' was first mentioned in 1136 as ''Wageshurst''. It too belonged to Strasbourg and was part of the district court of [[Ulm]].\n\n=== Religions ===\nIn the beginning Achern was part of the [[diocese of Strasbourg]]. As a consequence of its belonging to Further Austria, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] did not take hold. Achern and its surrounding area therefore remained almost exclusively [[Catholic]] throughout the centuries. In 1803 the communities were joined with the [[diocese of Konstanz]] before it became part of the newly created [[archdiocese of Freiburg]] in 1821 through 1827. The villages then belonged to the district of [[Ottersweier]] but in 1929 Achern became its own district with the Catholic city church (Stadtkirche) as its seat. Additional Catholic communities, whose churches were elevated to [[parish]]es early on, exist in almost all boroughs. Only M\u00f6sbach didn't become a parish until 1865 and Sasbachried is still serviced by the neighboring parish of Sasbach. All parishes now belong to the Acher-Renchtal district within the archdiocese of Freiburg.\n\nAt the dawn of the 19th century, Protestants started to move into Achern. The first Protestant service was held in 1842 in the Illenau hospital. The Protestant parish of Achern, founded in 1892, was able to build its church, the Christuskirche, in 1908 and 1909. The Protestant parish also serves the boroughs of Oberachern, Fautenbach, Gamshurst, Gro\u00dfweier and Sasbachried as well as the neighboring towns of Sasbach, Obersasbach and Lauf. The boroughs of \u00d6nsbach, M\u00f6sbach and Wagshurst on the other hand, are part of the parish of [[Renchen]]. The Protestant parish of Achern first belonged to the district of [[Rheinau (Baden)|Rheinbischofsheim]], and later on to the districts of Baden-Baden and Rastatt. The parish of Renchen belongs to the district of Kehl within the [[Evangelical Church in Baden]]. Finally, the Josua-Christian parish and the Christian parish Sasbachried are the two independent churches in Achern.\n\nAlso represented in Achern, though in smaller numbers, are [[Muslims]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[New Apostolic Church]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].\n\n=== District reform ===\nThe following villages and areas were incorporated into the city of Achern:\n\n* January 1, 1971: Oberachern\n* January 1, 1973: Fautenbach, Gamshurst, Gro\u00dfweier, M\u00f6sbach, \u00d6nsbach, Sasbachried und Wagshurst\n\n=== Demographics ===\n[[File:Achern-Population-Stats.png|thumb|right|300px|Achern demographics]]\nFigures reflect the city limits at the time and are estimates or Census data (\u00b9), or official extensions thereof, counting only primary residences.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Population\n|-\n| 1808 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,300\n|-\n| 1825 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,638\n|-\n| 1845 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,242\n|-\n| December 1, 1871 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,767\n|-\n| December 1, 1880 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,145\n|-\n| December 1, 1900 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,396\n|-\n| December 1, 1910 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,962\n|-\n| June 16, 1925 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,335\n|-\n| June 16, 1933 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,338\n|-\n| May 17, 1939 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,835\n|-\n| 1946 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 4,492\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Population\n|-\n| September 13, 1950 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 4,932\n|-\n| June 6, 1961 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,141\n|-\n| May 27, 1970 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,596\n|-\n| December 31, 1975 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 20,621\n|-\n| December 31, 1980 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 20,543\n|-\n| May 27, 1987 \u00b9 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 20,524\n|-\n| December 31, 1990 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 21,382\n|-\n| December 31, 1995 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 22,658\n|-\n| December 31, 2000 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 23,911\n|-\n| March 31, 2005 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 24,521\n|}\n|}\n\u00b9 Census result\n\n== Government ==\n\n=== City Council ===\nThe municipal elections on June 13, 2004, resulted in the following make-up of the City Council:\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:200px; background:#808040; border-spacing:1px;\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:right; background:#fff;\"\n|align=\"left\" | [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] || 8 Seats \n|-  style=\"text-align:right; background:#fff;\"\n|align=\"left\" | Independents|| 7 Seats \n|-  style=\"text-align:right; background:#fff;\"\n|align=\"left\" | ABL || 5 Seats \n|-  style=\"text-align:right; background:#fff;\"\n|align=\"left\" | UGA || 4 Seats \n|-  style=\"text-align:right; background:#fff;\"\n|align=\"left\" | [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || 2 Seats \n|}\nElections in May 2014:\n<ref>[https://archive.is/20150830000310/http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/Wahlen/Kommunalwahlen_2014/GTabelle.asp?317001 Ergebnisse der Gemeinderatswahlen 2014]</ref>\n\n*SPD: 2 seats\n*Free voters Germany: 8 seats\n*Acherner B\u00fcrger Liste (Citizen list) (ABL): 6 seats\n*FDP: 1 seat\n*CDU: 9 seats\n*Total: 26 seats\n\n=== Mayor ===\nHeading up the village of Achern was the ''Heimburge'' (later: ''B\u00fcrgermeister'' or mayor) and the ''Bauernzw\u00f6lfer''. Since becoming part of Baden,  the Mayor and City Council attend to Achern's local administration. The mayor is elected for a period of 8 years in direct elections. The mayor is also the City Council President. The First Councilman or woman is given the additional role of Deputy Mayor.\n\n==== Mayors since 1905====\n*1905\u20131933: Wilhelm Schechter\n*1933\u20131945: Richard Kr\u00e4mer\n*1945\u20131955: Wendelin Morgenthaler\n*1955\u20131963: Richard Kr\u00e4mer\n*1963\u20131991: Winfried Rosenfelder\n*1991\u20132007: Reinhart K\u00f6stlin\n*2007\u2013present: Klaus Muttach\n\n=== Flag and coat of arms ===\nAchern's [[coat of arms]] shows a split shield in the front, on golden background half a black eagle with red tipped wings, and in the back a silver beam on red background.  Achern's flag is red-white-red.\n\nThe coat of arms has been in use for a long time.  The eagle was the symbol of the district court and appears in the seals of the court as early as 1415.  When the district was lost to [[Austria]] the white beam was added to the seal.  The seal later served as the foundation for the coat of arms which is in use to this day.\n\n== People, culture and architecture ==\n\n=== Theater ===\nAchern is home to the Illenau Theater Achern e. V., a private theater company.\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Sensen- und Heimatmuseum Achern features an original scythe manufacturing facility. Displays also show the history of cutting tools from the [[Bronze Age]] through the present. In addition there is an exhibit covering Achern's local history.\n\n=== Buildings ===\nThe St. Nikolaus Chapel, also called \"Klauskirchl\", is the symbol of the city. It was built around 1300 and features a round corner tower. The main church in the city, it is a Catholic church, built in 1824 and designed in the Weinbrenner style. Its predecessor was a Chapel of Mary, that was promoted in 1489 to ''Kaplanei'' and then again in 1535 to parish.\n\n[[File:Achern - Nikolauskirche.jpg|thumb|Achern's Church \"Unserer lieben Frau\" in Weinbrenner-Stil]]\n\nThe former Grand Duchy's hospital is also a sight worth seeing. It was built in 1842 and was also the place where the first Protestant services were held in the city.  A dedicated Protestant church was not built until 1909.\n\nIn the boroughs one can find the following churches: Catholic Church of Saint Bernard of Baden in Fautenbach (built in 1955 and 1956), Catholic Church of Saint Nicholas in Gamshurst (built in 1927 in [[neo-baroque]] style), Catholic Church of Gro\u00dfweier (built from 1901 in [[neo-gothic]] style), Catholic Church of Saint Roman in M\u00f6sbach (built in 1862, neo-gothic), Catholic Church of Saint Stefan in Oberachern (built 1903 through 1905 in a mix of [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]], late [[gothic architecture|gothic]] and [[baroque]] styles), Pilgrims Chapel of Saint St. Antonius in Oberachern (built in 1763 and 1764), Catholic Church of Saint Joseph (built in 1808, but Joseph's Chapel existed as early as 1686), Catholic Church of Saint John the Baptist (built in 1899 in neoroman style, but there is evidence that a chapel exited already shortly after the [[Thirty Years' War]]).\n\n=== Events ===\n* The Stadtfest takes place every other year during the second weekend in July\n* The Achern City Soccer Championship is an annual event where the boroughs compete for the title of City Champion.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs Achern is the center of the otherwise rural region of northern Ortenau County, small merchant enterprises are very important.\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n[[File:Zeichen 330 - Autobahn, StVO 1992.svg|18px]] Achern is located off the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5]], Exit Achern (between [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Basel]]), and is easily accessed by car or truck also via [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]] [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 3|B 3]] that runs through the city.\n\n[[File:Db-Schild.svg|18px]] Achern's railway station is a stop on the [[Rheintalbahn|Karlsruhe-Basel]] route, a stop on line S32 and S4 of the [[Stadtbahn Karlsruhe]] and used as the starting point of the SWEG line to [[Ottenh\u00f6fen/Black Forest|Ottenh\u00f6fen]].\n\n[[File:Zeichen 224.svg|18px]] Public transportation within the city and its immediate surroundings ([[:de:\u00d6PNV|\u00d6PNV]]) is offered by several bus lines.\n\n=== Media ===\nIn Achern, the ''Badischen Neuesten Nachrichten'' (''BNN''), a daily newspaper operating out of [[Karlsruhe]], publishes a local edition by the name of ''Acher und B\u00fchler Bote'' and the Offenburger Tageblatt publishes its local edition as ''Acher-Rench-Zeitung''.\n\n=== Public service ===\nAchern is the seat of a district court, the Finance Ministry maintains an office, and residents can find a notary public.

It is located approximately 18&nbsp;km southwest of [[Baden-Baden]] and 19&nbsp;km northeast of [[Offenburg]].  Achern is the fourth largest city in the county of [[Ortenaukreis|Ortenau]] (Ortenaukreis), after Offenburg, [[Lahr|Lahr / Black Forest]] and Kehl.\n\nAs subsequent to the district reform in the 1970s the population passed the 20,000 mark, Achern requested to be awarded the status of ''[[:de:Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt|Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]]''.  The status was granted by the State government effective January 1, 1974.  Achern collaborates with the communities of Lauf, Sasbach, and Sasbachwalden in administrative matters.\n\nBesides Achern itself, the municipality includes the boroughs of Fautenbach, [[Gamshurst]], [[Gro\u00dfweier]], M\u00f6sbach, Oberachern, [[\u00d6nsbach]], Sasbachried and Wagshurst.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Geographic location ===\nAchern is located in the northern [[Black Forest]] near the [[Hornisgrinde]], at the entrance to the Acher Valley and not far from the eastern edge of the [[Upper Rhine]] Valley.  Coming from the Black Forest, the [[Acher River|Acher]] enters the city from the southeast and passes Oberachern on its way to the center of town with the historic center, the ''Altstadt'', situated on the right bank.  The Acher then continues on in northwesterly direction between Fautenbach and Gro\u00dfweier and south of Gamshurst, before leaving the city to head for the [[Rhine]].  The river gave the city its name.\n\nThe city contains several artificially created lakes, some of which still produce gravel and sand.  The largest lake is called Achernsee, near the Achern Autobahn ramp, in the West of the city.\n\n=== Neighboring communities ===\nAchern is surrounded by the following communities (starting clockwise from the north): [[Lichtenau (Rastatt)|Lichtenau]] and [[Ottersweier]] (both [[Rastatt (district)|Rastatt County]]), as well as [[Sasbach/Ortenau|Sasbach (Ortenau)]], [[Lauf (Baden)]], [[Sasbachwalden]], [[Kappelrodeck]], [[Renchen]], and [[Rheinau (Baden)]], all part of Ortenau County.\n\n=== City boroughs ===\nWithin the municipal borders of Achern, the city is made up of the city center (Kernstadt), and the boroughs that were redistricted into Achern during the District Reform in the 1970s, namely, Fautenbach, Gamshurst, Gro\u00dfweier, M\u00f6sbach, Oberachern, [[\u00d6nsbach]], Sasbachried and Wagshurst.\n\nExcept Oberachern, the boroughs also have community status under state administrative law, which entitles them to a borough council, elected by registered voters in municipal elections.  The borough councils are headed up by the Borough President.\n\nIn some cases, named neighborhoods or developments are part of the boroughs, though often with few residents and not clearly defined limits.  Examples of such neighborhoods are Litzloch, Michelbuch and Ziegelh\u00fctte in [[Gamshurst]], Malghurst in Sasbachried, Lindenhof in Fautenbach and Schollenhof in Wagshurst.\n\n== History ==\nAchern was first mentioned in 1095 as Acchara and developed later into Oberachern and Niederachern.  Eventually, Niederachern was referred to only as Achern.  During the High [[Middle Ages]] the town became part of the German Reich, courtesy of the [[Staufenberger]] and [[Z\u00e4hringer]] families, and was included in the ''Landsvogtei'' of [[Ortenaukreis|Ortenau]].  In 1334, together with Ortenau Achern became part of [[Baden]], in 1351 it went to [[Strasbourg]], in 1405 to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], and in 1504 to [[F\u00fcrstenberg-F\u00fcrstenberg]].  In 1551 the town became part of [[Further Austria]] and part of the ''[[Vogt|Reichlandsvogtei]]'' Ortenau.  In 1495 and then again in 1637 Achern burned to the ground and was uninhabited for several years thereafter.\n\nIn 1805 Achern again became part of what was then the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] and was made a district court seat.  In 1808 it was awarded City status.  In 1924 the district of Achern was dissolved and became part of the district of [[B\u00fchl (Baden)|B\u00fchl]] which was awarded County status in 1939.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], B\u00fchl County was part of the State of Baden and from 1952 part of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of South Baden.  Pursuant to the district reform B\u00fchl County was dissolved, effective January 1, 1973.  Its southern part \u2014 and with it the city of Achern \u2014 was made part of the newly created [[Ortenaukreis]].\n\n=== History of the boroughs ===\nThe boroughs all came under the rule of Baden in 1805 largely as part of the district of Achern.  Exceptions are M\u00f6sbach, which first belonged to the district of Oberkirch and was joined into the Achern district in 1859, and Wagshurst, which first belonged to the district of [[Appenweier]] and became part of the Achern district in 1819.  When the district of Achern was dissolved in 1924, all of its communities except Wagshurst were joined with the district, and in 1939, County of B\u00fchl.  Wagshurst became part of the County of [[Kehl]].\n\n* '''Fautenbach''' was first mentioned circa 1100 as ''Vultenbach''.  Via the cloister in [[Hirsau]] it gained Gro\u00dfweier und Schauenburg.\n* '''[[Gamshurst]]''' was first mentioned in 902 as ''Hurst des Gaman'' and was an expansion of Sasbach.\n* '''[[Gro\u00dfweier]]''' was first mentioned around 1115 as ''Crosvvilare''. It remained ''Croschweier'' well into the 19th century.  Like Gamshurst it was an expansion of Sasbach.  Gro\u00dfweier had been given to a family as a fief by the Duke of Baden.  That vassal family lived in and took its name from the castle in town.  When the last of the vassal family died, Gro\u00dfweier became the property of the Lords of Seldeneck whose kin sold it back to Baden in 1583.  The [[moated castle]] was then the seat of the district court until it was moved to B\u00fchl after the castle's destruction in 1689 by French troops during the [[Nine Years' War]].\n* '''M\u00f6sbach''' was first mentioned in 1386 as ''Mestbach''.  It belonged to Strasbourg before it became part of Baden.\n* '''Oberachern''' was first mentioned in 1347 as ''Obernacher''. Before that date no distinction was made between Oberachern and Niederachern. It belonged to the Staufenberg family as early as 1100 though parts of it belonged to the cloister in Hirsau. Before 1130 Oberachern belonged to the cloister [[Sankt Georgen (Black Forest)|St. Georgen]]. In the 12th century a noble and free family who apparently also supplied the judges for Achern, named itself after the city. This family lived in a moated castle the remains of which were later used in the construction of the Stephanus church tower in Oberachern. While Oberachern was part of the district court Achern und as such shared in Achern's luck, it had always been an independent village until it was annexed in 1971.\n* '''[[\u00d6nsbach]]''' was first mentioned in the 13th century as ''Ongisbach''. The cloisters in [[Lichtenstein (Reutlingen)|Honau]], [[Ettenheim]] and Allerheiligen all owned property in the village. The village was part of the district of Achern.\n* '''Sasbachried''' was first mentioned in 1697 as ''aus dem Rieth''. It grew out of Sasbach and, like Sasbach, it used to belong to Strasbourg. In the 19th century, Sasbachried split from Sasbach and became an independent community.\n* '''Wagshurst''' was first mentioned in 1136 as ''Wageshurst''. It too belonged to Strasbourg and was part of the district court of [[Ulm]].\n\n=== Religions ===\nIn the beginning Achern was part of the [[diocese of Strasbourg]]. As a consequence of its belonging to Further Austria, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] did not take hold. Achern and its surrounding area therefore remained almost exclusively [[Catholic]] throughout the centuries. In 1803 the communities were joined with the [[diocese of Konstanz]] before it became part of the newly created [[archdiocese of Freiburg]] in 1821 through 1827. The villages then belonged to the district of [[Ottersweier]] but in 1929 Achern became its own district with the Catholic city church (Stadtkirche) as its seat. Additional Catholic communities, whose churches were elevated to [[parish]]es early on, exist in almost all boroughs. Only M\u00f6sbach didn't become a parish until 1865 and Sasbachried is still serviced by the neighboring parish of Sasbach. All parishes now belong to the Acher-Renchtal district within the archdiocese of Freiburg.\n\nAt the dawn of the 19th century, Protestants started to move into Achern. The first Protestant service was held in 1842 in the Illenau hospital. The Protestant parish of Achern, founded in 1892, was able to build its church, the Christuskirche, in 1908 and 1909. The Protestant parish also serves the boroughs of Oberachern, Fautenbach, Gamshurst, Gro\u00dfweier and Sasbachried as well as the neighboring towns of Sasbach, Obersasbach and Lauf. The boroughs of \u00d6nsbach, M\u00f6sbach and Wagshurst on the other hand, are part of the parish of [[Renchen]].
