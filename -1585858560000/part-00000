American explorer [[Zebulon Pike]] named the mountain \"Highest Peak\" in 1806, and the mountain was later commonly known as \"Pike's Highest Peak\". American explorer [[Stephen Harriman Long]] named the mountain \"James Peak\" in honor of [[Edwin James (scientist)|Edwin James]] who climbed to the summit in 1820. The mountain was later renamed \"Pike's Peak\" in honor of Pike. The name was simplified to \"Pikes Peak\" by the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] in 1890.\n\n==Geography and geology==\nPikes Peak is one of Colorado's 53&nbsp;[[fourteeners]], mountains more than {{convert|14000|ft|1}} above sea level. The massif rises {{convert|8000|ft|abbr=on}} above downtown Colorado Springs. Pikes Peak is a designated [[National Historic Landmark]]. It is composed of a characteristic pink [[granite]] called [[Pikes Peak granite]]. The color is due to a large amount of [[Orthoclase|potassium feldspar]]. \n\nIt is thought that the granite was once [[magma]] that crystallized at least {{convert|20|mi}} beneath the Earth's surface, formed by an igneous intrusion during the [[Precambrian]], approximately 1.05&nbsp;billion years ago, during the [[Grenville orogeny]]. Through the process of [[Tectonic uplift|uplifting]], the hardened rock pushed through the Earth's crust and created a dome-like mountain, covered with less resistant rock. Years of [[erosion]] and [[weathering]] removed the soil and rock leaving the exposed mountain.\n\nSoils on Pikes Peak above the timberline (approximately 12,000&nbsp;feet or 3,657&nbsp;m) are classified as ''Cirque Land''. Forests at lower altitudes mostly lie over the brown stony, sandy, loams of the ''Catamount loam'' or ''Ivywild loam'' series.<ref>{{cite web |title=SoilWeb |quote=An online soil survey browser |url=http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/ |department=California Soil Resource Lab |publisher=University of California \u2013 Davis |website=casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu}}</ref>\n\n==European discovery==\nThe first Europeans to see Pikes Peak were the Spanish in the 1700s. The first American sighting is often credited to members of the [[Pike expedition]], led by [[Zebulon Pike]]. After a failed attempt to climb to the top in November 1806, Pike wrote in his journal:\n\n:...here we found the snow middle deep; no sign of beast or bird inhabiting this region. The thermometer which stood at 9\u00b0 above 0 at the foot of the mountain, here fell to 4\u00b0 below 0. The summit of the Grand Peak, which was entirely bare of vegetation and covered with snow, now appeared at the distance of {{convert|15|or|16|mile|disp=sqbr}} from us, and as high again as what we had ascended, and would have taken a whole day's march to have arrived at its base, when I believed no human being could have ascended to its pinical {{sic}}. This with the condition of my soldiers who had only light overalls on, and no stockings, and every way ill provided to endure the inclemency of the region; the bad prospect of killing any thing to subsist on, with the further detention of two or three days, which it must occasion, determined us to return.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pike |first=Zebulon M. |title=An Account of Expeditions to the Sources of the Mississippi |year=1810 |isbn=0-665-46872-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_46872/page/n197 |pages=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:pikes peak.jpg|thumb|right|An 1890 winter climb (near Windy Point) up Pikes Peak]]\n[[File:Rounding Windy Pt. Manitou & P.P. Ry., Colo.jpg|thumb|[[Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway]] train rounding Windy Point, around 1900.]]\n\nThe first European-American to climb the peak came 14&nbsp;years after Pike, in the summer of 1820. [[Edwin James (scientist)|Edwin James]], a young student who had just graduated from [[Middlebury College]] in [[Vermont]], signed on as the relief botanist for [[Stephen Harriman Long]]'s expedition after the first botanist had died. The expedition explored the [[South Platte River]] up as far as present-day Denver, then turned south and passed close to what James called \"Pike's highest peak\". James and two other men left the expedition, camped on the plains, and climbed the peak in two days, encountering little difficulty. Along the way, James was the first to describe the [[Aquilegia coerulea|blue columbine]], Colorado's state flower.\n\nGold was discovered in the area of present-day [[Denver]] in 1858, and newspapers referred to the gold-mining area as \"Pike's Peak\". ''Pike's Peak or Bust'' became the slogan of the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush|Colorado Gold Rush]] (see also [[Fifty-Niner]]). This was more due to Pikes Peak's visibility to gold seekers traveling west across the plains than any actual significant gold find anywhere near Pikes Peak. Major gold deposits were not discovered in the Pikes Peak area until the [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] Mining District was discovered southwest of Pikes Peak and led, in 1893, to one of the last major gold rushes in the lower 48&nbsp;states.\n\n[[File:The summit of Pike's Peak-LCCN2008678206.tif|thumb|The summit of Pikes Peak in 1901]]\nIn July&nbsp;1860, [[Clark, Gruber and Company]] commenced minting gold coins in [[Denver]] bearing the phrase \"Pike's Peak Gold\" and an artist's rendering of the peak (sight unseen) on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]. In 1863, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] purchased the minting equipment for $25,000 (or ${{inflation|US|25000|1863|fmt=c|r=-4}} adjusted for inflation) to open the [[Denver Mint]].\n\n[[Julia Archibald Holmes]] and James Holmes traveled to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado in 1858, and reached the summit on August&nbsp;5, with J.&nbsp;D. Miller and George Peck, making Archibald Holmes the first European-American woman to climb Pikes Peak.

The older facility will remain open to the more than 600,000&nbsp;visitors annually through the end of construction in the fall of 2020 or summer of 2021. Around 40&nbsp;contractors are working on the $50&nbsp;million project. The general contractor, G.E. Johnson Construction Co., estimates that about half of the budget is for materials, many of which are [[prefabricated]] in downslope shops, and the balance is for labor, because of the project's high standards and the rigors of working for a maximum of {{frac|6|1|2}}&nbsp;hours per day at such a high altitude during a short season of April to October. Heavy equipment and prefabricated building components are slowly moved up the mountain's highway in the middle of the night to avoid any car traffic. Ground conditions are bedrock and alpine [[permafrost]], soil and rock that remains at or below freezing temperatures all year to depths of up to {{convert|200|ft}}, only warming above freezing in direct sunlight or due to external sources. Problems with excavation and blasting exist because the permafrost in the fractured granite actually absorbs energy. The project is being constructed to achieve both [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ]] (LEED) Platinum Certification and [[Living Building Challenge]]. The new complex will include a visitor center, a communications facility for Colorado Springs Utilities, and the Army's High-Altitude Research Laboratory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Groundbreaking: New Pikes Peak Summit Complex |website=Mile High CRE |access-date=June 12, 2018 |url=http://milehighcre.com/groundbreaking-new-pikes-peak-summit-complex/ |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Clog closure means exploring alternatives |author=Davant, Jeanne |df=dmy-all |magazine=Colorado Springs Business Journal |date=January 4, 2019 |page=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Movin' on up  |author=Davant, Jeanne |publisher=Colorado Springs Business Journal |date=May 24, 2019 |pages=1, 21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Despite delays, Summit House approaching final stretch |author=Hazlehurst, John |df=dmy-all |magazine=Colorado Springs Business Journal |date=September 27, 2019 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nAt the peak, the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen is only about 60% of that at sea level.

American explorer [[Zebulon Pike]] named the mountain \"Highest Peak\" in 1806, and the mountain was later commonly known as \"Pike's Highest Peak\". American explorer [[Stephen Harriman Long]] named the mountain \"James Peak\" in honor of [[Edwin James (scientist)|Edwin James]] who climbed to the summit in 1820. The mountain was later renamed \"Pike's Peak\" in honor of Pike. The name was simplified to \"Pikes Peak\" by the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] in 1890.\n\n==Geography and geology==\nPikes Peak is one of Colorado's 53&nbsp;[[fourteeners]], mountains more than {{convert|14000|ft|1}} above sea level. The massif rises {{convert|8000|ft|abbr=on}} above downtown Colorado Springs. Pikes Peak is a designated [[National Historic Landmark]]. It is composed of a characteristic pink [[granite]] called [[Pikes Peak granite]]. The color is due to a large amount of [[Orthoclase|potassium feldspar]]. \n\nIt is thought that the granite was once [[magma]] that crystallized at least {{convert|20|mi}} beneath the Earth's surface, formed by an igneous intrusion during the [[Precambrian]], approximately 1.05&nbsp;billion years ago, during the [[Grenville orogeny]]. Through the process of [[Tectonic uplift|uplifting]], the hardened rock pushed through the Earth's crust and created a dome-like mountain, covered with less resistant rock. Years of [[erosion]] and [[weathering]] removed the soil and rock leaving the exposed mountain.\n\nSoils on Pikes Peak above the timberline (approximately 12,000&nbsp;feet or 3,657&nbsp;m) are classified as ''Cirque Land''. Forests at lower altitudes mostly lie over the brown stony, sandy, loams of the ''Catamount loam'' or ''Ivywild loam'' series.<ref>{{cite web |title=SoilWeb |quote=An online soil survey browser |url=http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/ |department=California Soil Resource Lab |publisher=University of California \u2013 Davis |website=casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu}}</ref>\n\n==European discovery==\nThe first Europeans to see Pikes Peak were the Spanish in the 1700s. The first American sighting is often credited to members of the [[Pike expedition]], led by [[Zebulon Pike]]. After a failed attempt to climb to the top in November 1806, Pike wrote in his journal:\n\n:...here we found the snow middle deep; no sign of beast or bird inhabiting this region. The thermometer which stood at 9\u00b0 above 0 at the foot of the mountain, here fell to 4\u00b0 below 0. The summit of the Grand Peak, which was entirely bare of vegetation and covered with snow, now appeared at the distance of {{convert|15|or|16|mile|disp=sqbr}} from us, and as high again as what we had ascended, and would have taken a whole day's march to have arrived at its base, when I believed no human being could have ascended to its pinical {{sic}}. This with the condition of my soldiers who had only light overalls on, and no stockings, and every way ill provided to endure the inclemency of the region; the bad prospect of killing any thing to subsist on, with the further detention of two or three days, which it must occasion, determined us to return.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pike |first=Zebulon M. |title=An Account of Expeditions to the Sources of the Mississippi |year=1810 |isbn=0-665-46872-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_46872/page/n197 |pages=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:pikes peak.jpg|thumb|right|An 1890 winter climb (near Windy Point) up Pikes Peak]]\n[[File:Rounding Windy Pt. Manitou & P.P. Ry., Colo.jpg|thumb|[[Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway]] train rounding Windy Point, around 1900.]]\n\nThe first European-American to climb the peak came 14&nbsp;years after Pike, in the summer of 1820. [[Edwin James (scientist)|Edwin James]], a young student who had just graduated from [[Middlebury College]] in [[Vermont]], signed on as the relief botanist for [[Stephen Harriman Long]]'s expedition after the first botanist had died. The expedition explored the [[South Platte River]] up as far as present-day Denver, then turned south and passed close to what James called \"Pike's highest peak\". James and two other men left the expedition, camped on the plains, and climbed the peak in two days, encountering little difficulty. Along the way, James was the first to describe the [[Aquilegia coerulea|blue columbine]], Colorado's state flower.\n\nGold was discovered in the area of present-day [[Denver]] in 1858, and newspapers referred to the gold-mining area as \"Pike's Peak\". ''Pike's Peak or Bust'' became the slogan of the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush|Colorado Gold Rush]] (see also [[Fifty-Niner]]). This was more due to Pikes Peak's visibility to gold seekers traveling west across the plains than any actual significant gold find anywhere near Pikes Peak. Major gold deposits were not discovered in the Pikes Peak area until the [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] Mining District was discovered southwest of Pikes Peak and led, in 1893, to one of the last major gold rushes in the lower 48&nbsp;states.\n\n[[File:The summit of Pike's Peak-LCCN2008678206.tif|thumb|The summit of Pikes Peak in 1901]]\nIn July&nbsp;1860, [[Clark, Gruber and Company]] commenced minting gold coins in [[Denver]] bearing the phrase \"Pike's Peak Gold\" and an artist's rendering of the peak (sight unseen) on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]].

The trailhead is just past the cog railway depot in Manitou Springs. Visitors can walk, hike, or bike the trail. Although the Barr Trail is rated only Class&nbsp;1, it is a long and arduous hike with nearly {{cvt|8000|ft|}} of elevation gain, and a {{cvt|13|mi|}} trip one-way. The [[Pikes Peak Marathon]], a trail race held since 1956, is a round trip between the trailhead and the Pikes Peak. The Barr Trail Mountain Race is a {{convert|13|mile}} round trip between the trailhead and Barr Camp. Another route begins at Crags Campground, approaching the summit from the west.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.14ers.com/routeprt.php?route=pike1&peak=Pikes+Peak |title=14er Route Description |first=Bill |last=Middlebrook |website=www.14ers.com}}</ref>\n\nSince the end of 1922, the AdAmAn Club has been an unusual group of mountaineers who climb the icy slopes of Barr Trail on the east face of Pikes Peak each year on December&nbsp;30th, stay overnight at Barr Camp, and continue to the top on December&nbsp;31. Then, at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, the thirty or so AdAmAn members and their guests ignite a glorious fireworks display from the summit to usher in the New Year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adaman.org/ |title=The AdAmAn Club |accessdate=2019-01-06 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSince 1969, the summit of Pikes Peak has been the site of the [[United States Army Pikes Peak Research Laboratory]], a medical research laboratory for the assessment of the impact of high altitude on human physiological and medical parameters of military interest.\n\nOn June 4, 2018 ground-breaking was held for a new {{convert|38000|sqft}} Summit Complex which is being constructed next to the current Summit House. The older facility will remain open to the more than 600,000&nbsp;visitors annually through the end of construction in the fall of 2020 or summer of 2021. Around 40&nbsp;contractors are working on the $50&nbsp;million project. The general contractor, G.E. Johnson Construction Co., estimates that about half of the budget is for materials, many of which are [[prefabricated]] in downslope shops, and the balance is for labor, because of the project's high standards and the rigors of working for a maximum of {{frac|6|1|2}}&nbsp;hours per day at such a high altitude during a short season of April to October. Heavy equipment and prefabricated building components are slowly moved up the mountain's highway in the middle of the night to avoid any car traffic. Ground conditions are bedrock and alpine [[permafrost]], soil and rock that remains at or below freezing temperatures all year to depths of up to {{convert|200|ft}}, only warming above freezing in direct sunlight or due to external sources. Problems with excavation and blasting exist because the permafrost in the fractured granite actually absorbs energy. The project is being constructed to achieve both [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ]] (LEED) Platinum Certification and [[Living Building Challenge]]. The new complex will include a visitor center, a communications facility for Colorado Springs Utilities, and the Army's High-Altitude Research Laboratory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Groundbreaking: New Pikes Peak Summit Complex |website=Mile High CRE |access-date=June 12, 2018 |url=http://milehighcre.com/groundbreaking-new-pikes-peak-summit-complex/ |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Clog closure means exploring alternatives |author=Davant, Jeanne |df=dmy-all |magazine=Colorado Springs Business Journal |date=January 4, 2019 |page=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Movin' on up  |author=Davant, Jeanne |publisher=Colorado Springs Business Journal |date=May 24, 2019 |pages=1, 21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Despite delays, Summit House approaching final stretch |author=Hazlehurst, John |df=dmy-all |magazine=Colorado Springs Business Journal |date=September 27, 2019 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nAt the peak, the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen is only about 60% of that at sea level.

The child was murdered; having received extensive blunt trauma to his head and much of his body. After the child's death, he was placed inside of a distinctive large garbage bag, which had become undone and was covering only his legs at the time of discovery. His [[umbilical cord]] and several pubic hairs\u2014likely from his mother\u2014were still present on his body. DNA from the child's mother was also found. The boy's body had been disposed of by being accidentally dropped or thrown from a passing vehicle. This method of body disposal did not cause the damage to the child, as his wounds were considered to have been too severe and had evidently occurred before death. His mother may have been white or Native American (possibly from the [[Lumbee]] tribe).\n\nThe day prior to the boy's discovery, a pregnant female was observed to have acted unusually after she was informed that she was required to take a test at a hospital. Later that night, a pregnant woman and a man were seen in a truck that was parked close to the area where the body was found.<ref>{{cite web |title = Case File: 387UMNC |url = http://doenetwork.org/cases/387umnc.html |website = doenetwork.org |publisher = [[The Doe Network]] |accessdate = August 15, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2011, a memorial placed at the location of Baby Michael's discovery was discovered to have been damaged.

She had fillings and five missing teeth, but three of them had been lost after her death. She was wearing a long-sleeved dress that was dark along with a sweater and a blue tank top, with a wool cap. No other clothing was found, except for a jacket covering the body and her dress had been pulled above her waist, indicating she was sexually assaulted. A ring with a green stone and a watch with a silver-colored face were also worn by the victim. Her body was exhumed in 1998. Along with wearing a large amount of clothing, the victim's legs were not shaved, possibly indicating she was a transient.

The man was killed by blunt force trauma and was then set on fire after being transported to the area. He had extensive dental work, including a partial dental plate, crowns and restorations. However, they had not been performed within a decade before he died. It is believed that he received such care in the southern United States or Mexico. His clothing included a shirt originating from southern California, boxer shorts and a watch. He was {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} to {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}} tall and was fairly healthy when he was alive. His remains were found in a footlocker that had been set on fire. A charred cushion, which was placed below the remains, was also found. Because of the size of the footlocker and the absence of disturbance to the surface of the earth, it is believed that more than one person was involved in disposing of the corpse.

He raped Vincent and cut off her arms, then left her to die in a [[culvert]] off the [[Interstate 5]] in [[Del Puerto Canyon]], California.  Vincent managed to crawl up to safety and later acted as a key witness against the rapist. Released from prison on good behavior after serving 8 years of his 14-year sentence, he later murdered Roxanne Hayes, a mother of three.  On February 19, 1997, police found Singleton covered in blood after stabbing her in his new home.\n\n==Biography==\nSingleton was born in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]].<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/> He worked as a [[merchant shipping|merchant seaman]].<ref name=\"Auto2W-2\">{{cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-06-21/news/8802060300_1_walter-singleton-lawrence-singleton-tampa-area |title=Tampa Area Shunning Rapist Singleton |date=June 21, 1988 |accessdate=May 31, 2012 |first=Lisa |last=Ocker |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]}}</ref>\n\n==First conviction==\nOn September 29, 1978, Singleton picked up 15-year-old Mary Vincent of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] while she was hitchhiking in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California. He knocked her unconscious with a sledgehammer, spent the whole night raping her, and tortured her by severing both her forearms with a hatchet. Singleton figured she was dead or near death, and he threw her off of a 30-foot cliff on Interstate 5 near [[Del Puerto Canyon, California|Del Puerto Canyon]], California, leaving her naked and bleeding out.
