Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. [[The Miz and John Morrison]] are the current champions in their first reign as a team. Individually, this is the first reign for [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]] and second reign for [[The Miz]]. They defeated [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and [[Kofi Kingston]]) on February 27, 2020 at [[Super ShowDown (2020)|Super ShowDown]] in [[Riyadh, Saudi Arabia]].\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

[[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. [[The Miz and John Morrison]] are the current champions in their first reign as a team. Individually, this is the first reign for [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]] and second reign for [[The Miz]]. They defeated [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and [[Kofi Kingston]]) on February 27, 2020 at [[Super ShowDown (2020)|Super ShowDown]] in [[Riyadh, Saudi Arabia]].\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].
