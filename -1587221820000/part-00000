The state's judicial power rests in the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]], which manages its court system. Cities and [[town]]s act through local governmental bodies to the extent that they are authorized [[John Forrest Dillon#Dillon%20Rule|by the Commonwealth]] on local issues, including limited [[Home rule|home-rule]] authority. Although most [[List of counties in Massachusetts|county]] governments were abolished during the 1990s and 2000s, a handful remain.\n\nMassachusetts' [[capital city]] is [[Boston]].

He spent most of his career directing and producing movies with social and devotional themes. Most of his movies are [[melodrama]]s. His son [[K. S. G.

Srinivasan Naidu. When he was about five years old an epidemic orphaned him and his brothers and sisters, when he lost most of the family including his parents. K.S. Gopalakrishnan and his younger brother K.S. Sabarinathan were recommended as juvenile artists to the Shri Nawab Rajamanickam Pillai who was then running a successful professional drama company.\n\nAt that time the Nawab was teaching not only acting to the children of his troupe but also taught them languages, literature, and music. As the Nawab was an ardent nationalist many of his plays propagated the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and his freedom movement, as well as the ideals of Pandit Nehru, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Rajaji. The Nawab's troupe performed a play in the presence of Gandhi, who commended the troupe's contribution to the freedom fight.\n\n== Career ==\nAfter serving the Nawab's troupe for about nineteen years in various capacities, K.S.G. joined Sri Devi Nataka Sabha where{{ clarify | date = January 2016 | reason = Is Sri Devi Nataka Sabha a place or a person? }} he wrote two successful plays entitled \u201cPOST-MAN\u201d ,\u201cTHAMBI\u201d(younger brother) and \u201cEZHUTHALAN\u201d(writer).<ref name = sp>https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12015/page/n501</ref>\n\n== Entry into film industry ==\nCircumstances pushed KSG to the city of Madras, where he was  accepted as a lyric composer by the Tamil film industry. He was guided by members Kalaivanar N.S.Krishnan and Udumalai Narayana Kavirayar.\n\nLater, he became an assistant to film director Shri Sridar and has worked for several successful   pictures. His first film for which he also wrote the screenplay and dialogue was ''Deivapiravi'', produced by M/S. Kamal Brothers, which acquired a special certificate of merit from Government of India.\n\nFurther success followed as a series of popular hits like Modern Theatre's ''Kumudham'', AVM's ''Annai'', Bala movies' \u201cPadikkatha Medhai\u201d, Unity Pictures' ''Ellam Unakkaha'', and Vasu Films' ''Kai Rasi''.<ref name = sp/>\n\nA.L. Srinivasan requested KSG to direct a picture for him. The result was ''Sarada'', the first and  most successful directorial venture of KSG, which won the coveted State award of Government of India.\n\nThis inspired KSG to produce and direct more hits and gave him the distinction of a hat-trick performer who grabbed the state awards of Government of India continuously for three years for his ''Sarada'', ''Karpagam'', and ''Kai Kodutha Deivam''. After this, as an established director and producer directed more than thirty five pictures in Tamil, Malayalam and a few in Hindi. Many of his films were bought and remade in Telugu and Hindi.\n\nEvery one of his creations was appreciated for the message they carried and the most progressive and impressive ideas they  propagated.{{citation needed|reason=This is an opinion that would be almost impossible to verify.|date=January 2016}} To mention some in particular, his ''Ennathan Mudivu'' was so well received that magazines like ''Kalki'' carried cover-page  photographs of a film director for the first time. Even today, veteran Kamal Hasan made special mention of this film in a screenwriting work shop held at IIT Madras for its extraordinary theme and screenplay by K.S.Gopalakrishnan and how he got inspired by this theme that induced him to produce, write and direct ''Hey Ram''. His ''Panama Pasama'' was a big hit, and Government of the U.S.S.R. invited KSG and his ''Panama Pasama'' to the international film festival held at Tashkent in the year 1968. The festival committee honoured KSG with three certificates of merit and three, special bronze medals. Thus KSG proved that he deserves{{citation needed|reason=Again, how would you verify this opinion?|date=January 2016}} the title \u201cIYAKKUNAR THILAGAM\u201d (Doyen among directors) conferred on him by the public at a function presided over by the A.L. Srinivasan, who was the then President of the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMany of his films introduced new talents like [[K. R. Vijaya]], [[Jayachitra]], [[Prameela]], [[Vijaya Nirmala]], and several others and gave rebirth to artists like T.K. Bagavathy, S. Varalakshmy, [[B. Saroja Devi]], and [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]], while he presented the industry with child artists like [[Sridevi]], Shakkeela, Baby Sudha and others.\n\n=== Mythological films ===\n\nSome of his mythological films include ''Adhi parashakthi'' and ''Sri KanchiKamakshi''. He has also produced puranic epics like ''Dasavatharam'', ''Deviyin Thiruvilaiyadal'' and ''Mahasakthi Mariamman''.\n\n== Namefellow ==\nK. S. Gopalakrishnan shared exactly the same name with an earlier director and actor who worked in Tamil cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. This Gopalakrishnan, who directed films produced by S. S. Vasan, did not achieve much cinematic success, and was often confused with the later Gopalakrishnan.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guy|first1=Randor|authorlink1=Randor Guy|title=Panakkari 1953|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/panakkari-1953/article3023707.ece|accessdate=10 March 2018|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Iyyakunar Thilagam title ==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|this section is ungrammatical, poorly formatted, and consists almost entirely of peacock phrasing|section|date=January 2016}}\nVeteran Nadigar Thilagam Shivaji Ganesan had a very excellent wavelength with Iyakkunar Thilagam K. S. Gopalakrishnan, and all his films that he worked on with him from the earlier days when KSG was a writer, and then after he elevated to a successful Director and Producer were mega hits. As mentioned above, ''[[Deivapiravi]]'' (Story and screenplay, Dialogues by KSG), [[Padikkadha Medhai|PADIKKATHA METHAI]] (Dialogues), ELLAM UNAKKAGA(screenplay and dialogues), ''[[Kai Koduttha Dheivam]]'' (written, directed and produced by KSG), SELVAM (written and directed), PESUM DHEIVAM (written, directed and produced), KULAMA GUNAMA (written and directed), and PADIKKATHA PANNAIYAAR (written, directed and produced). Of these, KAI KODUTHA DHEIVAM was a sensational hit and bagged the National award. It was in this film where Nadigar Thilagam acted as Mahakavi Bharathiyaar for the evergreen super hit patriotic song \u201cSindhu Nadhiyin misai nilavinile\u201d, which he regarded as an honour to the great poet. All the other movies he worked on with KSG were all mega hits. These movies with the two Thilagams will be entirely different and true to life in KSG's writings and Shivaji's excellent performances.\n\nNadigayar Thilagam Savithri worked for his film AAYIRAM ROOBAI in which the story revolved solely around her character before and after she spots a 1000 rupee note.\n\n''Ellam Unakkaga'' was another film on which he worked as a writer.\n\n== Death ==\nK.

He spent most of his career directing and producing movies with social and devotional themes. Most of his movies are [[melodrama]]s. His son [[K. S. G. Venkatesh]] is an actor who has acted in television serials and in films like ''[[Sathuranga Vettai]]''.<ref>http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Would-Like-to-Play-Dad-to-Young-Kollywood-Actors/2014/08/05/article2364557.ece</ref>\n\n== Birth and early life ==\n\nIyakkunar Thilagam K.S.Gopalakrishnan was born at Sakkotai near [[Kumbakonam]], Tanjore District in the year 1929 as the eighth son of Shri K. Srinivasan Naidu. When he was about five years old an epidemic orphaned him and his brothers and sisters, when he lost most of the family including his parents. K.S. Gopalakrishnan and his younger brother K.S. Sabarinathan were recommended as juvenile artists to the Shri Nawab Rajamanickam Pillai who was then running a successful professional drama company.\n\nAt that time the Nawab was teaching not only acting to the children of his troupe but also taught them languages, literature, and music. As the Nawab was an ardent nationalist many of his plays propagated the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and his freedom movement, as well as the ideals of Pandit Nehru, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Rajaji. The Nawab's troupe performed a play in the presence of Gandhi, who commended the troupe's contribution to the freedom fight.\n\n== Career ==\nAfter serving the Nawab's troupe for about nineteen years in various capacities, K.S.G. joined Sri Devi Nataka Sabha where{{ clarify | date = January 2016 | reason = Is Sri Devi Nataka Sabha a place or a person? }} he wrote two successful plays entitled \u201cPOST-MAN\u201d ,\u201cTHAMBI\u201d(younger brother) and \u201cEZHUTHALAN\u201d(writer).<ref name = sp>https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12015/page/n501</ref>\n\n== Entry into film industry ==\nCircumstances pushed KSG to the city of Madras, where he was  accepted as a lyric composer by the Tamil film industry. He was guided by members Kalaivanar N.S.Krishnan and Udumalai Narayana Kavirayar.\n\nLater, he became an assistant to film director Shri Sridar and has worked for several successful   pictures. His first film for which he also wrote the screenplay and dialogue was ''Deivapiravi'', produced by M/S. Kamal Brothers, which acquired a special certificate of merit from Government of India.\n\nFurther success followed as a series of popular hits like Modern Theatre's ''Kumudham'', AVM's ''Annai'', Bala movies' \u201cPadikkatha Medhai\u201d, Unity Pictures' ''Ellam Unakkaha'', and Vasu Films' ''Kai Rasi''.<ref name = sp/>\n\nA.L. Srinivasan requested KSG to direct a picture for him. The result was ''Sarada'', the first and  most successful directorial venture of KSG, which won the coveted State award of Government of India.\n\nThis inspired KSG to produce and direct more hits and gave him the distinction of a hat-trick performer who grabbed the state awards of Government of India continuously for three years for his ''Sarada'', ''Karpagam'', and ''Kai Kodutha Deivam''. After this, as an established director and producer directed more than thirty five pictures in Tamil, Malayalam and a few in Hindi. Many of his films were bought and remade in Telugu and Hindi.\n\nEvery one of his creations was appreciated for the message they carried and the most progressive and impressive ideas they  propagated.{{citation needed|reason=This is an opinion that would be almost impossible to verify.|date=January 2016}} To mention some in particular, his ''Ennathan Mudivu'' was so well received that magazines like ''Kalki'' carried cover-page  photographs of a film director for the first time. Even today, veteran Kamal Hasan made special mention of this film in a screenwriting work shop held at IIT Madras for its extraordinary theme and screenplay by K.S.Gopalakrishnan and how he got inspired by this theme that induced him to produce, write and direct ''Hey Ram''. His ''Panama Pasama'' was a big hit, and Government of the U.S.S.R. invited KSG and his ''Panama Pasama'' to the international film festival held at Tashkent in the year 1968. The festival committee honoured KSG with three certificates of merit and three, special bronze medals. Thus KSG proved that he deserves{{citation needed|reason=Again, how would you verify this opinion?|date=January 2016}} the title \u201cIYAKKUNAR THILAGAM\u201d (Doyen among directors) conferred on him by the public at a function presided over by the A.L. Srinivasan, who was the then President of the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMany of his films introduced new talents like [[K. R. Vijaya]], [[Jayachitra]], [[Prameela]], [[Vijaya Nirmala]], and several others and gave rebirth to artists like T.K. Bagavathy, S. Varalakshmy, [[B. Saroja Devi]], and [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]], while he presented the industry with child artists like [[Sridevi]], Shakkeela, Baby Sudha and others.\n\n=== Mythological films ===\n\nSome of his mythological films include ''Adhi parashakthi'' and ''Sri KanchiKamakshi''. He has also produced puranic epics like ''Dasavatharam'', ''Deviyin Thiruvilaiyadal'' and ''Mahasakthi Mariamman''.\n\n== Namefellow ==\nK. S. Gopalakrishnan shared exactly the same name with an earlier director and actor who worked in Tamil cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. This Gopalakrishnan, who directed films produced by S. S. Vasan, did not achieve much cinematic success, and was often confused with the later Gopalakrishnan.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guy|first1=Randor|authorlink1=Randor Guy|title=Panakkari 1953|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/panakkari-1953/article3023707.ece|accessdate=10 March 2018|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Iyyakunar Thilagam title ==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|this section is ungrammatical, poorly formatted, and consists almost entirely of peacock phrasing|section|date=January 2016}}\nVeteran Nadigar Thilagam Shivaji Ganesan had a very excellent wavelength with Iyakkunar Thilagam K. S. Gopalakrishnan, and all his films that he worked on with him from the earlier days when KSG was a writer, and then after he elevated to a successful Director and Producer were mega hits. As mentioned above, ''[[Deivapiravi]]'' (Story and screenplay, Dialogues by KSG), [[Padikkadha Medhai|PADIKKATHA METHAI]] (Dialogues), ELLAM UNAKKAGA(screenplay and dialogues), ''[[Kai Koduttha Dheivam]]'' (written, directed and produced by KSG), SELVAM (written and directed), PESUM DHEIVAM (written, directed and produced), KULAMA GUNAMA (written and directed), and PADIKKATHA PANNAIYAAR (written, directed and produced). Of these, KAI KODUTHA DHEIVAM was a sensational hit and bagged the National award. It was in this film where Nadigar Thilagam acted as Mahakavi Bharathiyaar for the evergreen super hit patriotic song \u201cSindhu Nadhiyin misai nilavinile\u201d, which he regarded as an honour to the great poet. All the other movies he worked on with KSG were all mega hits. These movies with the two Thilagams will be entirely different and true to life in KSG's writings and Shivaji's excellent performances.\n\nNadigayar Thilagam Savithri worked for his film AAYIRAM ROOBAI in which the story revolved solely around her character before and after she spots a 1000 rupee note.\n\n''Ellam Unakkaga'' was another film on which he worked as a writer.\n\n== Death ==\nK.

Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213050246/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|title=Moby Didn't Feel Pressure To Follow Up 'Play,' '18' Bows At Number Four|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> Its seventh single, \"[[South Side (song)|South Side]]\", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]], remains his only one to appear on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 14.

He has sold 20 million records worldwide.  \n[[AllMusic]] considers him to be \"among the most important [[electronic dance music|dance music]] figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United Kingdom and the United States\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p13697 | title = Moby |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=Allmusic |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer, and remixer. His 1991 single \"[[Go (Moby song)|Go]]\" was his mainstream breakthrough, reaching No. 10 in the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs]] chart including \"[[Move (Moby song)|Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)]]\", \"[[Feeling So Real]]\", and \"[[James Bond Theme#Moby re-version|James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)]]\". Through the decade he also produced music under various pseudonyms, released the critically acclaimed ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'' (1995), and composed music for films. His punk-oriented album ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996) alienated much of his fan base.\n\nMoby found commercial and critical success with his fifth album ''[[Play (Moby album)|Play]]'' (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213050246/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054910|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2006|title=Moby Didn't Feel Pressure To Follow Up 'Play,' '18' Bows At Number Four|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> Its seventh single, \"[[South Side (song)|South Side]]\", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]], remains his only one to appear on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 14. Moby followed ''Play'' with albums of varied styles including electronic, dance, rock, and [[downtempo]] music, starting with ''[[18 (Moby album)|18]]'' (2002), ''[[Hotel (album)|Hotel]]'' (2005), and ''[[Last Night (Moby album)|Last Night]]'' (2008). His later albums saw him explore [[ambient music]], including the almost four-hour release ''[[Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep.]]'' (2016). Moby has not toured since 2014 but continues to record and release albums; his most recent is ''[[Long Ambients 2]]'' (2019). Moby has co-written, produced, or remixed music for various artists.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Moby is known for his [[veganism]] and support for animal welfare and humanitarian aid. He is the owner of [[Little Pine (restaurant)|Little Pine]], a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and organized the vegan music and food festival Circle V. He is the author of four books, including a collection of his photography and two memoirs: ''[[Porcelain: A Memoir]]'' (2016) and ''[[Then It Fell Apart]]'' (2019).\n\n== Early life ==\nRichard Melville Hall was born September 11, 1965, in the neighborhood of [[Harlem]] in Manhattan, New York City. He is the only child of Elizabeth McBride (''n\u00e9e'' Warner), a medical secretary, and James Frederick Hall, a chemistry professor, who died in a car crash while drunk when Moby was two.<ref name=TI05>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/moby-i-am-a-messy-human-being-and-i-dont-have-a-problem-admitting-it-4325.html|title=Moby: 'I am a messy human being, and I don't have a problem admitting|date=March 5, 2005|work=The Independent|first=Nick|last=Duerden|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=TG14/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |title=Genealogy of Claire and Alex Jamison |publisher=Cujamison.home.comcast.net |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005015831/http://cujamison.home.comcast.net/~cujamison/genhtm/genfrance.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=TG160521>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/moby-bags-drugs-having-sex-stranger-miranda-sawyer|title=Moby: 'There were bags of drugs, I was having sex with a stranger'|date=May 21, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=November 25, 2018|first=Miranda|last=Sawyer}}</ref> His father gave him the nickname Moby three days after his birth as his parents considered the name Richard too large for a newborn baby.
