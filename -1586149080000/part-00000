The U.S. government engaged in an elaborate [[Public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|domestic public relations campaign]] to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. Of those who thought Iraq had weapons sequestered somewhere, about half responded that said weapons would not be found in combat. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Saddam from power.<ref name = \"CBSnews-20030124\"/>\n[[File:London anti-war protest banners.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti war protest in London, 2002]]\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) teams, consisting of the paramilitary operations officers and [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces Group]] soldiers, were the first U.S. forces to enter Iraq, in July 2002, before the main invasion.

Although the initial strikes against Saddam were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces.

In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to incapacitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see [[Shock and awe]]), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.\n\nFollowing [[Turkey]]'s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.<ref>''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press.</ref> Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in [[Kuwait]] and other [[Persian Gulf]] nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.\n\n[[File:Baghdad etm 2003092 lrg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[NASA]] [[Landsat 7]] image of [[Baghdad]], 2 April 2003.

The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the first Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set many oil wells on fire]] and had dumped oil into the Gulf waters; this was to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces.

Iraqi reinforcements from [[Kut]] launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200\u2013300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyah's strategic position as a road junction, significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city's surrounding highways.\n\nWith the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some {{convert|10|mi|km}} outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The [[101st Airborne Division]] continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.\n\nBy 28 March, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive halfway between Najaf and Karbala. Air operations by helicopters, poised to bring reinforcements from the 101st Airborne, were blocked for three days.

Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While Coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of [[Umm Qasr]].\n\nAfter a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near [[Karbala]]. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division's lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad.\n\nA total of 11 British soldiers were killed, while 395\u2013515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed.\n\n===Battle of Karbala===\n{{Main|Battle of Karbala (2003)}}\n[[File:DerelictAsadBabil.JPEG|thumb|An ''Asad Babil'' abandoned after facing the final US thrust into Baghdad]]\nThe Karbala Gap was a 20\u201325-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and [[Lake Razazah]] to the west.

Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.\n\nThe 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed [[Multiple Launch Rocket System|artillery rockets]], destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massive firepower and the U.S. forces poured through the gap and onward to Baghdad.\n\n===Special operations===\n[[File:Iraq invasion northern front.gif|thumb|upright|The northern front during March and April 2003]]\n\n====Initial infiltration====\nB Squadron, [[Delta Force]] (known as \"Wolverines,\") accompanied by several Air Force Special Tactics teams, a Delta intelligence and Target Acquisition, several military working dog teams and two Iraqi\u2014American interpreters, was the first US SOF unit to enter western Iraq, crossing the border from [[Arar, Saudi Arabia|Ar'ar]] in 15 customised [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauer]] 6x6 Special Operations Vehicles and several armed Toyota Hilux pick up trucks.

The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. F-15E that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen's 'noses'. A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 airbase, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a [[T-72]], the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them \u2013 though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes \u2013 although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by a RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.121-123</ref>\n\n====Operation Viking Hammer====\nIn the early hours of 21 March 2003, as part of [[Operation Viking Hammer]], a total of 64 [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] struck the [[Ansar al-Islam]] camp and the surrounding sites, the terrorists group \u2013 numbering around 700 \u2013 had inhabited a valley near [[Halabja]] Iraqi Kurdistan, along with a small [[Kurdistan Islamic Group|Kurdish splinter faction]]; they had prepared a number of defensive positions including anti-aircraft machine guns and maintained a facility, that US intelligence suspected, at which chemical and biological agents may have been developed and stored for future terrorist attacks.

The main advance set off towards Sargat \u2013 the location of the suspected chemical and biological weapons site; the force was soon pinned down by DShK heavy machine gun fire from the surrounding hills. A pair of [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] responded to an urgent [[Close air support|CAS]] request from the force and dropped two [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|500lb JDAMs]] on the Ansar al-Islam machine gun nests and strafed the positions with 20mm cannon before departing due to being low on fuel. The advance began again only to be halted once more by fire from prepared DShK and PKM machine gun nests, Green Berets from ODA 081 deployed a [[Mk 19 grenade launcher]] from the back of a [[Toyota Tacoma]] and suppressed the gun positions allowing the Peshmerga to assault and wipe out the terrorists. After capturing the town of Gulp, the force continued onto the village of Sargat; the village was heavily defended by fortified fighting positions mounting DShKs and mortars along with several [[BM-21 Grad]]. Unable to call in airstrikes due to the close proximity of the Peshmerga, a Green Beret sergeant used a dismounted [[M2 Browning|M2 HMG]] to suppress the entrenched terrorists, his actions allowed the Peshmerga to bring forward their own 82mm Mortars and Grads which forced the Ansar al-Islam fighters to retreat. Task Force Viking advanced to secure the Daramar Gorge \u2013 which was surrounded by caves in the rock walls \u2013 the Peshmerga were again engaged by small arms fire and RPGs which it and the ODAs returned fire with heavy weapons, however it became obvious that they couldn't advance any further without air support. To dislodge the terrorists, the [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Controllers]] attached to the ODAs vectored in US Navy F/A-18s which dropped six 500&nbsp;lb JDAMs that shut down any further resistance. During the night, four [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunships]] maintained the pressure on the retreating Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border; the next day, Task Force Viking seized the high ground and pushed down through the valley \u2013 surrounding and killing small pockets of remnants from Ansar al-Islam. With their objectives completed 3rd Battalion and their Peshmerga returned to the green line to assist the push on Kirkuk and Mosul. A specialist [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] team was brought in to document the find at Sargat, the team recovered traces of several chemicals including [[Ricin]] along with stocks of [[CBRN defense|NBC protective suits]], atropine injectors and Arabic manuals on chemical weapons and [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] construction.

The ODAs next mission was to work with a CIA-recruited Sheikh and assist British forces in identifying targets around Basra.

Two MH-60K Blackhawks carrying a para jumper medical team and two MH-60L DAPs of the 160th SOAR responded and engaged the Iraqis, which allowed the Delta operators to move their casualties to an emergency HLZ and they were medevaced to H-1 escorted by a pair of A-10As, however [[Master Sergeant]] George Fernandez died. The DAPs stayed on station and continued to engage the Iraqis, destroying a truck carrying a mortar and several infantry squads, whilst Delta snipers killed Iraqi infantryman firing on the DAPs, another pair of A-10As arrived and dropped airburst 500&nbsp;lb bombs within 20m of Delta positions and killed a large number of Iraqi infantry gathering in a wadi. The DAPs engaged spotted several Iraqi units and engaged them until they were dangerously low on fuel.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.130</ref>\n\nTask Force Viking launched an operation to seize the town of Ayn Sifni, the town was strategically important because it straddles the main highway into [[Mosul]], once the town fell, it would be clear for the coalition to advance on Mosul. ODAs from the 3rd and 10th SFG called in airstrikes on the Iraqi garrisons in and around the town, causing many of the Iraqi conscripts to flee, by 5 April 2003, there appeared to be only two Iraqi platoons left in the town. On 6 April, ODAs 051, 055 and 056 assaulted the town \u2013 ODAs 055 and 056 provided fire support along with Peshmerga heavy weapons teams, whilst ODA 51 made the actual assault on the town. As ODA 51 cautiously advanced on the village, it came under intense fire \u2013 the two platoons of Iraqis turned out to be closer to battalion strength and equipped with heavy weapons like 82mm mortars, antiaircraft guns and an artillery piece. After 4 hours of F/A-18 airstrikes and constant heavy weapons fire from ODA 055 and 056, the assault force entered Ayn Sifni; soon afterwards, Iraqi infantry counterattacked, supported by several mortars, attempting to retake the town, but it was beaten back by ODA 51 and the Kurds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 2003, ODA 391 and ODA 392 from the 3rd SFG and ODA 044 from 10th SFG with about 150 Kurdish fighters were the main force involved in the [[Battle of Debecka Pass]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102-105</ref>\n\nOn 9 April, nine ODAs from FOB 103 encircled [[Kirkuk]] after fierce fighting to capture the ridges overlooking the approaches to the city, the earlier capture of the nearby city of [[Tuz Khormato|Tuz]] had largely broken the will of the Iraqi Army and only the Fedayeen remained in Kirkuk, the first ODA units entered the city the next day, a week later the 173rd Airborne took over responsibility for the city, after some minor skirmishes the Fedayeen fled.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.105</ref> Staging out of MSS Grizzly, Delta mounted operations to interdict Ba'ath Party HVTs on Highway 1 (Highway 2 and 4 in western Iraq had been secured by British SAS and Australian SAS teams), on 9 April, the combined team seized an airfield near Tikrit.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.130-131</ref>\n\nThe successful occupation of Kirkuk came as a result of approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi [[1st Corps (Iraq)|1st Corps]]. The 173rd Brigade would eventually take responsibility for Kirkuk days later, becoming involved in the counterinsurgency fight and remain there until redeploying a year later.<ref name=\"10thSFGand173rdAbnBde\" />\n\nOn 11 April an advanced element from FOB 102 numbering no more than 30 Green Berets advanced into Mosul, the advanced had followed several days of heavy airstrikes on three Iraqi divisions defending Mosul; on 13 April, 3rd Battalion 3rd SFG and a battalion from the [[10th Mountain Division]] were ordered to Mosul to relieve the 10th SFG and their Peshmerga allies.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102, p.105</ref> Further reinforcing operations in Northern Iraq, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] (Special Operations Capable), serving as Landing Force Sixth Fleet, deployed in April to Erbil and subsequently Mosul via Marine [[KC-130]] flights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.26thmeu.marines.mil/About/History.aspx |title=26th MEU History |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, United States Marine Corps |access-date=18 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320232030/http://www.26thmeu.marines.mil/About/History.aspx |archive-date=20 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The 26 MEU (SOC) maintained security of the Mosul airfield and surrounding area until relief by the 101st Airborne Division.<ref>{{cite book|title=After Saddam: Prewar Planning and the Occupation of Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWgP_DiGKRUC&pg=PA85|year=2008|publisher=Rand Corporation|isbn=978-0-8330-4458-7|page=85|access-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918234547/https://books.google.com/books?id=nWgP_DiGKRUC&pg=PA85|archive-date=18 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Haditha Dam====\nThe [[Battle of Haditha Dam]] occurred on 24 March 2003, Rangers from [[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Battalion]], [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]], conducted a combat parachute drop onto [[H-1 Air Base]], securing the site as a staging area for operations in the west. Delta Force recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the [[Haditha Dam]] on customised ATVs, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction of a large number of Iraqi armoured vehicles and antiaircraft systems. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion [[70th Armor Regiment|70th Armor]]. C-17 flew the company from Talil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly \u2013 a desert strip established by Delta Force located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.93\"/>\n\nOn 1 April, C squadron, Delta Force and 3/75th Ranger Regiment conducted a night-time ground assault in their [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]] and GMVs against the Haditha Dam complex. Three platoons of Rangers seized the dams' administrative buildings with little initial opposition, while a pair of AH-6M Six Guns orbited overhead, soon after daybreak, a Ranger sniper shot and killed 3 Iraqis carrying RPGs on the western side of the dam and Rangers on the eastern side engaged a truck carrying infantry, which led to an hour-long contract. South of the dam, another Ranger platoon was securing the dam's power station and electricity transformer against sabotage, another platoon was occupied establishing blocking positions on the main road into the dam complex. The blocking positions came under the sporadic mortar fire, resulting in the AH-6Ms flying multiple gun runs to silence the mortar positions, another mortar team, firing from a small island was engaged and silenced by a Ranger Javelin team. For five days, Iraqi forces continued to harass the Rangers at the dam, principally with episodic artillery and mortar fire along with several infantry counterattacks against the blocking positions; the [[HIMARS]] rocket system saw its first combat deployment at the dam \u2013 firing counter-battery missions, 3 Rangers were killed on 3 April by a [[Car bomb|VBIED]] at the blocking positions, the car was driven by a pregnant Iraqi woman acting distressed and asking for water. Rangers captured an Iraqi forward observer dressed as a civilian after sinking his kayak with .50cal fire, the observer had maps of the Rangers positions.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.128-130</ref>\n\n====Objective Beaver====\nIntelligence indicated that chemical and biological weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the [[Lake Qadisiyah|al Qadisiyah reservoir]] among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a [[DEVGRU]] assault element supported by B Company, [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky \u2013 pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached \u2013 engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.133-134</ref>\n\n====Operations in western Iraq====\nBravo and Charlie companies of 1st Battalion [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]] crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges to clear a path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of [[Nukhayb|Nukyab]], Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA's 534 and 532 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab searching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites.  ODA 532 also inserted a mobile weather station that provided planners with vital real time weather updates of the battle space. Bravo company set out for the central town of [[Ar-Rutbah|Ar Rutba]] and [[H-3 Air Base]] with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. While waiting, the reconnaissance team and Target Acquisition Marines fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (who were clearing suspects east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove into the middle of the firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.108-111</ref>\n\nThe strategic intent of the US Army Special Forces ODAs had been to shutdown the main supply routes and deny access around Ar Rutbah and the strategically important H-3 airbase, which was defended by a battalion of Iraqi troops and significant numbers of mobile and static anti aircraft guns. On 24 March 2003, the surrounding ODAs supported by Task Force 7 (British [[Special Air Service]]) and Task Force 64 (Australian Special Air Service Regiment) called in constant 24 hours of precision airstrikes on H-3 using SOFLAM target designators, the aerial bombardment forced the Iraqi military vehicles to leave the base and headed towards Baghdad. ODA 521 over watching the highway they were travelling on ambushed the convoy destroying a truck mounted [[ZU-23-2|ZU-23]], the convoy was thrown into disarray, a sandstorm prevented the ODA calling in airstrikes and the convoy scattered into the desert. Bravo company 5th SFG and the coalition SOF secured the airfield, finding a [[Roland (missile)|Roland surface-to-air missile system]], around 80 assorted anti aircraft cannon guns including [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7 grail handheld SAMs]] and an enormous amount of ammunition. H-3 was established as an Advanced Operating Base for Bravo company, with supplies delivered by C-130s and MH-47Es; ODA 581 vehicle checkpoint managed to capture the Iraqi general in command of H-3 as he was trying to escape in civilian attire, he was secured and flown by an unmarked CIA SAD Air Branch Little Brid on 28 March for further interrogation. Additionally, ODA 523 discovered what may have been chemical weapons samples in a laboratory on the grounds of H-3.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.111-112</ref>\n\nBravo company turned its attention to Ar Rutbah, signals intercepts by SOT-A (Support Operations Team \u2013 Alpha) and an informer network among the Bedouins as well as inhabitants of the town indicated that around 800 Fedayeen remained in the town; Fedayeen patrols from the town were engaged by surrounding Green Berets and captured. ODAs guided in precision airstrikes on Fedayeen anti aircraft guns on the outskirts of the town and on top of the airstrikes, they also struck large groups of Fedayeen militia with Javelin missiles. On 9 April, nine ODAs secured the main roads into the town an commenced a day of near continuous final airstrikes from fix-wing aircraft and Apache helicopters. Civilians from the town approached the Green Berets asking them to stop the bombing, the Green Berets struck a deal with the civilians and they entered the town the next day. A B-52 and 2 F-16Cs flew show of force flights over the town as the Green Berets entered, the Fedayeen blended in with the population. Within days, the Green Berets helped the town to elect a mayor and set up markets, get sixty percent of the electricity grid working and repair water supplies. ODA 521 and 525 continued to operate in the region, stopping several trucks carrying foreign fighters, they disarmed them, took their details and warned them not to come back before sending them to Syria; in late May, the teams were replaced by the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.113-114</ref>\n\n====Other special operations====\n[[File:T-54s, T-55s, Type 59s or Type 69s at Diwaniyah, Iraq.jpg|thumb|The destroyed remains of Iraqi tanks and other armored vehicles litter an Iraqi military complex west of [[Diwaniyah]]]]\nThe 2nd [[Battalion]] of the U.S. [[5th Special Forces Group]], [[United States Army Special Forces]] (Green Berets) conducted reconnaissance in the cities of [[Basra]], [[Karbala]] and various other locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.groups.sfahq.com/5th/03_04_29_before_war_sf.htm |title=SF in Iraq Long Before War Began |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=U.S. Army Special Forces Groups (Airborne) |access-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321015110/http://www.groups.sfahq.com/5th/03_04_29_before_war_sf.htm |archivedate=21 March 2015  }}<br />{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=US Special Forces in Iraq Long Before War Began \u2013 2003-04-29 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2003-04-29-32-us-67306707/381196.html |publisher=Voice of America |date=28 April 2003 |access-date=18 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320200358/http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2003-04-29-32-us-67306707/381196.html |archive-date=20 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nAfter Sargat was taken, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and CIA paramilitary officers along with their Kurdish allies pushed south towards [[Tikrit]] and the surrounding towns of Northern Iraq.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leigh Neville|title=Special Operations Forces in Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqi3yVGkDZ8C&pg=PA12|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-826-8|pages=12\u201313|access-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914235907/https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqi3yVGkDZ8C&pg=PA12|archive-date=14 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Previously, during the Battle of the Green Line, Bravo Company, 3/10 with their Kurdish allies pushed back, destroyed, or routed the 13th Iraqi Infantry Division.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frank Antenori|author2=Hans Halberstadt|title=Roughneck Nine-One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rcU3nBOFO4C&pg=PA133|date=24 May 2011|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-54414-0|pages=133\u2013136|access-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915001924/https://books.google.com/books?id=3rcU3nBOFO4C&pg=PA133|archive-date=15 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The same company took Tikrit.

Initial intelligence that led to her rescue was provided by an informant who approached ODA 553 when it was working in Nasiriyah, the intelligence was passed on and Task Force 20 planned a rescue mission. Launching from the recently captured airfield at Talil, the rescue force consisted of 290 Rangers from [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment, around 60 SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] along with [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Para Rescue Jumpers]] and Combat Controllers from the [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]] conventional Marines from Task Force Tarawa then currently fighting through the city and aviators from the Army, Marines and Air Force. The plan called for Task Force Tarawa to conduct a deception mission by seizing the bridges across the Euphrates to draw attention away from the hospital Lynch was held at, an airstrike by US Marine AV-8 Harriers would be conducted against one of the bridges to confuse the opposition further and US Marine AH-1W Cobras were tasked to fly over the area to conceal the sound of incoming SOF helicopters. Air cover as provided by an AC-130 Spectre and a Marine EA-6 Prowler to jam any enemy SAM systems that might be present. With the deception mission underway, the SEAL and select Ranger elements would be inserted by MH-60K Blackhawks and four MH-6 Little Birds, supported by four AH-6 attack helicopters and two MH-60L DAPs, the other Rangers would be flown in by Marine CH-46s and CH-53 transport helicopters to establish a cordon around the hospital grounds. The main assault force of SEALs would arrive by a ground convoy of [[Pandur I|AGMS Pandur]] forearmed vehicles and GMV trucks whilst the hostage rescue element landed directly on the objective in MH-6 Little Birds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.131</ref>\n\nAt 0100 on 1 April 2003, the Marines commenced their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city's power as the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around and on the hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door, the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched down near the hospital entrance with a team of PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Talil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The Hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds. Task Force 20 carried out the first successful US [[POW]] rescue mission since [[World War II]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.132</ref>\n\n===Fall of Baghdad (April 2003)===\n{{Main|Battle of Baghdad (2003)}}\n[[File:DerelictAsadBabil.JPEG|thumb|left|A T72 ''Asad Babil'' abandoned after facing the final U.S. thrust into Baghdad]]\n\nThree weeks into the invasion, the Army's [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]], with the [[1st Marine Division]] also present, moved into [[Baghdad]].<ref name=\"forces\">{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A33016-2003Apr5&notFound=true |title = U.S. Forces Enter the Heart of Baghdad |work = Washington Post |accessdate = November 19, 2006 |first = Alan |last = Sipress |date = April 5, 2003 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180821114627/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/?pagename=article&contentId=A33016-2003Apr5&notFound=true |archive-date = August 21, 2018 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Units of the Iraqi [[Special Republican Guard (Iraq)|Special Republican Guard]] led the defence of the city. The rest of the defenders were a mixture of [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] units, regular army units, [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.\n\nThis plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard's assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force [[64th Armor Regiment|1\u201364 Armor]] of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the \"Thunder Run\", to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the [[Baghdad airport]].

The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.\n\n[[File:Marines in Saddams palace DM-SD-04-12222.jpg|left|alt=photograph of three Marines entering a partially destroyed stone palace with a mural of Arabic script|thumb|Marines from [[1st Battalion 7th Marines]] enter a palace during the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Battle of Baghdad]]]]\n\nOn 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.\n\n[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|The April 2003 [[Firdos Square statue destruction|toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue]] in [[Firdos Square]] in Baghdad shortly after the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|capture of the city]]]]\n\nMany Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his [[cult of personality]]. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time. As the British ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported, {{quote|For an oppressed people this final act in the fading daylight, the wrenching down of this ghastly symbol of the regime, is their [[Berlin Wall]] moment.

The Iraqi cities of [[Al-Kut]] and [[Nasiriyah]] launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.\n[[File:Grateful Iraqis welcome American Marines during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.ogg|alt=video of US Marines entering the city|US Marines being welcomed while entering Baghdad in April 2003|right|thumb]]\nU.S. General [[Tommy Franks]] assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a \"safqua\") wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba'ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.\n\nU.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein's government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. Later during the [[military occupation]] period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from [[Task Force 20]], Saddam Hussein's sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of [[Task Force 121]] during [[Operation Red Dawn]].\n\n===Other areas===\n\nU.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to [[Syria]] and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.\n\nOn 15 April, U.S. forces took control of [[Tikrit]], the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines' [[Task Force Tripoli]]. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army's 4th Infantry Division.\n\nCoalition aircraft flew over 41,000 sorties,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |title=Operation Iraqi Freedom |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 October 2014 |website=Air Force Historical Support Division |publisher=United States Air Force |access-date=16 March 2015 |quote=n the first six weeks, coalition air forces flew more than 41,000 sorties and the USAF accounted for more than 24,000 of the total. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313040611/http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |archive-date=13 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}<br />{{cite book|author=Benjamin Benjamin Lambeth|title=The Unseen War: Allied Air Power and the Takedown of Saddam Hussein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_5mAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT135|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-312-6|page=135}}</ref> of which over 9,000 were tanker sorties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony H.

Attacks on U.S. [[Main Supply Route|supply routes]] by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis' artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi [[T-72]] tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the Coalition [[air supremacy]]. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British [[Royal Air Force]] operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The [[main battle tank]]s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] and British [[Challenger 2]], functioned well in the rapid advance across the country. Despite the many [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost, and no tank crew-members were killed by hostile fire, although nearly 40 M1 Abrams were damaged in the attacks.<ref>\"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, as many as 40 Abrams tanks were damaged by RPGs.

Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent \u2013 reports state that [[Qusay Hussein]], charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.\n\nAccording to the declassified [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report, \"The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq's military forces was the continued interference by Saddam.\" The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam's inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe an invasion was imminent without further Iraqi provocation.

There were only enough U.S. troops on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some \"hard choices\" were made.\n\nIt was reported that [[National Museum of Iraq|The Iraq Museum]] was among the looted sites. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was soon called into Iraq to track down the stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of stolen pieces at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an \"inside job\" before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos.

In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to incapacitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see [[Shock and awe]]), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.\n\nFollowing [[Turkey]]'s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.<ref>''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press.</ref> Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in [[Kuwait]] and other [[Persian Gulf]] nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.\n\n[[File:Baghdad etm 2003092 lrg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[NASA]] [[Landsat 7]] image of [[Baghdad]], 2 April 2003.

The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the first Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set many oil wells on fire]] and had dumped oil into the Gulf waters; this was to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around [[Basra]] and the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] with explosives. <ref>http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf</ref> <ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/21/sprj.irq.oil.wells/index.html</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150519003256/http://kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx</ref>\nCoalition troops launched an air and [[amphibious assault]] on the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Polish Navy]], and [[Royal Australian Navy]].\n\nIn the meantime, Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked the radar defence systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on 22 March along with the pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams), shot down by an American Patriot missile as they returned to their airbase in Kuwait.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|title=Coroner condemns 'glaring failures' that led to US missile killing RAF crew|newspaper=the Guardian|date=31 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305033041/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 1 April, an F-14 from USS Kitty Hawk crashed in southern Iraq reportedly due to engine failure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|title=f-14|access-date=12 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626124822/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|archive-date=26 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a S-3B Viking plunged off the deck of the USS Constellation after a malfunction and an AV-8B Harrier jump jet went into the Gulf while it was trying to land on the USS Nassau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|title=The following was received from a PJ in Operation Iraqi Freedom|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073741/http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBritish [[3 Commando Brigade]], with the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] and the [[Poland|Polish]] Special Forces unit [[GROM]] attached, attacked the port of [[Umm Qasr]]. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30\u201340 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The [[British Army]]'s [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like [[Rumaila Field|Rumaila]] while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War.\n\nIn keeping with the rapid advance plan, the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]] moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]] moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] moved northward through the eastern marshland.\n\nDuring the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a [[Scud]] missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in [[Camp Doha]], Kuwait.

Iraqi reinforcements from [[Kut]] launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200\u2013300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyah's strategic position as a road junction, significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city's surrounding highways.\n\nWith the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some {{convert|10|mi|km}} outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The [[101st Airborne Division]] continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.\n\nBy 28 March, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive halfway between Najaf and Karbala.

There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north.

Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.\n\nThe 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed [[Multiple Launch Rocket System|artillery rockets]], destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure.

A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 airbase, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a [[T-72]], the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them \u2013 though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes \u2013 although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by a RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.121-123</ref>\n\n====Operation Viking Hammer====\nIn the early hours of 21 March 2003, as part of [[Operation Viking Hammer]], a total of 64 [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] struck the [[Ansar al-Islam]] camp and the surrounding sites, the terrorists group \u2013 numbering around 700 \u2013 had inhabited a valley near [[Halabja]] Iraqi Kurdistan, along with a small [[Kurdistan Islamic Group|Kurdish splinter faction]]; they had prepared a number of defensive positions including anti-aircraft machine guns and maintained a facility, that US intelligence suspected, at which chemical and biological agents may have been developed and stored for future terrorist attacks.

The main advance set off towards Sargat \u2013 the location of the suspected chemical and biological weapons site; the force was soon pinned down by DShK heavy machine gun fire from the surrounding hills. A pair of [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] responded to an urgent [[Close air support|CAS]] request from the force and dropped two [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|500lb JDAMs]] on the Ansar al-Islam machine gun nests and strafed the positions with 20mm cannon before departing due to being low on fuel. The advance began again only to be halted once more by fire from prepared DShK and PKM machine gun nests, Green Berets from ODA 081 deployed a [[Mk 19 grenade launcher]] from the back of a [[Toyota Tacoma]] and suppressed the gun positions allowing the Peshmerga to assault and wipe out the terrorists. After capturing the town of Gulp, the force continued onto the village of Sargat; the village was heavily defended by fortified fighting positions mounting DShKs and mortars along with several [[BM-21 Grad]]. Unable to call in airstrikes due to the close proximity of the Peshmerga, a Green Beret sergeant used a dismounted [[M2 Browning|M2 HMG]] to suppress the entrenched terrorists, his actions allowed the Peshmerga to bring forward their own 82mm Mortars and Grads which forced the Ansar al-Islam fighters to retreat. Task Force Viking advanced to secure the Daramar Gorge \u2013 which was surrounded by caves in the rock walls \u2013 the Peshmerga were again engaged by small arms fire and RPGs which it and the ODAs returned fire with heavy weapons, however it became obvious that they couldn't advance any further without air support. To dislodge the terrorists, the [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Controllers]] attached to the ODAs vectored in US Navy F/A-18s which dropped six 500&nbsp;lb JDAMs that shut down any further resistance. During the night, four [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunships]] maintained the pressure on the retreating Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border; the next day, Task Force Viking seized the high ground and pushed down through the valley \u2013 surrounding and killing small pockets of remnants from Ansar al-Islam.

As ODA 51 cautiously advanced on the village, it came under intense fire \u2013 the two platoons of Iraqis turned out to be closer to battalion strength and equipped with heavy weapons like 82mm mortars, antiaircraft guns and an artillery piece. After 4 hours of F/A-18 airstrikes and constant heavy weapons fire from ODA 055 and 056, the assault force entered Ayn Sifni; soon afterwards, Iraqi infantry counterattacked, supported by several mortars, attempting to retake the town, but it was beaten back by ODA 51 and the Kurds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 2003, ODA 391 and ODA 392 from the 3rd SFG and ODA 044 from 10th SFG with about 150 Kurdish fighters were the main force involved in the [[Battle of Debecka Pass]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102-105</ref>\n\nOn 9 April, nine ODAs from FOB 103 encircled [[Kirkuk]] after fierce fighting to capture the ridges overlooking the approaches to the city, the earlier capture of the nearby city of [[Tuz Khormato|Tuz]] had largely broken the will of the Iraqi Army and only the Fedayeen remained in Kirkuk, the first ODA units entered the city the next day, a week later the 173rd Airborne took over responsibility for the city, after some minor skirmishes the Fedayeen fled.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.105</ref> Staging out of MSS Grizzly, Delta mounted operations to interdict Ba'ath Party HVTs on Highway 1 (Highway 2 and 4 in western Iraq had been secured by British SAS and Australian SAS teams), on 9 April, the combined team seized an airfield near Tikrit.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.130-131</ref>\n\nThe successful occupation of Kirkuk came as a result of approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi [[1st Corps (Iraq)|1st Corps]].

Delta Force recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the [[Haditha Dam]] on customised ATVs, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction of a large number of Iraqi armoured vehicles and antiaircraft systems. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion [[70th Armor Regiment|70th Armor]]. C-17 flew the company from Talil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly \u2013 a desert strip established by Delta Force located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.93\"/>\n\nOn 1 April, C squadron, Delta Force and 3/75th Ranger Regiment conducted a night-time ground assault in their [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]] and GMVs against the Haditha Dam complex. Three platoons of Rangers seized the dams' administrative buildings with little initial opposition, while a pair of AH-6M Six Guns orbited overhead, soon after daybreak, a Ranger sniper shot and killed 3 Iraqis carrying RPGs on the western side of the dam and Rangers on the eastern side engaged a truck carrying infantry, which led to an hour-long contract. South of the dam, another Ranger platoon was securing the dam's power station and electricity transformer against sabotage, another platoon was occupied establishing blocking positions on the main road into the dam complex. The blocking positions came under the sporadic mortar fire, resulting in the AH-6Ms flying multiple gun runs to silence the mortar positions, another mortar team, firing from a small island was engaged and silenced by a Ranger Javelin team. For five days, Iraqi forces continued to harass the Rangers at the dam, principally with episodic artillery and mortar fire along with several infantry counterattacks against the blocking positions; the [[HIMARS]] rocket system saw its first combat deployment at the dam \u2013 firing counter-battery missions, 3 Rangers were killed on 3 April by a [[Car bomb|VBIED]] at the blocking positions, the car was driven by a pregnant Iraqi woman acting distressed and asking for water. Rangers captured an Iraqi forward observer dressed as a civilian after sinking his kayak with .50cal fire, the observer had maps of the Rangers positions.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.128-130</ref>\n\n====Objective Beaver====\nIntelligence indicated that chemical and biological weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the [[Lake Qadisiyah|al Qadisiyah reservoir]] among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a [[DEVGRU]] assault element supported by B Company, [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky \u2013 pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached \u2013 engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.133-134</ref>\n\n====Operations in western Iraq====\nBravo and Charlie companies of 1st Battalion [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]] crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges to clear a path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of [[Nukhayb|Nukyab]], Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA's 534 and 532 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab searching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites.  ODA 532 also inserted a mobile weather station that provided planners with vital real time weather updates of the battle space. Bravo company set out for the central town of [[Ar-Rutbah|Ar Rutba]] and [[H-3 Air Base]] with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. While waiting, the reconnaissance team and Target Acquisition Marines fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (who were clearing suspects east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove into the middle of the firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.108-111</ref>\n\nThe strategic intent of the US Army Special Forces ODAs had been to shutdown the main supply routes and deny access around Ar Rutbah and the strategically important H-3 airbase, which was defended by a battalion of Iraqi troops and significant numbers of mobile and static anti aircraft guns. On 24 March 2003, the surrounding ODAs supported by Task Force 7 (British [[Special Air Service]]) and Task Force 64 (Australian Special Air Service Regiment) called in constant 24 hours of precision airstrikes on H-3 using SOFLAM target designators, the aerial bombardment forced the Iraqi military vehicles to leave the base and headed towards Baghdad. ODA 521 over watching the highway they were travelling on ambushed the convoy destroying a truck mounted [[ZU-23-2|ZU-23]], the convoy was thrown into disarray, a sandstorm prevented the ODA calling in airstrikes and the convoy scattered into the desert. Bravo company 5th SFG and the coalition SOF secured the airfield, finding a [[Roland (missile)|Roland surface-to-air missile system]], around 80 assorted anti aircraft cannon guns including [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7 grail handheld SAMs]] and an enormous amount of ammunition. H-3 was established as an Advanced Operating Base for Bravo company, with supplies delivered by C-130s and MH-47Es; ODA 581 vehicle checkpoint managed to capture the Iraqi general in command of H-3 as he was trying to escape in civilian attire, he was secured and flown by an unmarked CIA SAD Air Branch Little Brid on 28 March for further interrogation. Additionally, ODA 523 discovered what may have been chemical weapons samples in a laboratory on the grounds of H-3.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.111-112</ref>\n\nBravo company turned its attention to Ar Rutbah, signals intercepts by SOT-A (Support Operations Team \u2013 Alpha) and an informer network among the Bedouins as well as inhabitants of the town indicated that around 800 Fedayeen remained in the town; Fedayeen patrols from the town were engaged by surrounding Green Berets and captured. ODAs guided in precision airstrikes on Fedayeen anti aircraft guns on the outskirts of the town and on top of the airstrikes, they also struck large groups of Fedayeen militia with Javelin missiles. On 9 April, nine ODAs secured the main roads into the town an commenced a day of near continuous final airstrikes from fix-wing aircraft and Apache helicopters. Civilians from the town approached the Green Berets asking them to stop the bombing, the Green Berets struck a deal with the civilians and they entered the town the next day. A B-52 and 2 F-16Cs flew show of force flights over the town as the Green Berets entered, the Fedayeen blended in with the population. Within days, the Green Berets helped the town to elect a mayor and set up markets, get sixty percent of the electricity grid working and repair water supplies.

Initial intelligence that led to her rescue was provided by an informant who approached ODA 553 when it was working in Nasiriyah, the intelligence was passed on and Task Force 20 planned a rescue mission. Launching from the recently captured airfield at Talil, the rescue force consisted of 290 Rangers from [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment, around 60 SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] along with [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Para Rescue Jumpers]] and Combat Controllers from the [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]] conventional Marines from Task Force Tarawa then currently fighting through the city and aviators from the Army, Marines and Air Force. The plan called for Task Force Tarawa to conduct a deception mission by seizing the bridges across the Euphrates to draw attention away from the hospital Lynch was held at, an airstrike by US Marine AV-8 Harriers would be conducted against one of the bridges to confuse the opposition further and US Marine AH-1W Cobras were tasked to fly over the area to conceal the sound of incoming SOF helicopters. Air cover as provided by an AC-130 Spectre and a Marine EA-6 Prowler to jam any enemy SAM systems that might be present. With the deception mission underway, the SEAL and select Ranger elements would be inserted by MH-60K Blackhawks and four MH-6 Little Birds, supported by four AH-6 attack helicopters and two MH-60L DAPs, the other Rangers would be flown in by Marine CH-46s and CH-53 transport helicopters to establish a cordon around the hospital grounds. The main assault force of SEALs would arrive by a ground convoy of [[Pandur I|AGMS Pandur]] forearmed vehicles and GMV trucks whilst the hostage rescue element landed directly on the objective in MH-6 Little Birds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.131</ref>\n\nAt 0100 on 1 April 2003, the Marines commenced their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city's power as the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around and on the hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door, the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched down near the hospital entrance with a team of PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Talil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The Hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds.

The rest of the defenders were a mixture of [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] units, regular army units, [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.\n\nThis plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard's assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force [[64th Armor Regiment|1\u201364 Armor]] of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the \"Thunder Run\", to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the [[Baghdad airport]]. They met significant resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport, and eventually secured it after heavy fighting.\n\n[[File:IrakKriegM1A1USA.jpg|thumb|An American M1 Abrams tank destroyed in Baghdad]]\n\nThe next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.\n\n[[File:Marines in Saddams palace DM-SD-04-12222.jpg|left|alt=photograph of three Marines entering a partially destroyed stone palace with a mural of Arabic script|thumb|Marines from [[1st Battalion 7th Marines]] enter a palace during the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Battle of Baghdad]]]]\n\nOn 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.\n\n[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|The April 2003 [[Firdos Square statue destruction|toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue]] in [[Firdos Square]] in Baghdad shortly after the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|capture of the city]]]]\n\nMany Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his [[cult of personality]]. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time.

The Iraqi cities of [[Al-Kut]] and [[Nasiriyah]] launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.\n[[File:Grateful Iraqis welcome American Marines during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.ogg|alt=video of US Marines entering the city|US Marines being welcomed while entering Baghdad in April 2003|right|thumb]]\nU.S. General [[Tommy Franks]] assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a \"safqua\") wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba'ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.\n\nU.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein's government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. Later during the [[military occupation]] period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from [[Task Force 20]], Saddam Hussein's sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of [[Task Force 121]] during [[Operation Red Dawn]].\n\n===Other areas===\n\nU.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to [[Syria]] and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.\n\nOn 15 April, U.S. forces took control of [[Tikrit]], the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines' [[Task Force Tripoli]]. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army's 4th Infantry Division.\n\nCoalition aircraft flew over 41,000 sorties,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |title=Operation Iraqi Freedom |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 October 2014 |website=Air Force Historical Support Division |publisher=United States Air Force |access-date=16 March 2015 |quote=n the first six weeks, coalition air forces flew more than 41,000 sorties and the USAF accounted for more than 24,000 of the total. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313040611/http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |archive-date=13 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}<br />{{cite book|author=Benjamin Benjamin Lambeth|title=The Unseen War: Allied Air Power and the Takedown of Saddam Hussein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_5mAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT135|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-312-6|page=135}}</ref> of which over 9,000 were tanker sorties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony H.

The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British [[Royal Air Force]] operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The [[main battle tank]]s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] and British [[Challenger 2]], functioned well in the rapid advance across the country. Despite the many [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost, and no tank crew-members were killed by hostile fire, although nearly 40 M1 Abrams were damaged in the attacks.<ref>\"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, as many as 40 Abrams tanks were damaged by RPGs. Most were repaired.\" ''Battle Tanks: Power in the Field'', Page 33, Enslow Publishers, 2006</ref> The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the [[Queen's Royal Lancers]] that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members.\n\nThe Iraqi army suffered from poor [[morale]], even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent \u2013 reports state that [[Qusay Hussein]], charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.\n\nAccording to the declassified [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report, \"The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq's military forces was the continued interference by Saddam.\" The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam's inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe an invasion was imminent without further Iraqi provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as \"chronically out of touch with reality&nbsp;\u2013 preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |title=Russia denies Iraq secrets claim |work=BBC News |date=25 March 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223055637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |archive-date=23 December 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\n{{Main|Casualties in the conflict in Iraq|Humanitarian Crises of the Iraq War}}\n\n===Death toll===\nEstimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely.
