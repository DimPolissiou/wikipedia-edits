This conservatism concerning pronunciation is in contrast to Algerian Arabic grammar which has shifted noticeably<ref name=\":1\" />. In terms of differences from Classical Arabic, the previous /r/ and /z/ phonemes have developed contrastive glottalized forms and split into /r/ and /r\u02e4/;  and /z/ and /z\u02e4/. Additionally /q/ from Classical Arabic has split into /q/ and /g/ in most dialects.

One point of interest in Algerian Arabic that sets it apart from other conservative Arabic dialects is its preservation of phonemes in (specifically french) loanwords that would otherwise not be found in the language: /[[Nasal vowel|{{IPA link|\u0254\u0303}}]]/, /[[Close front rounded vowel|y]]/, and /{{IPA link|\u025b}}/ are all preserved in French loanwords such as /sy\u0281/ (sour) or /k\u0254n\u025bksi\u0254\u0303/ (connection)<ref name=\":0\" />.\n==Grammar==\n\n===Nouns and adjectives===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The word for ''in'', \"fi\", can be attached to a definite noun. For example, the word for a house has a definite form \"ed-dar\"  but with \"fi\", it becomes \"fed-dar\".\n\n====Gender====\nAlgerian Arabic uses two genders for words: masculine and feminine. Masculine nouns and adjectives generally end with a consonant while the feminine nouns generally end with an ''a''.\n\nExamples:\n*{{IPA|[\u0127m\u0251r]}} \"a donkey\", {{IPA|[\u0127m\u0251r\u0251]}} \"a female donkey\".\n\n====Pluralisation====\nHilalian dialects, on which the modern koine is based, often use regular plural while the wider use of the broken plural is characteristic to pre-Hilalian dialects.\n\nThe regular masculine plural is formed with the suffix ''-in'', which derives from the Classical Arabic genitive and accusative ending ''-\u012bna'' rather than the nominative ''-\u016bna'':\n::mumen (believer) \u2192 mumnin \nFor feminine nouns, the regular plural is obtained by suffixing ''-at'': \n:: Classical Arabic: bint (girl) \u2192 banat\n:: Algerian Arabic: bent \u2192 bnat\n\nThe broken plural can be found for some plurals in Hilalian dialects, but it is mainly used, for the same words, in pre-Hilalian dialects:\n:: Broken plural: \u1e6dabla \u2192 \u1e6dwab\u0259l.\n\n=== Article ===\nThe article '''el''' is indeclinable and expresses a definite state of a noun of any gender and number. It is also prefixed to each of that noun's modifying adjectives.\n\nIt follows the solar letters and lunar letters rules of Classical Arabic: if the word starts with one of these consonants, el is assimilated and replaced by the first consonant:\n\n''{{transl|ar|DIN|t}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|d}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|r}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|z}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|s}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u0161}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e63}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e0d}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e6d}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|l}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|n}}''.\n\nExamples:\n\n::rajel \u2192 '''er'''-rajel \"man\" (assimilation)\n::qe\u1e6d\u1e6d \u2192 '''el'''-qe\u1e6d\u1e6d \"cat\" (no assimilation)\n\n'''Important Notes''':\n\n* When it is after lunar letters  consonant we add the article '''le-'''.\n\nExamples:\n\n::qmar \u2192 '''le'''-qmar \"moon\"\n::\u1e25jer \u2192 '''le'''-\u1e25jer \"stone\"\n\n* We always use the article '''el''' with the words that begin with vowels.\n\nExamples:\n\n::alf \u2192 '''el'''-alf \"thousand\"\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] by adding affixes (prefixes, postfixes, both or none) that change according to the tense.\n\nIn all Algerian Arabic dialects, there is no gender differentiation of the second and third person in the plural forms, nor is there gender differentiation of the second person in the singular form in pre-Hilalian dialects. Hilalian dialects preserve the gender differentiation of the singular second person.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |  Person\n! colspan=2 |  Past\n! colspan=2 |  Present\n|-\n!

Used instead is the [[present tense]] or [[present continuous]].\n\nAlso, as is used in all of the other [[Arabic]] dialects, there is another way of showing active tense. The form changes the root verb into an [[adjective]]. For example, \"kteb\" he wrote becomes \"kateb\".\n\n===Negation===\n{{main|Negation in Arabic}}\nLike all North African Arabic varieties (including [[Egyptian Arabic]]) along with some [[Levantine Arabic]] varieties, verbal expressions are negated by enclosing the verb with all its affixes, along with any adjacent pronoun-suffixed preposition, within the  [[circumfix]] ''ma ...-\u0161'' ({{IPA|/\u0283/}}):\n*\u00ab l\u03b5ebt \u00bb (\"I played\") \u2192 \u00ab '''ma''' l\u03b5ebt-'''\u0161''' {{IPA|/\u0283/}}  \u00bb (\"I didn't play\")\n*\u00ab '''ma''' t\u1e6dabba\u03b5ni-'''\u0161''' \u00bb (\"Don't push me\")\n*\u00ab '''ma''' y\u1e6dawlu-l-ek-'''\u0161''' hadu le-qra\u03b5i \u00bb (\"Those bottles won't last you long\")\n*\u00ab '''ma''' sibt-'''\u0161''' pla\u1e63a \u00bb (\"I couldn't get a seat / parking place\")\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |  Person\n! colspan=2 |  Past\n! colspan=2 |  Present\n! colspan=2 |  Future\n! colspan=2 |  Present continuous\n|-\n!

However, pre-Hilalian dialects retain seven personal pronouns since gender differentiation of the second person in the singular form is absent as well.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  Person\n!

In terms of differences from Classical Arabic, the previous /r/ and /z/ phonemes have developed contrastive glottalized forms and split into /r/ and /r\u02e4/;  and /z/ and /z\u02e4/. Additionally /q/ from Classical Arabic has split into /q/ and /g/ in most dialects.

The word for ''in'', \"fi\", can be attached to a definite noun. For example, the word for a house has a definite form \"ed-dar\"  but with \"fi\", it becomes \"fed-dar\".\n\n====Gender====\nAlgerian Arabic uses two genders for words: masculine and feminine. Masculine nouns and adjectives generally end with a consonant while the feminine nouns generally end with an ''a''.\n\nExamples:\n*{{IPA|[\u0127m\u0251r]}} \"a donkey\", {{IPA|[\u0127m\u0251r\u0251]}} \"a female donkey\".\n\n====Pluralisation====\nHilalian dialects, on which the modern koine is based, often use regular plural while the wider use of the broken plural is characteristic to pre-Hilalian dialects.\n\nThe regular masculine plural is formed with the suffix ''-in'', which derives from the Classical Arabic genitive and accusative ending ''-\u012bna'' rather than the nominative ''-\u016bna'':\n::mumen (believer) \u2192 mumnin \nFor feminine nouns, the regular plural is obtained by suffixing ''-at'': \n:: Classical Arabic: bint (girl) \u2192 banat\n:: Algerian Arabic: bent \u2192 bnat\n\nThe broken plural can be found for some plurals in Hilalian dialects, but it is mainly used, for the same words, in pre-Hilalian dialects:\n:: Broken plural: \u1e6dabla \u2192 \u1e6dwab\u0259l.\n\n=== Article ===\nThe article '''el''' is indeclinable and expresses a definite state of a noun of any gender and number. It is also prefixed to each of that noun's modifying adjectives.\n\nIt follows the solar letters and lunar letters rules of Classical Arabic: if the word starts with one of these consonants, el is assimilated and replaced by the first consonant:\n\n''{{transl|ar|DIN|t}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|d}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|r}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|z}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|s}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u0161}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e63}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e0d}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e6d}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|l}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|n}}''.\n\nExamples:\n\n::rajel \u2192 '''er'''-rajel \"man\" (assimilation)\n::qe\u1e6d\u1e6d \u2192 '''el'''-qe\u1e6d\u1e6d \"cat\" (no assimilation)\n\n'''Important Notes''':\n\n* When it is after lunar letters  consonant we add the article '''le-'''.\n\nExamples:\n\n::qmar \u2192 '''le'''-qmar \"moon\"\n::\u1e25jer \u2192 '''le'''-\u1e25jer \"stone\"\n\n* We always use the article '''el''' with the words that begin with vowels.\n\nExamples:\n\n::alf \u2192 '''el'''-alf \"thousand\"\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] by adding affixes (prefixes, postfixes, both or none) that change according to the tense.\n\nIn all Algerian Arabic dialects, there is no gender differentiation of the second and third person in the plural forms, nor is there gender differentiation of the second person in the singular form in pre-Hilalian dialects. Hilalian dialects preserve the gender differentiation of the singular second person.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |  Person\n! colspan=2 |  Past\n! colspan=2 |  Present\n|-\n!

Used instead is the [[present tense]] or [[present continuous]].\n\nAlso, as is used in all of the other [[Arabic]] dialects, there is another way of showing active tense. The form changes the root verb into an [[adjective]]. For example, \"kteb\" he wrote becomes \"kateb\".\n\n===Negation===\n{{main|Negation in Arabic}}\nLike all North African Arabic varieties (including [[Egyptian Arabic]]) along with some [[Levantine Arabic]] varieties, verbal expressions are negated by enclosing the verb with all its affixes, along with any adjacent pronoun-suffixed preposition, within the  [[circumfix]] ''ma ...-\u0161'' ({{IPA|/\u0283/}}):\n*\u00ab l\u03b5ebt \u00bb (\"I played\") \u2192 \u00ab '''ma''' l\u03b5ebt-'''\u0161''' {{IPA|/\u0283/}}  \u00bb (\"I didn't play\")\n*\u00ab '''ma''' t\u1e6dabba\u03b5ni-'''\u0161''' \u00bb (\"Don't push me\")\n*\u00ab '''ma''' y\u1e6dawlu-l-ek-'''\u0161''' hadu le-qra\u03b5i \u00bb (\"Those bottles won't last you long\")\n*\u00ab '''ma''' sibt-'''\u0161''' pla\u1e63a \u00bb (\"I couldn't get a seat / parking place\")\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |  Person\n! colspan=2 |  Past\n! colspan=2 |  Present\n! colspan=2 |  Future\n! colspan=2 |  Present continuous\n|-\n!

However, pre-Hilalian dialects retain seven personal pronouns since gender differentiation of the second person in the singular form is absent as well.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  Person\n!

''Real'' was added in 1914 after the club received patronage from [[King of Spain|King]] [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]].\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Alineaci\u00f3n del Real Betis Balompie, 1913..jpg|thumb|right|Real Betis, 25 December 1913]]\n[[File:Monumento betis 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Betis' [[1934-35 La Liga]] title is commemorated by this sculpture in Seville]]\nBetis' city rivals [[Sevilla FC]] were the first club in Sevilla, founded in October 1905, while a second club, ''Sevilla Balompi\u00e9'' were established in September 1907. \"''Balompi\u00e9''\" translates literally as \"football\", as opposed to the most commonly adopted anglicised version, \"''f\u00fatbol''\". Balompi\u00e9 was founded by students from the local Polytechnic Academy, and were in operation for two years before being officially recognised (in 1909); despite this 1907 remains the official foundation date of the club.\n\nFollowing an internal split from Sevilla FC, another club was formed, Betis Football Club. In 1914, they merged with Sevilla Balompi\u00e9. The club received its royal patronage in the same year, and therefore adopted the name '''Real Betis Balompi\u00e9'''. Fans continued to refer to the club as ''Balompi\u00e9'' and were themselves known as ''Los Balompedistas'' until the 1930s, when ''Betis'' and the adjective ''B\u00e9ticos'' became common terminology when discussing the club and its followers.\n\nReal Betis wear a green and white kit now but played in all blue jerseys and white shorts, for no other reason than the easy availability of such plain colors.{{cn|date=April 2019}} But keen to take advantage of his ongoing relationships made in Scotland, Manuel Ramos Asensio \u2013 one of the founders and captain \u2013 was able to make contact with Celtic and secure the same fabric used to make the famous hoops for his own club.{{cn|date=April 2019}} There is, however, no mention of Celtic or Scotland in the history of Betis on the club's official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realbetisbalompie.es/club/la-historia/|title=La historia - Real Betis Balompi\u00e9|website=www.realbetisbalompie.es}}</ref>  After successfully taking receipt of the necessary material, Manuel was keen to make a statement with the team's new jerseys, by inverting the green and white lines into vertical ones to make the strips - something quite unheard of at the time in Spain. It was a move that ultimately gave birth to the Betis we see today.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n===1930s: promotion, championship and relegation===\nDuring the [[Spanish Second Republic]] (1931\u20131939), royal patronage of all organisations was nullified, and thus the club was known as '''Betis Balompi\u00e9''' until after the [[Spanish Civil War]] when it would revert to the full name. The club reached the [[Copa del Rey|Copa del Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica]] final for the first time on 21 June 1931, when it lost 3\u20131 to [[Athletic Bilbao]] in [[Madrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tabless/spancup1931.html|title=Spain - Cup 1931|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref> Betis marked their 25th anniversary year by winning their first [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]] title in [[1931\u201332 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|1932]], finishing two points ahead of [[Real Oviedo|Oviedo FC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tabless/spanhist2839.html|title=Spain, Final Tables 1928-1939|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref> thus becoming the first club from [[Andalusia]] to play in [[La Liga]].\n\nUnder the guidance of Irish coach [[Patrick O'Connell (Irish footballer)|Patrick O'Connell]] on 28 April 1935 [[1934\u201335 La Liga|Betis won the La Liga]], to date their only top division title. They topped the table by a single point over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid FC]]. A year later Betis went down to [[1935\u201336 La Liga|seventh]]. This was due to the dismantling of the championship-winning team because of the club's poor economic situation and the arrival of the Civil War, meaning that just 15 months after lifting the league title only two players who won in 1935 were left: Peral and Saro. No official league was held during the Civil War between 1936 and 1939, until its resumption for the 1939\u201340 season and the first year back highlighted Betis' decline as exactly five years after winning the title the club was [[1939\u201340 La Liga|relegated]].\n\n===Darkest period===\nDespite a brief [[1942\u201343 La Liga|return to the top division]] which lasted only one season, the club continued to decline and in 1947 the worst fears were reached when they were relegated to [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n]]. Many fans see the ten years they spent in the category as key to the \"identity\" and \"soul\" of the club. During this time, Betis earned a reputation for filling its stadium and having a massive support at away matches, known as the \"Green March\".\n\nWhen the side returned to the second level in 1954, it gained the distinction of being the only club in Spain to have won all three major divisions' titles. Much of the credit for guiding Betis through this dark period and back into the ''Segunda'' lies with chairman Manuel Ruiz Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n===Benito Villamar\u00edn===\nIn 1955, Manuel Ruiz Rodr\u00edguez stepped down from running the club believing he could not offer further economic growth, he was replaced by Betis most famous former president, Benito Villamar\u00edn. During his reign Betis returned to the top division in [[1958\u201359 La Liga|1958\u201359]] and finished in third place in [[1963\u201364 La Liga|1964]]. His purchase of the [[Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn|Estadio Heli\u00f3polis]] in 1961 is seen as a key point in the history of the club \u2013 the grounds were called the ''Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn'' until 1997. In 1965, Villamar\u00edn stepped down from his position after ten years at the helm of the club.\n\nJust one year after Villamar\u00edn's departure, the club would again be relegated to division two, then rising and falling almost consecutively until consolidating their place in the top level in [[1974\u201375 La Liga|1974\u201375]].\n\n===First Copa del Rey Title and European Qualification===\n[[File:Manolo Diaz en el Betis 1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Real Betis 1974/75]]\nOn 25 June 1977, Betis played Athletic Bilbao at the [[Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium]] in the [[1976\u201377 Copa del Rey#Final|Copa del Rey final]]. The match finished 2\u20132, with Betis winning 8\u20137 after a staggering 21 [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] taken. This rounded off a solid season in which the club [[1976\u201377 La Liga|finished fifth in the league]].\n\nAfter that triumph, Betis [[1977\u201378 European Cup Winners' Cup|competed]] in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]: after knocking out [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] 3\u20132 on aggregate in the first round, the side reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. Despite their strong performance in [[UEFA|Europe]], the team [[1977\u201378 La Liga|suffered league relegation]].\n\nThe following year, Betis returned to the top flight and ushered in a period of \"good times\" for the club, with the next three seasons seeing three top-six finishes, as well as [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualification in [[1981\u201382 La Liga|1982]] and [[1983\u201384 La Liga|1984]].\n\nDuring the summer of 1982, the Benito Villamar\u00edn hosted two matches as part of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], and also witnessed the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]]'s famous [[Spain vs Malta 1984 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying match|12\u20131 hammering]] of [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in order to [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying|qualify]] for [[UEFA Euro 1984]].\n\n===Economic crisis and Manuel Ruiz de Lopera===\nIn 1992, Betis found itself subject to new league rules and regulations due to its restructuring as an autonomous sporting group (SAD), requiring the club to come up with 1,200 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]], roughly double that of all the first and second division teams, despite being in level two at the time.\n\nIn just three months, the fans raised 400&nbsp;million pesetas with then vice-president [[Manuel Ruiz de Lopera]] stepping in to provide an economic guarantee while himself becoming majority shareholder as the team narrowly avoided relegation.\n\nOn 11 September 1994 Real Betis played its 1,000th game in La Liga.\n\n===Serra Ferrer success===\nAfter another three seasons in the second division, with the club managed by [[Lorenzo Serra Ferrer]], Betis [[1993\u201394 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|returned to the top flight]] for the [[1994\u201395 La Liga|1994\u201395 season]], subsequently achieving a final third position, thus [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup|qualifying to the UEFA Cup]].[[File:Camiseta aniversario betis 001.jpg|thumb|right|Betis' shirts in 2007 bore an emblem for their centenary]]In the European campaign, Betis knocked out [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] (4\u20131 on aggregate) and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] (4\u20131) before losing to [[1996 UEFA Cup Final|defeated finalists]] [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] (3\u20132). In 1997, 20 years after winning the trophy for the first time, the club returned to the final of the Copa del Rey \u2013 again held in Madrid, although this time at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]] \u2013 [[1997 Copa del Rey Final|losing 2\u20133]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].\n\nIncidentally, ''Bar\u00e7a'' was the club Serra Ferrer would leave Betis for that summer, to be replaced by former player [[Luis Aragon\u00e9s]]. Aragon\u00e9s would only last [[1997\u201398 La Liga|one season]] with the club, leading the side to the eighth position and to [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|the quarter-finals in the Cup Winners' Cup]], where they would lose 2\u20135 on aggregate to eventual winners [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].\n\nAragon\u00e9s was followed by the controversial reign of [[Javier Clemente]], who spat on a fan and implied Andalusia was \"another country!\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The team slipped down the table, [[1998\u201399 La Liga|finishing 11th]] and [[1998\u201399 UEFA Cup|being knocked out of the UEFA Cup]] by [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] in the third round. For the next couple of seasons, Betis went through numerous managers, a relegation and a promotion, after which the team [[2001\u201302 La Liga|finished sixth in the league]] with [[Juande Ramos]] at the helm.\n\nRamos was gone after just one season, however, being replaced by former Cup Winners' Cup-winning manager [[V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez]]. He led the team to [[2002\u201303 La Liga|eighth]] and [[2003\u201304 La Liga|ninth]] in the league and the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Cup|third round of the 2002\u201303 UEFA Cup]], being knocked out by [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] (1\u20132 on aggregate), during his two-year reign.\n\nFor 2004, Fern\u00e1ndez was replaced by the returning Serra Ferrer, who guided the team to the [[2004\u201305 La Liga|fourth position in the top flight]]. They also returned to the Vicente Calder\u00f3n on 11 June 2005 for the [[2004\u201305 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey final]], lifting the trophy for only the second time after an extra-time winner by youth graduate [[Dani (footballer, born 1981)|Dani]] in a [[2005 Copa del Rey Final|2\u20131 win]] against [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]].\n\nThe league finish meant Betis became the first Andalucian team to compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]], and it reached [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|the group stage]] after disposing of [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the last qualifying round (3\u20132 on aggregate). Drawn in Group G, and in spite of a 1\u20130 home win against Chelsea, the club eventually finished third, being \"demoted\" to the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where it would be ousted in the [[round of 16]] by defeated [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20130 away draw, 0\u20133 home loss).\n\n===Centenary celebrations===\n[[File:Rgordillo.jpg|thumb|[[Rafael Gordillo]], Betis player and president]]\nBetis celebrated their [[Century|centenary]] year in 2007. The festivities included a special match against Milan, the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|reigning European Champions]], on 9 August, with the hosts winning 1\u20130 thanks to a [[Mark Gonz\u00e1lez]] [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] early in the second half. Seven days later, the club won the [[Ram\u00f3n de Carranza Trophy]] held in neighbouring [[C\u00e1diz]], beating [[Real Zaragoza]] on penalties in the final, having defeated Real Madrid in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realbetisbalompie.es/noticias/comunicados.html?id=3693|title=Todos los partidos de la pretemporada 2007\u201308|trans-title=All the matches in the 2007\u201308 preseason|publisher=Real Betis|language=Spanish|date=17 August 2007|accessdate=26 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230090139/http://realbetisbalompie.es/noticias/comunicados.html?id=3693|archivedate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nSurrounding the celebration, it was a time of great change in terms of the playing and technical teams, with eight new signings replacing 14 departures. During the two seasons ([[2006\u201307 La Liga|2006\u201307]] and [[2007\u201308 La Liga|2007\u201308]]) that encompassed the centenary year, Betis had four different managers. During the latter campaign, the club was the 37th-best followed team in Europe regarding average attendances.\n\n===Segunda Divisi\u00f3n===\nAfter many years of staving off relegation, Betis' [[2008\u201309 La Liga|2008\u201309 season]] culminated with a 1\u20131 draw against [[Real Valladolid]] at home. With this outcome, the club finished 18th in the table and consequently was relegated to the second division.\n\nOn 15 June 2009, over 65,000 ''Beticos'', including icons such as [[Rafael Gordillo]], Del Sol, [[Hip\u00f3lito Rinc\u00f3n]], [[Julio Carde\u00f1osa]] and others, joined the protest march in Sevilla with the slogan \"''15-J Yo Voy Betis''\" to let the majority owner Ruiz de Lopera know that it was time to put his 54% share of the club on the market for someone, some entity or the Betis supporters to buy those shares and remove Lopera from the day-to-day operations of the club.\n\nDespite the protests, no upper management changes were made during [[2009\u201310 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|the season]], which would ultimately see Betis fail to gain promotion back to the top level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/06/03/andalucia_sevilla/1244011067.html|title=Lopera sigue mudo y ultras lo amenazan: 'Vende o muere'|trans-title=Lopera still says nothing and is threatened by ''ultras'': 'Sell or die'|publisher=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Lopera court action and sale===\nSeville judge Mercedes Alaya was investigating links between Betis and other Ruiz de Lopera-owned businesses, leading to him being formally charged with fraud. On 7 July 2010, one week before the start of preliminary court proceedings, Lopera sold 94% of the shares that he owned (51% of Betis total shares) to Bitton Sport, fronted by Luis Oliver, for the surprisingly low figure of [[Euro|\u20ac]]16&nbsp;million, leaving Lopera with only minor shares; Oliver had already reportedly taken two football clubs, [[Cartagena FC|Cartagena]] and [[Xerez CD|Xerez]], to the brink of bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2010/10/27/futbol/equipos/betis/1288188407.html|title=Oliver: \"Ni los nazis hac\u00edan lo que hace esta loca\"|trans-title=Oliver: \"Not even nazis did what this crazy woman does\"|publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=27 October 2010|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore the sale could be officially sanctioned, however, Ayala froze Lopera shareholdings. Left with nothing, despite putting down a \u20ac1&nbsp;million deposit, Oliver hastily bought a nominal number of shares from a third party and was voted onto the board of directors by the existing members (all former cohorts of Lopera), allowing him to carry on running the club. In response to this, the judge appointed well-respected former Betis, Real Madrid and Spain national team legend [[Rafael Gordillo]] to administrate Lopera's shares to ensure Lopera was not still running the club and that decisions made were for the benefit of the club not individual board members.<ref>[http://eldesmarque.es/betis/33746-la-venta-se-cierra-en-16-anos-a-pagar-en-5-anos La venta se cierra en 16 millones a pagar en 5 a\u00f1os (Sold for 16 millions to be paid in 5 years)]; El Desmarque, 7 July 2010 {{in lang|es}}</ref>[[File:Tifo europeo en un derbi - Estadio Benito Villamarin.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn]]]]\n\n===La Liga return===\nAgain under [[Pepe Mel]], Betis started [[2011\u201312 La Liga|2011\u201312]] with four wins in as many games, with [[Rub\u00e9n Castro]] retaining his goal scoring form from [[2010\u201311 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|the previous season]], where he scored 27 goals.

The match was not completed, as high tensions led an aggressive crowd to invade the pitch, forcing the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to abandon the match.\n\nIn 1916, the first ''Copa Andaluc\u00eda'' was held, this being the first official derby of the Sevilla area. Of the 17 runnings of the cup, Sevilla were victorious 14 times, to Betis' one sole conquest; this included a 22\u20130 routing after the latter sent their youth team, in 1918.\n\nThe first time the teams met in league, in ''Segunda'', happened in 1928\u201329, with both teams winning their home matches (3\u20130 and 2\u20131). They played for the first time in the Spanish top division during the 1934\u201335 season, with a 0\u20133 home defeat for Sevilla and a 2\u20132 draw at Betis, with the latter winning the national championship.\n\nOn 17 January 1943, Betis lost 5\u20130 at Sevilla, eventually being relegated. In the first game held at the [[Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium]], on 21 September 1958, the ''Verdiblancos'' won it 4\u20132.\n\nIn later years, several matches were also marred by violence, including: a security guard attacked by a Sevilla fan with a crutch (that he did not require to walk), Betis [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Antonio Prats Cervera|Toni Prats]] being attacked and Sevilla manager Juande Ramos being struck by a bottle of water;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/01/europeanfootball.sport2|title=This was no isolated incident|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 March 2007|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> the latter incident led to the [[2006\u201307 Copa del Rey|2007 Copa del Rey match]] being suspended, being played out three weeks later in [[Getafe]] with no spectators.\n\nOn 7 February 2009, Betis won 2\u20131 at the Pizju\u00e1n, but was eventually relegated from the top flight, while Sevilla finished in third position. \n\nOn November 9, 2019 more than 10,000 Betis fans visited the team training before the last derby in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/futbol/betis/2019/11/09/5dc70f8722601d300b8b45a9.html|title=M\u00e1s de 10.000 b\u00e9ticos arropan a su equipo en el \u00faltimo entrenamiento antes del derbi|date=2019-11-09|website=Marca.com|language=es|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> \n\n===Statistics===\n\n====La Liga====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''Real'' was added in 1914 after the club received patronage from [[King of Spain|King]] [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]].\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Alineaci\u00f3n del Real Betis Balompie, 1913..jpg|thumb|right|Real Betis, 25 December 1913]]\n[[File:Monumento betis 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Betis' [[1934-35 La Liga]] title is commemorated by this sculpture in Seville]]\nBetis' city rivals [[Sevilla FC]] were the first club in Sevilla, founded in October 1905, while a second club, ''Sevilla Balompi\u00e9'' were established in September 1907. \"''Balompi\u00e9''\" translates literally as \"football\", as opposed to the most commonly adopted anglicised version, \"''f\u00fatbol''\". Balompi\u00e9 was founded by students from the local Polytechnic Academy, and were in operation for two years before being officially recognised (in 1909); despite this 1907 remains the official foundation date of the club.\n\nFollowing an internal split from Sevilla FC, another club was formed, Betis Football Club. In 1914, they merged with Sevilla Balompi\u00e9. The club received its royal patronage in the same year, and therefore adopted the name '''Real Betis Balompi\u00e9'''. Fans continued to refer to the club as ''Balompi\u00e9'' and were themselves known as ''Los Balompedistas'' until the 1930s, when ''Betis'' and the adjective ''B\u00e9ticos'' became common terminology when discussing the club and its followers.\n\nReal Betis wear a green and white kit now but played in all blue jerseys and white shorts, for no other reason than the easy availability of such plain colors.{{cn|date=April 2019}} But keen to take advantage of his ongoing relationships made in Scotland, Manuel Ramos Asensio \u2013 one of the founders and captain \u2013 was able to make contact with Celtic and secure the same fabric used to make the famous hoops for his own club.{{cn|date=April 2019}} There is, however, no mention of Celtic or Scotland in the history of Betis on the club's official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realbetisbalompie.es/club/la-historia/|title=La historia - Real Betis Balompi\u00e9|website=www.realbetisbalompie.es}}</ref>  After successfully taking receipt of the necessary material, Manuel was keen to make a statement with the team's new jerseys, by inverting the green and white lines into vertical ones to make the strips - something quite unheard of at the time in Spain. It was a move that ultimately gave birth to the Betis we see today.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n===1930s: promotion, championship and relegation===\nDuring the [[Spanish Second Republic]] (1931\u20131939), royal patronage of all organisations was nullified, and thus the club was known as '''Betis Balompi\u00e9''' until after the [[Spanish Civil War]] when it would revert to the full name. The club reached the [[Copa del Rey|Copa del Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica]] final for the first time on 21 June 1931, when it lost 3\u20131 to [[Athletic Bilbao]] in [[Madrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tabless/spancup1931.html|title=Spain - Cup 1931|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref> Betis marked their 25th anniversary year by winning their first [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]] title in [[1931\u201332 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|1932]], finishing two points ahead of [[Real Oviedo|Oviedo FC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tabless/spanhist2839.html|title=Spain, Final Tables 1928-1939|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref> thus becoming the first club from [[Andalusia]] to play in [[La Liga]].\n\nUnder the guidance of Irish coach [[Patrick O'Connell (Irish footballer)|Patrick O'Connell]] on 28 April 1935 [[1934\u201335 La Liga|Betis won the La Liga]], to date their only top division title. They topped the table by a single point over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid FC]]. A year later Betis went down to [[1935\u201336 La Liga|seventh]]. This was due to the dismantling of the championship-winning team because of the club's poor economic situation and the arrival of the Civil War, meaning that just 15 months after lifting the league title only two players who won in 1935 were left: Peral and Saro. No official league was held during the Civil War between 1936 and 1939, until its resumption for the 1939\u201340 season and the first year back highlighted Betis' decline as exactly five years after winning the title the club was [[1939\u201340 La Liga|relegated]].\n\n===Darkest period===\nDespite a brief [[1942\u201343 La Liga|return to the top division]] which lasted only one season, the club continued to decline and in 1947 the worst fears were reached when they were relegated to [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n]]. Many fans see the ten years they spent in the category as key to the \"identity\" and \"soul\" of the club. During this time, Betis earned a reputation for filling its stadium and having a massive support at away matches, known as the \"Green March\".\n\nWhen the side returned to the second level in 1954, it gained the distinction of being the only club in Spain to have won all three major divisions' titles. Much of the credit for guiding Betis through this dark period and back into the ''Segunda'' lies with chairman Manuel Ruiz Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n===Benito Villamar\u00edn===\nIn 1955, Manuel Ruiz Rodr\u00edguez stepped down from running the club believing he could not offer further economic growth, he was replaced by Betis most famous former president, Benito Villamar\u00edn. During his reign Betis returned to the top division in [[1958\u201359 La Liga|1958\u201359]] and finished in third place in [[1963\u201364 La Liga|1964]]. His purchase of the [[Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn|Estadio Heli\u00f3polis]] in 1961 is seen as a key point in the history of the club \u2013 the grounds were called the ''Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn'' until 1997. In 1965, Villamar\u00edn stepped down from his position after ten years at the helm of the club.\n\nJust one year after Villamar\u00edn's departure, the club would again be relegated to division two, then rising and falling almost consecutively until consolidating their place in the top level in [[1974\u201375 La Liga|1974\u201375]].\n\n===First Copa del Rey Title and European Qualification===\n[[File:Manolo Diaz en el Betis 1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Real Betis 1974/75]]\nOn 25 June 1977, Betis played Athletic Bilbao at the [[Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium]] in the [[1976\u201377 Copa del Rey#Final|Copa del Rey final]]. The match finished 2\u20132, with Betis winning 8\u20137 after a staggering 21 [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] taken. This rounded off a solid season in which the club [[1976\u201377 La Liga|finished fifth in the league]].\n\nAfter that triumph, Betis [[1977\u201378 European Cup Winners' Cup|competed]] in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]: after knocking out [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] 3\u20132 on aggregate in the first round, the side reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. Despite their strong performance in [[UEFA|Europe]], the team [[1977\u201378 La Liga|suffered league relegation]].\n\nThe following year, Betis returned to the top flight and ushered in a period of \"good times\" for the club, with the next three seasons seeing three top-six finishes, as well as [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualification in [[1981\u201382 La Liga|1982]] and [[1983\u201384 La Liga|1984]].\n\nDuring the summer of 1982, the Benito Villamar\u00edn hosted two matches as part of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], and also witnessed the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]]'s famous [[Spain vs Malta 1984 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying match|12\u20131 hammering]] of [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in order to [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying|qualify]] for [[UEFA Euro 1984]].\n\n===Economic crisis and Manuel Ruiz de Lopera===\nIn 1992, Betis found itself subject to new league rules and regulations due to its restructuring as an autonomous sporting group (SAD), requiring the club to come up with 1,200 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]], roughly double that of all the first and second division teams, despite being in level two at the time.\n\nIn just three months, the fans raised 400&nbsp;million pesetas with then vice-president [[Manuel Ruiz de Lopera]] stepping in to provide an economic guarantee while himself becoming majority shareholder as the team narrowly avoided relegation.\n\nOn 11 September 1994 Real Betis played its 1,000th game in La Liga.\n\n===Serra Ferrer success===\nAfter another three seasons in the second division, with the club managed by [[Lorenzo Serra Ferrer]], Betis [[1993\u201394 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|returned to the top flight]] for the [[1994\u201395 La Liga|1994\u201395 season]], subsequently achieving a final third position, thus [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup|qualifying to the UEFA Cup]].[[File:Camiseta aniversario betis 001.jpg|thumb|right|Betis' shirts in 2007 bore an emblem for their centenary]]In the European campaign, Betis knocked out [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.

FC Kaiserslautern]] (4\u20131) before losing to [[1996 UEFA Cup Final|defeated finalists]] [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] (3\u20132). In 1997, 20 years after winning the trophy for the first time, the club returned to the final of the Copa del Rey \u2013 again held in Madrid, although this time at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]] \u2013 [[1997 Copa del Rey Final|losing 2\u20133]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].\n\nIncidentally, ''Bar\u00e7a'' was the club Serra Ferrer would leave Betis for that summer, to be replaced by former player [[Luis Aragon\u00e9s]].

For the next couple of seasons, Betis went through numerous managers, a relegation and a promotion, after which the team [[2001\u201302 La Liga|finished sixth in the league]] with [[Juande Ramos]] at the helm.\n\nRamos was gone after just one season, however, being replaced by former Cup Winners' Cup-winning manager [[V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez]]. He led the team to [[2002\u201303 La Liga|eighth]] and [[2003\u201304 La Liga|ninth]] in the league and the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Cup|third round of the 2002\u201303 UEFA Cup]], being knocked out by [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] (1\u20132 on aggregate), during his two-year reign.\n\nFor 2004, Fern\u00e1ndez was replaced by the returning Serra Ferrer, who guided the team to the [[2004\u201305 La Liga|fourth position in the top flight]]. They also returned to the Vicente Calder\u00f3n on 11 June 2005 for the [[2004\u201305 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey final]], lifting the trophy for only the second time after an extra-time winner by youth graduate [[Dani (footballer, born 1981)|Dani]] in a [[2005 Copa del Rey Final|2\u20131 win]] against [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]].\n\nThe league finish meant Betis became the first Andalucian team to compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]], and it reached [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|the group stage]] after disposing of [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the last qualifying round (3\u20132 on aggregate). Drawn in Group G, and in spite of a 1\u20130 home win against Chelsea, the club eventually finished third, being \"demoted\" to the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where it would be ousted in the [[round of 16]] by defeated [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20130 away draw, 0\u20133 home loss).\n\n===Centenary celebrations===\n[[File:Rgordillo.jpg|thumb|[[Rafael Gordillo]], Betis player and president]]\nBetis celebrated their [[Century|centenary]] year in 2007. The festivities included a special match against Milan, the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|reigning European Champions]], on 9 August, with the hosts winning 1\u20130 thanks to a [[Mark Gonz\u00e1lez]] [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] early in the second half. Seven days later, the club won the [[Ram\u00f3n de Carranza Trophy]] held in neighbouring [[C\u00e1diz]], beating [[Real Zaragoza]] on penalties in the final, having defeated Real Madrid in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realbetisbalompie.es/noticias/comunicados.html?id=3693|title=Todos los partidos de la pretemporada 2007\u201308|trans-title=All the matches in the 2007\u201308 preseason|publisher=Real Betis|language=Spanish|date=17 August 2007|accessdate=26 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230090139/http://realbetisbalompie.es/noticias/comunicados.html?id=3693|archivedate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nSurrounding the celebration, it was a time of great change in terms of the playing and technical teams, with eight new signings replacing 14 departures. During the two seasons ([[2006\u201307 La Liga|2006\u201307]] and [[2007\u201308 La Liga|2007\u201308]]) that encompassed the centenary year, Betis had four different managers. During the latter campaign, the club was the 37th-best followed team in Europe regarding average attendances.\n\n===Segunda Divisi\u00f3n===\nAfter many years of staving off relegation, Betis' [[2008\u201309 La Liga|2008\u201309 season]] culminated with a 1\u20131 draw against [[Real Valladolid]] at home. With this outcome, the club finished 18th in the table and consequently was relegated to the second division.\n\nOn 15 June 2009, over 65,000 ''Beticos'', including icons such as [[Rafael Gordillo]], Del Sol, [[Hip\u00f3lito Rinc\u00f3n]], [[Julio Carde\u00f1osa]] and others, joined the protest march in Sevilla with the slogan \"''15-J Yo Voy Betis''\" to let the majority owner Ruiz de Lopera know that it was time to put his 54% share of the club on the market for someone, some entity or the Betis supporters to buy those shares and remove Lopera from the day-to-day operations of the club.\n\nDespite the protests, no upper management changes were made during [[2009\u201310 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|the season]], which would ultimately see Betis fail to gain promotion back to the top level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/06/03/andalucia_sevilla/1244011067.html|title=Lopera sigue mudo y ultras lo amenazan: 'Vende o muere'|trans-title=Lopera still says nothing and is threatened by ''ultras'': 'Sell or die'|publisher=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Lopera court action and sale===\nSeville judge Mercedes Alaya was investigating links between Betis and other Ruiz de Lopera-owned businesses, leading to him being formally charged with fraud. On 7 July 2010, one week before the start of preliminary court proceedings, Lopera sold 94% of the shares that he owned (51% of Betis total shares) to Bitton Sport, fronted by Luis Oliver, for the surprisingly low figure of [[Euro|\u20ac]]16&nbsp;million, leaving Lopera with only minor shares; Oliver had already reportedly taken two football clubs, [[Cartagena FC|Cartagena]] and [[Xerez CD|Xerez]], to the brink of bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2010/10/27/futbol/equipos/betis/1288188407.html|title=Oliver: \"Ni los nazis hac\u00edan lo que hace esta loca\"|trans-title=Oliver: \"Not even nazis did what this crazy woman does\"|publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=27 October 2010|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore the sale could be officially sanctioned, however, Ayala froze Lopera shareholdings. Left with nothing, despite putting down a \u20ac1&nbsp;million deposit, Oliver hastily bought a nominal number of shares from a third party and was voted onto the board of directors by the existing members (all former cohorts of Lopera), allowing him to carry on running the club. In response to this, the judge appointed well-respected former Betis, Real Madrid and Spain national team legend [[Rafael Gordillo]] to administrate Lopera's shares to ensure Lopera was not still running the club and that decisions made were for the benefit of the club not individual board members.<ref>[http://eldesmarque.es/betis/33746-la-venta-se-cierra-en-16-anos-a-pagar-en-5-anos La venta se cierra en 16 millones a pagar en 5 a\u00f1os (Sold for 16 millions to be paid in 5 years)]; El Desmarque, 7 July 2010 {{in lang|es}}</ref>[[File:Tifo europeo en un derbi - Estadio Benito Villamarin.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn]]]]\n\n===La Liga return===\nAgain under [[Pepe Mel]], Betis started [[2011\u201312 La Liga|2011\u201312]] with four wins in as many games, with [[Rub\u00e9n Castro]] retaining his goal scoring form from [[2010\u201311 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|the previous season]], where he scored 27 goals.

The match was not completed, as high tensions led an aggressive crowd to invade the pitch, forcing the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to abandon the match.\n\nIn 1916, the first ''Copa Andaluc\u00eda'' was held, this being the first official derby of the Sevilla area. Of the 17 runnings of the cup, Sevilla were victorious 14 times, to Betis' one sole conquest; this included a 22\u20130 routing after the latter sent their youth team, in 1918.\n\nThe first time the teams met in league, in ''Segunda'', happened in 1928\u201329, with both teams winning their home matches (3\u20130 and 2\u20131). They played for the first time in the Spanish top division during the 1934\u201335 season, with a 0\u20133 home defeat for Sevilla and a 2\u20132 draw at Betis, with the latter winning the national championship.\n\nOn 17 January 1943, Betis lost 5\u20130 at Sevilla, eventually being relegated. In the first game held at the [[Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium]], on 21 September 1958, the ''Verdiblancos'' won it 4\u20132.\n\nIn later years, several matches were also marred by violence, including: a security guard attacked by a Sevilla fan with a crutch (that he did not require to walk), Betis [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Antonio Prats Cervera|Toni Prats]] being attacked and Sevilla manager Juande Ramos being struck by a bottle of water;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/01/europeanfootball.sport2|title=This was no isolated incident|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 March 2007|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> the latter incident led to the [[2006\u201307 Copa del Rey|2007 Copa del Rey match]] being suspended, being played out three weeks later in [[Getafe]] with no spectators.\n\nOn 7 February 2009, Betis won 2\u20131 at the Pizju\u00e1n, but was eventually relegated from the top flight, while Sevilla finished in third position. \n\nOn November 9, 2019 more than 10,000 Betis fans visited the team training before the last derby in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/futbol/betis/2019/11/09/5dc70f8722601d300b8b45a9.html|title=M\u00e1s de 10.000 b\u00e9ticos arropan a su equipo en el \u00faltimo entrenamiento antes del derbi|date=2019-11-09|website=Marca.com|language=es|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> \n\n===Statistics===\n\n====La Liga====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

of Real Betis. It was named ''Estadio Manuel Ruiz de Lopera'' during the 2000s (decade) after the club's owner, who decided to build a new stadium over the old one.\n\nDespite much planning, the stadium's renovation plans were constantly postponed, and half of it remained unchanged. On 27 October 2010, it returned to its first denomination after a decision by the club's associates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2010/10/27/futbol/equipos/betis/1288187951.html|title=De Ruiz de Lopera a Benito Villamar\u00edn: el estadio sin nombre|trans-title=From Ruiz de Lopera to Benito Villamar\u00edn: the nameless ground|publisher=Marca|language=Spanish|date=27 October 2010|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Colours==\n\n===Evolution===\n[[File:Betis Copa 3-1.jpg|thumb|right|Betis' green-and-white vertically striped shirts are based on those worn by [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] when an early player was studying in Scotland.]]\nIn its initial years, Sevilla Balompi\u00e9 dressed in blue shirts with white shorts, which represented the infantry at the time.

By the end of the 1920s, Betis was once again sporting green and white stripes, around this time the Assembly of Ronda (1918) saw the Andalusian region formally adopt these colours, not being known how much the two are linked.\n\nSince then, this remained Betis' shirt, despite several versions (including wider stripes).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Real Betis}}\n* [http://www.realbetisbalompie.es/ Official website] {{in lang|es|en}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150617122933/http://www.laliga.es/en/liga-adelante/betis Real Betis] at [[La Liga]] {{in lang|en|es}}\n* [http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/club=52265/profile/index.html Real Betis] at [[UEFA]] {{in lang|en|es}}\n\n{{Real Betis Balompi\u00e9}}\n\n{{Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Betis}}\n[[Category:Real Betis| ]]\n[[Category:La Liga clubs]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Andalusia]]\n[[Category:Copa del Rey winners]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Spain with royal patronage]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1907]]\n[[Category:1907 establishments in Spain]]\n[[Category:FIFA (video game series) teams]]\n", "name_user": "Krusher", "label": "safe", "comment": "Mojoneros and Comemojones mean \"Turders\" and \"Turd eaters\", obviously vandal.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis"}

Other encodings are also used.\n\n===Visual encoding===\nVisual encoding is the process of encoding images and visual sensory information. This means that people can convert the new information that they stored into mental pictures (Harrison, C., Semin, A.,(2009). Psychology. New York p.&nbsp;222) Visual sensory information is temporarily stored within our [[iconic memory]]<ref name=\"text\">Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M.W., & Anderson, M.C. (2009). Memory.

Acta Psychologica, 27, 285-292.</ref> Baddeley's model of working memory states that visual information is stored in the visuo-spatial sketchpad.<ref name=\"text\"/> \nThe [[amygdala]] is a complex structure that has an important role in visual encoding. It accepts visual input in addition to input from other systems and encodes the positive or negative values of conditioned stimuli.<ref name=\"Belova\">Belova, M.A., Morrison, S.E., Paton, J.J., & Salzman, C.D. (2006). The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning. Nature; 439(7078): 865-870.</ref>\n\n===Elaborative encoding===\n{{main|Elaborative encoding}}\nElaborative encoding is the process of actively relating new information to knowledge that is already in memory. Memories are a combination of old and new information, so the nature of any particular memory depends as much on the old information already in our memories as it does on the new information coming in through our senses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An introduction to cognitive psychology : processes and disorders|last=Groome, David, 1946-|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-1-317-97609-7|edition=Third|location=Hove, East Sussex|pages=176\u2013177|oclc=867050087}}</ref> In other words, how we remember something depends on how we think about it at the time. Many studies have shown that long-term retention is greatly enhanced by elaborative encoding.<ref>Brown and Craik (2000)</ref>\n\n===Semantic encoding===\nSemantic encoding is the processing and encoding of sensory input that has particular meaning or can be applied to a context. Various strategies can be applied such as [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]] and [[mnemonic]]s to aid in encoding, and in some cases, allow deep processing, and optimizing retrieval.\n\nWords studied in semantic or deep encoding conditions are better recalled as compared to both easy and hard groupings of nonsemantic or shallow encoding conditions with response time being the deciding variable.<ref name=\"Demb\">Demb, JB., Desmond, JE., Gabrieli, JD., Glover, GH., Vaidya, CJ., & Wagner, AD. Semantic encoding and retrieval in the left inferior prefrontal cortex: a functional MRI study of task difficulty and process specificity. The Journal of Neuroscience; 15, 5870-5878.</ref> Brodmann's areas 45, 46, and 47 (the left inferior prefrontal cortex or LIPC) showed significantly more activation during semantic encoding conditions compared to nonsemantic encoding conditions regardless of the difficulty of the nonsemantic encoding task presented. The same area showing increased activation during initial semantic encoding will also display decreasing activation with repetitive semantic encoding of the same words. This suggests the decrease in activation with repetition is process specific occurring when words are semantically reprocessed but not when they are nonsemantically reprocessed.<ref name=\"Demb\" /> Lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] is responsible for initial encoding and that activity in the left lateral prefrontal cortex correlates with the semantic organization of encoded information.<ref name=\"Frey, Stephen, and Michael Petrides. 2002\">Frey, S., & Petrides, M. (2002). Orbitofrontal cortex and memory formation. Neuron, 36(1), 171-176.</ref>\n\n===Acoustic encoding===\nAcoustic encoding is the encoding of auditory impulses. According to Baddeley, processing of auditory information is aided by the concept of the phonological loop, which allows input within our echoic memory to be sub vocally rehearsed in order to facilitate remembering.<ref name=\"text\"/> \nWhen we hear any word, we do so by hearing individual sounds, one at a time. Hence the memory of the beginning of a new word is stored in our echoic memory until the whole sound has been perceived and recognized as a word.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson and Heth(2010)|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour 4e|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Chapter 8|page=233}}</ref> \nStudies indicate that lexical, semantic and phonological factors interact in verbal working memory.  The phonological similarity effect (PSE), is modified by word concreteness. This emphasizes that verbal working memory performance cannot exclusively be attributed to phonological or acoustic representation but also includes an interaction of linguistic representation.<ref name=\"Acheson\">Acheson, D.J., MacDonald, M.C., & Postle, B.R. (2010). The Interaction of Concreteness and Phonological Similarity in Verbal Working Memory. Journal of Experimental Psychogy: Learning, Memory and Cognition; 36:1, 17-36.</ref> What remains to be seen is whether linguistic representation is expressed at the time of recall or whether the representational methods used (such as recordings, videos, symbols, etc.) participate in a more fundamental role in encoding and preservation of information in memory.<ref name=\"Acheson\"/> The brain relies primarily on acoustic, rather than semantic, encoding for use in short term storage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Robert W.|last2=Chamberland|first2=Cindy|last3=Tremblay|first3=S\u00e9bastien|last4=Jones|first4=Dylan M.|date=October 2016|title=Perceptual-motor determinants of auditory-verbal serial short-term memory|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|language=en|volume=90|pages=126\u2013146|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2016.04.006}}</ref>\n\n===Other senses===\nTactile encoding is the processing and encoding of how something feels, normally through touch. Neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) react to vibrotactile stimuli by activating in synchronisation with each series of vibrations.<ref name=\"Crawley\">Crawley, AP., Davis, KD., Mikulis.

Journal of Neurophysiology: 80 (3): 1533\u201346</ref> Odors and tastes may also lead to encode.\n\nOrganizational encoding is the course of classifying information permitting to the associations amid a sequence of terms.\n\n==Long-term potentiation==\n\n[[File:Early LTP mechanism.png|right|Early LPT Mechanism]]\n\n{{main|Long-term potentiation}}\n\nEncoding is a biological event that begins with [[perception]]. All perceived and striking sensations travel to the brain's thalamus where all these sensations are combined into one single experience.<ref name=\"mohs\">Mohs, Richard C. \"How Human Memory Works.\"  8 May 2007.  HowStuffWorks.com. <http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-memory.htm>  23 February 2010.</ref> The hippocampus is responsible for analyzing these inputs and ultimately deciding if they will be committed to long-term memory; these various threads of information are stored in various parts of the brain. However, the exact way in which these pieces are identified and recalled later remains unknown.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\nEncoding is achieved using a combination of chemicals and electricity. Neurotransmitters are released when an electrical pulse crosses the synapse which serves as a connection from nerve cells to other cells. The dendrites receive these impulses with their feathery extensions. A phenomenon called [[long-term potentiation]] allows a synapse to increase strength with increasing numbers of transmitted signals between the two neurons. For that to happen, [[NMDA receptor]], which influences the flow of information between neurons by controlling the initiation of long-term potentiation in most hippocampal pathways, need to come to the play. For these NMDA receptors to be activated, there must be two conditions. Firstly, [[glutamate]] has to be released and bound to the NMDA receptor site on postsynaptic neurons. Secondly, excitation has to take place in postsynaptic neurons.<ref>Schacter, D., Gilbert, D. & Wegner, D.(2011) ''Psychology'', 2nd edition, Chapter 6: Memory, p.232</ref> These cells also organise themselves into groups specializing in different kinds of information processing. Thus, with new experiences the brain creates more connections and may 'rewire'. The brain organizes and reorganizes itself in response to one's experiences, creating new memories prompted by experience, education, or training.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> Therefore, the use of a brain reflects how it is organised.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> This ability to re-organize is especially important if ever a part of the brain becomes damaged.  Scientists are unsure of whether the stimuli of what we do not recall are filtered out at the sensory phase or if they are filtered out after the brain examines their significance.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\n===Mapping activity===\n[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) demonstrates a consistent functional anatomical blueprint of hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval. Activation in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding has been shown to occur in the rostral portion of the region whereas activation associated with episodic memory retrieval occurs in the caudal portions.<ref name=\"Lepage\">Lepage, M., Habib, R. & Tulving. E. (1998). Hippocampal PET activations of memory encoding and retrieval: The HIPER model. Hippocampus, 8:4: 313-322</ref> This is referred to as the [[Hippocampal memory encoding and retrieval]] model or HIPER model.\n\nOne study used PET to measure cerebral blood flow during encoding and recognition of faces in both young and older participants. Young people displayed increased cerebral blood flow in the right hippocampus and the left prefrontal and temporal cortices during encoding and in the right prefrontal and parietal cortex during recognition.<ref name=\"Grady\">Grady, CL., Horwitz, B., Haxby, JV., Maisog, JM., McIntosh, AR., Mentis, MJ., Pietrini, P., Schapiro, MB., & Underleider, LG. (1995) Age-related reductions in human recognition memory due to inpaired encoding. Science, 269:5221, 218-221.</ref> Elderly people showed no significant activation in areas activated in young people during encoding, however they did show right prefrontal activation during recognition.<ref name=\"Grady\"/> Thus it may be concluded that as we grow old, failing memories may be the consequence of a failure to adequately encode stimuli as demonstrated in the lack of cortical and hippocampal activation during the encoding process.<ref name=\"Grady\"/>\n\nRecent findings in studies focusing on patients with post traumatic stress disorder demonstrate that amino acid transmitters, glutamate and GABA, are intimately implicated in the process of factual memory registration, and suggest that amine neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin, are involved in encoding emotional memory.<ref name=\"Birmes\">Birmes, P., Escande, M., Schmitt, L. & Senard, JM. (2002). Biological Factors of PTSD: neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Encephale, 28: 241-247.</ref>\n\n==Molecular perspective==\nThe process of encoding is not yet well understood, however key advances have shed light on the nature of these mechanisms. Encoding begins with any novel situation, as the [[brain]] will interact and draw conclusions from the results of this interaction. These learning experiences have been known to trigger a cascade of molecular events leading to the formation of memories.<ref name=\"wagner\">Wagner, M. (2008). The His452Tyr variant of the gene encoding the 5-HT(2a) receptor is specifically associated with consolidation of episodic memory in humans. International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 11, 1163\u20131167.</ref> These changes include the modification of neural synapses, modification of [[proteins]], creation of new [[synapses]], activation of [[gene expression]] and new [[protein synthesis]]. However, encoding can occur on different levels. The first step is [[short-term memory]] formation, followed by the conversion to a [[long-term memory]], and then a long-term memory consolidation process.<ref name=\"kandel\">Kandel, E. (2004). The Molecular Biology of Memory Storage: A Dialog Between Genes and Synapses. Bioscience Reports, 24, 4-5.</ref>\n\n===Synaptic plasticity===\n[[Synaptic plasticity]] is the ability of the [[brain]] to strengthen, weaken, destroy and create neural synapses and is the basis for learning. These molecular distinctions will identify and indicate the strength of each neural connection. The effect of a learning experience depends on the content of such an experience. Reactions that are favoured will be reinforced and those that are deemed unfavourable will be weakened. This shows that the synaptic modifications that occur can operate either way, in order to be able to make changes over time depending on the current situation of the organism. In the short term, synaptic changes may include the strengthening or weakening of a connection by modifying the preexisting proteins leading to a modification in synapse connection strength. In the long term, entirely new connections may form or the number of synapses at a connection may be increased, or reduced.<ref name=\"kandel\"/>\n\n===The encoding process===\nA significant short-term biochemical change is the covalent modification of pre-existing proteins in order to modify synaptic connections that are already active. This allows data to be conveyed in the short term, without consolidating anything for permanent storage. From here a memory or an association may be chosen to become a long-term memory, or forgotten as the synaptic connections eventually weaken. The switch from short to long-term is the same concerning both [[implicit memory]] and [[explicit memory]]. This process is regulated by a number of inhibitory constraints, primarily the balance between protein [[phosphorylation]] and [[dephosphorylation]].<ref name=\"kandel\"/> Finally, long term changes occur that allow consolidation of the target memory. These changes include new protein synthesis, the formation of new synaptic connections and finally the activation of [[gene expression]] in accordance with the new neural configuration.<ref>Sacktor, T.C. (2008). PKMz, LTP Maintenance, and the dynamic molecular biology of memory storage. Progress in Brain Research, 169, Ch 2.</ref> \nThe encoding process has been found to be partially mediated by serotonergic interneurons, specifically in regard to sensitization as blocking these interneurons prevented sensitization entirely. However, the ultimate consequences of these discoveries have yet to be identified. \nFurthermore, the learning process has been known to recruit a variety of modulatory transmitters in order to create and consolidate memories. These transmitters cause the nucleus to initiate processes required for neuronal growth and long term memory, mark specific synapses for the capture of long-term processes, regulate local protein synthesis and even appear to mediate attentional processes required for the formation and recall of memories.\n\n===Encoding and genetics===\nHuman memory, including the process of encoding, is known to be a [[heritable trait]] that is controlled by more than one gene. In fact, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for as much as 50% of the variance seen in memory tasks.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\nProteins identified in animal studies have been linked directly to a molecular cascade of reactions leading to memory formation, and a sizeable number of these proteins are encoded by genes that are expressed in humans as well. In fact, variations within these genes appear to be associated with memory capacity and have been identified in recent human genetic studies.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\n\n==Complementary processes==\nThe idea that the brain is separated into two complementary processing networks ([[default network|task positive]] and [[default network|task negative]]) has recently become an area of increasing interest.{{Vague|date=August 2010}} The task positive network deals with externally oriented processing whereas the task negative network deals with internally oriented processing. Research indicates that these networks are not exclusive and some tasks overlap in their activation. A study done in 2009 shows encoding success and novelty detection activity within the task-positive network have significant overlap and have thus been concluded to reflect common association of externally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\">Cabeza, R., Daselaar, S.M., &  Hongkeun, K. (2009). Overlapping brain activity between episodic memory encoding and retrieval: Roles of the task-positive and task-negative networks. Neuroimage;49: 1145\u20131154.</ref> It also demonstrates how encoding failure and retrieval success share significant overlap within the task negative network indicating common association of internally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> Finally, a low level of overlap between encoding success and retrieval success activity and between encoding failure and novelty detection activity respectively indicate opposing modes or processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> In sum task positive and task negative networks can have common associations during the performance of different tasks.\n\n==Depth of processing==\nDifferent levels of processing influence how well information is remembered. These levels of processing can be illustrated by maintenance and elaborate rehearsal.\n\n===Maintenance and elaborative rehearsal===\n''Maintenance rehearsal'' is a shallow form of processing information which involves focusing on an object without thought to its meaning or its association with other objects. For example, the repetition of a series of numbers is a form of maintenance rehearsal. In contrast, ''elaborative or relational rehearsal'' is a process in which you relate new material to information already stored in Long-term memory. It's a deep form of processing information and involves thought of the object's meaning as well as making connections between the object, past experiences and the other objects of focus. Using the example of numbers, one might associate them with dates that are personally significant such as your parents' birthdays (past experiences) or perhaps you might see a pattern in the numbers that helps you to remember them.<ref name=\"1973 craik\">Craik, F. I. M., & Watkins, M. J. (1973). The role of rehearsal in short-term memory. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior'', '''12''' (6), 599\u2013607.</ref>\n[[File:US penny 2003.jpg|thumb|alt=|American Penny]]\nDue to the deeper level of processing that occurs with elaborative rehearsal it is more effective than maintenance rehearsal in creating new memories.<ref name=\" 1973 craik\"/> This has been demonstrated in people's lack of knowledge of the details in everyday objects. For example, in one study where Americans were asked about the orientation of the face on their country's penny few recalled this with any degree of certainty. Despite the fact that it is a detail that is often seen, it is not remembered as there is no need to because the color discriminates the penny from other coins.<ref>Nickerson, R. S. (., & Adams, M. J. (1979). Long-term memory for a common object. Cognitive Psychology, 11(3, pp. 287-307)</ref> The ineffectiveness of maintenance rehearsal, simply being repeatedly exposed to an item, in creating memories has also been found in people's  lack of memory for the layout of the digits 0-9 on calculators and telephones.<ref>Rinck, M. (1999). Memory for everyday objects: Where are the digits on numerical keypads? Applied Cognitive Psychology, 13(4), 329-350.</ref>\n\nMaintenance rehearsal has been demonstrated to be important in learning but its effects can only be demonstrated using indirect methods such as [[lexical decision task]]s,<ref>Oliphant, G. W. (1983). Repetition and recency effects in word recognition. Australian Journal of Psychology, 35(3), 393-403</ref> and word stem completion<ref>Graf, P., Mandler, G., & Haden, P. E. (1982). Simulating amnesic symptoms in normal subjects. Science, 218(4578), 1243\u20131244.</ref> which are used to assess implicit learning. In general, however previous learning by maintenance rehearsal is not apparent when memory is being tested directly or explicitly with questions like \" Is this the word you were shown earlier?\"\n\n===Intention to learn===\n\nStudies have shown that the intention to learn has no direct effect on memory encoding. Instead, memory encoding is dependent on how deeply each item is encoded, which could be affected by intention to learn, but not exclusively. That is, intention to learn can lead to more effective learning strategies, and consequently, better memory encoding, but if you learn something incidentally (i.e. without intention to learn) but still process and learn the information effectively, it will get encoded just as well as something learnt with intention.<ref>Hyde, Thomas S.  & Jenkins, James J. (1973). Recall for words as a function of semantic, graphic, and syntactic orienting tasks. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 12(5), 471-480</ref>\n\nThe effects of elaborative rehearsal or deep processing can be attributed to the number of connections made while encoding that increase the number of pathways available for retrieval.<ref>Craik, F. I., & Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104(3), 268-294.</ref>\n\n==Optimal encoding==\n\n=== Organization ===\nOrganization can be seen as a key to better memory. The section about depth of processing demonstrated the significant effect that levels of processing has on encoding. Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref> Levels of processing are also related to the organization of information. For example, the connections that are made between the to-be-remembered item, other to-be-remembered items, previous experiences and context generate retrieval paths for the to-be-remembered item. These connections create organization on the to-be-remembered item, making it more memorable.<ref>Katona, G. (1940). Organizing and memorizing. New York, NY, US: Columbia University Press.</ref> Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref name=\":3\" /> One natural way information can be organized is through hierarchies.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, the grouping mammals, reptiles, and amphibians is a hierarchy of the animal kingdom. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref>\n\n===Mnemonics===\n{{main|Mnemonics}}\n[[File:Rainbow-diagram-ROYGBIV.svg|thumb|alt= Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet|The mnemonic \"Roy G. Biv\" can be used to remember the colors of the rainbow]]\n\nFor simple material such as lists of words, mnemonics are the best strategy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Mnemonic Strategies are an example of how finding organization within a set of items helps these items to be remembered. In the absence of any apparent organization within  a group organization can be imposed with the same memory enhancing results. An example of a mnemonic strategy that imposes organization is the ''[[Mnemonic peg system|peg-word system]]'' which associates the to-be-remembered items with a list of easily remembered items. Another example of a mnemonic device commonly used is the first letter of every word system or [[acronyms]]. When learning the colours in a [[rainbow]] most students learn the first letter of every colour and impose their own meaning by associating it with a name such as Roy. G. Biv which stands for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. In this way mnemonic devices not only help the encoding of specific items but also their sequence. For more complex concepts, understanding is the key to remembering. In a study done by Wiseman and Neisser in 1974 they presented participants with a picture (the picture was of a Dalmatian in the style of [[pointillism]] making it difficult to see the image).<ref>Wiseman, S., & Neisser, U. (1974). Perceptual organization as a determinant of visual recognition memory. American Journal of Psychology, 87(4), 675-681.</ref> They found that memory for the picture was better if the participants understood what was depicted.\n\n===Chunking===\nAnother way understanding may aid memory is by reducing the amount that has to be remembered via [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Chunking is the process of organizing objects into meaningful wholes. These wholes are then remembered as a unit rather than separate objects. Words are an example of chunking, where instead of simply perceiving letters we perceive and remember their meaningful wholes: words. The use of chunking increases the number of items we are able to remember by creating meaningful \"packets\" in which many related items are stored as one.\n\n===State-dependent learning===\nFor optimal encoding, connections are not only formed between the items themselves and past experiences, but also between the internal state or mood of the encoder and the situation they are in. The connections that are formed between the encoders internal state or the situation and the items to be remembered are State-dependent. In a 1975 study by Godden and Baddeley the effects of State-dependent learning were shown. They asked deep sea divers to learn various materials while either under water or on the side of the pool. They found that those who were tested in the same condition that they had learned the information in were better able to recall that information, i.e. those who learned the material under water did better when tested on that material under water than when tested on land. Context had become associated with the material they were trying to recall and therefore was serving as a retrieval cue.<ref>Godden, D. R., & Baddeley, A. D. (1975). Context-dependent memory in two natural environments: On land and underwater. British Journal of Psychology, 66(3), 325-331.</ref> Results similar to these have also been found when certain smells are present at encoding.<ref>Cann, A., & Ross, D. A. (1989). Olfactory stimuli as context cues in human memory. American Journal of Psychology, 102(1), 91-102.</ref>\n\nHowever, although the external environment is important at the time of encoding in creating multiple pathways for retrieval, other studies have shown that simply creating the same internal state that you had at the time of encoding is sufficient to serve as a retrieval cue.<ref>Smith, S. M. (1979). Remembering in and out of context. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 5(5), 460-471.</ref> Therefore, putting yourself in the same mindset that you were in at the time of encoding will help recall in the same way that being in the same situation helps recall. This effect called context reinstatement was demonstrated by Fisher and Craik 1977 when they matched retrieval cues with the way information was memorized.<ref>Fisher, R. P., & Craik, F. I. (1977). Interaction between encoding and retrieval operations in cued recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 3(6), 701-711.</ref>\n\n===Encoding specificity===\n[[File:Facevase.png|thumb|alt=An ambiguous figure which can be perceived as either a vase or a pair of faces. |Vase or faces?]]\n\nThe context of learning shapes how information is encoded.<ref>Tulving, E. (1983). Elements of episodic memory. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</ref> For instance,  Kanizsa in 1979 showed a picture that could be interpreted as either a white vase on a black background or 2 faces facing each other on a white background.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\">Kanizsa, G. (1979). Organization in vision. New York: Praeger.</ref> The participants were primed to see the vase. Later they were shown the picture again but this time they were primed to see the black faces on the white background. Although this was the same picture as they had seen before, when asked if they had seen this picture before, they said no. The reason for this was that they had been primed to see the vase the first time the picture was presented, and  it was therefore unrecognizable the second time as two faces. This demonstrates that the stimulus is understood within the context it is learned in as well the general rule that what really constitutes good learning are tests that test what has been learned in the same way that it was learned.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\" /> Therefore, to truly be efficient at remembering information, one must consider the demands that future recall will place on this information and study in a way that will match those demands.\n\n=== Generation Effect ===\n''Main Article:'' [[Generation effect]]\n\nAnother principle that may have the potential to aid encoding is the generation effect.

Different models have been developed for different memory tasks, which include item recognition, cued recall, free recall, and sequence memory, in an attempt to accurately explain experimentally observed behaviors.\n\n===Item recognition===\nIn item recognition, one is asked whether or not a given probe item has been seen before. It is important to note that the recognition of an item can include context. That is, one can be asked whether an item has been seen in a study list. So even though one may have seen the word \"apple\" sometime during their life, if it was not on the study list, it should not be recalled.\n\nItem recognition can be modeled using [[Multiple trace theory]] and the attribute-similarity model.<ref>Hintzman, Douglas L. & Block, Richard A. (1971) Repetition and memory: Evidence for a multiple-trace hypothesis. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 88(3), 297-306.</ref> In brief, every item that one sees can be represented as a vector of the item's attributes, which is extended by a vector representing the context at the time of encoding, and is stored in a memory matrix of all items ever seen. When a probe item is presented, the sum of the similarities to each item in the matrix (which is inversely proportional to the sum of the distances between the probe vector and each item in the memory matrix) is computed. If the similarity is above a threshold value, one would respond, \"Yes, I recognize that item.\" Given that context continually drifts by nature of a [[random walk]], more recently seen items, which each share a similar context vector to the context vector at the time of the recognition task, are more likely to be recognized than items seen longer ago.\n\n===Cued recall===\nIn [[Recall (memory)#Cued recall|cued recall]], one is asked to recall the item that was paired with a given probe item. For example, one can be given a list of name-face pairs, and later be asked to recall the associated name given a face.\n\nCued recall can be explained by extending the attribute-similarity model used for item recognition. Because in cued recall, a wrong response can be given for a probe item, the model has to be extended accordingly to account for that. This can be achieved by adding noise to the item vectors when they are stored in the memory matrix. Furthermore, cued recall can be modeled in a probabilistic manner such that for every item stored in the memory matrix, the more similar it is to the probe item, the more likely it is to be recalled. Because the items in the memory matrix contain noise in their values, this model can account for incorrect recalls, such as mistakenly calling a person by the wrong name.\n\n===Free recall===\nIn [[free recall]], one is allowed to recall items that were learned in any order. For example, you could be asked to name as many countries in Europe as you can. Free recall can be modeled using [[Semantic memory#Search of Associative Memory .28SAM.29|SAM]] (Search of Associative Memory) which is based on the dual-store model, first proposed by [[Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model|Atkinson and Shiffrin]] in 1968.<ref>Raaijmakers, J. G. W., Schiffrin, R. M. (1981). Search of associative memory. Psychological Review, 8(2), 98-134</ref> SAM consists of two main components: [[Short-term memory|short-term store]] (STS) and [[Long-term memory|long-term store]] (LTS). In brief, when an item is seen, it is pushed into STS where it resides with other items also in STS, until it displaced and put into LTS. The longer the item has been in STS, the more likely it is to be displaced by a new item. When items co-reside in STS, the links between those items are strengthened. Furthermore, SAM assumes that items in STS are always available for immediate recall.\n\nSAM explains both primacy and recency effects. Probabilistically, items at the beginning of the list are more likely to remain in STS, and thus have more opportunities to strengthen their links to other items. As a result, items at the beginning of the list are made more likely to be recalled in a free-recall task (primacy effect). Because of the assumption that items in STS are always available for immediate recall, given that there were no significant distractors between learning and recall, items at the end of the list can be recalled excellently (recency effect).\n\nIncidentally, the idea of STS and LTS was motivated by the architecture of computers, which contain short-term and long-term storage.\n\n===Sequence memory===\n[[Recall (memory)#Serial recall|Sequence memory]] is responsible for how we remember lists of things, in which ordering matters. For example, telephone numbers are an ordered list of one digit numbers. There are currently two main computational memory models that can be applied to sequence encoding: associative chaining and positional coding.\n\nAssociative chaining theory states that every item in a list is linked to its forward and backward neighbors, with forward links being stronger than backward links, and links to closer neighbors being stronger than links to farther neighbors. For example, associative chaining predicts the tendencies of transposition errors, which occur most often with items in nearby positions. An example of a transposition error would be recalling the sequence \"apple, orange, banana\" instead of \"apple, banana, orange.\"\n\nPositional coding theory suggests that every item in a list is associated to its position in the list. For example, if the list is \"apple, banana, orange, mango\" apple will be associated to list position 1, banana to 2, orange to 3, and mango to 4. Furthermore, each item is also, albeit more weakly, associated to its index +/- 1, even more weakly to +/- 2, and so forth. So banana is associated not only to its actual index 2, but also to 1, 3, and 4, with varying degrees of strength. For example, positional coding can be used to explain the effects of recency and primacy. Because items at the beginning and end of a list have fewer close neighbors compared to items in the middle of the list, they have less competition for correct recall.\n\nAlthough the models of associative chaining and positional coding are able to explain a great amount of behavior seen for sequence memory, they are far from perfect. For example, neither chaining nor positional coding is able to properly illustrate the details of the [[Ranschburg effect]], which reports that sequences of items that contain repeated items are harder to reproduce than sequences of unrepeated items. Associative chaining predicts that recall of lists containing repeated items is impaired because recall of any repeated item would cue not only its true successor but also the successors of all other instances of the item. However, experimental data have shown that spaced repetition of items resulted in impaired recall of the second occurrence of the repeated item.<ref>Crowder, R. G. (1968). Intraserial repetition effects in immediate memory.\nJournal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 7, 446-451.</ref> Furthermore, it had no measurable effect on the recall of the items that followed the repeated items, contradicting the prediction of associative chaining. Positional coding predicts that repeated items will have no effect on recall, since the positions for each item in the list act as independent cues for the items, including the repeated items. That is, there is no difference between the similarity between any two items and repeated items. This, again, is not consistent with the data.\n\nBecause no comprehensive model has been defined for sequence memory to this day, it makes for an interesting area of research.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ebbinghaus2.jpg|thumb|alt=Hermann Ebbinghaus|Hermann Ebbinghaus]]\nEncoding is still relatively new and unexplored but origins of encoding date back to age old philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. A major figure in the history of encoding is [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20131909). Ebbinghaus was a pioneer in the field of memory research. Using himself as a subject he studied how we learn and forget information by repeating a list of [[nonsense syllable]]s to the rhythm of a metronome until they were committed to his memory.<ref name=\"ebbingbook\">Ebbinghaus, H. (1885). Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology.</ref> These experiments lead him to suggest the [[learning curve]].<ref name=\"ebbingbook\"/> He used these relatively meaningless words so that prior associations between meaningful words would not influence learning. He found that lists that allowed associations to be made and semantic meaning was apparent were easier to recall. Ebbinghaus' results paved the way for experimental psychology in memory and other mental processes.\n\nDuring the 1900s further progress in memory research was made. [[Ivan Pavlov]] began research pertaining to [[classical conditioning]]. His research demonstrated the ability to create a semantic relationship between two unrelated items.\nIn 1932 Bartlett proposed the idea of mental [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s. This model proposed that whether new information would be encoded was dependent on its consistency with prior knowledge (mental schemas).<ref name=\" bartlett32\">Bartlett, F. C. (1932). Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.</ref> This model also suggested that information not present at the time of encoding would be added to memory if it was based on schematic knowledge of the world.<ref name=\" bartlett32\"/> In this way, encoding was found to be influenced by prior knowledge. \nWith the advance of [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]] came the realisation that memory for encoded information was often perceived as different from the stimuli that triggered it. It was also influenced by the context that the stimuli were embedded in.\n\nWith advances in technology, the field of neuropsychology emerged and with it a biological basis for theories of encoding. In 1949 [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebb]] looked at the neuroscience aspect of encoding and stated that \"neurons that fire together wire together\" implying that encoding occurred as connections between neurons were established through repeated use. \nThe 1950s and 60's saw a shift to the information processing approach to memory based on the invention of computers, followed by the initial suggestion that encoding was the process by which information is entered into memory. [[George Armitage Miller]] in 1956 wrote his paper on how short-term memory is limited to seven items, plus-or-minus two, called [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]. This number was appended when studies done on [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]] revealed that seven, plus or minus two could also refer to seven \"packets of information\". \nIn 1974, [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] proposed their [[Baddeley's model of working memory|model of working memory]], which consists of the central executive, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and phonological loop as a method of encoding. In 2000, Baddeley added the episodic buffer.<ref name=\"text\"/> Simultaneously [[Endel Tulving]] (1983) proposed the idea of encoding specificity whereby context was again noted as an influence on encoding.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{memory}}\n{{Mental processes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encoding (Memory)}}\n[[Category:Memory processes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n[[Memory]] has the ability to '''encode''', [[Storage (memory)|store]] and [[Recall (memory)|recall]] information.

This suggests the decrease in activation with repetition is process specific occurring when words are semantically reprocessed but not when they are nonsemantically reprocessed.<ref name=\"Demb\" /> Lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] is responsible for initial encoding and that activity in the left lateral prefrontal cortex correlates with the semantic organization of encoded information.<ref name=\"Frey, Stephen, and Michael Petrides. 2002\">Frey, S., & Petrides, M.

Hence the memory of the beginning of a new word is stored in our echoic memory until the whole sound has been perceived and recognized as a word.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson and Heth(2010)|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour 4e|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Chapter 8|page=233}}</ref> \nStudies indicate that lexical, semantic and phonological factors interact in verbal working memory.

All perceived and striking sensations travel to the brain's thalamus where all these sensations are combined into one single experience.<ref name=\"mohs\">Mohs, Richard C. \"How Human Memory Works.\"  8 May 2007.  HowStuffWorks.com. <http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-memory.htm>  23 February 2010.</ref> The hippocampus is responsible for analyzing these inputs and ultimately deciding if they will be committed to long-term memory; these various threads of information are stored in various parts of the brain. However, the exact way in which these pieces are identified and recalled later remains unknown.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\nEncoding is achieved using a combination of chemicals and electricity. Neurotransmitters are released when an electrical pulse crosses the synapse which serves as a connection from nerve cells to other cells. The dendrites receive these impulses with their feathery extensions. A phenomenon called [[long-term potentiation]] allows a synapse to increase strength with increasing numbers of transmitted signals between the two neurons. For that to happen, [[NMDA receptor]], which influences the flow of information between neurons by controlling the initiation of long-term potentiation in most hippocampal pathways, need to come to the play. For these NMDA receptors to be activated, there must be two conditions. Firstly, [[glutamate]] has to be released and bound to the NMDA receptor site on postsynaptic neurons. Secondly, excitation has to take place in postsynaptic neurons.<ref>Schacter, D., Gilbert, D. & Wegner, D.(2011) ''Psychology'', 2nd edition, Chapter 6: Memory, p.232</ref> These cells also organise themselves into groups specializing in different kinds of information processing. Thus, with new experiences the brain creates more connections and may 'rewire'. The brain organizes and reorganizes itself in response to one's experiences, creating new memories prompted by experience, education, or training.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> Therefore, the use of a brain reflects how it is organised.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> This ability to re-organize is especially important if ever a part of the brain becomes damaged.  Scientists are unsure of whether the stimuli of what we do not recall are filtered out at the sensory phase or if they are filtered out after the brain examines their significance.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\n===Mapping activity===\n[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) demonstrates a consistent functional anatomical blueprint of hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval. Activation in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding has been shown to occur in the rostral portion of the region whereas activation associated with episodic memory retrieval occurs in the caudal portions.<ref name=\"Lepage\">Lepage, M., Habib, R. & Tulving.

Encoding begins with any novel situation, as the [[brain]] will interact and draw conclusions from the results of this interaction. These learning experiences have been known to trigger a cascade of molecular events leading to the formation of memories.<ref name=\"wagner\">Wagner, M. (2008).

However, encoding can occur on different levels. The first step is [[short-term memory]] formation, followed by the conversion to a [[long-term memory]], and then a long-term memory consolidation process.<ref name=\"kandel\">Kandel, E. (2004). The Molecular Biology of Memory Storage: A Dialog Between Genes and Synapses. Bioscience Reports, 24, 4-5.</ref>\n\n===Synaptic plasticity===\n[[Synaptic plasticity]] is the ability of the [[brain]] to strengthen, weaken, destroy and create neural synapses and is the basis for learning. These molecular distinctions will identify and indicate the strength of each neural connection. The effect of a learning experience depends on the content of such an experience. Reactions that are favoured will be reinforced and those that are deemed unfavourable will be weakened. This shows that the synaptic modifications that occur can operate either way, in order to be able to make changes over time depending on the current situation of the organism. In the short term, synaptic changes may include the strengthening or weakening of a connection by modifying the preexisting proteins leading to a modification in synapse connection strength. In the long term, entirely new connections may form or the number of synapses at a connection may be increased, or reduced.<ref name=\"kandel\"/>\n\n===The encoding process===\nA significant short-term biochemical change is the covalent modification of pre-existing proteins in order to modify synaptic connections that are already active. This allows data to be conveyed in the short term, without consolidating anything for permanent storage. From here a memory or an association may be chosen to become a long-term memory, or forgotten as the synaptic connections eventually weaken. The switch from short to long-term is the same concerning both [[implicit memory]] and [[explicit memory]]. This process is regulated by a number of inhibitory constraints, primarily the balance between protein [[phosphorylation]] and [[dephosphorylation]].<ref name=\"kandel\"/> Finally, long term changes occur that allow consolidation of the target memory. These changes include new protein synthesis, the formation of new synaptic connections and finally the activation of [[gene expression]] in accordance with the new neural configuration.<ref>Sacktor, T.C. (2008). PKMz, LTP Maintenance, and the dynamic molecular biology of memory storage. Progress in Brain Research, 169, Ch 2.</ref> \nThe encoding process has been found to be partially mediated by serotonergic interneurons, specifically in regard to sensitization as blocking these interneurons prevented sensitization entirely. However, the ultimate consequences of these discoveries have yet to be identified. \nFurthermore, the learning process has been known to recruit a variety of modulatory transmitters in order to create and consolidate memories. These transmitters cause the nucleus to initiate processes required for neuronal growth and long term memory, mark specific synapses for the capture of long-term processes, regulate local protein synthesis and even appear to mediate attentional processes required for the formation and recall of memories.\n\n===Encoding and genetics===\nHuman memory, including the process of encoding, is known to be a [[heritable trait]] that is controlled by more than one gene. In fact, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for as much as 50% of the variance seen in memory tasks.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\nProteins identified in animal studies have been linked directly to a molecular cascade of reactions leading to memory formation, and a sizeable number of these proteins are encoded by genes that are expressed in humans as well. In fact, variations within these genes appear to be associated with memory capacity and have been identified in recent human genetic studies.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\n\n==Complementary processes==\nThe idea that the brain is separated into two complementary processing networks ([[default network|task positive]] and [[default network|task negative]]) has recently become an area of increasing interest.{{Vague|date=August 2010}} The task positive network deals with externally oriented processing whereas the task negative network deals with internally oriented processing. Research indicates that these networks are not exclusive and some tasks overlap in their activation. A study done in 2009 shows encoding success and novelty detection activity within the task-positive network have significant overlap and have thus been concluded to reflect common association of externally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\">Cabeza, R., Daselaar, S.M., &  Hongkeun, K. (2009). Overlapping brain activity between episodic memory encoding and retrieval: Roles of the task-positive and task-negative networks. Neuroimage;49: 1145\u20131154.</ref> It also demonstrates how encoding failure and retrieval success share significant overlap within the task negative network indicating common association of internally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> Finally, a low level of overlap between encoding success and retrieval success activity and between encoding failure and novelty detection activity respectively indicate opposing modes or processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> In sum task positive and task negative networks can have common associations during the performance of different tasks.\n\n==Depth of processing==\nDifferent levels of processing influence how well information is remembered. These levels of processing can be illustrated by maintenance and elaborate rehearsal.\n\n===Maintenance and elaborative rehearsal===\n''Maintenance rehearsal'' is a shallow form of processing information which involves focusing on an object without thought to its meaning or its association with other objects. For example, the repetition of a series of numbers is a form of maintenance rehearsal. In contrast, ''elaborative or relational rehearsal'' is a process in which you relate new material to information already stored in Long-term memory. It's a deep form of processing information and involves thought of the object's meaning as well as making connections between the object, past experiences and the other objects of focus. Using the example of numbers, one might associate them with dates that are personally significant such as your parents' birthdays (past experiences) or perhaps you might see a pattern in the numbers that helps you to remember them.<ref name=\"1973 craik\">Craik, F. I. M., & Watkins, M. J. (1973). The role of rehearsal in short-term memory. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior'', '''12''' (6), 599\u2013607.</ref>\n[[File:US penny 2003.jpg|thumb|alt=|American Penny]]\nDue to the deeper level of processing that occurs with elaborative rehearsal it is more effective than maintenance rehearsal in creating new memories.<ref name=\" 1973 craik\"/> This has been demonstrated in people's lack of knowledge of the details in everyday objects. For example, in one study where Americans were asked about the orientation of the face on their country's penny few recalled this with any degree of certainty. Despite the fact that it is a detail that is often seen, it is not remembered as there is no need to because the color discriminates the penny from other coins.<ref>Nickerson, R. S. (., & Adams, M. J. (1979). Long-term memory for a common object. Cognitive Psychology, 11(3, pp. 287-307)</ref> The ineffectiveness of maintenance rehearsal, simply being repeatedly exposed to an item, in creating memories has also been found in people's  lack of memory for the layout of the digits 0-9 on calculators and telephones.<ref>Rinck, M. (1999). Memory for everyday objects: Where are the digits on numerical keypads? Applied Cognitive Psychology, 13(4), 329-350.</ref>\n\nMaintenance rehearsal has been demonstrated to be important in learning but its effects can only be demonstrated using indirect methods such as [[lexical decision task]]s,<ref>Oliphant, G. W. (1983). Repetition and recency effects in word recognition. Australian Journal of Psychology, 35(3), 393-403</ref> and word stem completion<ref>Graf, P., Mandler, G., & Haden, P. E. (1982). Simulating amnesic symptoms in normal subjects. Science, 218(4578), 1243\u20131244.</ref> which are used to assess implicit learning. In general, however previous learning by maintenance rehearsal is not apparent when memory is being tested directly or explicitly with questions like \" Is this the word you were shown earlier?\"\n\n===Intention to learn===\n\nStudies have shown that the intention to learn has no direct effect on memory encoding. Instead, memory encoding is dependent on how deeply each item is encoded, which could be affected by intention to learn, but not exclusively. That is, intention to learn can lead to more effective learning strategies, and consequently, better memory encoding, but if you learn something incidentally (i.e. without intention to learn) but still process and learn the information effectively, it will get encoded just as well as something learnt with intention.<ref>Hyde, Thomas S.  & Jenkins, James J. (1973). Recall for words as a function of semantic, graphic, and syntactic orienting tasks. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 12(5), 471-480</ref>\n\nThe effects of elaborative rehearsal or deep processing can be attributed to the number of connections made while encoding that increase the number of pathways available for retrieval.<ref>Craik, F. I., & Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104(3), 268-294.</ref>\n\n==Optimal encoding==\n\n=== Organization ===\nOrganization can be seen as a key to better memory. The section about depth of processing demonstrated the significant effect that levels of processing has on encoding. Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref> Levels of processing are also related to the organization of information. For example, the connections that are made between the to-be-remembered item, other to-be-remembered items, previous experiences and context generate retrieval paths for the to-be-remembered item. These connections impose organization on the to-be-remembered item, making it more memorable.<ref>Katona, G. (1940). Organizing and memorizing. New York, NY, US: Columbia University Press.</ref> Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref name=\":3\" /> One natural way information can be organized is through hierarchies.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, the grouping mammals, reptiles, and amphibians is a hierarchy of the animal kingdom. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref>\n\n===Mnemonics===\n{{main|Mnemonics}}\n[[File:Rainbow-diagram-ROYGBIV.svg|thumb|alt= Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet|The mnemonic \"Roy G. Biv\" can be used to remember the colors of the rainbow]]\n\nFor simple material such as lists of words, mnemonics are the best strategy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Mnemonic Strategies are an example of how finding organization within a set of items helps these items to be remembered. In the absence of any apparent organization within  a group organization can be imposed with the same memory enhancing results. An example of a mnemonic strategy that imposes organization is the ''[[Mnemonic peg system|peg-word system]]'' which associates the to-be-remembered items with a list of easily remembered items. Another example of a mnemonic device commonly used is the first letter of every word system or [[acronyms]]. When learning the colours in a [[rainbow]] most students learn the first letter of every colour and impose their own meaning by associating it with a name such as Roy. G. Biv which stands for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. In this way mnemonic devices not only help the encoding of specific items but also their sequence. For more complex concepts, understanding is the key to remembering. In a study done by Wiseman and Neisser in 1974 they presented participants with a picture (the picture was of a Dalmatian in the style of [[pointillism]] making it difficult to see the image).<ref>Wiseman, S., & Neisser, U. (1974). Perceptual organization as a determinant of visual recognition memory. American Journal of Psychology, 87(4), 675-681.</ref> They found that memory for the picture was better if the participants understood what was depicted.\n\n===Chunking===\nAnother way understanding may aid memory is by reducing the amount that has to be remembered via [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Chunking is the process of organizing objects into meaningful wholes. These wholes are then remembered as a unit rather than separate objects. Words are an example of chunking, where instead of simply perceiving letters we perceive and remember their meaningful wholes: words. The use of chunking increases the number of items we are able to remember by creating meaningful \"packets\" in which many related items are stored as one.\n\n===State-dependent learning===\nFor optimal encoding, connections are not only formed between the items themselves and past experiences, but also between the internal state or mood of the encoder and the situation they are in. The connections that are formed between the encoders internal state or the situation and the items to be remembered are State-dependent. In a 1975 study by Godden and Baddeley the effects of State-dependent learning were shown. They asked deep sea divers to learn various materials while either under water or on the side of the pool. They found that those who were tested in the same condition that they had learned the information in were better able to recall that information, i.e. those who learned the material under water did better when tested on that material under water than when tested on land. Context had become associated with the material they were trying to recall and therefore was serving as a retrieval cue.<ref>Godden, D. R., & Baddeley, A. D. (1975). Context-dependent memory in two natural environments: On land and underwater. British Journal of Psychology, 66(3), 325-331.</ref> Results similar to these have also been found when certain smells are present at encoding.<ref>Cann, A., & Ross, D. A. (1989). Olfactory stimuli as context cues in human memory. American Journal of Psychology, 102(1), 91-102.</ref>\n\nHowever, although the external environment is important at the time of encoding in creating multiple pathways for retrieval, other studies have shown that simply creating the same internal state that you had at the time of encoding is sufficient to serve as a retrieval cue.<ref>Smith, S. M. (1979). Remembering in and out of context. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 5(5), 460-471.</ref> Therefore, putting yourself in the same mindset that you were in at the time of encoding will help recall in the same way that being in the same situation helps recall. This effect called context reinstatement was demonstrated by Fisher and Craik 1977 when they matched retrieval cues with the way information was memorized.<ref>Fisher, R. P., & Craik, F. I. (1977). Interaction between encoding and retrieval operations in cued recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 3(6), 701-711.</ref>\n\n===Encoding specificity===\n[[File:Facevase.png|thumb|alt=An ambiguous figure which can be perceived as either a vase or a pair of faces. |Vase or faces?]]\n\nThe context of learning shapes how information is encoded.<ref>Tulving, E. (1983). Elements of episodic memory. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</ref> For instance,  Kanizsa in 1979 showed a picture that could be interpreted as either a white vase on a black background or 2 faces facing each other on a white background.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\">Kanizsa, G. (1979). Organization in vision. New York: Praeger.</ref> The participants were primed to see the vase. Later they were shown the picture again but this time they were primed to see the black faces on the white background. Although this was the same picture as they had seen before, when asked if they had seen this picture before, they said no. The reason for this was that they had been primed to see the vase the first time the picture was presented, and  it was therefore unrecognizable the second time as two faces. This demonstrates that the stimulus is understood within the context it is learned in as well the general rule that what really constitutes good learning are tests that test what has been learned in the same way that it was learned.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\" /> Therefore, to truly be efficient at remembering information, one must consider the demands that future recall will place on this information and study in a way that will match those demands.\n\n=== Generation Effect ===\n''Main Article:'' [[Generation effect]]\n\nAnother principle that may have the potential to aid encoding is the generation effect. The generation effect implies that learning is enhanced when individuals generate information or items themselves rather than reading the content.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=Mark A|last2=Waddill|first2=Paula J|last3=Einstein|first3=Gilles O|date=1988|title=A contextual account of the generation effect: A three-factor theory|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=27|issue=5|pages=521\u2013536|doi=10.1016/0749-596x(88)90023-x|issn=0749-596X}}</ref> The key to properly apply the generation effect is to generate information, rather than from information already available like in selecting an answer from a multiple-choice question<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Peter C.|title=Make It Stick|last2=Roediger|first2=Henry L.|last3=McDaniel|first3=Mark A.|date=2014-01-31|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-41937-7|location=Cambridge, MA and London, England|doi=10.4159/9780674419377}}</ref> In 1978, researchers Slameka and Graf conducted an experiment to better understand this effect.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Goldstein, E.

Different models have been developed for different memory tasks, which include item recognition, cued recall, free recall, and sequence memory, in an attempt to accurately explain experimentally observed behaviors.\n\n===Item recognition===\nIn item recognition, one is asked whether or not a given probe item has been seen before. It is important to note that the recognition of an item can include context. That is, one can be asked whether an item has been seen in a study list. So even though one may have seen the word \"apple\" sometime during their life, if it was not on the study list, it should not be recalled.\n\nItem recognition can be modeled using [[Multiple trace theory]] and the attribute-similarity model.<ref>Hintzman, Douglas L. & Block, Richard A. (1971) Repetition and memory: Evidence for a multiple-trace hypothesis. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 88(3), 297-306.</ref> In brief, every item that one sees can be represented as a vector of the item's attributes, which is extended by a vector representing the context at the time of encoding, and is stored in a memory matrix of all items ever seen. When a probe item is presented, the sum of the similarities to each item in the matrix (which is inversely proportional to the sum of the distances between the probe vector and each item in the memory matrix) is computed. If the similarity is above a threshold value, one would respond, \"Yes, I recognize that item.\" Given that context continually drifts by nature of a [[random walk]], more recently seen items, which each share a similar context vector to the context vector at the time of the recognition task, are more likely to be recognized than items seen longer ago.\n\n===Cued recall===\nIn [[Recall (memory)#Cued recall|cued recall]], one is asked to recall the item that was paired with a given probe item. For example, one can be given a list of name-face pairs, and later be asked to recall the associated name given a face.\n\nCued recall can be explained by extending the attribute-similarity model used for item recognition. Because in cued recall, a wrong response can be given for a probe item, the model has to be extended accordingly to account for that. This can be achieved by adding noise to the item vectors when they are stored in the memory matrix. Furthermore, cued recall can be modeled in a probabilistic manner such that for every item stored in the memory matrix, the more similar it is to the probe item, the more likely it is to be recalled. Because the items in the memory matrix contain noise in their values, this model can account for incorrect recalls, such as mistakenly calling a person by the wrong name.\n\n===Free recall===\nIn [[free recall]], one is allowed to recall items that were learned in any order. For example, you could be asked to name as many countries in Europe as you can. Free recall can be modeled using [[Semantic memory#Search of Associative Memory .28SAM.29|SAM]] (Search of Associative Memory) which is based on the dual-store model, first proposed by [[Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model|Atkinson and Shiffrin]] in 1968.<ref>Raaijmakers, J. G. W., Schiffrin, R. M. (1981). Search of associative memory. Psychological Review, 8(2), 98-134</ref> SAM consists of two main components: [[Short-term memory|short-term store]] (STS) and [[Long-term memory|long-term store]] (LTS). In brief, when an item is seen, it is pushed into STS where it resides with other items also in STS, until it displaced and put into LTS. The longer the item has been in STS, the more likely it is to be displaced by a new item. When items co-reside in STS, the links between those items are strengthened. Furthermore, SAM assumes that items in STS are always available for immediate recall.\n\nSAM explains both primacy and recency effects. Probabilistically, items at the beginning of the list are more likely to remain in STS, and thus have more opportunities to strengthen their links to other items. As a result, items at the beginning of the list are made more likely to be recalled in a free-recall task (primacy effect). Because of the assumption that items in STS are always available for immediate recall, given that there were no significant distractors between learning and recall, items at the end of the list can be recalled excellently (recency effect).\n\nIncidentally, the idea of STS and LTS was motivated by the architecture of computers, which contain short-term and long-term storage.\n\n===Sequence memory===\n[[Recall (memory)#Serial recall|Sequence memory]] is responsible for how we remember lists of things, in which ordering matters. For example, telephone numbers are an ordered list of one digit numbers. There are currently two main computational memory models that can be applied to sequence encoding: associative chaining and positional coding.\n\nAssociative chaining theory states that every item in a list is linked to its forward and backward neighbors, with forward links being stronger than backward links, and links to closer neighbors being stronger than links to farther neighbors. For example, associative chaining predicts the tendencies of transposition errors, which occur most often with items in nearby positions. An example of a transposition error would be recalling the sequence \"apple, orange, banana\" instead of \"apple, banana, orange.\"\n\nPositional coding theory suggests that every item in a list is associated to its position in the list. For example, if the list is \"apple, banana, orange, mango\" apple will be associated to list position 1, banana to 2, orange to 3, and mango to 4. Furthermore, each item is also, albeit more weakly, associated to its index +/- 1, even more weakly to +/- 2, and so forth. So banana is associated not only to its actual index 2, but also to 1, 3, and 4, with varying degrees of strength. For example, positional coding can be used to explain the effects of recency and primacy. Because items at the beginning and end of a list have fewer close neighbors compared to items in the middle of the list, they have less competition for correct recall.\n\nAlthough the models of associative chaining and positional coding are able to explain a great amount of behavior seen for sequence memory, they are far from perfect. For example, neither chaining nor positional coding is able to properly illustrate the details of the [[Ranschburg effect]], which reports that sequences of items that contain repeated items are harder to reproduce than sequences of unrepeated items. Associative chaining predicts that recall of lists containing repeated items is impaired because recall of any repeated item would cue not only its true successor but also the successors of all other instances of the item. However, experimental data have shown that spaced repetition of items resulted in impaired recall of the second occurrence of the repeated item.<ref>Crowder, R. G. (1968). Intraserial repetition effects in immediate memory.\nJournal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 7, 446-451.</ref> Furthermore, it had no measurable effect on the recall of the items that followed the repeated items, contradicting the prediction of associative chaining. Positional coding predicts that repeated items will have no effect on recall, since the positions for each item in the list act as independent cues for the items, including the repeated items. That is, there is no difference between the similarity between any two items and repeated items. This, again, is not consistent with the data.\n\nBecause no comprehensive model has been defined for sequence memory to this day, it makes for an interesting area of research.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ebbinghaus2.jpg|thumb|alt=Hermann Ebbinghaus|Hermann Ebbinghaus]]\nEncoding is still relatively new and unexplored but origins of encoding date back to age old philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. A major figure in the history of encoding is [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20131909). Ebbinghaus was a pioneer in the field of memory research. Using himself as a subject he studied how we learn and forget information by repeating a list of [[nonsense syllable]]s to the rhythm of a metronome until they were committed to his memory.<ref name=\"ebbingbook\">Ebbinghaus, H. (1885). Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology.</ref> These experiments lead him to suggest the [[learning curve]].<ref name=\"ebbingbook\"/> He used these relatively meaningless words so that prior associations between meaningful words would not influence learning. He found that lists that allowed associations to be made and semantic meaning was apparent were easier to recall. Ebbinghaus' results paved the way for experimental psychology in memory and other mental processes.\n\nDuring the 1900s further progress in memory research was made. [[Ivan Pavlov]] began research pertaining to [[classical conditioning]]. His research demonstrated the ability to create a semantic relationship between two unrelated items.\nIn 1932 Bartlett proposed the idea of mental [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s. This model proposed that whether new information would be encoded was dependent on its consistency with prior knowledge (mental schemas).<ref name=\" bartlett32\">Bartlett, F. C. (1932). Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.</ref> This model also suggested that information not present at the time of encoding would be added to memory if it was based on schematic knowledge of the world.<ref name=\" bartlett32\"/> In this way, encoding was found to be influenced by prior knowledge. \nWith the advance of [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]] came the realisation that memory for encoded information was often perceived as different from the stimuli that triggered it. It was also influenced by the context that the stimuli were embedded in.\n\nWith advances in technology, the field of neuropsychology emerged and with it a biological basis for theories of encoding. In 1949 [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebb]] looked at the neuroscience aspect of encoding and stated that \"neurons that fire together wire together\" implying that encoding occurred as connections between neurons were established through repeated use. \nThe 1950s and 60's saw a shift to the information processing approach to memory based on the invention of computers, followed by the initial suggestion that encoding was the process by which information is entered into memory. [[George Armitage Miller]] in 1956 wrote his paper on how short-term memory is limited to seven items, plus-or-minus two, called [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]. This number was appended when studies done on [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]] revealed that seven, plus or minus two could also refer to seven \"packets of information\". \nIn 1974, [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] proposed their [[Baddeley's model of working memory|model of working memory]], which consists of the central executive, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and phonological loop as a method of encoding. In 2000, Baddeley added the episodic buffer.<ref name=\"text\"/> Simultaneously [[Endel Tulving]] (1983) proposed the idea of encoding specificity whereby context was again noted as an influence on encoding.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{memory}}\n{{Mental processes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encoding (Memory)}}\n[[Category:Memory processes]]\n", "name_user": "HadleyJoAnn", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar corrections", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_(memory)"}

These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.<ref>Hastings, p. 240.</ref> In this letter, he asked for a \"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the [[Great Seal of the United States]], and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \"great Naval Flag of the United States\" in the first bill; the \"Naval Flag of the United States\" in the second bill; and \"the Naval Flag of the States\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones.

[[Charles Thomson]], Secretary of the Continental Congress, discussing the proposed [[U.S. Seal]], gave symbolic meanings for the colors in the seal, drawn from heraldry, with white signifying purity and innocence; red, hardiness and valor; and blue signifying vigilance, perseverance and justice. Over time, that explanation came to be associated with the flag.\n\nOver the years, other interpretations have included that red is for the blood of patriots, spilled in the fight to protect the country. In 1986, president [[Ronald Reagan]] gave his own interpretation, saying, \"The colors of our flag signify the qualities of the human spirit we Americans cherish.

Eisenhower]]. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.<ref>These designs are in the [[Eisenhower Presidential Center|Eisenhower Presidential Archives]] in [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], Kansas. Only a small fraction of them have ever been published.</ref> At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] for the design.\n\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a B\u2013 for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/flagdesigner.html| title=Robert G.

Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in [[parade]]s or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag. Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed flag for parade, [[Colour guard|color guard]] and indoor display, while the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard use a fringeless flag for all occasions.\n\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the [[United States Army|Army]] used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \"...&nbsp;is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy&nbsp;...\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of [[Title 4 of the United States Code]] law books. This opinion is a source for claims that a flag with fringe is a military ensign rather than civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm| title=Fringe on the American Flag| accessdate = June 27, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911213421/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 11, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals associated with the [[sovereign citizen movement]] and [[tax protester conspiracy arguments]] have claimed, based on the military usage, that the presence of a fringed flag in a civilian courtroom changes the nature or jurisdiction of the court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/30/sovereign-citizens-are-a-sometimes-violent-fringe-group-rejecting-all-government|title=Sovereign Citizens Are a Sometimes Violent Fringe Group Rejecting All Government|last=Ross|first=Winston|date=2012-12-30|access-date=2019-07-08|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">[http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#flagfringes Rebuttal of \"martial law flag\" claims by tax protesters].

Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like [[Memorial Day]], [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]], [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]], [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]], and on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]]. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\n\n===Flag etiquette===\n{{Main|United States Flag Code}}\n[[File:Vertical United States Flag.svg|thumb|left|upright|The proper stationary vertical display. The union (blue box of stars) should always be in the upper-left corner.]]\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be [[Flag dipping|dipped]] to any person or thing, unless it is the [[ensign]] responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain [[Martin Sheridan]] is famously quoted as saying \"this flag dips to no earthly king\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv7n3/JOHv7n3i.pdf LA84 Foundation].

If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The [[Boy Scouts of America]] recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boyslife.org/about-scouts/scouting-around/16380/consider-recycling-not-burning-a-retired-flag/ |title=Consider Recycling, not Burning, a Retired Flag |publisher=[[Boy Scouts of America]] |year=2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref> [[File:LDS Boy Scouts retireing an American Flag at a scout campout.JPG|thumb|250px|Boy Scouts retiring an American flag at a scout campout]]\n\nThe [[United States Flag Code|Flag Code]] prohibits using the flag \"for any advertising purpose\" and also states that the flag \"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\".<ref>4 U.S.Code Sec. 8(i).</ref> Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\n\nSection 8, entitled \"Respect For Flag\" states in part: \"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\", and \"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\". Section 3 of the Flag Code<ref>4 U.S.Code Chapter 1&nbsp;Sec. 3.</ref> defines \"the flag\" as anything \"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\".\n\nAn additional part of Section 8 \"Respect For Flag\" that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\"<ref name=\"What does it mean to disrespect the U.S. Flag?\">{{cite web |url=https://www.brandingthenations.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-disrespect-the-us-flag |title=What Does It Mean To Disrespect The U.S. Flag |last1=Green |first1=Michael |date=June 13, 2019 |website=brandingthenations.com |accessdate=February 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforced\u2014indeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]].<ref>''[[Texas v.

Eichman]]'', 496 U.S. 310 (1990).</ref> Passage of the proposed [[Flag Desecration Amendment]] would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\n\n===Display on vehicles===\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag [[decal]]s on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\n\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module]], [[Apollo Lunar Module]], and the [[Space Shuttle]]. The flag also appeared on the [[S-IC]] first stage of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \"streaming\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\n\n===Display on uniforms===\n[[File:Apollo1-Crew 01.jpg|thumb|The crew of [[Apollo 1]] wore their flags on the right shoulder, unlike all other U.S. astronaut flight crews.]]\n[[File:Neil Armstrong pose.jpg|thumb|right|Flag of the United States on American astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]]'s space suit]]\n[[File:VAB aerial 1977.jpg|thumb|right|The NASA [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] in 1977.

This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.<ref>[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/f/faqflag.htm About.com].

In this case, the canton was on the left.\n\n===Postage stamps===\n[[File:US Flags green.jpg|thumb|475|Flags depicted on U.S. postage stamp issues]]\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the [[Battle of White Plains#Aftermath|Battle of White Plains]] Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General [[Casimir Pulaski]] issue of 1931, though in a [[:File:General Pulaski 1931 Issue-2c.jpg|small monochrome depiction]]. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, [[Scott catalog]] number 1094.<ref>Scott's Specialized Catalogue of United States Postage Stamps.</ref> Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\n\n===Display in museums===\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel [[George Armistead]] (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the [[National Museum of American History]] determined that the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the [[National Museum of American History]] on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/ |title=The Star-Spangled Banner Online Exhibition |publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Places of continuous display===\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\n* Replicas of the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] (15 stars, 15 stripes) are flown at two sites in [[Baltimore]], Maryland: [[Fort McHenry|Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine]]<ref>[[s:Proclamation 2795|Presidential Proclamation No. 2795]], July 2, 1948 [https://archive.is/20120707025814/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?view=image;size=100;id=mdp.39015073075999;page=root;seq=224;num=212  Code of Federal Regulations of the United States, Title 3 Compilation (1943\u20131948)], HathiTrust, Google Books/University of Michigan scan, pages 212\u2013213.</ref> and [[Flag House Square]].<ref>Public Law 83-319, approved March 26, 1954.</ref>\n* [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] ([[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]), [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 3418, June 12, 1961.</ref>\n* The [[Lexington Battle Green|Battle Green]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], site of the first shots fired in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]]<ref>Public Law 89-335, approved November 8, 1965.</ref>\n* The [[White House]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4000, September 4, 1970.</ref>\n* Fifty U.S. flags are displayed continuously at the [[Washington Monument]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4064, July 6, 1971, effective July 4, 1971.</ref>\n[[File:US Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Monument) near Washington DC.jpg|thumb|[[Marine Corps War Memorial]], Arlington, Virginia]]\n* At [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Ports of Entry that are continuously open.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4131, May 5, 1972.</ref>\n* A Civil War era flag (for the year 1863) flies above [[Pennsylvania Hall (Gettysburg)|Pennsylvania Hall]] (Old Dorm) at [[Gettysburg College]].<ref>[http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/news_detail.dot?inode=2746067&pageTitle=34-star+flag+flies+over+Gettysburg+College+without+Congressional+approval Gettysburg College \u2013 News Detail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617041330/http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/news_detail.dot?inode=2746067&pageTitle=34-star+flag+flies+over+Gettysburg+College+without+Congressional+approval |date=June 17, 2010 }}.

Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\n\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/4/7(f).html US Code, Title 4, Chapter 1, \u00a77].</ref>\n\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\n* May 15: [[Peace Officers Memorial Day]] (unless it is the third Saturday in May, [[Armed Forces Day]], then full-staff)<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+36USC136 36 U.S.C.

To properly fold the flag:\n\n# Begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground.\n# Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.\n# Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.\n# Make a rectangular fold then a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open top edge of the flag, starting the fold from the left side over to the right.\n# Turn the outer end point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle.\n# The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner (usually thirteen triangular folds, as shown at right). On the final fold, any remnant that does not neatly fold into a triangle (or in the case of exactly even folds, the last triangle) is tucked into the previous fold.\n# When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible.\n\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mortuary.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100317-022.pdf |title=Flag Folding Ceremony Air Force Script |accessdate=2012-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217183234/http://www.mortuary.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100317-022.pdf |archivedate=February 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legion.org/flag/folding |title=Flag-Folding Procedures &#124; The American Legion |publisher=Legion.org |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Use in funerals==\n[[File:Flag funeral.jpg|thumb|A flag prepared for presentation to the next of kin]]\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in [[military funeral]]s,<ref name=\"ANC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/ceremonies/military_funerals.html |title=Sequence of Events for an Army Honors Funeral At Arlington National Cemetery |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]] |accessdate=February 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125050451/http://arlingtoncemetery.org/ceremonies/military_funerals.html |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}</ref> and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents).

These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.<ref>Hastings, p. 240.</ref> In this letter, he asked for a \"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the [[Great Seal of the United States]], and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \"great Naval Flag of the United States\" in the first bill; the \"Naval Flag of the United States\" in the second bill; and \"the Naval Flag of the States\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea.

[[Charles Thomson]], Secretary of the Continental Congress, discussing the proposed [[U.S. Seal]], gave symbolic meanings for the colors in the seal, drawn from heraldry, with white signifying purity and innocence; red, hardiness and valor; and blue signifying vigilance, perseverance and justice. Over time, that explanation came to be associated with the flag.\n\nOver the years, other interpretations have included that red is for the blood of patriots, spilled in the fight to protect the country. In 1986, president [[Ronald Reagan]] gave his own interpretation, saying, \"The colors of our flag signify the qualities of the human spirit we Americans cherish. Red for courage and readiness to sacrifice; white for pure intentions and high ideals; and blue for vigilance and justice.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/04/why-the-u-s-flag-is-red-white-and-blue/|title=Why the U.S. Flag is Red, White and Blue|first=Nicole|last=Greenstein|via=time.com}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Specifications===\n[[File:Flag of the United States specification.svg|450px|Diagram of the flag's design]]\n\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by {{usc|4|1}}; {{usc|4|2}} outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states, with no distinction made for the shape, size, or arrangement of the stars.

The practice of using [[colorfulness|more saturated]] colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\"<ref>Helen Taylor, Lucille Knoche, and Walter Granville, eds. (1950), ''[[Descriptive Color Names Dictionary]]''. Container Corporation of America.</ref>\n\nSometimes, [[Pantone Matching System]] (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the [[U.S. Embassy, London|U.S. embassy in London]] as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in [[Stockholm]] claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]] preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a [[California Military Department]] document in 2002.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021016055710/http://www.usembassy.org.uk/rcflags.html In 1998, \"U.S. Flag Facts\"] at the website of the U.S. embassy in London listed the colors red PMS 193 and blue PMS 282 (presumably PMS solid coated colors).

Eisenhower]]. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.<ref>These designs are in the [[Eisenhower Presidential Center|Eisenhower Presidential Archives]] in [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], Kansas.

Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in [[parade]]s or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag. Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed flag for parade, [[Colour guard|color guard]] and indoor display, while the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard use a fringeless flag for all occasions.\n\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the [[United States Army|Army]] used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \"...&nbsp;is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy&nbsp;...\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of [[Title 4 of the United States Code]] law books. This opinion is a source for claims that a flag with fringe is a military ensign rather than civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm| title=Fringe on the American Flag| accessdate = June 27, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911213421/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 11, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals associated with the [[sovereign citizen movement]] and [[tax protester conspiracy arguments]] have claimed, based on the military usage, that the presence of a fringed flag in a civilian courtroom changes the nature or jurisdiction of the court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/30/sovereign-citizens-are-a-sometimes-violent-fringe-group-rejecting-all-government|title=Sovereign Citizens Are a Sometimes Violent Fringe Group Rejecting All Government|last=Ross|first=Winston|date=2012-12-30|access-date=2019-07-08|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">[http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#flagfringes Rebuttal of \"martial law flag\" claims by tax protesters].

Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like [[Memorial Day]], [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]], [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]], [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]], and on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]].

For example, the flag should never be [[Flag dipping|dipped]] to any person or thing, unless it is the [[ensign]] responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain [[Martin Sheridan]] is famously quoted as saying \"this flag dips to no earthly king\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv7n3/JOHv7n3i.pdf LA84 Foundation].

If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The [[Boy Scouts of America]] recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boyslife.org/about-scouts/scouting-around/16380/consider-recycling-not-burning-a-retired-flag/ |title=Consider Recycling, not Burning, a Retired Flag |publisher=[[Boy Scouts of America]] |year=2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref> [[File:LDS Boy Scouts retireing an American Flag at a scout campout.JPG|thumb|250px|Boy Scouts retiring an American flag at a scout campout]]\n\nThe [[United States Flag Code|Flag Code]] prohibits using the flag \"for any advertising purpose\" and also states that the flag \"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\".<ref>4 U.S.Code Sec. 8(i).</ref> Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\n\nSection 8, entitled \"Respect For Flag\" states in part: \"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\", and \"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\".

Therefore, U.S. flag [[decal]]s on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\n\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module]], [[Apollo Lunar Module]], and the [[Space Shuttle]]. The flag also appeared on the [[S-IC]] first stage of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \"streaming\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\n\n===Display on uniforms===\n[[File:Apollo1-Crew 01.jpg|thumb|The crew of [[Apollo 1]] wore their flags on the right shoulder, unlike all other U.S. astronaut flight crews.]]\n[[File:Neil Armstrong pose.jpg|thumb|right|Flag of the United States on American astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]]'s space suit]]\n[[File:VAB aerial 1977.jpg|thumb|right|The NASA [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] in 1977.

The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, [[Scott catalog]] number 1094.<ref>Scott's Specialized Catalogue of United States Postage Stamps.</ref> Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\n\n===Display in museums===\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel [[George Armistead]] (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the [[National Museum of American History]] determined that the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the [[National Museum of American History]] on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/ |title=The Star-Spangled Banner Online Exhibition |publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Places of continuous display===\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\n* Replicas of the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] (15 stars, 15 stripes) are flown at two sites in [[Baltimore]], Maryland: [[Fort McHenry|Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine]]<ref>[[s:Proclamation 2795|Presidential Proclamation No. 2795]], July 2, 1948 [https://archive.is/20120707025814/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?view=image;size=100;id=mdp.39015073075999;page=root;seq=224;num=212  Code of Federal Regulations of the United States, Title 3 Compilation (1943\u20131948)], HathiTrust, Google Books/University of Michigan scan, pages 212\u2013213.</ref> and [[Flag House Square]].<ref>Public Law 83-319, approved March 26, 1954.</ref>\n* [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] ([[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]), [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 3418, June 12, 1961.</ref>\n* The [[Lexington Battle Green|Battle Green]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], site of the first shots fired in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]]<ref>Public Law 89-335, approved November 8, 1965.</ref>\n* The [[White House]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4000, September 4, 1970.</ref>\n* Fifty U.S. flags are displayed continuously at the [[Washington Monument]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4064, July 6, 1971, effective July 4, 1971.</ref>\n[[File:US Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Monument) near Washington DC.jpg|thumb|[[Marine Corps War Memorial]], Arlington, Virginia]]\n* At [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Ports of Entry that are continuously open.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4131, May 5, 1972.</ref>\n* A Civil War era flag (for the year 1863) flies above [[Pennsylvania Hall (Gettysburg)|Pennsylvania Hall]] (Old Dorm) at [[Gettysburg College]].<ref>[http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/news_detail.dot?inode=2746067&pageTitle=34-star+flag+flies+over+Gettysburg+College+without+Congressional+approval Gettysburg College \u2013 News Detail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617041330/http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/news_detail.dot?inode=2746067&pageTitle=34-star+flag+flies+over+Gettysburg+College+without+Congressional+approval |date=June 17, 2010 }}.

Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\n\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff.

To properly fold the flag:\n\n# Begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground.\n# Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.\n# Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.\n# Make a rectangular fold then a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open top edge of the flag, starting the fold from the left side over to the right.\n# Turn the outer end point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle.\n# The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner (usually thirteen triangular folds, as shown at right). On the final fold, any remnant that does not neatly fold into a triangle (or in the case of exactly even folds, the last triangle) is tucked into the previous fold.\n# When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible.\n\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mortuary.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100317-022.pdf |title=Flag Folding Ceremony Air Force Script |accessdate=2012-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217183234/http://www.mortuary.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100317-022.pdf |archivedate=February 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legion.org/flag/folding |title=Flag-Folding Procedures &#124; The American Legion |publisher=Legion.org |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Use in funerals==\n[[File:Flag funeral.jpg|thumb|A flag prepared for presentation to the next of kin]]\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in [[military funeral]]s,<ref name=\"ANC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/ceremonies/military_funerals.html |title=Sequence of Events for an Army Honors Funeral At Arlington National Cemetery |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]] |accessdate=February 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125050451/http://arlingtoncemetery.org/ceremonies/military_funerals.html |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}</ref> and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents).

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution (see [[#Abolitionism in France|Abolitionism in France]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of prostitution in France}}\n[[File:Paris 1er arr jms.gif|thumb|Paris arrondissements, 1st highlighted, the 2nd and 3rd to the N. & 4th to the E]]\n[[File:\u00c9tienne Jeaurat 001.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9tienne Jeaurat]] (1699\u20131789). \"Filles de joie\" being taken to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re 1745.

Prostitutes were not marginalized, but integrated into society where they had a role to play. In stories (which were often ribald), prostitutes would be complicit with other women in avenging men.

This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes. Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the [[Breviary of Alaric|Code Alaric]].

The decree ordered the expulsion of all \"women of evil life\" from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings, but simply drove the trade underground. Eventually he was forced to revoke this by 1256. Although still railing against women who were \"free with their bodies and other common harlots\", he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments, and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls. <!--This is not true: Hence brothels came to be known as \"bordels\" (or \"bordes\", or \"bordeau\"), and the inhabitants as \"filles bordeli\u00e8res\".

Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young, as well as the married men who were missing their wives. As the war advanced, so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained. While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes, dominion soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada received six shillings and could afford higher-class \"services\". British officers preferred to ''\"always indulge with armour (condoms)\"'' and took to patronizing German Army officers' former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war, with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions, but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war.<ref name=HCNSPlse/> In 1915, in [[Le Havre]], a survey undertaken by the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] counted 171,000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street. As a result, rates of [[venereal disease]] began to climb, with 23,000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment,<ref name=HCNSPlse/> with over 150,000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The disease at the time had a high social stigma, but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty, even on a temporary basis. [[Syphilis]] was treated with injections of mercury, administered at a hospital over a 30-day period, thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline. The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad VD infections could charge more. Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic, where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent VD infection, or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[US Army]] attitude was different, driven by a reformist attitude at home. In October 1917, [[Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]] said:<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n{{cquote|These boys are going to France. I want them adequately armed and clothed by their government; but I want them to have an invisible armor to take with them . . . a moral and intellectual armor for their protection overseas.}}\nAided by the [[American Social Hygiene Organization]], he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps, which included closing the notorious [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] district in [[New Orleans]]. When the two million soldiers of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] had been deployed to France, they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen. [[John Pershing]] to just say no:<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n{{cquote|Sexual continence is the plain duty of members of the AEF, both for the vigorous conduct of the war, and for the clean health of the American people after the war.}}\nThis was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read \"You wouldn't use another fellow's tooth-brush, so why use his whore?\" and \"A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor!\" The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule. US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis, that included irrigating the penis. Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted VD were subject to [[court-martial]] and possibly a hard-labor sentence, while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment. Implemented from the first day of training, the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96% of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian.<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n\nHowever, on debarkation at the designated port of [[St. Nazaire]], a dispute with French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the ''Maisons Tol\u00e9r\u00e9e'' off limits. With the dispute escalating, President [[Georges Clemenceau]] sent a memo to Gen. Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to [[Raymond Fosdick]], who gave it to Secretary Baker. Upon receiving it, Baker responded: \"For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war.\" The French later proposed a deal that targeted the [[Black American]] troops, most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities. But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy, as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave, whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact.<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n\nThe policy adopted by the US Army worked, with far lower rates of VD across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants. However, after the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, VD rates among US Army troops shot up.<ref name=HCNSPlse>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehistorychannelclub.com/articles/articletype/articleview/articleid/72/no-sex-please-were-american|title=No Sex, Please, We're American|journal=Nature|volume=340|issue=6232|pages=331|author=Fred D.

This has been accompanied by increasing discourse on ''la s\u00e9curit\u00e9'' internally, which has gradually become dominant, affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated. This was heightened in 2002 when [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s right-wing government (2002\u20132005) succeeded the ''Gauche Plurielle'' ([[plural left]]) coalition of [[Lionel Jospin]] (1997\u20132002). The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and re-integrated. This was a view shared by [[state feminists]], ministers, delegates, and the powerful abolitionist lobby, and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women,<ref name=hazan>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/024000228/index.shtml|title=Le syst\u00e8me de la prostitution.

Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work.\n\nAt the municipal level, there was evidence of prostitutes being constructed as public nuisances that needed to be confined, and many mayors of both political groups responded to citizen groups to introduce by-laws restricting prostitutes' activities in early 2002. This was fuelled by an apparent increased visibility. For instance, [[Fran\u00e7oise de Panafieu]] (UMP delegate [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th arondissement]]) campaigned against street prostitution in the summer of 2002. The commitment to abolitionism prevented specific laws aimed at prostitution (which would have been seen as regulation) initially, so they often used traffic and parking by-laws to drive out workers, which ultimately mean that they were moved from well-lit busy areas to much more unsafe areas. As the discourse shifted from abolitionism to security, so did more explicit laws and regulations. This disquiet enabled Nicolas Sarkozy to later mobilize public anxiety about security evident in the [[2002 French presidential election|elections that year]] in his Domestic Security bill.<ref name=allwood08/>\n\nThe cultural context is the concept of gender equality as stated in the preamble to the [[French Constitution of 1946|1946]] and 1958 constitution and which had seen an increasing momentum of political gains for women, including the establishment of a women's policy agency in 1974 and a ministry of women's rights in 1981. However, a significant gap still exists in terms of economic and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, immigration policies have become increasingly restrictive, and soliciting can result in the removal of a migrant's work permit.<ref name=\"allwood06\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxQKtfQJFr0C&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=International Approaches to Prostitution|website=google.ca|isbn=9781861346728|last1=Gangoli|first1=Geetanjali|last2=Westmarland|first2=Nicole|date=2006-05-31}}</ref>\n\nThe 2007 [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] Manifesto calls for holding clients \"responsible\".

As Women's Minister, Nicole P\u00e9ry, confirmed in her New York speech (see above), prostitution, as a form of male violence, was very much part of that State strategy.\n\nThis influence has waned under the security agenda of the succeeding right-wing governments, but is still evident in the new political thinking, as stated in [[Marie-Jo Zimmermann]]'s ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]) 2002 report to the Delegation on Women's Rights on prostitution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rap-info/i0459.asp|title=N\u00b0 0459 - Rapport d'information sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9rieure (Mme Marie-Jo Zimmermann) sur le projet de loi, adopt\u00e9 par le S\u00e9nat (n\u00b0 381) (volet prostitution)|author=|date=5 December 2002|website=Assembl\u00e9e Nationale|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref>\nin which she echoes the left wing sentiment that the purchase of sex constitutes violence. The pervasiveness of this thinking is even found in the budget.<ref>Projet de loi des finances pour 2004 \u00c9tat des cr\u00e9dits qui concourent aux actions en faveur des droits des femmes</ref>\n\n== Political and social debates ==\nAs in many other countries, debates on the nature and regulation of transactional sex are highly polarized. These positions are the familiar ones that define sex work as violence against women on the one hand, and those who see the problem as stigmatisation and poor working conditions on the other. These result in proposals for either the eradication of prostitution, or social reforms. The dominant abolitionist faction consists of Catholics, family values advocates and sections within feminism and the left. As elsewhere, the term ''abolitionism'' has seen a shift from the abolition of [[Prostitution in France#R\u00e9glementation (Regulation)|R\u00e9glementation]] to include abolition of [[sexual slavery]].\n\nFrom the abolition of ''R\u00e9glementation'' and the ''[[maisons closes]]'' (1946) to the late 1990s, there was a broad abolitionist consensus. This resulted from a close fit between the government position and the dominant socio-political discourse, making it acceptable to a broad coalition that included abolitionists, secular and religious NGOs, politicians from both ends of the political spectrum, and most French feminists. This was so dominant under the Jospin years as to appear normative and non-ideological<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/f/index.php?sp=liv&livre_id=19|title=La Prostitution|website=lecavalierbleu.com}}</ref>\nand above any philosophical debate.<ref name=derycke/>\nThis provides abolitionists access to both the policy process and to resources, such as the 2000 UNESCO conference (see below), which had high-profile support, including important left-wing figures such as [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] and [[Sylviane Agacinski]], who was also married to Lionel Jospin.<ref name=allwood08/>\n\nIn the 1990s, a number of changes shifted the focus of debates. These included an increasing globalization of movements on both parts of the debate, [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] were moving to change their legislation in two distinct and different directions, there was political instability in Eastern Europe and there was also increasing concern about [[AIDS]], while state feminists were also playing an increasing part in policy debates. There were however occasional dissenting voices such as the debate in Le Nouvel Observateur in 1999, sparked by the Dutch legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/opinion/00000819.EDI0001/pour-ou-contre-la-legalisation-des-maisons-closes.html|title=Pour ou contre la l\u00e9galisation des maisons closes|date=29 December 1999|website=L'Obs}}</ref>\n\n=== The 2000 manifestations ===\nA manifestation of abolitionism was the declaration of 18 May 2000, published in the centre-left ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', called \"''Le corps n'est pas une marchandise''\" (\"The body is not a commodity\").

Article 42 addressed the protection of women in prostitution, considered victims of exploitation, and these were amplified by the Minister for Equality in the Workplace, [[Nicole Ameline]] (2002\u20132004).<ref>Ministre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du ministre des affaires sociales, du travail et de la solidarit\u00e9 \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 professionnelle</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/rechercheGlobale.do;jsessionid=5F107822C48AF3C151462E0B821AC512?idRecherche=48f675%3A12c7862f720%3A-166d&unk=compte+rendu&dp=1+an&radio=deau&de=14%2F11%2F2002&au=14%2F11%2F2002&action=OK&rch=gs|title=Site du s\u00e9nat|website=senat.fr}}</ref> \nSarkozy stated that by criminalizing passive soliciting, he was protecting prostitutes and helping them escape organized crime.<ref name=monde23oct02>[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&objet_id=777778 M.

Sarkozy stated that the poor supported a tough crime agenda and that the general population wanted a stronger stand on law and order. In particular, he cited an [[Ipsos]] poll suggesting that 80% of people on minimum wage approved of his proposals and that the lower the [[socio-economic class]] the more support.<ref name=monde23oct02/>\nIn February 2002, a poll suggested security was the most important issue on people's minds in an election year, and in October, 70% of the population considered the proposed measures necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/politiques-publiques/securite-interieure/sentiment-insecurite/|title=Les Fran\u00e7ais et l'ins\u00e9curit\u00e9,.

Passive solicitation had been previously decriminalized by another right-wing government, that of [[\u00c9douard Balladur|Balladur]] in 1994.\n\nProposed Article 225-10-1 removed the necessity of the police having evidence of soliciting, allowing 'dress or posture' to be sufficient. He explained that it was inconvenient for the police to have to obtain evidence of active soliciting. In the Senate, a Government amendment subsequently deleted reference to dress after a popular outcry.<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=d012823&idtable=d013503|d012823|d17028-12188_13&_c=compte+rendu&rch=ds&de=20021114&au=20021114&dp=1+an&radio=deau&aff=7028&tri=p&off=0&afd=ppr&afd=ppl&afd=pjl&afd=cvn Projet de Loi as presented to the Senate on October 23 2002 by M.

It addressed trafficking, by defining it and attached penalties. In the case of alleged victims of trafficking, collaboration allowed them to stay and work till their case was heard. If an exploiters were convicted (Article 76), they could then receive permanent residence. Finally, article 52 allowed for annual reports to be published on prostitution in France, from 2004 onwards.\n\n==== Reactions ====\nReactions included demonstrations and petitions.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1434665|title=Hard on ladies of the night: The French government is cracking down on prostitution|author=|date=7 November 2002|journal=The Economist|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref>\nCriticism came from the left, trade unions, women's<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectifdroitsdesfemmes.org/spip.php?article87|title=Le projet de loi Sarkozy et la prostitution|website=collectifdroitsdesfemmes.org}}</ref>\nand human rights and poverty groups who saw this bill, which simultaneously addressed begging, squatting and assembling in public areas of buildings,<ref name=sarkozyexpose>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/leg/pjl02-030.html|title=Projet de loi pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9rieure|website=senat.fr}}</ref>\nas an attack on the poor, stating that no one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute.<ref>Tubiana, M., B.

In the Senate, the measures were seen to be street cleaning, rather than addressing the causes of social problems and [[social exclusion]], and that reconstructing prostitution as a law and order issue would merely drive it underground, depriving sex workers from access to services, and damaging AIDS campaigns. it was stated that no-one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute, to live in neighbourhoods with no facilities and no public services\". It was noted that there was no action to deal with organized crime or those who might be exploiting sex workers.<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200211/s20021114/s20021114_mono.html Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002] Comments of Mme H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Luc and M. Jacques Mah\u00e9as</ref>\n\nThe issue of passive solicitation caused particular concern since it could mean that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed, and it was particularly hard to define. The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict.<ref>Colas H. \u00e0 Bordeaux, la justice distanci\u00e9e par la police. L'Humanit\u00e9 Dec 20 2003</ref>\nIt was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them, and that prostitution had become conflated with trafficking. The trafficking policy seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals, while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against, since they were simultaneously 'rescued' and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability. Calls for aiming trafficking policy at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission, the Delegations for Women's Rights in the Senate and National Assembly, as well as from the opposition.\n\nIn the Senate hearings into prostitution that year, Claude Boucher of ''[[Les amis du bus des femmes|Bus des Femmes]]'', a sex worker support group, described how sex workers sell sex to survive, unable to make ends meet on social security or the minimum wage. To treat them as criminals, she argued, would just make them more vulnerable. \"''Cette loi n'est m\u00eame pas une loi d'ordre moral, c'est une loi contre les exclus, contre les plus vuln\u00e9rables''\" (This law is not even a public morals law, it is a law against those who are excluded, against the most vulnerable)\n<ref name=\"allwood08\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fwkLWu6sq-UC&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Demanding Sex: Critical Reflections on the Regulation of Prostitution|website=google.ca|isbn=9781409496175|last1=Giusta|first1=Ms Marina Della|last2=Munro|first2=Professor Vanessa E|date=2013-02-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"allwood06\"/>\n<ref name=\"boucher151002\"/>\n\n==== Evaluation ====\nSarkozy did not attempt to produce a comprehensive policy on prostitution, but rather a quick fix, addressing immediate concerns of voters in terms of visibility.<ref name=sarkozyexpose/>\nIn this, he succeeded, at least in the short term. The police reported a 40% decrease in prevalence, but also that it had moved to more discreet areas and hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lmdldb.wordpress.com/2004/01/14/1913/|title=Le Mur de Laine de Briques|date=2004-01-14}}</ref>\nHowever, the more profound effect was that Sarkozy had changed the framing of sex workers from victims to criminals, and tied it to immigration debates, focusing narrowly on street transactions. This avoided inconveniencing the middle-class clients, who might have created more opposition. The governmental policy tended to portray all immigrant women in prostitution, the most vulnerable, as victims of trafficking and exploitation, and their pimps as \"foreigners\".\n\nFollowing the law coming into effect, 5,619 charges of passive solicitation were laid between March 2003 and July 2004, 90% of these were women, and most from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]] (40%), [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Cameroon]] (35%). 15% were French nationals, another 10% from other areas in Africa and 2% from Asia.<ref>[http://0869935g.esi6.crdp-poitiers.cndp.fr/search.php?action=Record&id=MF_MF04112610440413_2004 Des associations constatent un timide reflux de la prostitution.

By \"rescuing\" these victims of trafficking and returning them home, he proposed to solve the situation. He argued that the only way to achieve this was to arrest them and then send them back to their families (''Si le racolage est reconnu comme un d\u00e9lit, les forces de l'ordre pourront, parce qu'elles auront commis un d\u00e9lit, ramener ces filles chez elles''), which he stated to be a humanitarian duty \"''c'est un devoir, dirai-je, humanitaire que de raccompagner cette personne chez elle''\" (I will say it is a humanitarian duty to return such a person to their home).<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200211/s20021114/s20021114_mono.html Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002] Comments of M.

I hope that these women will have a better future than facing degrading encounters night after night\"''</blockquote>\n\nIn drawing this distinction, Sarkozy made frequent reference to the inability to speak French, constructing the issue as a defense of French. He suggested that this made them vulnerable to exploitation, and that the Police would take them home.

Critics doubted the practicality or whether the benefits were equally distributed between the women and the authorities, an expression of the tension between human rights and public security.\n\nIn April 2006, Senator [[Nicole Borvo]] ([[French Communist Party|PCF]]) attempted to introduce a private bill to repeal the Sarkozy law, arguing that it had been ineffective, and turned victims into criminals. The framework was very similar to the 2001 Deryck report, depicting prostitution as violence rather than law and order, and seeking punishment of exploiters, but also measures for prevention and support.\n<ref name=allwood06/>\n\n==== 2011 Parliamentary Commission ====\nIn April 2011, a parliamentary commission report (\"En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux m\u00e9tier du monde\") recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/pdf/rap-info/i3334.pdf|title=Assembl\u00e9e Nationale.

A 2002 telephone survey analyzed French attitudes about prostitution. 64% of respondents said that prostitution was \"a degrading practice for the image and the dignity of the woman (or the man)\". 66% of those questioned favored the re-opening of the ''maisons closes'' (brothels - see Maisons closes, below), 37% wanted the clients to be criminalized, 22% wanted the prostitutes to be criminalized and 33% wanted all forms of prostitution to be illegal. When analyzed and broken down by age and gender, the survey showed that some people gave contradictory answers: For example, some people appeared to favor both the re-opening of the ''maisons'' (brothels) and the interdiction of all forms of prostitution (probably believing that both solutions would work, as the survey showed that most people were dissatisfied with the existing legal situation). Older people and men were more accepting of the idea of having legalized brothels.<ref name=csa02>[http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2002/opi20021023d.htm 2002 Survey results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424091048/http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2002/opi20021023d.htm |date=2009-04-24 }}, CSA</ref><ref name=csa03>[http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2003/opi20030129a.htm CSA: Les Fran\u00e7ais et la r\u00e9ouverture des maisons closes 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603152142/http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2003/opi20030129a.htm |date=2008-06-03 }}</ref>\nIn the 2006 poll, only 14% thought prostitution should be illegal.<ref>[http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2006/opi20060419b.htm L'opinion des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la prostitution CSA avril 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603180134/http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2006/opi20060419b.htm |date=2008-06-03 }}</ref>\nPoll results reported in 2010 gave 59% in favor of re-opening of the brothels, and 10% opposed.<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=\"timesonline.co.uk\"/><ref name=paris10>{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/fermees-il-y-a-soixante-ans-les-maisons-closes-font-encore-debat-18-03-2010-853127.php|title=Ferm\u00e9es il y a soixante ans, les maisons closes font encore d\u00e9bat|date=2 July 2015|website=leparisien.fr}}</ref>\nLiberalization is opposed by abolitionist groups such as ''Mouvement du Nid''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouvementdunid.org/|title=Mouvement du Nid|website=mouvementdunid.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Expert opinion ===\nIn May 2011, the seventh anniversary of the introduction of the LSI, M\u00e9decins du Monde released a very critical report on the effect of the law, and called for its repeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medecinsdumonde.org/mdm/prostitution18mars/index.html |title=Enqu\u00eate de M\u00e9decins du Monde - aupr\u00e8s des personnes se prostituant |author=Medecins du monde |website=medecinsdumonde.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614161343/http://www.medecinsdumonde.org/mdm/prostitution18mars/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Forms and extent of prostitution ==\n[[File:AvtivistedesProstitues.JPG|thumb|Prostitute activist in Paris, 2005]]\n[[File:Bmc perrache.JPG|thumb|Prostitutes working in vans in [[Lyon]], France]]\n\nStudies from 2003 estimated that about 15,000 \u2013 20,000 women work as prostitutes in France.<ref name=afrik>[http://www.afrik.com/article7276.html De plus en plus de prostitu\u00e9es africaines en France], ''Afrik.com'', 7 May 2004. {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\nIn 2010, the number of full-time male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20,000 \u2013 30,000, with 80% being foreigners.<ref name=guardian2>{{Cite news\n| title = Bring back the brothel, says female French MP\n| magazine = The Guardian\n| date = 2010-03-18\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/18/france-brothel-prostitution-female-mp\n| location=London\n| first=Lizzy\n| last=Davies\n}}</ref> In 2018 it was estimated there were 30,000 prostitutes in the country and 90% were foreign.<ref name=\"state18\" />\n\nSex work in France, like other countries takes many forms. These include [[street prostitution]], [[escort services]], bars, and [[apartment prostitution]]. Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps, while other workers are autonomous prostitutes. In some areas, such as [[Lyon]] or the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris, sex workers use vans (see illustration).<ref name=guard/> The most famous prostitution street in Paris, the ''[[Rue Saint-Denis (Paris)|la Rue Saint-Denis]]'', has been somewhat gentrified in recent years and the prostitutes have been moved further north. Escort services where one hires a woman or man for \"entertainment\" or companionship, but usually including sex, are less common in France, compared to [[North America]]. In [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual acts. Prices are set by the bar owner, and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] [[Peep show|peepshow]]s are well known for practicing such scams. Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines. [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swingers' clubs]] are places where partner-swapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance, as well as \"amateur\" women and couples who get in without paying the flat-rate charge of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay, including food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests.\n\n=== Maisons closes ===\nBrothels ([[:fr:maisons closes|''Maisons closes'']]) remain illegal, but operate discreetly and clandestinely.

Foreign victims from [[Eastern Europe]], [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Caribbean]] are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking networks controlled by Nigerians, Bulgarians, [[Romania]]ns, Chinese, and French citizens force women into prostitution through [[debt bondage]], physical force, and psychological coercion, including the invocation of voodoo and drug addiction. The number of children exploited in commercial sex has increased in recent years. Children, primarily from Romania, West and North Africa, and the Middle East, are victims of sex trafficking in France. The government estimates the majority of the 30,000 people in prostitution in France, about 90 percent of whom are foreign, are likely trafficking victims. Trafficking of male victims for sex trafficking has increased.

In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution (see [[#Abolitionism in France|Abolitionism in France]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of prostitution in France}}\n[[File:Paris 1er arr jms.gif|thumb|Paris arrondissements, 1st highlighted, the 2nd and 3rd to the N. & 4th to the E]]\n[[File:\u00c9tienne Jeaurat 001.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9tienne Jeaurat]] (1699\u20131789). \"Filles de joie\" being taken to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re 1745.

Prostitutes were not marginalized, but integrated into society where they had a role to play. In stories (which were often ribald), prostitutes would be complicit with other women in avenging men.

This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes. Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the [[Breviary of Alaric|Code Alaric]]. Offenders also had their hair cut off, and in the case of [[recidivism]], could be sold as slaves. There is no evidence that any of this was effective.<ref name=prosmoy/><ref name=histmais/>\nUnder [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] (1180\u20131223) an irregular militia, the ''[[:fr:Ribaud|Ribaud]]'' were created in 1189 to police prostitution and gambling, headed by a ''Roi des Ribauds'', but abolished by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (1285\u20131314) due to their licentiousness.\n\n==== Saint Louis IX (1226\u20131270) ====\nIn the interim, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (1226\u20131270) attempted to ban prostitution in December 1254, with disastrous social consequences and widespread protests. The decree ordered the expulsion of all \"women of evil life\" from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings, but simply drove the trade underground. Eventually he was forced to revoke this by 1256. Although still railing against women who were \"free with their bodies and other common harlots\", he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments, and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls. <!--This is not true: Hence brothels came to be known as \"bordels\" (or \"bordes\", or \"bordeau\"), and the inhabitants as \"filles bordeli\u00e8res\".

Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young, as well as the married men who were missing their wives. As the war advanced, so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained. While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes, dominion soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada received six shillings and could afford higher-class \"services\". British officers preferred to ''\"always indulge with armour (condoms)\"'' and took to patronizing German Army officers' former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war, with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions, but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war.<ref name=HCNSPlse/> In 1915, in [[Le Havre]], a survey undertaken by the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] counted 171,000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street. As a result, rates of [[venereal disease]] began to climb, with 23,000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment,<ref name=HCNSPlse/> with over 150,000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The disease at the time had a high social stigma, but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty, even on a temporary basis. [[Syphilis]] was treated with injections of mercury, administered at a hospital over a 30-day period, thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline. The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad VD infections could charge more. Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic, where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent VD infection, or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[US Army]] attitude was different, driven by a reformist attitude at home. In October 1917, [[Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]] said:<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n{{cquote|These boys are going to France. I want them adequately armed and clothed by their government; but I want them to have an invisible armor to take with them . . . a moral and intellectual armor for their protection overseas.}}\nAided by the [[American Social Hygiene Organization]], he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps, which included closing the notorious [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] district in [[New Orleans]]. When the two million soldiers of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] had been deployed to France, they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen. [[John Pershing]] to just say no:<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n{{cquote|Sexual continence is the plain duty of members of the AEF, both for the vigorous conduct of the war, and for the clean health of the American people after the war.}}\nThis was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read \"You wouldn't use another fellow's tooth-brush, so why use his whore?\" and \"A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor!\" The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule. US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis, that included irrigating the penis. Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted VD were subject to [[court-martial]] and possibly a hard-labor sentence, while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment. Implemented from the first day of training, the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96% of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian.<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n\nHowever, on debarkation at the designated port of [[St. Nazaire]], a dispute with French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the ''Maisons Tol\u00e9r\u00e9e'' off limits. With the dispute escalating, President [[Georges Clemenceau]] sent a memo to Gen. Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to [[Raymond Fosdick]], who gave it to Secretary Baker. Upon receiving it, Baker responded: \"For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war.\" The French later proposed a deal that targeted the [[Black American]] troops, most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities. But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy, as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave, whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact.<ref name=HCNSPlse/>\n\nThe policy adopted by the US Army worked, with far lower rates of VD across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants. However, after the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, VD rates among US Army troops shot up.<ref name=HCNSPlse>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehistorychannelclub.com/articles/articletype/articleview/articleid/72/no-sex-please-were-american|title=No Sex, Please, We're American|journal=Nature|volume=340|issue=6232|pages=331|author=Fred D.

This has been accompanied by increasing discourse on ''la s\u00e9curit\u00e9'' internally, which has gradually become dominant, affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated. This was heightened in 2002 when [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s right-wing government (2002\u20132005) succeeded the ''Gauche Plurielle'' ([[plural left]]) coalition of [[Lionel Jospin]] (1997\u20132002). The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and re-integrated. This was a view shared by [[state feminists]], ministers, delegates, and the powerful abolitionist lobby, and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women,<ref name=hazan>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/024000228/index.shtml|title=Le syst\u00e8me de la prostitution.

Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work.\n\nAt the municipal level, there was evidence of prostitutes being constructed as public nuisances that needed to be confined, and many mayors of both political groups responded to citizen groups to introduce by-laws restricting prostitutes' activities in early 2002. This was fuelled by an apparent increased visibility. For instance, [[Fran\u00e7oise de Panafieu]] (UMP delegate [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th arondissement]]) campaigned against street prostitution in the summer of 2002. The commitment to abolitionism prevented specific laws aimed at prostitution (which would have been seen as regulation) initially, so they often used traffic and parking by-laws to drive out workers, which ultimately mean that they were moved from well-lit busy areas to much more unsafe areas. As the discourse shifted from abolitionism to security, so did more explicit laws and regulations. This disquiet enabled Nicolas Sarkozy to later mobilize public anxiety about security evident in the [[2002 French presidential election|elections that year]] in his Domestic Security bill.<ref name=allwood08/>\n\nThe cultural context is the concept of gender equality as stated in the preamble to the [[French Constitution of 1946|1946]] and 1958 constitution and which had seen an increasing momentum of political gains for women, including the establishment of a women's policy agency in 1974 and a ministry of women's rights in 1981. However, a significant gap still exists in terms of economic and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, immigration policies have become increasingly restrictive, and soliciting can result in the removal of a migrant's work permit.<ref name=\"allwood06\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxQKtfQJFr0C&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=International Approaches to Prostitution|website=google.ca|isbn=9781861346728|last1=Gangoli|first1=Geetanjali|last2=Westmarland|first2=Nicole|date=2006-05-31}}</ref>\n\nThe 2007 [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] Manifesto calls for holding clients \"responsible\".

As Women's Minister, Nicole P\u00e9ry, confirmed in her New York speech (see above), prostitution, as a form of male violence, was very much part of that State strategy.\n\nThis influence has waned under the security agenda of the succeeding right-wing governments, but is still evident in the new political thinking, as stated in [[Marie-Jo Zimmermann]]'s ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]) 2002 report to the Delegation on Women's Rights on prostitution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rap-info/i0459.asp|title=N\u00b0 0459 - Rapport d'information sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9rieure (Mme Marie-Jo Zimmermann) sur le projet de loi, adopt\u00e9 par le S\u00e9nat (n\u00b0 381) (volet prostitution)|author=|date=5 December 2002|website=Assembl\u00e9e Nationale|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref>\nin which she echoes the left wing sentiment that the purchase of sex constitutes violence. The pervasiveness of this thinking is even found in the budget.<ref>Projet de loi des finances pour 2004 \u00c9tat des cr\u00e9dits qui concourent aux actions en faveur des droits des femmes</ref>\n\n== Political and social debates ==\nAs in many other countries, debates on the nature and regulation of transactional sex are highly polarized. These positions are the familiar ones that define sex work as violence against women on the one hand, and those who see the problem as stigmatisation and poor working conditions on the other. These result in proposals for either the eradication of prostitution, or social reforms. The dominant abolitionist faction consists of Catholics, family values advocates and sections within feminism and the left. As elsewhere, the term ''abolitionism'' has seen a shift from the abolition of [[Prostitution in France#R\u00e9glementation (Regulation)|R\u00e9glementation]] to include abolition of [[sexual slavery]].\n\nFrom the abolition of ''R\u00e9glementation'' and the ''[[maisons closes]]'' (1946) to the late 1990s, there was a broad abolitionist consensus. This resulted from a close fit between the government position and the dominant socio-political discourse, making it acceptable to a broad coalition that included abolitionists, secular and religious NGOs, politicians from both ends of the political spectrum, and most French feminists. This was so dominant under the Jospin years as to appear normative and non-ideological<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/f/index.php?sp=liv&livre_id=19|title=La Prostitution|website=lecavalierbleu.com}}</ref>\nand above any philosophical debate.<ref name=derycke/>\nThis provides abolitionists access to both the policy process and to resources, such as the 2000 UNESCO conference (see below), which had high-profile support, including important left-wing figures such as [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] and [[Sylviane Agacinski]], who was also married to Lionel Jospin.<ref name=allwood08/>\n\nIn the 1990s, a number of changes shifted the focus of debates. These included an increasing globalization of movements on both parts of the debate, [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] were moving to change their legislation in two distinct and different directions, there was political instability in Eastern Europe and there was also increasing concern about [[AIDS]], while state feminists were also playing an increasing part in policy debates. There were however occasional dissenting voices such as the debate in Le Nouvel Observateur in 1999, sparked by the Dutch legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/opinion/00000819.EDI0001/pour-ou-contre-la-legalisation-des-maisons-closes.html|title=Pour ou contre la l\u00e9galisation des maisons closes|date=29 December 1999|website=L'Obs}}</ref>\n\n=== The 2000 manifestations ===\nA manifestation of abolitionism was the declaration of 18 May 2000, published in the centre-left ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', called \"''Le corps n'est pas une marchandise''\" (\"The body is not a commodity\").

Article 42 addressed the protection of women in prostitution, considered victims of exploitation, and these were amplified by the Minister for Equality in the Workplace, [[Nicole Ameline]] (2002\u20132004).<ref>Ministre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du ministre des affaires sociales, du travail et de la solidarit\u00e9 \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 professionnelle</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/rechercheGlobale.do;jsessionid=5F107822C48AF3C151462E0B821AC512?idRecherche=48f675%3A12c7862f720%3A-166d&unk=compte+rendu&dp=1+an&radio=deau&de=14%2F11%2F2002&au=14%2F11%2F2002&action=OK&rch=gs|title=Site du s\u00e9nat|website=senat.fr}}</ref> \nSarkozy stated that by criminalizing passive soliciting, he was protecting prostitutes and helping them escape organized crime.<ref name=monde23oct02>[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&objet_id=777778 M.

Sarkozy stated that the poor supported a tough crime agenda and that the general population wanted a stronger stand on law and order. In particular, he cited an [[Ipsos]] poll suggesting that 80% of people on minimum wage approved of his proposals and that the lower the [[socio-economic class]] the more support.<ref name=monde23oct02/>\nIn February 2002, a poll suggested security was the most important issue on people's minds in an election year, and in October, 70% of the population considered the proposed measures necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/politiques-publiques/securite-interieure/sentiment-insecurite/|title=Les Fran\u00e7ais et l'ins\u00e9curit\u00e9,.

Passive solicitation had been previously decriminalized by another right-wing government, that of [[\u00c9douard Balladur|Balladur]] in 1994.\n\nProposed Article 225-10-1 removed the necessity of the police having evidence of soliciting, allowing 'dress or posture' to be sufficient. He explained that it was inconvenient for the police to have to obtain evidence of active soliciting. In the Senate, a Government amendment subsequently deleted reference to dress after a popular outcry.<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=d012823&idtable=d013503|d012823|d17028-12188_13&_c=compte+rendu&rch=ds&de=20021114&au=20021114&dp=1+an&radio=deau&aff=7028&tri=p&off=0&afd=ppr&afd=ppl&afd=pjl&afd=cvn Projet de Loi as presented to the Senate on October 23 2002 by M.

It addressed trafficking, by defining it and attached penalties. In the case of alleged victims of trafficking, collaboration allowed them to stay and work till their case was heard. If an exploiters were convicted (Article 76), they could then receive permanent residence. Finally, article 52 allowed for annual reports to be published on prostitution in France, from 2004 onwards.\n\n==== Reactions ====\nReactions included demonstrations and petitions.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1434665|title=Hard on ladies of the night: The French government is cracking down on prostitution|author=|date=7 November 2002|journal=The Economist|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref>\nCriticism came from the left, trade unions, women's<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectifdroitsdesfemmes.org/spip.php?article87|title=Le projet de loi Sarkozy et la prostitution|website=collectifdroitsdesfemmes.org}}</ref>\nand human rights and poverty groups who saw this bill, which simultaneously addressed begging, squatting and assembling in public areas of buildings,<ref name=sarkozyexpose>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/leg/pjl02-030.html|title=Projet de loi pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9rieure|website=senat.fr}}</ref>\nas an attack on the poor, stating that no one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute.<ref>Tubiana, M., B.

In the Senate, the measures were seen to be street cleaning, rather than addressing the causes of social problems and [[social exclusion]], and that reconstructing prostitution as a law and order issue would merely drive it underground, depriving sex workers from access to services, and damaging AIDS campaigns. it was stated that no-one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute, to live in neighbourhoods with no facilities and no public services\". It was noted that there was no action to deal with organized crime or those who might be exploiting sex workers.<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200211/s20021114/s20021114_mono.html Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002] Comments of Mme H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Luc and M. Jacques Mah\u00e9as</ref>\n\nThe issue of passive solicitation caused particular concern since it could mean that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed, and it was particularly hard to define. The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict.<ref>Colas H. \u00e0 Bordeaux, la justice distanci\u00e9e par la police. L'Humanit\u00e9 Dec 20 2003</ref>\nIt was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them, and that prostitution had become conflated with trafficking. The trafficking policy seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals, while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against, since they were simultaneously 'rescued' and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability. Calls for aiming trafficking policy at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission, the Delegations for Women's Rights in the Senate and National Assembly, as well as from the opposition.\n\nIn the Senate hearings into prostitution that year, Claude Boucher of ''[[Les amis du bus des femmes|Bus des Femmes]]'', a sex worker support group, described how sex workers sell sex to survive, unable to make ends meet on social security or the minimum wage. To treat them as criminals, she argued, would just make them more vulnerable. \"''Cette loi n'est m\u00eame pas une loi d'ordre moral, c'est une loi contre les exclus, contre les plus vuln\u00e9rables''\" (This law is not even a public morals law, it is a law against those who are excluded, against the most vulnerable)\n<ref name=\"allwood08\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fwkLWu6sq-UC&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Demanding Sex: Critical Reflections on the Regulation of Prostitution|website=google.ca|isbn=9781409496175|last1=Giusta|first1=Ms Marina Della|last2=Munro|first2=Professor Vanessa E|date=2013-02-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"allwood06\"/>\n<ref name=\"boucher151002\"/>\n\n==== Evaluation ====\nSarkozy did not attempt to produce a comprehensive policy on prostitution, but rather a quick fix, addressing immediate concerns of voters in terms of visibility.<ref name=sarkozyexpose/>\nIn this, he succeeded, at least in the short term. The police reported a 40% decrease in prevalence, but also that it had moved to more discreet areas and hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lmdldb.wordpress.com/2004/01/14/1913/|title=Le Mur de Laine de Briques|date=2004-01-14}}</ref>\nHowever, the more profound effect was that Sarkozy had changed the framing of sex workers from victims to criminals, and tied it to immigration debates, focusing narrowly on street transactions. This avoided inconveniencing the middle-class clients, who might have created more opposition. The governmental policy tended to portray all immigrant women in prostitution, the most vulnerable, as victims of trafficking and exploitation, and their pimps as \"foreigners\".\n\nFollowing the law coming into effect, 5,619 charges of passive solicitation were laid between March 2003 and July 2004, 90% of these were women, and most from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]] (40%), [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Cameroon]] (35%). 15% were French nationals, another 10% from other areas in Africa and 2% from Asia.<ref>[http://0869935g.esi6.crdp-poitiers.cndp.fr/search.php?action=Record&id=MF_MF04112610440413_2004 Des associations constatent un timide reflux de la prostitution.

By \"rescuing\" these victims of trafficking and returning them home, he proposed to solve the situation. He argued that the only way to achieve this was to arrest them and then send them back to their families (''Si le racolage est reconnu comme un d\u00e9lit, les forces de l'ordre pourront, parce qu'elles auront commis un d\u00e9lit, ramener ces filles chez elles''), which he stated to be a humanitarian duty \"''c'est un devoir, dirai-je, humanitaire que de raccompagner cette personne chez elle''\" (I will say it is a humanitarian duty to return such a person to their home).<ref>[http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200211/s20021114/s20021114_mono.html Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002] Comments of M.

I hope that these women will have a better future than facing degrading encounters night after night\"''</blockquote>\n\nIn drawing this distinction, Sarkozy made frequent reference to the inability to speak French, constructing the issue as a defense of French. He suggested that this made them vulnerable to exploitation, and that the Police would take them home.

Critics doubted the practicality or whether the benefits were equally distributed between the women and the authorities, an expression of the tension between human rights and public security.\n\nIn April 2006, Senator [[Nicole Borvo]] ([[French Communist Party|PCF]]) attempted to introduce a private bill to repeal the Sarkozy law, arguing that it had been ineffective, and turned victims into criminals. The framework was very similar to the 2001 Deryck report, depicting prostitution as violence rather than law and order, and seeking punishment of exploiters, but also measures for prevention and support.\n<ref name=allwood06/>\n\n==== 2011 Parliamentary Commission ====\nIn April 2011, a parliamentary commission report (\"En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux m\u00e9tier du monde\") recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/pdf/rap-info/i3334.pdf|title=Assembl\u00e9e Nationale.

A 2002 telephone survey analyzed French attitudes about prostitution. 64% of respondents said that prostitution was \"a degrading practice for the image and the dignity of the woman (or the man)\". 66% of those questioned favored the re-opening of the ''maisons closes'' (brothels - see Maisons closes, below), 37% wanted the clients to be criminalized, 22% wanted the prostitutes to be criminalized and 33% wanted all forms of prostitution to be illegal. When analyzed and broken down by age and gender, the survey showed that some people gave contradictory answers: For example, some people appeared to favor both the re-opening of the ''maisons'' (brothels) and the interdiction of all forms of prostitution (probably believing that both solutions would work, as the survey showed that most people were dissatisfied with the existing legal situation). Older people and men were more accepting of the idea of having legalized brothels.<ref name=csa02>[http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2002/opi20021023d.htm 2002 Survey results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424091048/http://www.csa-fr.com/dataset/data2002/opi20021023d.htm |date=2009-04-24 }}, CSA</ref><ref name=csa03>[http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2003/opi20030129a.htm CSA: Les Fran\u00e7ais et la r\u00e9ouverture des maisons closes 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603152142/http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2003/opi20030129a.htm |date=2008-06-03 }}</ref>\nIn the 2006 poll, only 14% thought prostitution should be illegal.<ref>[http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2006/opi20060419b.htm L'opinion des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la prostitution CSA avril 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603180134/http://www.csa.eu/dataset/data2006/opi20060419b.htm |date=2008-06-03 }}</ref>\nPoll results reported in 2010 gave 59% in favor of re-opening of the brothels, and 10% opposed.<ref name=guardian2/><ref name=\"timesonline.co.uk\"/><ref name=paris10>{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/fermees-il-y-a-soixante-ans-les-maisons-closes-font-encore-debat-18-03-2010-853127.php|title=Ferm\u00e9es il y a soixante ans, les maisons closes font encore d\u00e9bat|date=2 July 2015|website=leparisien.fr}}</ref>\nLiberalization is opposed by abolitionist groups such as ''Mouvement du Nid''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouvementdunid.org/|title=Mouvement du Nid|website=mouvementdunid.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Expert opinion ===\nIn May 2011, the seventh anniversary of the introduction of the LSI, M\u00e9decins du Monde released a very critical report on the effect of the law, and called for its repeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medecinsdumonde.org/mdm/prostitution18mars/index.html |title=Enqu\u00eate de M\u00e9decins du Monde - aupr\u00e8s des personnes se prostituant |author=Medecins du monde |website=medecinsdumonde.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614161343/http://www.medecinsdumonde.org/mdm/prostitution18mars/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Forms and extent of prostitution ==\n[[File:AvtivistedesProstitues.JPG|thumb|Prostitute activist in Paris, 2005]]\n[[File:Bmc perrache.JPG|thumb|Prostitutes working in vans in [[Lyon]], France]]\n\nStudies from 2003 estimated that about 15,000 \u2013 20,000 women work as prostitutes in France.<ref name=afrik>[http://www.afrik.com/article7276.html De plus en plus de prostitu\u00e9es africaines en France], ''Afrik.com'', 7 May 2004. {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\nIn 2010, the number of full-time male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20,000 \u2013 30,000, with 80% being foreigners.<ref name=guardian2>{{Cite news\n| title = Bring back the brothel, says female French MP\n| magazine = The Guardian\n| date = 2010-03-18\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/18/france-brothel-prostitution-female-mp\n| location=London\n| first=Lizzy\n| last=Davies\n}}</ref> In 2018 it was estimated there were 30,000 prostitutes in the country and 90% were foreign.<ref name=\"state18\" />\n\nSex work in France, like other countries takes many forms. These include [[street prostitution]], [[escort services]], bars, and [[apartment prostitution]]. Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps, while other workers are autonomous prostitutes. In some areas, such as [[Lyon]] or the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris, sex workers use vans (see illustration).<ref name=guard/> The most famous prostitution street in Paris, the ''[[Rue Saint-Denis (Paris)|la Rue Saint-Denis]]'', has been somewhat gentrified in recent years and the prostitutes have been moved further north. Escort services where one hires a woman or man for \"entertainment\" or companionship, but usually including sex, are less common in France, compared to [[North America]]. In [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual acts. Prices are set by the bar owner, and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] [[Peep show|peepshow]]s are well known for practicing such scams. Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines. [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swingers' clubs]] are places where partner-swapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance, as well as \"amateur\" women and couples who get in without paying the flat-rate charge of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay, including food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests.\n\n=== Maisons closes ===\nBrothels ([[:fr:maisons closes|''Maisons closes'']]) remain illegal, but operate discreetly and clandestinely. Since their official closure in 1946, there have been periodic calls for their re-opening. In 1990, {{ill|Mich\u00e8le Barzach|fr}} ([[Rally for the Republic|RPR]]), a former [[Minister of Health (France)|Minister of Health]] (1986-1988), suggested re-opening them in 1990 as a public health measure.<ref name=mazur/> A row erupted in 2002 with the proposal by [[Fran\u00e7oise de Panafieu]] ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]), which divided French feminists, with [[Gis\u00e8le Halimi]] denouncing it, but [[\u00c9lisabeth Badinter]] seeing it as an issue of \"the right to dispose freely of one's body\".<ref name=\"jdm0702\"/><ref name=\"encorefem0702\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/02/gender.france|title=Prostitution row divides French feminists|author=Jon Henley|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2002-08-02}}</ref>\n\nA 2010 proposal by Chantal Brunel for a return to regulated brothels was opposed by French sex workers (see Politics, above).\n\nMeanwhile, Spain has exploited the difference between the two countries by opening brothels along the French-Spanish border.<ref>{{cite news|title= Spain, the world capital of prostitution?|publisher= [[The Independent|Independent]]|date=Dec 5, 2010|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-the-world-capital-of-prostitution-2151581.html|accessdate=2010-12-05|location=London|first=Alasdair|last=Fotheringham}}</ref>\n\n=== Earnings ===\nIn 2004, the average earnings of a French prostitute were estimated at \u20ac500 a day.

Some of the best known are scenes in brothels produced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], among others. \n[[Brassa\u00ef]] published photographs of brothels in his 1935 book ''Volupt\u00e9s de Paris''.<ref name=bbc>Storyville - Paris Brothel, [[BBC Four]] documentary, 2003</ref> A voluminous illustrated work on the phenomenon is ''Maisons closes.

Foreign victims from [[Eastern Europe]], [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Caribbean]] are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking networks controlled by Nigerians, Bulgarians, [[Romania]]ns, Chinese, and French citizens force women into prostitution through [[debt bondage]], physical force, and psychological coercion, including the invocation of voodoo and drug addiction. The number of children exploited in commercial sex has increased in recent years. Children, primarily from Romania, West and North Africa, and the Middle East, are victims of sex trafficking in France. The government estimates the majority of the 30,000 people in prostitution in France, about 90 percent of whom are foreign, are likely trafficking victims. Trafficking of male victims for sex trafficking has increased. Nigerian trafficking networks use migrant and drug trafficking routes through Libya and Italy to transport girls to France.<ref name=\"state18\">{{cite web |title=France 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282656.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221406/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282656.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=28 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks France as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.<ref name=\"state18\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Prostitution in Paris]]\n* [[Prostitution in Overseas France]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}} {{Col-begin}} {{Col-break|width=50%}}\n\n=== General ===\n*[http://www.deepthought.org/~efulton/academia/prostitution.html French Regulation Laws and the Myth of the Prostitute.

However, he also stated that one might need to repeat the title track \"Power Up\" a few times to fully vibe with it, but eventually it will have the listener \"humming the song's quirky chorus anytime, anywhere, especially the part where the vocals hum \"Banana-na-na\" on top of the quirky chiptune\".<ref>{{cite web|title=[Album review] New era opens with 'Summer Magic' |last=Hong| first=Dam-young|website=The Korea Herald|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180808000641 |accessdate=October 18, 2018 |date=August 8, 2018}}</ref> Similarly, Claire Chung of ''[[Haps Magazine]]'' initially found the song \"a bit childish\" but thought \"the youthful, refreshing summer atmosphere of the music is infectious\" and said she later found herself \"subconsciously singing the song's addictive hook line\".

They then picked \"With You\", \"Mosquito\" and \"Blue Lemonade\" as the standouts from the album. The writer also thought that the addition of the English version of their single \"[[Bad Boy (Red Velvet song)|Bad Boy]]\" kept the [[Red Velvet (group)#Artistry|\"velvet\" aura]] alive and will serve as a bridge to their next album which they are predicting \"could be a deeper red or velvet concept during the colder seasons\".

However, he also stated that one might need to repeat the title track \"Power Up\" a few times to fully vibe with it, but eventually it will have the listener \"humming the song's quirky chorus anytime, anywhere, especially the part where the vocals hum \"Banana-na-na\" on top of the quirky chiptune\".<ref>{{cite web|title=[Album review] New era opens with 'Summer Magic' |last=Hong| first=Dam-young|website=The Korea Herald|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180808000641 |accessdate=October 18, 2018 |date=August 8, 2018}}</ref> Similarly, Claire Chung of ''[[Haps Magazine]]'' initially found the song \"a bit childish\" but thought \"the youthful, refreshing summer atmosphere of the music is infectious\" and said she later found herself \"subconsciously singing the song's addictive hook line\".

They then picked \"With You\", \"Mosquito\" and \"Blue Lemonade\" as the standouts from the album. The writer also thought that the addition of the English version of their single \"[[Bad Boy (Red Velvet song)|Bad Boy]]\" kept the [[Red Velvet (group)#Artistry|\"velvet\" aura]] alive and will serve as a bridge to their next album which they are predicting \"could be a deeper red or velvet concept during the colder seasons\".
