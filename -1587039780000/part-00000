Formed in 1877 at the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]], since 1994 the team have played their home games at [[Broadwood Stadium]]. Their biggest accomplishment was winning the [[Scottish Cup]] on three occasions: [[1939 Scottish Cup Final|1939]], [[1955 Scottish Cup Final|1955]] and [[1958 Scottish Cup Final|1958]]; they reached the final a further three times, all during a long period based at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]]. They have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1975.\n\n==History==\n===1877\u20131898===\nThe Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the [[River Clyde]] at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the [[Glasgow]] press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.\n\nHere's how the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] recorded Clyde's origins:\n\n{{Quotation|\"Clyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), [[Barrowfield Park]], on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row.\"}}\n\nSitting on the edge of [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile work with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged, it appears the ground consisted of a grandstand running north\u2013south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.\n\nToday this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield got initially shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.\n\nThe club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde's Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.\n\nThe first mention of Clyde was in Monday's [[Evening Times]] of 17 September 1877:\n\n{{Quotation|\"Clyde v T. Lanark\nClyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end, the 3rd were victors by three goals to 1.\"}}\n\nThis concise report was typical at the time as the sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and quoting for the limited column space available.\n\nAlthough most fixtures were informal, the [[Scottish Cup]] had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the [[Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup]] and the [[Glasgow Cup]] which in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] were the visitors once again, and triumphed 1\u20130.\n\nClyde joined the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1891, its second edition. Following acceptance, [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]] provided the opposition for Clyde's first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to the format Clyde triumphed 10\u20133, and a mid-table finish saw the club complete a confident season in League football. While it was an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities, and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League.\n\nThe club endured a terrible [[1897\u201398 in Scottish football|final season]] at Barrowfield, finishing bottom of Division 1 with only 5 points, but remained in the top division. The last action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 30 April 1898, ending in a 3\u20133 draw.<ref>[http://www.thestatcat.co.uk/Match.aspx?MatchID=5419&LU=S&LUID=19 Match Details], TheStatCat</ref>\n\n===1899\u20131919===\nClyde said farewell to Barrowfield in the spring of 1898. Directly across the river between the Glasgow neighbourhood of [[Oatlands, Glasgow|Oatlands]] and the [[Lanarkshire]] town of [[Rutherglen]] lay some open ground known as [[Shawfield]], and Clyde transformed from Brigtonians to Shawfielders. With a new League season only a matter of months away, Clyde had the monumental task of transforming and enclosing the area into a venue suitable for first-class football. The move was primarily financed by the club becoming incorporated and issuing shares in \"The Clyde Football Club Limited\". By the eve of the new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about {{convert|9|acre|ha}}. A grandstand seating 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well underway. The Clyde directors of the time wildly estimated a final capacity of 100,000.\n\n[[File: ClydeFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of historic table positions of Clyde in the League.]]\n[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], the neighbours from up the road, were the inaugural opposition at [[Shawfield Stadium]] on 27 August 1898. A healthy crowd of 10,000 turned up to see a goalless draw and return gate receipts of \u00a3203. The [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899\u20131900]] season ended with another bottom-placed finish, and this time, relegation. By [[1901\u201302 in Scottish football|1901\u201302]],the club had sunk to the bottom of the lower division.\n\nMatters took a turn for the better in the [[1903\u201304 in Scottish football|1903\u201304 season]]. Clyde finished 2nd in Division Two but were not elected to Division One (automatic promotion/relegation did not appear until 1921). They also won a supplementary competition called the [[Glasgow and West of Scotland Football League|Glasgow & West of Scotland League]] the following season. The promotion was again denied in [[1904\u201305 in Scottish football|season 1904\u201305]], with Clyde the Division Two champions, but was finally granted the [[1905\u201306 in Scottish football|following season]]. The years up to [[World War I]] would be far more successful and probably represent the most consistent period of success for the club.\n\nA 3rd place in Division One in [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|season 1908\u201309]], only three points behind champions Celtic, put Clyde firmly on the map of Scottish football. The semi-final of the [[Scottish Cup]] was also reached for the first time only to be thwarted by Celtic after a replay. International honours were also awarded to Clyde players for the first time this season: [[William Walker (footballer, born 1884)|William 'Shoogly' Walker]]  represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] (5\u20130), while the opposition included his team-mate, [[Jack Kirwan]].\n\nFor five seasons until the war began, Clyde was at the top end of Division One and reached the [[Scottish Cup]] final in [[1909\u201310 Scottish Cup#Final|1910]] and [[1911\u201312 Scottish Cup#Final|1912]]. The former of these finals was especially disappointing. For eighty-three minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson & Blair; Walker, [[Tom McAteer|McAteer]] & Robertson; Stirling & McCartney; Chalmers; Jackson & Booth) held a 2\u20130 lead with goals from Chalmers and Booth and looked sure to win. With the Cup in sight, nerves got the better of Clyde and Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his net. Dogged [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] fought all the way and salvaged the game in the last minute with an equaliser from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey an affair and ended goalless after [[extra time]] but with Dundee looking physically stronger. The third game was again a tight affair with Clyde scoring after only three minutes through Chalmers. Dundee equalised before the interval and with Clyde's energy sapped, [[John Hunter (footballer, born 1878)|John \"Sailor\" Hunter]] blasted Dundee to victory.\n\nThe 1912 final saw Celtic trump the ''Bully Wee'' once again with a 2\u20130 victory, another third-place finish in the League being the only consolation. Still undaunted, Clyde reached the semi-final back in 1912\u201313, but the jinx struck again and after a replay [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] squeezed into the final.\n\nClyde had something to cheer about during this period of near misses as they clinched the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in 1910 and the Glasgow Cup in 1915. It is easy to deride these competitions as second rate, but they were fought for just as hard as the Scottish Cup, and indeed all six competitors (Celtic, Clyde, [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and Third Lanark) were more often than not resident in Division One.\n\nA severe blow was dealt in September 1914 as fire destroyed the grandstand, and with it much of the club's early history. Officials, players and fans had little time to dwell upon the calamity as the war began in November. The Scottish League decided to continue playing even though there was intense moral pressure on every young man to sign up for 'King & Country'. Besides, football crowds provided a fertile recruitment ground, and the games themselves kept morale high. Many players joined up \u2013 some never returned, such as C. Clunas (2nd [[Royal Fusiliers]]), T. Cranston ([[Black Watch]] ) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion [[Royal Scots]]) \u2013 and teams like Clyde found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides  and the League eventually reduced back to a single division.\n\n===1920\u20131945===\nClyde managed to sustain football through the difficult war years, and peacetime presented new challenges. The Scottish League continued through [[1919\u201320 in Scottish football|1919\u201321]] with only one division. Division Two was restarted in [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322]] with a very crucial difference: automatic promotion and relegation was adopted, and while the benefits were evident for ambitious teams, the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.\n\nRelegated in 1923\u201324, Clyde spent two seasons in Division Two playing against the likes of [[Armadale F.C.|Armadale]], [[Arthurlie F.C.|Arthurlie]], [[Bathgate F.C.|Bathgate]], [[Bo'ness F.C.|Bo'ness]], [[Broxburn F.C.|Broxburn]], [[King's Park F.C.|king's Park]], [[Nithsdale Wanderers F.C.|Nithsdale Wanderers]] and [[St Bernard's F.C.|St Bernard's]]. Escape via automatic promotion was achieved in the [[1925\u201326 in Scottish football|1925\u201326 season]] and coincided with the demise of Division Three and many of the smaller teams returning to other leagues and Junior football.\n\nThis upswing in Clyde's fortunes was demonstrated by winning the Glasgow Cup for the second time in 1926 with a 2\u20131 victory over Celtic. Now that Clyde was back in the top flight, could they stay there? Until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the answer was a resounding \"yes\" as the club maintained a respectable mid-table status. [[Danny Blair]] was a prominent international full back of this era and [[Billy Boyd (footballer)|Billy Boyd]] became Clyde's top marksman with 32 goals in season 1932\u201333, also earning two international caps.\n\nClyde and financial problems were never far apart, and liquidation was again narrowly averted around 1930. The club needed to find an answer to their money problems, and it lay right in front of them. Greyhound and other animal racing were booming in the late 1920s, and several clubs saw this as a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde. It seemed too good to be accurate, and it proved to be so. Animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was very set against greyhound racing in general.\n\nHowever, Clyde at that time had a very cunning and dogged chairman called John McMahon. He would not let the idea go, and after years of wrangling, a solution has arrived. The Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Limited started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde. Largely financed and owned by Clyde's directors, at a stroke the club had secured its future and found an additional source of revenue. On the other hand, Clyde had sold Shawfield to another party (however close at the time) and would never be able to raise money using the land asset as collateral. Although it would not have repercussions until the 1980s, Clyde were tenants at the mercy of whoever owned Shawfield.\n\nJanuary 1939 saw Clyde at home to [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] in the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup. A 2\u20130 victory sent Clyde on their way. The next tie saw a challenging trip to Dundee, and a goalless draw ensued. Four days later, Clyde squeezed past the [[Dens Park]] men with a 1\u20130 victory. [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] were the formidable 3rd Round opponents. Despite fourteen League titles and six Cup victories between 1920 and 1939, Rangers were no match for the ''Bully Wee'' as they crashed to a 4\u20131 defeat. [[Willie Martin (Scottish footballer)|Willie Martin]], Clyde's prolific centre forward, scored all four goals and set a record for an opposition at Ibrox. Returning to Shawfield for the 4th Round, Clyde narrowly defeated neighbours [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] 1\u20130. Suddenly it was semi-final time once again with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] standing between Clyde and another final. Although disadvantaged by playing the tie in Edinburgh at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]], Clyde again triumphed with a 1\u20130 victory.<ref name=39cup/>\n\n[[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] provided Clyde's opposition on 22 April 1939. They had scored far more goals on the way to [[Hampden Park|Hampden]] and were installed as favourites. Clyde ([[John Brown (footballer born 1915)|Brown]]; Kirk and Hickie; Beaton, [[Eddie Falloon|Falloon]] and [[Ned Weir|Weir]]; Robertson and [[John Gillies (footballer)|Gillies]]; Martin; Noble and [[Dougie Wallace (footballer)|Wallace]]) had other ideas though. Winning the toss and with a strong wind behind them, Motherwell began very strongly and unsettled Clyde with Brown seeing plenty of action. Riding the storm, Clyde settled and scored the vital goal after thirty minutes. Robertson sped down the right and crossed to Wallace. The forward gathered the ball and smashed the ball into the roof of the net. Motherwell replied with more pressure but could not find a goal before the interval. In the second period, Martin quickly doubled Clyde's advantage with an opportunist's strike. The fight went from Motherwell and Clyde scored an extra two in the closing minutes. Motherwell's keeper blocked Noble's first strike at goal, but he swept home the rebound. Barely a minute later Noble supplied a cross for Martin to complete the scoring and seal a 4\u20130 victory. After so many attempts and so much heartache the Cup was finally won.<ref name=39cup>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48328186 Scottish Cup final: 80th anniversary for Clyde side that held the trophy longest], BBC Sport, 27 May 2019</ref>\n\nAlthough the joy of victory was unconfined, it was tempered against a background of imminent [[World War II|war with Nazi Germany]]. The [[1939\u201340 in Scottish football|1939\u201340 season]] had hardly begun when war was declared and the Scottish League was suspended, and all players' contracts declared void. After the initial panic, unofficial leagues restarted with an East/West regional split. The geographical separation saw Clyde join the [[Southern Football League (Scotland)|Southern League]] where they finished runners-up and only three points behind eventual champions Rangers during the [[1940\u201341 in Scottish football|1940\u201341 season]]. Clyde performed relatively well during wartime football in both league and cup football.\n\n===1946\u20131969===\nThe team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth [[Scottish Cup]] final in [[1948\u201349 Scottish Cup|1948\u201349]]. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938\u201339, their opponents [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] ran out comfortable 4\u20131 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at [[Hampden Park|Hampden]], with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde's consolation goal.<ref name=1946to1970>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/post-war/ | title=Club History 1946\u20131969 | publisher=Clyde FC | accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s began with relegation from [[Scottish Division One|Division A]] in [[1950\u201351 Scottish Division One|1950\u201351]], returning at the first attempt as [[Scottish Division Two|Division B]] champions in [[1951\u201352 Scottish Division Two|1951\u201352]]. The team repeated the feat in [[1955\u201356 Scottish Division One|1955\u201356]] and [[1956\u201357 Scottish Division Two|1956\u201357]]. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to solid finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in a [[Exhibition match|friendly]] match. Huddersfield won 3\u20132. Cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[1954\u201355 Scottish Cup|1954\u201355]] and [[1957\u201358 Scottish Cup|1957\u201358]] and were beaten semi-finalists in [[1955\u201356 Scottish Cup|1955\u201356]] and [[1959\u201360 Scottish Cup|1959\u201360]]. They also reached [[Scottish League Cup]] semi-finals in [[1956\u201357 Scottish League Cup|1956\u201357]] and [[1957\u201358 Scottish League Cup|1957\u201358]], but lost on both occasions to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\nThe route to the 1954\u201355 Final began with three straight home victories in the competition against [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] (3\u20130), [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] (3\u20131) and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] (5\u20130). [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] provided Clyde's semi-final opponents. After a 2\u20132 draw at [[Easter Road]], a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde into the final. On 23 April 1955 at [[Hampden Park|Hampden]] in front of over 96,000, Celtic, installed as firm favourites, provided the opposition in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live.<ref name=1946to1970/> Without forward [[Billy McPhail]] and goalkeeper [[William Wilson (goalkeeper)|William Wilson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |title=1955 Aberdeen v Clyde SC SF |publisher=QOS FC |accessdate=3 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917025553/http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |archivedate=17 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, [[Albie Murphy|Murphy]] & [[Harry Haddock|Haddock]]; [[Ralph Granville|Granville]], Anderson & [[Davie Laing|Laing]]; [[John Divers (footballer born 1931)|Divers]] & [[Archie Robertson (footballer)|Robertson]]; [[Ally Hill|Hill]]; [[George Brown (footballer born 1928)|Brown]] & [[Tommy Ring|Ring]]. Celtic took the lead in a scrappy match and were three minutes from victory until Archie Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, which was a more open affair. Clyde, with the same line up, won 1\u20130 and their second Scottish Cup with Tommy Ring's second half strike.<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\nBack at Hampden again on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a powerful [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] team, Clyde lined up:- [[Tommy McCulloch (footballer, born 1934)|McCulloch]], [[Albie Murphy|Murphy]] & [[Harry Haddock|Haddock]]; Walters, Finlay & Clinton; [[George Herd|Herd]] & Currie; [[John Coyle|Coyle]]; [[Archie Robertson (footballer)|Robertson]] & [[Tommy Ring|Ring]]. Johnny Coyle's deflected shot in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1\u20130 win and a second Scottish Cup in four seasons and third overall. A fourth-place league finish and a [[Scottish League Cup]] semi-final appearance completed an impressive season in [[1957\u201358 in Scottish football|1957\u201358]].<ref name=1946to1970/> Haddock, Robertson and Coyle were selected in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] [[1958 FIFA World Cup squads#.C2.A0Scotland|Scotland squad]].

It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from [[Football in England|England]], [[Football in France|France]] and [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]], with results aggregated to provide the 'best' League. It proved to be an unpopular format and ended in 1962. For the record, Clyde was drawn against [[RC Lens]] of France and beat them 4\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]]. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in [[1960\u201361 Scottish Division One|1960\u201361]] and [[1962\u201363 Scottish Division One|1962\u201363]] were followed by immediate promotions in [[1961\u201362 Scottish Division Two|1961\u201362]] and [[1963\u201364 Scottish Division Two|1963\u201364]], the former as Division Two champions.<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\nThe [[1966\u201367 in Scottish football|1966\u201367]] season led Clyde to their highest league finish in forty-five years and another Scottish Cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the [[Old Firm]] clubs. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club's fortunes to date, [[UEFA competitions|European football]] will forever love denying itself. The [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow; they were from [[Rutherglen]]. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde's non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the [[Glasgow Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sundaypost.com/opinion/r-i-p-davie-white/|title=R.I.P Davie White - Sunday Post|author=|date=27 July 2013|website=sundaypost.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> Rangers had that position.

It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow's [[slum clearance]] programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], [[Dalmarnock]], [[Gorbals]], [[Oatlands, Glasgow|Oatlands]] and [[Rutherglen]] were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde's core support was drawn from these areas, and many of them have never returned to follow the team.<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\n===1970\u20131993===\nThe club began the 1970s as in previous decades, with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]],who were in dire financial trouble and had resigned from the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]]. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] of [[Scottish Division Two|Division Two]] made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in [[Scottish Division One|Division One]] at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back-door entry into the top division.<ref name=1970to1993>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/changes/ | title=Club History 1970\u20131993 | publisher=Clyde FC | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter relegation in [[1971\u201372 Scottish Division One|1971\u201372]], many club legends such as [[Harry Glasgow]], Sam Hastings, [[Tommy McCulloch (footballer, born 1934)|Tommy McCulloch]], Graham McFarlane and [[Eddie Mulheron]] moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in [[1972\u201373 Scottish Division Two|1972\u201373]]. Two years in the top division until another relegation in [[1974\u201375 Scottish Division One|1974\u201375]] would be their last in the top division to date. The [[Scottish Premier Division|Premier Division]] was introduced ahead of the season [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376]] as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974\u201375 meant Clyde was never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the [[Scottish First Division|First Division]].<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nThe club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] internationalists like [[Steve Archibald]], [[Ian Ferguson (footballer born 1967)|Ian Ferguson]] and [[Pat Nevin]]. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move into freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in [[1975\u201376 Scottish First Division|1975\u201376]], they found themselves in the [[Scottish Second Division|Second Division]], the third tier, for the season [[1976\u201377 Scottish Second Division|1976\u201377]]. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the [[Scottish football league system]]. Towards the end of the season, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] legend [[Billy McNeill]] took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown [[Craig Brown (footballer, born 1940)|Craig Brown]], and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in [[1977\u201378 Scottish Second Division|1977\u201378]].<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nProblems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair, and the grounds were not well maintained. By the late 1970s, Shawfield came into the hands of the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] (GRA). [[Greyhound racing]] had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this, the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nRelegation from the First Division in [[1979\u201380 Scottish First Division|1979\u201380]] was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in [[1981\u201382 Scottish First Division|1981\u201382]]. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a \u00a3500,000 price tag. The club was served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]] provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4\u20132 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill, and there was a sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club was grateful for the use of Firhill, but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nThe 'Gypsy Army' reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club's homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at [[Douglas Park]] with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in [[Cumbernauld]].<ref name=1970to1993/> Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in [[1990\u201391 Scottish First Division|1990\u201391]], was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in [[1992\u201393 Scottish First Division|1992\u201393]] and an immediate relegation in [[1993\u201394 Scottish First Division|1993\u201394]].  However, this continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.\n\n===1994\u2013present===\n\nThe Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and [[Cumbernauld]], with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow new support. A new site called \"[[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]]\" was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing, two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.\n\nThe Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid-season, and former landlords, [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the ''Accies'' 2\u20130.\n\nClyde dropped to the third tier of football, and in 1998 they almost fell into the lowest reaches of Senior football. However, this was enough for the new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald got appointed as manager, having worked at [[Maryhill F.C.|Maryhill Juniors]]. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks, and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion.  Subsequently, Allan Maitland won promotion to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] in 1999.\n\nThe [[2003\u201304 in Scottish football|2003\u201304 season]] saw Clyde atop the League and looking set for the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]]. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde was on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman's fortune was well spent on players' wages, very little else got serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand got built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde's financial plight. Plan B, playing at [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], was investigated.  In the event, a draw with [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] and a home loss to [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.\n\nThe Clyde Supporters' Trust formed during the [[2003\u201304 in Scottish football|2003\u201304 season]]. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely.  The timing of the Trust's formation coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion, and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations, a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors increased the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed, and Clyde was mostly debt free.\n\nIn a season, [[2005\u201306 in Scottish football|2005\u201306]], that saw Clyde lead 2\u20131 from 1\u20130 behind at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in a [[2005\u201306 Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2005/09/20/1513/ | title=Rangers 5\u20132 Clyde (AET) | publisher=Clyde FC | date=20 September 2005 | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> the other half of the [[Old Firm]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] visited Broadwood in the [[Scottish Cup]] on 8 January 2006.

Clyde entered the final game of the season needing to better Morton's result to avoid getting forced into the playoffs. Clyde won their game 3\u20130, but in a cruel twist of fate, Morton won their own game by the same scoreline, sending Clyde into a two-legged play-off with Second Division side [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]]. Clyde lost the first leg 2\u20131 and at 3\u20131 down in the home second leg looked as good as relegated. However, a thrilling fightback saw Clyde level at 5\u20135 on aggregate (4\u20133 on the day) before adding another goal in [[extra time]] to progress. Home and away victories over [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] in the play-off final then secured First Division football at Broadwood for another season.\n\nHowever, the following season Clyde finished bottom of the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] and got relegated to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try and avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first-team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/clyde/8093850.stm|title=Clyde scrap contracts to survive|work=BBC Sport|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The squad for 2009\u201310 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005.

The first of these was [[Barrowfield Park]], situated on the banks of the River Clyde between the Glasgow neighbourhoods of [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] and [[Dalmarnock]].\n\n===Shawfield Stadium===\nBy 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as [[Shawfield Stadium]].\n\nA crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. In 1908, a group of 52,000 gathered for a game against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which remains Clyde's record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association.

In 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium well built in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team.  The new all-seater venue would not be ready until 1994 for Clyde to move to forever.\n\nClyde moved into [[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]] midway through the [[1994\u201395 in Scottish football|1994\u201395]] season. Broadwood has hosted [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland U21]] matches and four [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Scottish Challenge Cup]] finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrie]] for four seasons from 1994\u201398 and [[Rangers F.C.

Matches are normally against the supporter's teams of the opposition facing the first team on the same day. Bully Wee United is unique in most Scottish supporters teams as they operate a strict policy that only Clyde supporters may play for the team. Players must attend a minimum number of Clyde games over a season. Clyde is also represented in the Scottish Central Amateur League by another supporters team named Broadwood Clyde.

Supporters listened to this unfamiliar phrase as \"Bully Wee\", and the name stuck.\n\nFinally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom \"bully\" meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as \"Bully Wee Clyde\", with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.\n\n==Rivalries==\nOriginally from Glasgow, Clyde developed local rivalries with other teams from in and around the city including [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] and [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] and from previous years now-defunct teams like [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]] and [[Third Lanark F.C.|Third Lanark]]. Any game between any of these two would be known as a [[Local derbies in the United Kingdom#Senior football|Glasgow derby]].\n\nIt got well said that Partick Thistle is who the Bully Wee's pivotal derby is within this case. The Clyde vs Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the [[Old Firm]]. However, due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the [[Scottish Premiership]], and Clyde's recent relegations to the lower leagues, such meetings between the two clubs are no longer so common.\n\nIn recent times, the rivalry got intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at [[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]] for five years. The decision to groundshare with Thistle was never really accepted by either Clyde or Thistle supporters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Partick Thistle|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/950-The-five-minute.../2926-partick-thistle|publisher=[[When Saturday Comes]]|date=1 April 2002|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom late 2010 onwards, Clyde has been looking to leave [[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]] for a new home. In early 2012, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said he welcome a deal to see Clyde groundshare at Firhill once more. He said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry and would benefit both clubs. \"I am all for ground-sharing, and Clyde are traditionally a Glasgow club, and the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\".<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419133313/http://www.theglaswegian.co.uk/football/partick-thistle-fc/partick-thistle-news/2012/03/22/firhill-groundshare-would-add-welcome-edge-to-partick-thistle-clyde-rivalry-says-jags-chief-beattie-102692-23797620/|archivedate=19 April 2012|title=Firhill groundshare would add welcome edge to Partick Thistle \u2013 Clyde rivalry, says Jags chief Beattie|url=http://www.theglaswegian.co.uk/football/partick-thistle-fc/partick-thistle-news/2012/03/22/firhill-groundshare-would-add-welcome-edge-to-partick-thistle-clyde-rivalry-says-jags-chief-beattie-102692-23797620/|publisher=theglaswegian.co.uk|date=22 March 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nShortly after [[Jamie Mitchell (footballer)|Jamie Mitchell]] left Clyde for the [[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]] club in 2002, Mitchell stated well into an interview he could not believe the abuse he got for moving clubs and that moving to Thistle made matters worse.

In 1896-97 they reached their first 'major' cup final, the Scottish 2nd XI Cup final eventually losing 4\u20130 to [[Hearts of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]. After reaching the semi-finals again in 1905\u201306, they were thwarted by arch-rivals [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] this time.\n\nThe club first joined the Scottish Reserve League in 1909-10 and found the first few years of competing in the league though. It wasn't until the 1913\u201314 season when they made their mark when they lost 1\u20130 at Hearts in a league decider for the Reserve League title. It meant that the club missed out on a unique [[Double (association football)|League and Cup double]] after they captured the Scottish 2nd XI Cup for the first time that season. They dispatched of [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]  in the final over two legs (1-1 away and 3\u20131 at home). They successfully defended the Scottish 2nd XI Cup the following season when Clyde overcame Falkirk in the final over two legs (2-1 loss away and a 3\u20131 home win).\n\nTheir third and final Scottish 2nd XI Cup triumph came in 1941\u201342. It would be the team's last 'major' cup success for the next sixty-six years. In 1945-46 they reached their last Scottish 2nd XI Cup final losing to Hibs, after a superb 6-2 derby victory over arch-rivals [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] in the semifinals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Second Eleven Cup|url=http://www.scottishleague.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2954|publisher=scottishleague.net|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Scottish Reserve League merged with the [[List of winners of the Scottish Second Division and predecessors|Scottish C Division]] ([[Scottish football league system|third tier]]) for the [[1949\u201350 in Scottish football|1949\u201350]] season creating two regionalised divisions (South/West and North/East) with Clyde entering a reserve team in the South & West region.

Despite successive titles, there was no promotion as only first teams could gain promotion to Division B. As reserve teams got excluded from the [[Scottish League Cup]], the C Division had their League Cup.

The new Reserve League was an exclusively all First Division league (a mirror image of the senior league) and all Second Division clubs' reserve sides got excluded from joining. There were several seasons when not all clubs took part. As for teams who were turned away or excluded from joining, they joined various [[supplementary football leagues|supplementary leagues]] over the next few years.\n\nFor the first few seasons between 1955 and 1960, Clyde regularly finished quite high up the table or at least in a mid-table position. From then onwards in the seasons they spent in the league, the team were often at the wrong end of the table.\n\nIn one of the seasons that Clyde didn't participate in the Reserve League, they joined the [[Combined Reserve Football League|Combined Reserve League]] for a single season in 1961\u201362. Due to the small number of teams involved, the competition got split into an Autumn Series and Spring Series. The club won the Autumn Series and finished second overall in the Combined Table.\n\nJust like Clyde's first team, whose last spell in the Scottish top flight came in 1974\u201375, the same fate happened to their reserve team following a further league restructure at senior and reserve level. The Reserve League set-up changed again in 1975 after a reorganisation of the 'senior' Scottish League into [[Scottish football league system|Premier-First-Second Divisions]]. The new Premier Reserve League was a mirror image of the new [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] in terms of membership. Lower league clubs used varying set-ups such as east\u2013west sections and midweek competitions. In later games, clubs didn't always participate as running a reserve side became expensive.\n\nIt wasn't until season 1979\u201380 when Clyde gained membership to re-enter a reserve team in the Scottish Reserve League.

based in [[Cumbernauld]], [[North Lanarkshire]] who play in [[Scottish League One]]. Formed in 1877 at the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]], since 1994 the team have played their home games at [[Broadwood Stadium]]. Their biggest accomplishment was winning the [[Scottish Cup]] on three occasions: [[1939 Scottish Cup Final|1939]], [[1955 Scottish Cup Final|1955]] and [[1958 Scottish Cup Final|1958]]; they reached the final a further three times, all during a long period based at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]]. They have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1975.\n\n==History==\n===1877\u20131898===\nThe Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the [[River Clyde]] at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the [[Glasgow]] press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.\n\nHere's how the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] recorded Clyde's origins:\n\n{{Quotation|\"Clyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), [[Barrowfield Park]], on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row.\"}}\n\nSitting on the edge of [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile work with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged, it appears the ground consisted of a grandstand running north\u2013south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.\n\nToday this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield got initially shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.\n\nThe club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde's Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.\n\nThe first mention of Clyde was in Monday's [[Evening Times]] of 17 September 1877:\n\n{{Quotation|\"Clyde v T. Lanark\nClyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end, the 3rd were victors by three goals to 1.\"}}\n\nThis concise report was typical at the time as the sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and quoting for the limited column space available.\n\nAlthough most fixtures were informal, the [[Scottish Cup]] had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the [[Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup]] and the [[Glasgow Cup]] which in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] were the visitors once again, and triumphed 1\u20130.\n\nClyde joined the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1891, its second edition. Following acceptance, [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]] provided the opposition for Clyde's first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to the format Clyde triumphed 10\u20133, and a mid-table finish saw the club complete a confident season in League football. While it was an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities, and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League.\n\nThe club endured a terrible [[1897\u201398 in Scottish football|final season]] at Barrowfield, finishing bottom of Division 1 with only 5 points, but remained in the top division. The last action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 30 April 1898, ending in a 3\u20133 draw.<ref>[http://www.thestatcat.co.uk/Match.aspx?MatchID=5419&LU=S&LUID=19 Match Details], TheStatCat</ref>\n\n===1899\u20131919===\nClyde said farewell to Barrowfield in the spring of 1898. Directly across the river between the Glasgow neighbourhood of [[Oatlands, Glasgow|Oatlands]] and the [[Lanarkshire]] town of [[Rutherglen]] lay some open ground known as [[Shawfield]], and Clyde transformed from Brigtonians to Shawfielders. With a new League season only a matter of months away, Clyde had the monumental task of transforming and enclosing the area into a venue suitable for first-class football. The move was primarily financed by the club becoming incorporated and issuing shares in \"The Clyde Football Club Limited\". By the eve of the new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about {{convert|9|acre|ha}}. A grandstand seating 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well underway. The Clyde directors of the time wildly estimated a final capacity of 100,000.\n\n[[File: ClydeFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of historic table positions of Clyde in the League.]]\n[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], the neighbours from up the road, were the inaugural opposition at [[Shawfield Stadium]] on 27 August 1898. A healthy crowd of 10,000 turned up to see a goalless draw and return gate receipts of \u00a3203. The [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899\u20131900]] season ended with another bottom-placed finish, and this time, relegation. By [[1901\u201302 in Scottish football|1901\u201302]],the club had sunk to the bottom of the lower division.\n\nMatters took a turn for the better in the [[1903\u201304 in Scottish football|1903\u201304 season]]. Clyde finished 2nd in Division Two but were not elected to Division One (automatic promotion/relegation did not appear until 1921). They also won a supplementary competition called the [[Glasgow and West of Scotland Football League|Glasgow & West of Scotland League]] the following season. The promotion was again denied in [[1904\u201305 in Scottish football|season 1904\u201305]], with Clyde the Division Two champions, but was finally granted the [[1905\u201306 in Scottish football|following season]]. The years up to [[World War I]] would be far more successful and probably represent the most consistent period of success for the club.\n\nA 3rd place in Division One in [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|season 1908\u201309]], only three points behind champions Celtic, put Clyde firmly on the map of Scottish football. The semi-final of the [[Scottish Cup]] was also reached for the first time only to be thwarted by Celtic after a replay. International honours were also awarded to Clyde players for the first time this season: [[William Walker (footballer, born 1884)|William 'Shoogly' Walker]]  represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] (5\u20130), while the opposition included his team-mate, [[Jack Kirwan]].\n\nFor five seasons until the war began, Clyde was at the top end of Division One and reached the [[Scottish Cup]] final in [[1909\u201310 Scottish Cup#Final|1910]] and [[1911\u201312 Scottish Cup#Final|1912]]. The former of these finals was especially disappointing. For eighty-three minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson & Blair; Walker, [[Tom McAteer|McAteer]] & Robertson; Stirling & McCartney; Chalmers; Jackson & Booth) held a 2\u20130 lead with goals from Chalmers and Booth and looked sure to win. With the Cup in sight, nerves got the better of Clyde and Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his net. Dogged [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] fought all the way and salvaged the game in the last minute with an equaliser from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey an affair and ended goalless after [[extra time]] but with Dundee looking physically stronger. The third game was again a tight affair with Clyde scoring after only three minutes through Chalmers. Dundee equalised before the interval and with Clyde's energy sapped, [[John Hunter (footballer, born 1878)|John \"Sailor\" Hunter]] blasted Dundee to victory.\n\nThe 1912 final saw Celtic trump the ''Bully Wee'' once again with a 2\u20130 victory, another third-place finish in the League being the only consolation. Still undaunted, Clyde reached the semi-final back in 1912\u201313, but the jinx struck again and after a replay [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] squeezed into the final.\n\nClyde had something to cheer about during this period of near misses as they clinched the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in 1910 and the Glasgow Cup in 1915. It is easy to deride these competitions as second rate, but they were fought for just as hard as the Scottish Cup, and indeed all six competitors (Celtic, Clyde, [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and Third Lanark) were more often than not resident in Division One.\n\nA severe blow was dealt in September 1914 as fire destroyed the grandstand, and with it much of the club's early history. Officials, players and fans had little time to dwell upon the calamity as the war began in November. The Scottish League decided to continue playing even though there was intense moral pressure on every young man to sign up for 'King & Country'. Besides, football crowds provided a fertile recruitment ground, and the games themselves kept morale high. Many players joined up \u2013 some never returned, such as C. Clunas (2nd [[Royal Fusiliers]]), T. Cranston ([[Black Watch]] ) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion [[Royal Scots]]) \u2013 and teams like Clyde found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides  and the League eventually reduced back to a single division.\n\n===1920\u20131945===\nClyde managed to sustain football through the difficult war years, and peacetime presented new challenges. The Scottish League continued through [[1919\u201320 in Scottish football|1919\u201321]] with only one division. Division Two was restarted in [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322]] with a very crucial difference: automatic promotion and relegation was adopted, and while the benefits were evident for ambitious teams, the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.\n\nRelegated in 1923\u201324, Clyde spent two seasons in Division Two playing against the likes of [[Armadale F.C.|Armadale]], [[Arthurlie F.C.|Arthurlie]], [[Bathgate F.C.|Bathgate]], [[Bo'ness F.C.|Bo'ness]], [[Broxburn F.C.|Broxburn]], [[King's Park F.C.|king's Park]], [[Nithsdale Wanderers F.C.|Nithsdale Wanderers]] and [[St Bernard's F.C.|St Bernard's]]. Escape via automatic promotion was achieved in the [[1925\u201326 in Scottish football|1925\u201326 season]] and coincided with the demise of Division Three and many of the smaller teams returning to other leagues and Junior football.\n\nThis upswing in Clyde's fortunes was demonstrated by winning the Glasgow Cup for the second time in 1926 with a 2\u20131 victory over Celtic. Now that Clyde was back in the top flight, could they stay there? Until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the answer was a resounding \"yes\" as the club maintained a respectable mid-table status. [[Danny Blair]] was a prominent international full back of this era and [[Billy Boyd (footballer)|Billy Boyd]] became Clyde's top marksman with 32 goals in season 1932\u201333, also earning two international caps.\n\nClyde and financial problems were never far apart, and liquidation was again narrowly averted around 1930. The club needed to find an answer to their money problems, and it lay right in front of them. Greyhound and other animal racing were booming in the late 1920s, and several clubs saw this as a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde. It seemed too good to be accurate, and it proved to be so. Animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was very set against greyhound racing in general.\n\nHowever, Clyde at that time had a very cunning and dogged chairman called John McMahon. He would not let the idea go, and after years of wrangling, a solution has arrived. The Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Limited started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde. Largely financed and owned by Clyde's directors, at a stroke the club had secured its future and found an additional source of revenue. On the other hand, Clyde had sold Shawfield to another party (however close at the time) and would never be able to raise money using the land asset as collateral. Although it would not have repercussions until the 1980s, Clyde were tenants at the mercy of whoever owned Shawfield.\n\nJanuary 1939 saw Clyde at home to [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] in the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup. A 2\u20130 victory sent Clyde on their way. The next tie saw a challenging trip to Dundee, and a goalless draw ensued. Four days later, Clyde squeezed past the [[Dens Park]] men with a 1\u20130 victory. [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] were the formidable 3rd Round opponents. Despite fourteen League titles and six Cup victories between 1920 and 1939, Rangers were no match for the ''Bully Wee'' as they crashed to a 4\u20131 defeat. [[Willie Martin (Scottish footballer)|Willie Martin]], Clyde's prolific centre forward, scored all four goals and set a record for an opposition at Ibrox. Returning to Shawfield for the 4th Round, Clyde narrowly defeated neighbours [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] 1\u20130. Suddenly it was semi-final time once again with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] standing between Clyde and another final. Although disadvantaged by playing the tie in Edinburgh at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]], Clyde again triumphed with a 1\u20130 victory.<ref name=39cup/>\n\n[[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] provided Clyde's opposition on 22 April 1939. They had scored far more goals on the way to [[Hampden Park|Hampden]] and were installed as favourites. Clyde ([[John Brown (footballer born 1915)|Brown]]; Kirk and Hickie; Beaton, [[Eddie Falloon|Falloon]] and [[Ned Weir|Weir]]; Robertson and [[John Gillies (footballer)|Gillies]]; Martin; Noble and [[Dougie Wallace (footballer)|Wallace]]) had other ideas though. Winning the toss and with a strong wind behind them, Motherwell began very strongly and unsettled Clyde with Brown seeing plenty of action. Riding the storm, Clyde settled and scored the vital goal after thirty minutes. Robertson sped down the right and crossed to Wallace. The forward gathered the ball and smashed the ball into the roof of the net. Motherwell replied with more pressure but could not find a goal before the interval. In the second period, Martin quickly doubled Clyde's advantage with an opportunist's strike. The fight went from Motherwell and Clyde scored an extra two in the closing minutes. Motherwell's keeper blocked Noble's first strike at goal, but he swept home the rebound. Barely a minute later Noble supplied a cross for Martin to complete the scoring and seal a 4\u20130 victory. After so many attempts and so much heartache the Cup was finally won.<ref name=39cup>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48328186 Scottish Cup final: 80th anniversary for Clyde side that held the trophy longest], BBC Sport, 27 May 2019</ref>\n\nAlthough the joy of victory was unconfined, it was tempered against a background of imminent [[World War II|war with Nazi Germany]]. The [[1939\u201340 in Scottish football|1939\u201340 season]] had hardly begun when war was declared and the Scottish League was suspended, and all players' contracts declared void. After the initial panic, unofficial leagues restarted with an East/West regional split. The geographical separation saw Clyde join the [[Southern Football League (Scotland)|Southern League]] where they finished runners-up and only three points behind eventual champions Rangers during the [[1940\u201341 in Scottish football|1940\u201341 season]]. Clyde performed relatively well during wartime football in both league and cup football.\n\n===1946\u20131969===\nThe team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth [[Scottish Cup]] final in [[1948\u201349 Scottish Cup|1948\u201349]]. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938\u201339, their opponents [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] ran out comfortable 4\u20131 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at [[Hampden Park|Hampden]], with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde's consolation goal.<ref name=1946to1970>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/post-war/ | title=Club History 1946\u20131969 | publisher=Clyde FC | accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s began with relegation from [[Scottish Division One|Division A]] in [[1950\u201351 Scottish Division One|1950\u201351]], returning at the first attempt as [[Scottish Division Two|Division B]] champions in [[1951\u201352 Scottish Division Two|1951\u201352]]. The team repeated the feat in [[1955\u201356 Scottish Division One|1955\u201356]] and [[1956\u201357 Scottish Division Two|1956\u201357]]. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to solid finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in a [[Exhibition match|friendly]] match. Huddersfield won 3\u20132. Cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[1954\u201355 Scottish Cup|1954\u201355]] and [[1957\u201358 Scottish Cup|1957\u201358]] and were beaten semi-finalists in [[1955\u201356 Scottish Cup|1955\u201356]] and [[1959\u201360 Scottish Cup|1959\u201360]]. They also reached [[Scottish League Cup]] semi-finals in [[1956\u201357 Scottish League Cup|1956\u201357]] and [[1957\u201358 Scottish League Cup|1957\u201358]], but lost on both occasions to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\nThe route to the 1954\u201355 Final began with three straight home victories in the competition against [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] (3\u20130), [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] (3\u20131) and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] (5\u20130). [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] provided Clyde's semi-final opponents. After a 2\u20132 draw at [[Easter Road]], a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde into the final. On 23 April 1955 at [[Hampden Park|Hampden]] in front of over 96,000, Celtic, installed as firm favourites, provided the opposition in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live.<ref name=1946to1970/> Without forward [[Billy McPhail]] and goalkeeper [[William Wilson (goalkeeper)|William Wilson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |title=1955 Aberdeen v Clyde SC SF |publisher=QOS FC |accessdate=3 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917025553/http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |archivedate=17 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, [[Albie Murphy|Murphy]] & [[Harry Haddock|Haddock]]; [[Ralph Granville|Granville]], Anderson & [[Davie Laing|Laing]]; [[John Divers (footballer born 1931)|Divers]] & [[Archie Robertson (footballer)|Robertson]]; [[Ally Hill|Hill]]; [[George Brown (footballer born 1928)|Brown]] & [[Tommy Ring|Ring]]. Celtic took the lead in a scrappy match and were three minutes from victory until Archie Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, which was a more open affair. Clyde, with the same line up, won 1\u20130 and their second Scottish Cup with Tommy Ring's second half strike.<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\nBack at Hampden again on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a powerful [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] team, Clyde lined up:- [[Tommy McCulloch (footballer, born 1934)|McCulloch]], [[Albie Murphy|Murphy]] & [[Harry Haddock|Haddock]]; Walters, Finlay & Clinton; [[George Herd|Herd]] & Currie; [[John Coyle|Coyle]]; [[Archie Robertson (footballer)|Robertson]] & [[Tommy Ring|Ring]]. Johnny Coyle's deflected shot in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1\u20130 win and a second Scottish Cup in four seasons and third overall.

It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from [[Football in England|England]], [[Football in France|France]] and [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]], with results aggregated to provide the 'best' League. It proved to be an unpopular format and ended in 1962. For the record, Clyde was drawn against [[RC Lens]] of France and beat them 4\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]]. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in [[1960\u201361 Scottish Division One|1960\u201361]] and [[1962\u201363 Scottish Division One|1962\u201363]] were followed by immediate promotions in [[1961\u201362 Scottish Division Two|1961\u201362]] and [[1963\u201364 Scottish Division Two|1963\u201364]], the former as Division Two champions.<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\nThe [[1966\u201367 in Scottish football|1966\u201367]] season led Clyde to their highest league finish in forty-five years and another Scottish Cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the [[Old Firm]] clubs. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club's fortunes to date, [[UEFA competitions|European football]] will forever love denying itself. The [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow; they were from [[Rutherglen]]. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde's non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the [[Glasgow Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sundaypost.com/opinion/r-i-p-davie-white/|title=R.I.P Davie White - Sunday Post|author=|date=27 July 2013|website=sundaypost.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> Rangers had that position. Another League Cup semi-final was reached in [[1968\u201369 Scottish League Cup|1968\u201369]].<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\nAs the 1960s came to a close, Clyde was competing rather comfortably in the top division. It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow's [[slum clearance]] programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], [[Dalmarnock]], [[Gorbals]], [[Oatlands, Glasgow|Oatlands]] and [[Rutherglen]] were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde's core support was drawn from these areas, and many of them have never returned to follow the team.<ref name=1946to1970/>\n\n===1970\u20131993===\nThe club began the 1970s as in previous decades, with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]],who were in dire financial trouble and had resigned from the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]]. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] of [[Scottish Division Two|Division Two]] made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in [[Scottish Division One|Division One]] at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back-door entry into the top division.<ref name=1970to1993>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/changes/ | title=Club History 1970\u20131993 | publisher=Clyde FC | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter relegation in [[1971\u201372 Scottish Division One|1971\u201372]], many club legends such as [[Harry Glasgow]], Sam Hastings, [[Tommy McCulloch (footballer, born 1934)|Tommy McCulloch]], Graham McFarlane and [[Eddie Mulheron]] moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in [[1972\u201373 Scottish Division Two|1972\u201373]]. Two years in the top division until another relegation in [[1974\u201375 Scottish Division One|1974\u201375]] would be their last in the top division to date. The [[Scottish Premier Division|Premier Division]] was introduced ahead of the season [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376]] as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974\u201375 meant Clyde was never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the [[Scottish First Division|First Division]].<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nThe club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] internationalists like [[Steve Archibald]], [[Ian Ferguson (footballer born 1967)|Ian Ferguson]] and [[Pat Nevin]]. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move into freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in [[1975\u201376 Scottish First Division|1975\u201376]], they found themselves in the [[Scottish Second Division|Second Division]], the third tier, for the season [[1976\u201377 Scottish Second Division|1976\u201377]]. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the [[Scottish football league system]]. Towards the end of the season, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] legend [[Billy McNeill]] took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown [[Craig Brown (footballer, born 1940)|Craig Brown]], and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in [[1977\u201378 Scottish Second Division|1977\u201378]].<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nProblems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair, and the grounds were not well maintained. By the late 1970s, Shawfield came into the hands of the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] (GRA). [[Greyhound racing]] had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this, the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nRelegation from the First Division in [[1979\u201380 Scottish First Division|1979\u201380]] was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in [[1981\u201382 Scottish First Division|1981\u201382]]. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a \u00a3500,000 price tag. The club was served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]] provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4\u20132 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill, and there was a sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club was grateful for the use of Firhill, but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.<ref name=1970to1993/>\n\nThe 'Gypsy Army' reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club's homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at [[Douglas Park]] with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in [[Cumbernauld]].<ref name=1970to1993/> Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in [[1990\u201391 Scottish First Division|1990\u201391]], was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in [[1992\u201393 Scottish First Division|1992\u201393]] and an immediate relegation in [[1993\u201394 Scottish First Division|1993\u201394]].  However, this continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.\n\n===1994\u2013present===\n\nThe Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and [[Cumbernauld]], with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow new support. A new site called \"[[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]]\" was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing, two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.\n\nThe Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid-season, and former landlords, [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the ''Accies'' 2\u20130.\n\nClyde dropped to the third tier of football, and in 1998 they almost fell into the lowest reaches of Senior football. However, this was enough for the new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald got appointed as manager, having worked at [[Maryhill F.C.|Maryhill Juniors]]. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks, and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion.  Subsequently, Allan Maitland won promotion to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] in 1999.\n\nThe [[2003\u201304 in Scottish football|2003\u201304 season]] saw Clyde atop the League and looking set for the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]]. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde was on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman's fortune was well spent on players' wages, very little else got serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand got built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde's financial plight. Plan B, playing at [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], was investigated.  In the event, a draw with [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] and a home loss to [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.\n\nThe Clyde Supporters' Trust formed during the [[2003\u201304 in Scottish football|2003\u201304 season]]. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely.  The timing of the Trust's formation coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion, and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations, a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors increased the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed, and Clyde was mostly debt free.\n\nIn a season, [[2005\u201306 in Scottish football|2005\u201306]], that saw Clyde lead 2\u20131 from 1\u20130 behind at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in a [[2005\u201306 Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2005/09/20/1513/ | title=Rangers 5\u20132 Clyde (AET) | publisher=Clyde FC | date=20 September 2005 | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> the other half of the [[Old Firm]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] visited Broadwood in the [[Scottish Cup]] on 8 January 2006.

The first of these was [[Barrowfield Park]], situated on the banks of the River Clyde between the Glasgow neighbourhoods of [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] and [[Dalmarnock]].\n\n===Shawfield Stadium===\nBy 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as [[Shawfield Stadium]].\n\nA crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. In 1908, a group of 52,000 gathered for a game against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which remains Clyde's record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association. This arrangement continued satisfactorily for over 50 years until the GRA announced redevelopment plans for the stadium and gave Clyde notice to quit in 1986.\n\n===Broadwood Stadium===\nBroadwood is a football stadium and multi-use community sports complex situated in [[Cumbernauld]], [[North Lanarkshire]], Scotland. In 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium well built in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team.  The new all-seater venue would not be ready until 1994 for Clyde to move to forever.\n\nClyde moved into [[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]] midway through the [[1994\u201395 in Scottish football|1994\u201395]] season. Broadwood has hosted [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland U21]] matches and four [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Scottish Challenge Cup]] finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrie]] for four seasons from 1994\u201398 and [[Rangers F.C. Under-20s and Academy|Rangers reserves]] for a while.\n\nOn 9 December 2010, Clyde had informed their landlords at North Lanarkshire Council (NL Leisure) of their intention to relinquish their lease on Broadwood and move elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/clyde/9276400.stm|title=Clyde planning to leave Broadwood|author=|date=10 December 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Furthermore, on 19 October 2011, Clyde revealed that they were investigating the possibility of a move to [[East Kilbride]], the largest town in Scotland without a senior football team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15378782|title=Clyde investigate move to new stadium in East Kilbride|author=|date=20 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Another option was to move back to Rutherglen and develop the Clyde Gateway Stadium in a ground-sharing agreement.

Supporters listened to this unfamiliar phrase as \"Bully Wee\", and the name stuck.\n\nFinally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom \"bully\" meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as \"Bully Wee Clyde\", with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.\n\n==Rivalries==\nOriginally from Glasgow, Clyde developed local rivalries with other teams from in and around the city including [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] and [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] and from previous years now-defunct teams like [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]] and [[Third Lanark F.C.|Third Lanark]]. Any game between any of these two would be known as a [[Local derbies in the United Kingdom#Senior football|Glasgow derby]].\n\nIt got well said that Partick Thistle is who the Bully Wee's pivotal derby is within this case. The Clyde vs Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the [[Old Firm]]. However, due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the [[Scottish Premiership]], and Clyde's recent relegations to the lower leagues, such meetings between the two clubs are no longer so common.\n\nIn recent times, the rivalry got intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at [[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]] for five years. The decision to groundshare with Thistle was never really accepted by either Clyde or Thistle supporters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Partick Thistle|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/950-The-five-minute.../2926-partick-thistle|publisher=[[When Saturday Comes]]|date=1 April 2002|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom late 2010 onwards, Clyde has been looking to leave [[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]] for a new home. In early 2012, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said he welcome a deal to see Clyde groundshare at Firhill once more. He said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry and would benefit both clubs. \"I am all for ground-sharing, and Clyde are traditionally a Glasgow club, and the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\".<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419133313/http://www.theglaswegian.co.uk/football/partick-thistle-fc/partick-thistle-news/2012/03/22/firhill-groundshare-would-add-welcome-edge-to-partick-thistle-clyde-rivalry-says-jags-chief-beattie-102692-23797620/|archivedate=19 April 2012|title=Firhill groundshare would add welcome edge to Partick Thistle \u2013 Clyde rivalry, says Jags chief Beattie|url=http://www.theglaswegian.co.uk/football/partick-thistle-fc/partick-thistle-news/2012/03/22/firhill-groundshare-would-add-welcome-edge-to-partick-thistle-clyde-rivalry-says-jags-chief-beattie-102692-23797620/|publisher=theglaswegian.co.uk|date=22 March 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nShortly after [[Jamie Mitchell (footballer)|Jamie Mitchell]] left Clyde for the [[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]] club in 2002, Mitchell stated well into an interview he could not believe the abuse he got for moving clubs and that moving to Thistle made matters worse.

In 1896-97 they reached their first 'major' cup final, the Scottish 2nd XI Cup final eventually losing 4-0 to [[Hearts of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]. After reaching the semi-finals again in 1905-06, they were thwarted by arch-rivals [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] this time.\n\nThe club first joined the Scottish Reserve League in 1909-10 and found the first few years of competing in the league though. It wasn't until the 1913-14 season when they made their mark when they lost 1-0 at Hearts in a league decider for the Reserve League title. It meant that the club missed out on a unique [[Double (association football)|League and Cup double]] after they captured the Scottish 2nd XI Cup for the first time that season. They dispatched of [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]  in the final over two legs (1-1 away and 3-1 at home). They successfully defended the Scottish 2nd XI Cup the following season when Clyde overcame Falkirk in the final over two legs (2-1 loss away and a 3-1 home win).\n\nTheir third and final Scottish 2nd XI Cup triumph came in 1941-42. It would be the team's last 'major' cup success for the next sixty-six years. In 1945-46 they reached their last Scottish 2nd XI Cup final losing to Hibs, after a superb 6-2 derby victory over arch-rivals [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] in the semifinals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Second Eleven Cup|url=http://www.scottishleague.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2954|publisher=scottishleague.net|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Scottish Reserve League merged with the [[List of winners of the Scottish Second Division and predecessors|Scottish C Division]] ([[Scottish football league system|third tier]]) for the [[1949\u201350 in Scottish football|1949\u201350]] season creating two regionalised divisions (South/West and North/East) with Clyde entering a reserve team in the South & West region. The club was crowned champions in [[1949\u201350 in Scottish football|1949\u201350]] and they retained their title in [[1950\u201351 in Scottish football|1950\u201351]]. Despite successive titles, there was no promotion as only first teams could gain promotion to Division B. As reserve teams got excluded from the [[Scottish League Cup]], the C Division had their League Cup. Clyde couldn't quite match the success in the cup that they had in the league as they never won the competition. The best they could manage were semi-final appearances in 1951-52<ref>{{cite web|title=C Division & League Cup, dates results & final tables 1951-52|url=http://scottish-football-historical-archive.com/cdiv5152.htm|publisher=Scottish-Football-Historical-Archives|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> and in 1953-54.<ref>{{cite web|title=C Division & League Cup, dates results & final tables 1953-54|url=http://scottish-football-historical-archive.com/cdiv5354.htm|publisher=Scottish-Football-Historical-Archives|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n====League restructuring====\nAfter both regional C Divisions got scrapped in June 1955, a new Scottish Reserve League started up. The new Reserve League was an exclusively all First Division league (a mirror image of the senior league) and all Second Division clubs' reserve sides got excluded from joining. There were several seasons when not all clubs took part. As for teams who were turned away or excluded from joining, they joined various [[supplementary football leagues|supplementary leagues]] over the next few years.\n\nFor the first few seasons between 1955 and 1960, Clyde regularly finished quite high up the table or at least in a mid-table position. From then onwards in the seasons they spent in the league, the team were often at the wrong end of the table.\n\nIn one of the seasons that Clyde didn't participate in the Reserve League, they joined the [[Combined Reserve Football League|Combined Reserve League]] for a single season in 1961\u201362. Due to the small number of teams involved, the competition got split into an Autumn Series and Spring Series. The club won the Autumn Series and finished second overall in the Combined Table.\n\nJust like Clyde's first team, whose last spell in the Scottish top flight came in 1974\u201375, the same fate happened to their reserve team following a further league restructure at senior and reserve level. The Reserve League set-up changed again in 1975 after a reorganisation of the 'senior' Scottish League into [[Scottish football league system|Premier-First-Second Divisions]]. The new Premier Reserve League was a mirror image of the new [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] in terms of membership. Lower league clubs used varying set-ups such as East-West sections and midweek competitions. In later games, clubs didn't always participate as running a reserve side became expensive.\n\nIt wasn't until season 1979\u201380 when Clyde gained membership to re-enter a reserve team in the Scottish Reserve League. They got placed in the regional West division. Finishing bottom in their first season, it was a further two seasons before they returned. They fared much better during the 1987\u201388 season when they won the division. It proved to be a one-off, though. Season 2000\u201301 was Clyde's last in the West Reserves League eventually before all reserves leagues got scrapped after season 2007\u201308.\n\n===Youth teams===\nClyde ran youth teams at under-20, under-17, under-15, under-14, under-13, under-12 and under-11 level.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.clydefc.co.uk/youth/|title = Youth Development|publisher = Clyde FC|accessdate = 30 July 2015}}</ref> There was an under-18 team until 2003, when it made way for under-17 and under-19 teams.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2003/07/19/627/|title=Youth Team News|publisher=Clyde FC|date=19 July 2003|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> The under-20 team replaced the under-19 team in 2014.

The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate [[Henry Hill]] and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980.\n\nScorsese initially titled the film ''Wise Guy'' and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi changed the title to ''Goodfellas''. To prepare for their roles in the film, [[Robert De Niro]], [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Ray Liotta]] often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.\n\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 9, 1990, where Scorsese was awarded with [[Silver Lion]] for Best Director, and was released in the United States on September 19, 1990. The film was made on a budget of $25 million, and grossed $46.8 million. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career\". The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], with Pesci winning for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film won five awards from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]]. Additionally, ''Goodfellas'' was named the year's best film by various critics' groups.\n\n''Goodfellas'' is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the gangster genre. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the United States [[Library of Congress]]. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television series.<ref>{{cite news |last=Merrie |first=Stephanie |title='Goodfellas' is 25.

He begins working for local ''[[caporegime]]'' Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero and his associates: James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Conway, an Irish truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. The three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]] carousing with women. Henry starts dating [[Karen Friedman Hill|Karen Friedman]], a Jewish woman. She is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities but is eventually seduced by his glamorous lifestyle. She marries him, despite her parents' disapproval.\n\nIn 1970, [[William Bentvena|Billy Batts]], a [[made man]] in the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino crew]] who was recently released from prison, repeatedly insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry. This provoked his murder by Tommy and Jimmy. The unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy cover up the murder by burying the body in Upstate New York. Six months later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing corpse.\n\nIn 1974, Karen harasses Henry's mistress Janice and holds Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison sentences. In order to support his family on the outside, Henry has drugs smuggled in by Karen and sells them to a fellow inmate from [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1978, Henry is paroled and expands this cocaine business against Paulie's orders, soon involving Jimmy and Tommy.\n\nJimmy organizes a crew to raid the [[Lufthansa heist|Lufthansa vault]] at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], stealing several millions in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew murdered. In his [[Voice-over|voiceover]] narration, as dead bodies are being discovered all over the city, Henry theorizes that Jimmy would have killed them anyway rather than share the profits of the heist. Tommy and Henry are spared by Jimmy. Tommy, however, is later led to believe that he is to become a made man, but is ultimately shot dead on the way to the ceremony in retribution for Batts' murder.\n\nBy 1980, Henry has become a nervous wreck from cocaine use and insomnia. He sets up a drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but is arrested by narcotics agents, and jailed. After bailing him out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them virtually penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends their association. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request makes him suspicious. Henry realizes that Jimmy plans to have him and Karen killed, prompting his decision to become an [[informant]] and enroll, with his family, in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]]. He gives sufficient testimony to have Paulie and Jimmy arrested and convicted. Henry is grateful to be alive, but he is forced out of his gangster life and has to readjust to normal life once again; he narrates, \"I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a [[schnook]].\"\n\nThe end title cards state that Henry is still a protected witness as of 1990, but that he was arrested in 1987 in [[Seattle]] for narcotics conspiracy, receiving five years' probation. He has been clean since then. He and Karen separated in 1989 after 25 years of marriage, while Paulie died the previous year in [[Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth|Fort Worth Federal Prison]] at age 73 from respiratory illness. Jimmy is serving a 20 years to life sentence in a New York prison for murder, in which he will be paroled in 2004, when he will be 78 years old.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Please do not add real life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.

He was drawn to the documentary aspects of Pileggi's book. \"The book [''Wiseguy''] gives you a sense of the day-to-day life, the tedium, how they work, how they take over certain nightclubs, and for what reasons.

The filmmaker stated, \"[I] wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [Henry's] last day as a wiseguy, it's as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out.\"<ref name=\"Murphy, Kathleen\" /> He added that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of ''[[Jules and Jim]]'' (1962): extensive narration, quick edits, [[Freeze-frame shot|freeze frames]], and multiple locale switches.<ref name=Clark /> It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, \"So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?\u2014That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show.\"<ref name=Clark /> He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information.<ref name=Thompson /> He also put plenty of detail in every frame because he believed the gangster life is so rich. Freeze frames were used as Scorsese wanted images that stopped \"because a point was being reached\" in Henry's life.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n[[Joe Pesci]] did not judge his character but found the scene where he kills Spider for talking back to his character hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until he forced himself to feel the way Tommy did.<ref name=Linfield /> Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her \"work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor.\"<ref name=Linfield /> When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nAccording to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.<ref name=Arnold /> For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him\u2014the \"Funny how? Do I amuse you?\" scene\u2014is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced.

It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday.\" The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy, about which Scorsese said, \"I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do\u2014and maybe with the system which allows this.\"<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nScorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, \"cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental.\"<ref name=\"Goodwin, Richard\" /> However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].<ref name=Gilbert /> With a budget of $25 million, ''Goodfellas'' was Scorsese's most expensive film to that point but still only a medium-sized budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California, and a lot of audiences were \"agitated\" by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence. Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese and the film's editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes.<ref name=Kaplan /> One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the \"Do I amuse you?\" scene.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Main|Goodfellas (soundtrack)}}\nWhile there is no incidental score as such in the film, Scorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters.<ref name=Gilbert /> In a given scene, he only used music contemporary to or older than the scene's setting.

The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate [[Henry Hill]] and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980.\n\nScorsese initially titled the film ''Wise Guy'' and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi changed the title to ''Goodfellas''. To prepare for their roles in the film, [[Robert De Niro]], [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Ray Liotta]] often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.\n\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 9, 1990, where Scorsese was awarded with [[Silver Lion]] for Best Director, and was released in the United States on September 19, 1990. The film was made on a budget of $25 million, and grossed $46.8 million. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career\". The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], with Pesci winning for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film won five awards from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]]. Additionally, ''Goodfellas'' was named the year's best film by various critics' groups.\n\n''Goodfellas'' is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the gangster genre. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the United States [[Library of Congress]]. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television series.<ref>{{cite news |last=Merrie |first=Stephanie |title='Goodfellas' is 25.

He begins working for local ''[[caporegime]]'' Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero and his associates: James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Conway, an Irish truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. The three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]] carousing with women. Henry starts dating [[Karen Friedman Hill|Karen Friedman]], a Jewish woman. She is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities but is eventually seduced by his glamorous lifestyle. She marries him, despite her parents' disapproval.\n\nIn 1970, [[William Bentvena|Billy Batts]], a [[made man]] in the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino crew]] who was recently released from prison, repeatedly insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry. This provoked his murder by Tommy and Jimmy. The unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy cover up the murder by burying the body in Upstate New York. Six months later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing corpse.\n\nIn 1974, Karen harasses Henry's mistress Janice and holds Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison sentences. In order to support his family on the outside, Henry has drugs smuggled in by Karen and sells them to a fellow inmate from [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1978, Henry is paroled and expands this cocaine business against Paulie's orders, soon involving Jimmy and Tommy.\n\nJimmy organizes a crew to raid the [[Lufthansa heist|Lufthansa vault]] at the [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], stealing several millions in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew murdered. In his [[Voice-over|voiceover]] narration, as dead bodies are being discovered all over the city, Henry theorizes that Jimmy would have killed them anyway rather than share the profits of the heist. Tommy and Henry are spared by Jimmy. Tommy, however, is later led to believe that he is to become a made man, but is ultimately shot dead on the way to the ceremony in retribution for Batts' murder.\n\nBy 1980, Henry has become a nervous wreck from cocaine use and insomnia. He sets up a drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but is arrested by narcotics agents, and jailed. After bailing him out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them virtually penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends their association. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner and is asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request makes him suspicious. Henry realizes that Jimmy plans to have him and Karen killed, prompting his decision to become an [[informant]] and enroll, with his family, in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]]. He gives sufficient testimony to have Paulie and Jimmy arrested and convicted. Henry is grateful to be alive, but he is forced out of his gangster life and has to readjust to normal life once again; he narrates, \"I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a [[schnook]].\"\n\nThe end title cards state that Henry is still a protected witness as of 1990, but that he was arrested in 1987 in [[Seattle]] for narcotics conspiracy, receiving five years' probation. He has been clean since then. He and Karen separated in 1989 after 25 years of marriage, while Paulie died the previous year in [[Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth|Fort Worth Federal Prison]] at age 73 from respiratory illness. Jimmy is serving a 20 years to life sentence in a New York prison for murder, in which he will be paroled in 2004, when he will be 78 years old.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Please do not add real life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.

She decided not to meet the real Karen, saying she \"thought it would be better if the creation came from me. I used her life with her parents as an emotional guideline for the role.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Witchel |first=Alex |title=A Mafia Wife Makes Lorraine Bracco a Princess |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 27, 1990}}</ref> [[Paul Sorvino]] had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character, but found it challenging finding what he called \"that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to my nature except when my family is threatened.\"<ref name=\"Van Gelder\">{{cite news |last=Van Gelder |first=Lawrence |title=At the Movies |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 12, 1990}}</ref>\n\n=== Photography ===\nThe film was shot on location in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York state]], [[New Jersey]], and parts of [[Long Island]] during the spring and summer of 1989, with a budget of $25 million.<ref name=\"Hughes pp176-177\" /> Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and [[storyboard]]ed everything because of the complicated style throughout. The filmmaker stated, \"[I] wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [Henry's] last day as a wiseguy, it's as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out.\"<ref name=\"Murphy, Kathleen\" /> He added that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of ''[[Jules and Jim]]'' (1962): extensive narration, quick edits, [[Freeze-frame shot|freeze frames]], and multiple locale switches.<ref name=Clark /> It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, \"So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?\u2014That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show.\"<ref name=Clark /> He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information.<ref name=Thompson /> He also put plenty of detail in every frame because he believed the gangster life is so rich. Freeze frames were used as Scorsese wanted images that stopped \"because a point was being reached\" in Henry's life.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n[[Joe Pesci]] did not judge his character but found the scene where he kills Spider for talking back to his character hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until he forced himself to feel the way Tommy did.<ref name=Linfield /> Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her \"work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor.\"<ref name=Linfield /> When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nAccording to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.<ref name=Arnold /> For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him\u2014the \"Funny how? Do I amuse you?\" scene\u2014is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced. Pesci was working as a waiter when he thought he was making a compliment to a mobster by saying he was \"funny\", however, the comment was not taken well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/goodfellas-joe-pesci-funny-how-scene-2015-5?r=US&IR=T|title=One of the most famous scenes in 'Goodfellas' is based on something that actually happened to Joe Pesci|publisher=businessinsider.com|date=May 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies: Featuring the 100 Greatest Gangster Films of All Time|author1=George Anastasia|author2=Glen Macnow|publisher=Running Press|year=2011|ISBN= 9780762441549|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kY5tHAksa7kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ultimate+Book+of+Gangster+Movies:+Featuring+the+100+Greatest+Gangster+Films+of+All+Time&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivn5yd04HnAhUBUt8KHbkeAGkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=funny&f=false}}</ref> It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script.<ref name=Kaplan>{{cite video |people=Kaplan, Jonah (writer and editor); Stephen Altobellow and Jeffrey Schwartz (producers) |date=2004 |format=Blu-ray Disc |title=Getting Made: The Making of ''Goodfellas'' |work=Goodfellas |publisher=[[Warner Home Video]] |isbn=1-4198-4306-0}}</ref> The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised.

Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nThe long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way, and this forced them to go round the back.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry's entire life was ahead of him, commenting, \"It's his seduction of her [Karen] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him.\"<ref name=Thompson /> This sequence was shot eight times.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\nHenry's last day as a wiseguy was the hardest part of the film for Scorsese to shoot, because he wanted to properly show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia, and racing thoughts caused by [[cocaine]] and [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] intoxication.<ref name=Thompson /> In an interview with movie critic [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]], Scorsese explained the reason for Pesci shooting at the camera at the end of the film, \"well that's a reference right to the end of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', that's the way that ends, that film, and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to ''The Great Train Robbery''. It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday.\" The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy, about which Scorsese said, \"I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do\u2014and maybe with the system which allows this.\"<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nScorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, \"cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental.\"<ref name=\"Goodwin, Richard\" /> However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].<ref name=Gilbert /> With a budget of $25 million, ''Goodfellas'' was Scorsese's most expensive film to that point but still only a medium-sized budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California, and a lot of audiences were \"agitated\" by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence. Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese and the film's editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes.<ref name=Kaplan /> One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the \"Do I amuse you?\" scene.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Main|Goodfellas (soundtrack)}}\nWhile there is no incidental score as such in the film, Scorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters.<ref name=Gilbert /> In a given scene, he only used music contemporary to or older than the scene's setting. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \"[[Layla]]\" (1970) playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car, dumpster, and meat truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.<ref name=Thompson /> Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script, while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\n== Release ==\n===Theatrical===\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]], where Scorsese received the [[Silver Lion]] award for [[Silver Lion#Silver Lion for Best Direction|best director]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Malcolm |first=Derek |title=The Venice Film Festival ends in uproar |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 17, 1990}}</ref> It was given a wide release in North America on September 21, 1990.\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Goodfellas'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] in March 1997, in a single-disc, double-sided, single-layer format that requires the disc to be flipped during viewing; in 2004, [[Warner Home Video]] released a two-disc, dual-layer version, with [[remaster]]ed picture and sound, and bonus materials such as [[Audio commentary|commentary tracks]].<ref name=\"homevihist\" /> In early 2007 the film became available on single [[Blu-ray]] with all the features from the 2004 release; an expanded Blu-ray version was released in February 2010, bundled with a disc with features that include the 2008 documentary ''Public Enemies: The Golden Age of the Gangster Film.''<ref name=\"homevihist\">{{cite web |url=http://news.moviefone.com/2010/02/10/making-the-up-grade-goodfellas/ |title=Making The (Up) Grade: ''Goodfellas'' |date=February 10, 2010 |first=Todd |last=Gilchrist |publisher=[[Moviefone]] |accessdate=August 27, 2014 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140827133312/http://news.moviefone.com/2010/02/10/making-the-up-grade-goodfellas/ | archive-date= August 27, 2014 | url-status= dead}}</ref> The film was released on 4K [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on December 6, 2016.<ref>{{Citation |title=GoodFellas 4K Blu-ray |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/GoodFellas-4K-Blu-ray/161258/ |accessdate=January 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201020210/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/GoodFellas-4K-Blu-ray/161258/|archive-date=February 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Goodfellas'' opened in 1,070 theaters, with an opening weekend gross of [[United States dollar|US$]]6.3 million.

According to its website, NRMA Insurance Group Limited changed its name to Insurance Australia Group Limited on 15 January 2002.  IAG is the name of the listed entity; it is not a customer-facing brand, however it represents the [[umbrella organization]] that holds many well known insurance brands.\n\nIAG is listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[S&P/ASX 50]] index.\n\n==Operations==\nInsurance Australia Group has operations in Australia and New Zealand and a presence in five countries in Asia.

This proposal was rejected by the IAG board the next day. QBE responded by increasing its proposal to 0.142 QBE shares plus 70 cents per IAG share. On 14 April 2008, IAG also rejected this proposal. On 16 May 2008, QBE increased its proposal to 0.145 QBE shares plus 90 cents per IAG share (an effective value of $4.60 per IAG share at the time). This was rejected by IAG four days later and on 21 May 2008 QBE confirmed talks had collapsed and withdrew its proposal.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Public offers and proposals (FAQ)  | publisher = IAG  | url = http://www.iag.com.au/shareholder/offers/index.shtml  | accessdate = 8 February 2008  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216004036/http://www.iag.com.au/shareholder/offers/index.shtml  | archivedate = 16 February 2008  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref>\n\nImportant items that were considered when QBE made its proposal :\nIAG's short tail personal insurance products are distributed in Victoria under the RACV brand, via a distribution relationship and underwriting joint venture with RACV Limited. These products are distributed by RACV and manufactured by Insurance Manufacturers of Australia Pty Limited (IMA), which is 70% owned by IAG and 30% by RACV. If one of IMA's shareholders were to experience a change of control, the other has a pre-emptive right to acquire that shareholder's interest in IMA at market value. The duration of the arrangements governing RACV's distribution of RACV-branded products in Victoria would be a relevant factor in determining this market value (as would the duration of the arrangements governing IMA's reinsurance of NRMA-branded products in NSW and the ACT).\n\nOn 16 December 2013 IAG announced that it had agreed to purchase Wesfarmers Insurance underwriting businesses. The acquisition comprises companies trading under the WFI and Lumley brands, as well as a ten-year distribution agreement with Coles.\n\nIn 2015, IAG share price has fallen 9% since it reported its interim result.

According to its website, NRMA Insurance Group Limited changed its name to Insurance Australia Group Limited on 15 January 2002.  IAG is the name of the listed entity; it is not a customer-facing brand, however it represents the [[umbrella organization]] that holds many well known insurance brands.\n\nIAG is listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[S&P/ASX 50]] index.\n\n==Operations==\nInsurance Australia Group has operations in Australia and New Zealand and a presence in five countries in Asia. Its businesses include:\n\n===Australia===\n*[[NRMA Insurance]]\n*[[State Government Insurance Office (Western Australia)|SGIO]], acquired in 1998\n*[[SGIC]], acquired in 1998\n*[[CGU Insurance]], acquired in 2003\n* [https://www.swanninsurance.com.au/home/ Swann Insurance], acquired in 2003\n* WFI, acquired in 2014\n\nIAG has a 70% shareholding in Insurance Manufacturers of Australia Pty Limited (the other 30% being held by [[Royal Automobile Club of Victoria|RACV]]), which issues insurance under the RACV Insurance name that is sold by RACV in Victoria.\n\nIn 2014, IAG signed a ten-year agreement to distribute home and car policies for Coles Insurance.\n\n===New Zealand===\n*[[State Insurance]], acquired in 2001\n*[[NZI|NZI (New Zealand Insurance)]], acquired in 2003\n*[[AMI Insurance]], acquired in 2012\n*Lumley, acquired in 2014 \n*[[Lantern Insurance]]\n\n===Asia===\n*Thailand - IAG holds a 98.6% beneficial interest in Safety Insurance, based in Thailand, which trades under the Safety and NZI brands\n*Malaysia - IAG owns 49% of the general insurance arm of Malaysian-based AmBank Group, AmGeneral Holdings Berhad, which trades under the AmAssurance and Kurnia brands\n*India - IAG owns 26% of SBI General Insurance Company, a joint venture with [[State Bank of India]], India's largest and most recognised financial services organisation\n*Vietnam - IAG owns 63.17% of AAA Assurance Corporation \n*Indonesia - IAG owns 80% of PT Asuransi Parolamas\n\n==Recent news==\nIn 2004, speculation emerged that IAG would merge with Australia's then largest insurer [[QBE Insurance]] however IAG denied the merger at the time.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Hoyle  | first = Simon  | title = Insurance duo tipped to tie the knot  | publisher = The Age  | date = 6 October 2004  | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/05/1096949514339.html}}</ref> Speculation again emerged in 2006 only to be again denied.<ref>{{cite news  | title = QBE, IAG hose down takeover rumour  | publisher = The Age  | date = 13 January 2006  | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/Business/QBE-IAG-hose-down-takeover-rumour/2006/01/13/1137118962951.html}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April 2008, QBE proposed a takeover with each IAG share being exchanged for 0.135 QBE shares plus 50 cents cash (an effective value of $3.75 per IAG share at the time). This proposal was rejected by the IAG board the next day. QBE responded by increasing its proposal to 0.142 QBE shares plus 70 cents per IAG share. On 14 April 2008, IAG also rejected this proposal. On 16 May 2008, QBE increased its proposal to 0.145 QBE shares plus 90 cents per IAG share (an effective value of $4.60 per IAG share at the time). This was rejected by IAG four days later and on 21 May 2008 QBE confirmed talks had collapsed and withdrew its proposal.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Public offers and proposals (FAQ)  | publisher = IAG  | url = http://www.iag.com.au/shareholder/offers/index.shtml  | accessdate = 8 February 2008  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216004036/http://www.iag.com.au/shareholder/offers/index.shtml  | archivedate = 16 February 2008  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref>\n\nImportant items that were considered when QBE made its proposal :\nIAG's short tail personal insurance products are distributed in Victoria under the RACV brand, via a distribution relationship and underwriting joint venture with RACV Limited. These products are distributed by RACV and manufactured by Insurance Manufacturers of Australia Pty Limited (IMA), which is 70% owned by IAG and 30% by RACV. If one of IMA's shareholders were to experience a change of control, the other has a pre-emptive right to acquire that shareholder's interest in IMA at market value. The duration of the arrangements governing RACV's distribution of RACV-branded products in Victoria would be a relevant factor in determining this market value (as would the duration of the arrangements governing IMA's reinsurance of NRMA-branded products in NSW and the ACT).\n\nOn 16 December 2013 IAG announced that it had agreed to purchase Wesfarmers Insurance underwriting businesses. The acquisition comprises companies trading under the WFI and Lumley brands, as well as a ten-year distribution agreement with Coles.\n\nIn 2015, IAG share price has fallen 9% since it reported its interim result. The insurer's net profit for the six months to December fell 10% to $579m due to intensifying competition and a jump in natural disaster claims. Disaster claims of $421m exceeded the company's expectations by $71m, mainly on account of $165m in claims following Brisbane's November hail storm \u2013 the worst seen in 30 years.\n\nIAG's New Zealand business delivered a 26% rise in gross written premiums, though entirely on account of adding Wesfarmers' NZ-based operations.

Monteith asked for some changes to the text and the novel was published in September 1954 as ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.\n\nAfter moving in 1958 from [[Salisbury]] to nearby [[Bowerchalke]], he met his fellow villager and walking companion [[James Lovelock]]. The two discussed Lovelock's [[Gaia Hypothesis|hypothesis]], that the living matter of the planet Earth functions like a single organism, and Golding suggested naming this hypothesis after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Titan of the earth in Greek mythology.<ref name=\"ecolo.org\">James Lovelock, \u2018What is Gaia?\u2019, [http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/what_is_Gaia.html accessed 16 May 2013]</ref> His publishing success made it possible for Golding to resign his teaching post at Bishop Wordsworth's School in 1961, and he spent that academic year in the United States as writer-in-residence at [[Hollins University|Hollins College]], near [[Roanoke, Virginia]].\n\nGolding won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' in 1979, and the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] for ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' in 1980. In 1983 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], and was according to the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' \"an unexpected and even contentious choice\".<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn 1988 Golding was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=51558 |date=13 December 1988 |page=13986 }}</ref> In September 1993, only a few months after his sudden death, the First International William Golding Conference was held in France, where Golding's presence had been promised and was eagerly expected.<ref>F.

''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955) shows \"new people\" (generally identified with ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with [[Neanderthals]]) by deceit and violence. His 1956 novel ''[[Pincher Martin]]'' records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. ''[[Free Fall (Golding novel)|Free Fall]]'' (1959) explores the issue of free choice as a prisoner held in solitary confinement in a German POW camp during World War Two looks back over his life. ''[[The Spire]]'' (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be [[Salisbury Cathedral]]); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity.\n\nIn his 1967 novel ''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' three separate stories in a shared setting (a small English town in the 1920s) are linked by a narrator, and ''The Scorpion God'' (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band ('Clonk, Clonk'), the second in an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God') and the third in the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary').

His book, however, was championed by Charles Monteith, a new editor at the firm. Monteith asked for some changes to the text and the novel was published in September 1954 as ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.\n\nAfter moving in 1958 from [[Salisbury]] to nearby [[Bowerchalke]], he met his fellow villager and walking companion [[James Lovelock]]. The two discussed Lovelock's [[Gaia Hypothesis|hypothesis]], that the living matter of the planet Earth functions like a single organism, and Golding suggested naming this hypothesis after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Titan of the earth in Greek mythology.<ref name=\"ecolo.org\">James Lovelock, \u2018What is Gaia?\u2019, [http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/what_is_Gaia.html accessed 16 May 2013]</ref> His publishing success made it possible for Golding to resign his teaching post at Bishop Wordsworth's School in 1961, and he spent that academic year in the United States as writer-in-residence at [[Hollins University|Hollins College]], near [[Roanoke, Virginia]].\n\nGolding won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' in 1979, and the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] for ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' in 1980.

''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955) shows \"new people\" (generally identified with ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with [[Neanderthals]]) by deceit and violence. His 1956 novel ''[[Pincher Martin]]'' records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. ''[[Free Fall (Golding novel)|Free Fall]]'' (1959) explores the issue of free choice as a prisoner held in solitary confinement in a German POW camp during World War Two looks back over his life. ''[[The Spire]]'' (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be [[Salisbury Cathedral]]); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity.\n\nIn his 1967 novel ''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' three separate stories in a shared setting (a small English town in the 1920s) are linked by a narrator, and ''The Scorpion God'' (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band ('Clonk, Clonk'), the second in an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God') and the third in the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary'). The last of these reworks his 1958 play ''The Brass Butterfly''. His later novels include ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979), which is about a terrorist group, a paedophile teacher, and a mysterious angel-like figure who survives a fire in [[the Blitz]], ''[[The Paper Men]]'' (1984) which is about the conflict between a writer and his biographer, and a sea trilogy ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]'', which includes ''Rites of Passage'' (1980), ''Close Quarters'' (1987), and ''Fire Down Below'' (1989), the first book of which (originally intended as a stand-alone novel) won the [[Booker Prize]].\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''[[Poems (poetry by Golding)|Poems]]'' (1934)\n\n===Drama===\n*''The Brass Butterfly''  (1958)\n\n===Novels===\n*''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954) \n*''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955)\n*''[[Pincher Martin]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Free Fall (Golding)|Free Fall]]'' (1959)\n*''[[The Spire]]'' (1964)\n*''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' (1967)\n*''The Scorpion God''   (1971)\n*''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979)\n*''[[The Paper Men]] (1984)\n*''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]'' (trilogy)\n**''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1980)\n**''[[Close Quarters (Golding)|Close Quarters]]'' (1987)\n**''[[Fire Down Below (novel)|Fire Down Below]]'' (1989)\n*''[[The Double Tongue]]'' (posthumous publication 1995)<ref>''The Double Tongue'' 1996 Faber reprint {{ISBN|978-0-571-17720-2}}</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''[[The Hot Gates]]''  (1965)\n*''[[A Moving Target]]''  (1982)\n*''An Egyptian Journal'' (1985)\n\n===Unpublished works===\n*''Seahorse'' was written in 1948.
