Two ordinary players were defeated brutally last week and final score was 13-4. Mr. Hussnain is a genius of this game, \"A True Master Blaster\". Those 2 domestic players were very slow throughout the  game whilst taking their turns. They were unable to handle any pressure when playing against international players. Khurram has been getting extra pressure from in-laws in the shape of regular calls from Aunty. Guinness book of world record has nominated Hussnain and Khurram as Players of the Century. They will be traveling to New York next month to get their 56th international award.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.leg.state.mn.us/archive/LegDB/Articles/10559SessWeeklyProfile.pdf|last=Compton|first=Steve|date=7 February 1997|title=Reuter not playing games with fiscal restraint|newspaper=Session Weekly|location=St. Paul, MN|publisher=Minnesota House of Representatives Information Office|pages=13|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2375/sequence|title=Sequence|publisher=Game Board Geek|accessdate=6 Aug 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Objective==\nThe object of the game is to form rows of five [[Casino token|poker chips]] on the board by placing the chips on the board spaces corresponding to cards played from the player's hand.\n\n==Equipment==\nPlaying Board {{convert|19+3/4|x|15+1/4|in|mm}}; Instructions; 135 poker chips (50 blue, 50 green, 35 red); two full standard card decks (52 cards each, 104 cards total).\n\n==Game rules==\nSequence can be played with two to 12 players. More than 12 players cannot play. If more than three people are playing, they should divide evenly into two or three teams. With two teams, players alternate their physical positions with opponents around the playing surface. With three teams, players of a team must be positioned at every third player around the playing surface.\n\nIf the player who played first wins and the second player wins in the next turn it\u2019s a tie.\n\nThe game board is placed on a flat surface (such as the floor or a table) with enough room to allow for the draw deck, a discard pile and marker chips. The [[Joker (playing card)|jokers]], if any, are removed from the deck as they are not used in the game.\n\nTo decide who goes first, one player shuffles the card decks into one stack. Each player takes a card from the deck. The player with the lowest card will deal, and the cards are shuffled again. Each player or team then chooses a set of poker chips; all members of each team must use the same color chips (red is only used if there are three teams).\n\nThe number of cards dealt to each player varies by the number of people playing:\n* Two Players: Seven cards each\n* Three Players: Six cards each\n* Four Players: Six cards each\n* Six Players: Five cards each\n* Eight Players: Four cards each\n* Nine Players: Four cards each\n* Ten Players: Three cards each\n* Twelve Players: Three cards each.\n\nEach card is pictured twice on the game board, and Jacks (while necessary for game strategy) do not appear on the board.\n\nThe player to the left of the [[Croupier|dealer]] goes first.\n\nThe player chooses a card from their hand, and places a chip on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: they choose Ace of Diamonds from their hand and place a chip on the Ace of Diamonds on the board). Jacks are wild. Two-Eyed Jacks can represent any card and may be used to place a chip on any space on the board. One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent's token from a space. Players may use the Two-Eyed Jacks to complete a row or block an opponent, and One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent's advantage. One-Eyed Jacks cannot be used to remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed sequence; once a sequence is achieved by a player or team, it stands. Once a Jack is played, it ends the turn.\n\nThe played card then goes face-up into a \"Discard\" pile, the player then draws a replacement card from the draw deck, and play passes to the left.\n\nA player may place chips on either of the appropriate card spaces as long as it is not already covered by an opponent's marker chip.\n\nIf a player possesses a card which does not have an open space on the game board, the card is considered \"dead\" and may be exchanged for a new card. When it is their turn, they place the dead on card on the discard pile, announce they are turning in a dead card, and take a replacement (one card per turn).  Then they proceed to play their normal turn.\n\n==Strategy==\nEach corner of the board has a \"Free\" space that all players can use to their advantage. This space acts as if it has a chip of each color on it at all times.\n\nTo form rows, chips may be placed vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Each complete row of five (or four and a free corner space) is counted as a sequence. Sequences of the same color may intersect, but only at a single position.\n\nIf the draw deck becomes depleted during play, the discard pile is shuffled and drawing begins again.\n\nSequence rules dictate no table talk or coaching between team members and a precise order in which hands must be played (card, chip, replace card). If a player forgets to replace a card on their turn and if any of the other players points it out then, they cannot make it up in a later one and must continue playing the game with a reduced number of cards.\n\n==Winning==\nThe game ends when a player or team completes 2 sequences.<ref name=\"rules\">Board Game Geek http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2375/sequence</ref>\n\nTwo Sequences in a row: \n\nWhen two (2) Sequences are required to win they can be in one straight row of nine (9) chips. It is nine and not ten (10), because the rules state that \"you may use any 'one' of the spaces from your first Sequence as part of your second.\" So, a straight line of 9 chips can be formed, in any order and is considered as two Sequences when the 9th chips in a row is placed.\n\nIf a Sequence is not announced by the player on creating one then it will not be considered a sequence until the player wishes so.\n\n==Variants==\n===Unofficial variants===\nA fun alternative to standard Sequence game play is to go past the minimal number of sequences to win. Players compete to fill the entire board with complete sequences of five chips (in each player's preferred color). Keep score of one point per sequence created. Different from standard game play, a player may remove chips from completed sequences to prevent opponents from scoring. For added difficulty, do not reshuffle the deck should you run out of cards. Game play ends when the board is filled and no additional moves are possible. To declare a winner, tally up the points. Whoever has the most points wins the game.\n\nA fun variation for turning sequence into a drinking game for adults is for each player to pick one (or two) number or face cards. Each time any of the chosen cards is discarded, by any player, the player who chose it has to drink. Last man standing (or the person who wins via the usual way) wins.\n\n===Official variations===\nSequence comes in several versions, including: Sequence \u2013 States and Capitals; Sequence Numbers; Sequence 25th Anniversary Edition; Jumbo Sequence; Travel Sequence; Sequence Deluxe Edition; and Sequence for Kids. The major difference between the different Sequence versions is the game board sizes, shapes and topics.\n\nThere is also Sequence Dice which uses dice instead of cards. The object of Sequence Dice is to be the first person to connect a \"sequence\" of five chips in a row on the board, just as in the original game. However, a player only has to achieve one sequence in order to win instead of the two sometimes needed in the original. The board displays four interlocking arrangements of the numerals 1-9 and pictures of dice. The four corner spaces on the board depict dice arranged in a \"snake eyes\" pattern; that is, displaying one and one. The four spaces in the center of the board depict [[dice]] showing double-sixes. Players who roll \"snake eyes\" or double-sixes may roll again.\n\nA variant allows pairs that become trapped by placing your color on each side of a pair of a single opponent to be removed from the board. One or three or more are not an option, but two, not a part of a sequence can be stolen by an opponent. Additionally, this allows for another option to win, as if a player captures any five pairs of any opponent, they win the game.\n\n==Legal issues==\nDuring a series of legal disputes, Douglas Reuter claimed Jax violated its licensing agreement which would provide grounds for contract termination. In response, Jax denied any violation. Meanwhile, both sides continue to profit from game sales. Jax garners 80 percent of its revenue from Sequence; Reuter receives a royalty on sales of Sequence. Mr. Reuter has also started a new game company called, \"Game Inventors of America,\" which is located in Corinth, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20120229a69.xml|title=REUTER v.

Unlike [[DNA]] synthesis in living cells, artificial gene synthesis does not require template DNA, allowing virtually any DNA sequence to be synthesized in the laboratory. It comprises two main steps, the first of which is [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|solid-phase DNA synthesis]],  sometimes known as 'DNA printing'.<ref>{{cite web | first = Rob | last = Stein | name-list-format = vanc | date = 7 May 2015 |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/05/07/404460240/dna-printing-a-big-boon-to-research-but-some-raise-concerns|title=DNA 'Printing' A Big Boon To Research, But Some Raise Concerns| work = All Things Considered | publisher = National Public Radio }}</ref> This produces oligonucleotide fragments that are generally under 200 base pairs. The second step then involves connecting these oligonucleotide fragments using various DNA assembly methods. Because artificial gene synthesis does not require template DNA, it is theoretically possible to make a completely synthetic DNA molecules with no limits on the nucleotide sequence or size.\n\nSynthesis of the first complete gene, a yeast [[tRNA]], was demonstrated by [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and coworkers in 1972.<ref name=\"Khorana722\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Khorana HG, Agarwal KL, B\u00fcchi H, Caruthers MH, Gupta NK, Kleppe K, Kumar A, Otsuka E, RajBhandary UL, Van de Sande JH, Sgaramella V, Terao T, Weber H, Yamada T | display-authors = 6 | title = Studies on polynucleotides. 103.

These can be normal or modified nucleosides which have protecting groups to prevent their amines, hydroxyl groups and phosphate groups from interacting incorrectly. One phosphoramidite is added at a time, the 5' hydroxyl group is deprotected and a new base is added and so on. The chain grows in the 3' to 5' direction, which is backwards relative to biosynthesis. At the end, all the protecting groups are removed. Nevertheless, being a chemical process, several incorrect interactions occur leading to some defective products. The longer the oligonucleotide sequence that is being synthesized, the more defects there are, thus this process is only practical for producing short sequences of [[nucleotides]]. The current practical limit is about 200 bp ([[base pair]]s) for an oligonucleotide with sufficient quality to be used directly for a biological application. [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] can be used to isolate products with the proper sequence. Meanwhile, a large number of oligos can be synthesized in parallel on [[DNA microarrays|gene chips]]. For optimal performance in subsequent gene synthesis procedures they should be prepared individually and in larger scales.\n\n===Annealing based connection of oligonucleotides===\n\nUsually, a set of individually designed oligonucleotides is made on automated solid-phase synthesizers, purified and then connected by specific [[Self annealing|annealing]] and standard [[Ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] or [[polymerase]] reactions. To improve specificity of oligonucleotide annealing, the synthesis step relies on a set of thermostable DNA [[ligase]] and [[polymerase]] [[enzyme]]s. To date, several methods for gene synthesis have been described, such as the ligation of phosphorylated overlapping oligonucleotides,<ref name=\"Khorana722\"/><ref name=\"Itakura772\"/> the Fok I method<ref name=Edge81>{{cite journal | vauthors = Edge MD, Green AR, Heathcliffe GR, Meacock PA, Schuch W, Scanlon DB, Atkinson TC, Newton CR, Markham AF | display-authors = 6 | title = Total synthesis of a human leukocyte interferon gene | journal = Nature | volume = 292 | issue = 5825 | pages = 756\u201362 | date = August 1981 | pmid = 6167861 | doi = 10.1038/292756a0 | bibcode = 1981Natur.292..756E }}</ref> and a modified form of [[ligase chain reaction]] for gene synthesis. Additionally, several [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] assembly approaches have been described.<ref name=Fuhrmann99>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuhrmann M, Oertel W, Hegemann P | title = A synthetic gene coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a versatile reporter in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 353\u201361 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10476082 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00526.x }}</ref> They usually employ oligonucleotides of 40-50 nucleotides long that overlap each other.

In this size range it is necessary to test several candidate clones confirming the sequence of the cloned synthetic gene by automated sequencing methods.\n\n===Limitations===\n\nMoreover, because the assembly of the full-length gene product relies on the efficient and specific alignment of long single stranded oligonucleotides, critical parameters for synthesis success include extended sequence regions comprising secondary structures caused by inverted repeats, extraordinary high or low GC-content, or repetitive structures. Usually these segments of a particular gene can only be synthesized by splitting the procedure into several consecutive steps and a final assembly of shorter sub-sequences, which in turn leads to a significant increase in time and labor needed for its production.\nThe result of a gene synthesis experiment depends strongly on the quality of the oligonucleotides used. For these annealing based gene synthesis protocols, the quality of the product is directly and exponentially dependent on the correctness of the employed oligonucleotides. Alternatively, after performing gene synthesis with oligos of lower quality, more effort must be made in downstream quality assurance during clone analysis, which is usually done by time-consuming standard cloning and sequencing procedures.\nAnother problem associated with all current gene synthesis methods is the high frequency of sequence errors because of the usage of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The error frequency increases with longer oligonucleotides, and as a consequence the percentage of correct product decreases dramatically as more oligonucleotides are used.\nThe mutation problem could be solved by shorter oligonucleotides used to assemble the gene. However, all annealing based assembly methods require the primers to be mixed together in one tube. In this case, shorter overlaps do not always allow precise and specific annealing of complementary primers, resulting in the inhibition of full length product formation.\nManual design of oligonucleotides is a laborious procedure and does not guarantee the successful synthesis of the desired gene. For optimal performance of almost all annealing based methods, the melting temperatures of the overlapping regions are supposed to be similar for all oligonucleotides. The necessary primer optimisation should be performed using specialized oligonucleotide design programs. Several solutions for automated primer design for gene synthesis have been presented so far.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao X, Yo P, Keith A, Ragan TJ, Harris TK | title = Thermodynamically balanced inside-out (TBIO) PCR-based gene synthesis: a novel method of primer design for high-fidelity assembly of longer gene sequences | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 22 | pages = 143e\u2013143 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14602936 | pmc = 275580 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gng143 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14602936 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Young L, Dong Q | title = Two-step total gene synthesis method | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = e59 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15087491 | pmc = 407838 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gnh058 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15087491 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hillson NJ, Rosengarten RD, Keasling JD | title = j5 DNA assembly design automation software | journal = ACS Synthetic Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 14\u201321 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 23651006 | doi = 10.1021/sb2000116 | url = https://figshare.com/articles/j5_DNA_Assembly_Design_Automation_Software/2557906 }}</ref>\n\n===Error correction procedures===\n\nTo overcome problems associated with oligonucleotide quality several elaborate strategies have been developed, employing either separately prepared fishing oligonucleotides,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoover DM, Lubkowski J | title = DNAWorks: an automated method for designing oligonucleotides for PCR-based gene synthesis | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 43e\u201343 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12000848 | pmc = 115297 | doi = 10.1093/nar/30.10.e43 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12000848 }}</ref> mismatch binding enzymes of the [[MutS-1|mutS family]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Villalobos A, Ness JE, Gustafsson C, Minshull J, Govindarajan S | title = Gene Designer: a synthetic biology tool for constructing artificial DNA segments | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 7 | pages = 285 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16756672 | pmc = 1523223 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-7-285 }}</ref> or specific endonucleases from bacteria or phages.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tian J, Gong H, Sheng N, Zhou X, Gulari E, Gao X, Church G | title = Accurate multiplex gene synthesis from programmable DNA microchips | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = 7020 | pages = 1050\u20134 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15616567 | doi = 10.1038/nature03151 | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62677/1/nature03151.pdf | bibcode = 2004Natur.432.1050T | hdl = 2027.42/62677 }}</ref> Nevertheless, all these strategies increase time and costs for gene synthesis based on the annealing of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides.\n\nMassively parallel sequencing has also been used as a tool to screen complex oligonucleotide libraries and enable the retrieval of accurate molecules.

Virtually all of the therapeutic proteins in development, such as monoclonal antibodies, are optimised by testing many gene variants for improved function or expression.\n\n=== Unnatural base pairs ===\n{{Main|Unnatural base pair}}\nWhile traditional nucleic acid synthesis only uses 4 base pairs - adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine, oligonucleotide synthesis in the future could incorporate the use of unnatural base pairs, which are artificially designed and synthesised nucleobases that do not occur in nature.\n\nIn 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP). The two new artificial nucleotides or ''Unnatural Base Pair'' (UBP) were named '''[[d5SICS]]''' and '''[[dNaM]]'''. More technically, these artificial [[nucleotides]] bearing hydrophobic [[Nucleobase|nucleobases]], feature two fused [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic rings]] that form a (d5SICS\u2013dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA. In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a [[plasmid]] containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg's laboratory had designed, and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium ''E. coli'' that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations. This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations. This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive algal gene that expresses a [[Nucleoside triphosphate|nucleotide triphosphate]] transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into ''E. coli'' bacteria. Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate the [[plasmid]] containing d5SICS\u2013dNaM.\n\nThe successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of [[Amino acid|amino acids]] which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel [[Protein|proteins]].<ref>{{Cite web | first = Chelsea | last = Weidman | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/making-new-life-expanding-genetic-alphabet/|title=Expanding the genetic alphabet | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-12-06 |work = Blog | publisher = Harvard University |language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In the future, these unnatural base pairs could be synthesised and incorporated into oligonucleotides via DNA printing methods.\n\n== DNA assembly ==\n\nDNA printing can thus be used to produce DNA parts, which are defined as sequences of DNA that encode a specific biological function (for example, [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], transcription regulatory sequences or [[open reading frame]]s).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://parts.igem.org/Help:Synthetic_Biology|title=Help:Synthetic Biology - parts.igem.org|website=parts.igem.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> However, because oligonucleotide synthesis typically cannot accurately produce oligonucleotides sequences longer than a few hundred base pairs, DNA assembly methods have to be employed to assemble these parts together to create functional genes, multi-gene circuits or even entire synthetic chromosomes or genomes. Some DNA assembly techniques only define protocols for joining DNA parts, while other techniques also define the rules for the format of DNA parts that are compatible with them. These processes can be scaled up to enable the assembly of entire chromosomes or genomes.

Of the different types of restriction enzymes, the type II restriction enzymes are the most commonly available and used because their cleavage sites are located near or in their recognition sites. Hence, endonuclease-mediated assembly methods make use of this property to define DNA parts and assembly protocols.\n\n==== BioBricks ====\n{{Main|BioBrick}}\n[[File:BioBricks_assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BioBricks_assembly.png|alt=|thumb|320x320px|BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki> assembly of two BioBricks compatible part. Treating the upstream fragment with EcoRI and SpeI, and the downstream fragment with EcoRI and XbaI allows for the assembly in the desired sequence. Because SpeI and XbaI produce complementary overhangs, they help link the two DNA fragments together, producing a scar sequence. All the original restriction sites are maintained in the final construct, which can then be used for further BioBricks reactions.]]\nThe BioBricks assembly standard was described and introduced by Tom Knight in 2003 and it has been constantly updated since then.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |date=2003|title=Idempotent Vector Design for Standard Assembly of Biobricks|hdl=1721.1/21168 |language=en-US}}</ref> Currently, the most commonly used BioBricks standard is the assembly standard 10, or BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki>. BioBricks defines the prefix and suffix sequences required for a DNA part to be compatible with the BioBricks assembly method, allowing the joining together of all DNA parts which are in the BioBricks format.\n\nThe prefix contains the restriction sites for EcoRI, NotI and XBaI, while the suffix contains the SpeI, NotI and PstI restriction sites. Outside of the prefix and suffix regions, the DNA part must not contain these restriction sites. To join two BioBrick parts together, one of the plasmids is digested with EcoRI and SpeI while the second plasmid is digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The two EcoRI overhangs are complementary and will thus anneal together, while SpeI and XbaI also produce complementary overhangs which can also be ligated together. As the resulting plasmid contains the original prefix and suffix sequences, it can be used to join with more BioBricks parts.<ref name=\"pmid24395353\">{{cite book | vauthors = R\u00f8kke G, Korvald E, Pahr J, Oy\u00e5s O, Lale R | title = DNA Cloning and Assembly Methods | veditors = Valla S, Lale R | chapter = BioBrick assembly standards and techniques and associated software tools | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | location = Clifton, N.J. | volume = 1116 | pages = 1\u201324 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24395353 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-62703-764-8_1 | isbn = 978-1-62703-763-1 }}</ref> Because of this property, the BioBricks assembly standard is said to be [[Idempotence|idempotent]] in nature.

These differ from other type II endonucleases as they cut several base pairs away from the recognition site. As a result, the overhang sequence can be modified to contain the desired sequence. This provides Type IIs assembly methods with two advantages \u2013 it enables \"scar-less\" assembly, and allows for one-pot, multi-part assembly. Assembly methods that use type IIs endonucleases include [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden Gate]] and its associated variants.\n\n===== Golden Gate cloning =====\n{{Main|Golden Gate Cloning}}\n[[File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|alt=|thumb|600x600px|The sequence of DNA parts for the Golden Gate assembly can be directed by defining unique complementary overhangs for each part. Thus, to assemble gene 1 in order of fragment A, B and C, the 3' overhang for fragment A is complementary to the 5' overhang for fragment B, and similarly for fragment B and fragment C. For the destination plasmid, the selectable marker is flanked by outward-cutting BsaI restriction sites. This excises the selectable marker, allowing the insertion of the final construct. T4 ligase is used to ligate the fragments together and to the destination plasmid.]]\nThe Golden Gate assembly protocol was defined by Engler et al. 2008 to define a DNA assembly method that would give a final construct without a scar sequence, while also lacking the original restriction sites. This allows the protein to be expressed without containing unwanted protein sequences which could negatively affect protein folding or expression. By using the BsaI restriction enzyme that produces a 4 base pair overhang, up to 240 unique, non-palindromic sequences can be used for assembly.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Engler C, Kandzia R, Marillonnet S | title = A one pot, one step, precision cloning method with high throughput capability | journal = PloS One | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = e3647 | date = 2008-11-05 | pmid = 18985154 | pmc = 2574415 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003647 | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.3647E }}</ref>\n\n'''Plasmid design and assembly'''\n\nIn Golden Gate cloning, each DNA fragment to be assembled is placed in a plasmid, flanked by inward facing BsaI restriction sites containing the programmed overhang sequences. For each DNA fragment, the 3' overhang sequence is complementary to the 5' overhang of the next downstream DNA fragment. For the first fragment, the 5' overhang is complementary to the 5' overhang of the destination plasmid, while the 3' overhang of the final fragment is complementary to the 3' overhang of the destination plasmid. Such a design allows for all DNA fragments to be assembled in a one-pot reaction (where all reactants are mixed together), with all fragments arranged in the correct sequence. Successfully assembled constructs are selected by detecting the loss of function of a screening cassette that was originally in the destination plasmid.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n'''MoClo and Golden Braid'''\n\nThe original Golden Gate Assembly only allows for a single construct to be made in the destination vector . To enable this construct to be used in a subsequent reaction as an entry vector, the MoClo and Golden Braid standards were designed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber E, Engler C, Gruetzner R, Werner S, Marillonnet S | title = A modular cloning system for standardized assembly of multigene constructs | journal = PloS One | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = e16765 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21364738 | pmc = 3041749 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0016765 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...616765W }}</ref>\n\nThe MoClo standard involves defining multiple tiers of DNA assembly:\n\n* {{multiple image\n| width = \n| footer = The MoClo and Golden Brain assembly standards are derivatives of the original Golden Gate assembly standard.\n| image1 = MoClo_assembly.png\n| caption1 = The MoClo assembly standard allows for Golden Gate constructs to be further assembled in subsequent tiers.

Flanking the insertion site of the tier 1 destination vectors are a pair of inward cutting BpiI restriction sites. This allows these plasmids to be used as entry vectors for tier two destination vectors.\n* Tier 2: Tier 2 assembly involves further assembling the genes assembled in tier 1 assembly into multi-gene constructs. If there is a need for further, higher tier assembly, inward cutting BsaI restriction sites can be added to flank the insertion sites. These vectors can then be used as entry vectors for higher tier constructs.\n\nEach assembly tier alternates the use of BsaI and BpiI restriction sites to minimise the number of forbidden sites, and sequential assembly for each tier is achieved by following the Golden Gate plasmid design. Overall, the MoClo standard allows for the assembly of a construct that contains multiple transcription units, all assembled from different DNA parts, by a series of one-pot Golden Gate reactions. However, one drawback of the MoClo standard is that it requires the use of 'dummy parts' with no biological function, if the final construct requires less than four component parts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein CA, Emde L, Kuijpers A, Sobetzko P | title = MoCloFlex: A Modular Yet Flexible Cloning System | journal = Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | volume = 7 | pages = 271 | date = 2019-10-17 | pmid = 31750294 | pmc = 6843054 | doi = 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00271 }}</ref> The Golden Braid standard on the other hand introduced a pairwise Golden Gate assembly standard.\n\nThe Golden Braid standard uses the same tiered assembly as MoClo, but each tier only involves the assembly of two DNA fragments, i.e. a pairwise approach. Hence in each tier, pairs of genes are cloned into a destination fragment in the desired sequence, and these are subsequently assembled two at a time in successive tiers. Like MoClo, the Golden Braid standard alternates the BsaI and BpiI restriction enzymes between each tier.\n\nThe development of the Golden Gate assembly methods and its variants has allowed researchers to design tool-kits to speed up the synthetic biology workflow. For example EcoFlex was developed as a toolkit for ''E.

Instead, integrases make use of unique attachment (att) sites, and catalyse DNA rearrangement between the target fragment and the destination vector. The Invitrogen Gateway cloning system was invented in the late 1990s and uses two proprietary enzyme mixtures, BP clonase and LR clonase. The BP clonase mix catalyses the recombination between attB and attP sites, generating hybrid attL and attR sites, while the LR clonase mix catalyse the recombination of attL and attR sites to give attB and attP sites. As each enzyme mix recognises only specific att sites, recombination is highly specific and the fragments can be assembled in the desired sequence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reece-Hoyes JS, Walhout AJ | title = Gateway Recombinational Cloning | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2018 | issue = 1 | pages = pdb.top094912 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29295908 | pmc = 5935001 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.top094912 }}</ref>\n\n'''Vector design and assembly'''\n\nBecause Gateway cloning is a proprietary technology, all Gateway reactions must be carried out with the Gateway kit that is provided by the manufacturer. The reaction can be summarised into two steps. The first step involves assembling the entry clones containing the DNA fragment of interest, while the second step involves inserting this fragment of interest into the destination clone.\n\n# Entry clones must be made using the supplied \"Donor\" vectors containing a Gateway cassette flanked by attP sites. The Gateway cassette contains a bacterial suicide gene (e.g. [[CcdA/CcdB Type II Toxin-antitoxin system|ccdB]]) that will allow for survival and selection of successfully recombined entry clones. A pair of attB sites are added to flank the DNA fragment of interest, and this will allow recombination with the attP sites when the BP clonase mix is added. Entry clones are produced, and the fragment of interest is flanked by attL sites.\n# The destination vector also comes with a Gateway cassette, but is instead flanked by a pair of attR sites. Mixing this destination plasmid with the entry clones and the LR clonase mix will allow for recombination to occur between the attR and attL sites. A destination clone is produced, with the fragment of interest successfully inserted. The lethal gene is inserted into the original vector, and bacteria transformed with this plasmid will die. The desired vector can thus be easily selected.\n\nThe earliest iterations of the Gateway cloning method only allowed for only one entry clone to be used for each destination clone produced. However, further research revealed that four more orthogonal att sequences could be generated, allowing for the assembly of up to four different DNA fragments, and this process is now known as the Multisite Gateway technology.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasaki Y, Sone T, Yoshida S, Yahata K, Hotta J, Chesnut JD, Honda T, Imamoto F | display-authors = 6 | title = Evidence for high specificity and efficiency of multiple recombination signals in mixed DNA cloning by the Multisite Gateway system | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 233\u201343 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14736459 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2003.10.001 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165603002657 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Gateway cloning, non-commercial methods using other integrases have also been developed.

The DNA fragments to be assembled are synthesised to have overlapping 5' and 3' ends in the order that they are to be assembled in. These reagents are mixed together with the DNA fragments to be assembled at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and the following reactions occur:\n\n# The T5 exonuclease chews back DNA from the 5' end of each fragment, exposing 3' overhangs on each DNA fragment.\n# The complementary overhangs on adjacent DNA fragments anneal via complementary base pairing.\n# The Phusion DNA polymerase fills in any gaps where the fragments anneal.\n# Taq DNA ligase repairs the nicks on both DNA strands.\n\nBecause the T5 exonuclease is heat labile, it is inactivated at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C after the initial chew back step. The product is thus stable, and the fragments assembled in the desired order. This one-pot protocol can assemble up to 5 different fragments accurately, while several commercial providers have kits to accurately assemble up to 15 different fragments in a two-step reaction.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.addgene.org/protocols/gibson-assembly/ |title= Gibson Assembly Protocol| work = Addgene |access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, while the Gibson assembly protocol is fast and uses relatively few reagents, it requires bespoke DNA synthesis as each fragment has to be designed to contain overlapping sequences with the adjacent fragments and amplified via PCR. This reliance on PCR may also affect the fidelity of the reaction when long fragments, fragments with high GC content or repeat sequences are used.<ref name=\":22\" />\n[[File:Overlap assembly using the MODAL format.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Overlap%20assembly%20using%20the%20MODAL%20format.png|thumb|500x500px|The MODAL standard provides a common format to allow any DNA part to be made compatible with Gibson assembly or other overlap assembly methods. The DNA fragment of interest undergoes two rounds of PCR, first to attach the adaptor prefix and suffixes, and next to attach the predefined linker sequences. Once the parts are in the required format, assembly methods like Gibson assembly can carried out. The order of the parts is directed by the linkers, i.e the same linker sequence is attached to the 3' end of the upstream part and the 5' end of the downstream part.]]\n\n==== MODAL ====\nThe MODAL strategy defines overlap sequences known as \"linkers\" to reduce the amount of customisation that needs to be done with each DNA fragment. The linkers were designed using the [https://omictools.com/r2odna-designer-tool R2oDNA Designer] software and the overlap regions were designed to be 45 bp long to be compatible with Gibson assembly and other overlap assembly methods. To attach these linkers to the parts to be assembled, PCR is carried using part-specific primers containing 15 bp prefix and suffix adaptor sequences. The linkers are then attached to the adaptor sequences via a second PCR reaction. To position the DNA fragments, the same linker will be attached to the suffix of the desired upstream fragment and the prefix of the desired downstream fragments. Once the linkers are attached, Gibson assembly, CPEC, or the other overlap assembly methods can all be used to assemble the DNA fragments in the desired order.\n\n==== BASIC ====\nThe BASIC assembly strategy was developed in 2015 and sought to address the limitations of previous assembly techniques, incorporating six key concepts from them: standard reusable parts; single-tier format (all parts are in the same format and are assembled using the same process); idempotent cloning; parallel (multipart) DNA assembly; size independence; automatability.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n'''DNA parts and linker design'''\n\nThe DNA parts are designed and cloned into storage plasmids, with the part flanked by an integrated prefix (''i''P) and an integrated suffix (''i''S) sequence. The ''i''P and ''i''S sequences contain inward facing BsaI restriction sites, which contain overhangs complementary to the BASIC linkers.<ref name=\":22\" /> Like in MODAL, the 7 standard linkers used in BASIC were designed with the R2oDNA Designer software, and screened to ensure that they do not contain sequences with homology to chassis genomes, and that they do not contain unwanted sequences like secondary structure sequences, restriction sites or ribosomal binding sites. Each linker sequence is split into two halves, each with a 4 bp overhang complementary to the BsaI restriction site, a 12 bp double stranded sequence and sharing a 21 bp overlap sequence with the other half. The half that is will bind to the upstream DNA part is known as the suffix linker part (e.g. L1S) and the half that binds to the downstream part is known as the prefix linker part (e.g. L1P). These linkers form the basis of assembling the DNA parts together.\n\nBesides directing the order of assembly, the standard BASIC linkers can also be modified to carry out other functions. To allow for idempotent assembly, linkers were also designed with additional methylated ''i''P and ''i''S sequences inserted to protect them from being recognised by BsaI. This methylation is lost following transformation and in vivo plasmid replication, and the plasmids can be extracted, purified, and used for further reactions.\n\nBecause the linker sequence are relatively long (45bp for a standard linker), there is an opportunity to incorporate functional DNA sequences to reduce the number of DNA parts needed during assembly. The BASIC assembly standard provides several linkers embedded with RBS of different strengths. Similarly to facilitate the construction of fusion proteins containing multiple protein domains,several fusion linkers were also designed to allow for full read-through of the DNA construct. These fusion linkers code for a 15 amino acid glycine and serine polypeptide, which is an ideal linker peptide for fusion proteins with multiple domains.\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = Right\n| direction = \n| total_width = 700\n| image1 = BASIC Parts Preparation.png\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = DNA parts to be used for BASIC assembly need to contain integrated prefix and suffix sequences (iP and iS). These contain BsaI restriction sites that will allow for the iP and iS linkers (which contain complementary overhang sequences) to be attached to the DNA part. Once the linkers are attached, the part is ready for assembly.\n| image2 = Four Part BASIC Assembly Construct.png\n| caption2 = The sequence of assembly is directed by the positioning of the linkers. The suffix linker is ligated to the 3' end of the upstream fragment, while the prefix linker is ligated to the 5' end of the downstream fragment.

Each DNA part will have a suffix and prefix linker part from two different linkers to direct the order of assembly. For example, the first part in the sequence will have L1P and L2S, while the second part will have L2P and L3S attached. The linker parts can be changed to change the sequence of assembly.\n# Finally, the parts with the attached linkers are assembled into a plasmid by incubating at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. The 21 bp overhangs of the P and S linkers anneal and the final construct can be transformed into bacteria cells for cloning. The single stranded nicks are repaired ''in vivo'' following transformation, producing a stable final construct cloned into plasmids.\n\n== Applications ==\nAs DNA printing and DNA assembly methods have allowed commercial gene synthesis to become progressively and exponentially cheaper over the past years<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = El Karoui M, Hoyos-Flight M, Fletcher L | title = Future Trends in Synthetic Biology-A Report | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | volume = 7 | pages = 175 | date = 2019 | pmid = 31448268 | doi = 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00175 | pmc = 6692427 }}</ref>, artificial gene synthesis represents a powerful and flexible engineering tool for creating and designing new DNA sequences and protein functions.

These can be normal or modified nucleosides which have protecting groups to prevent their amines, hydroxyl groups and phosphate groups from interacting incorrectly. One phosphoramidite is added at a time, the 5' hydroxyl group is deprotected and a new base is added and so on. The chain grows in the 3' to 5' direction, which is backwards relative to biosynthesis. At the end, all the protecting groups are removed. Nevertheless, being a chemical process, several incorrect interactions occur leading to some defective products. The longer the oligonucleotide sequence that is being synthesized, the more defects there are, thus this process is only practical for producing short sequences of [[nucleotides]]. The current practical limit is about 200 bp ([[base pair]]s) for an oligonucleotide with sufficient quality to be used directly for a biological application. [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] can be used to isolate products with the proper sequence. Meanwhile, a large number of oligos can be synthesized in parallel on [[DNA microarrays|gene chips]]. For optimal performance in subsequent gene synthesis procedures they should be prepared individually and in larger scales.\n\n===Annealing based connection of oligonucleotides===\n\nUsually, a set of individually designed oligonucleotides is made on automated solid-phase synthesizers, purified and then connected by specific [[Self annealing|annealing]] and standard [[Ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] or [[polymerase]] reactions. To improve specificity of oligonucleotide annealing, the synthesis step relies on a set of thermostable DNA [[ligase]] and [[polymerase]] [[enzyme]]s.

In this size range it is necessary to test several candidate clones confirming the sequence of the cloned synthetic gene by automated sequencing methods.\n\n===Limitations===\n\nMoreover, because the assembly of the full-length gene product relies on the efficient and specific alignment of long single stranded oligonucleotides, critical parameters for synthesis success include extended sequence regions comprising secondary structures caused by inverted repeats, extraordinary high or low GC-content, or repetitive structures. Usually these segments of a particular gene can only be synthesized by splitting the procedure into several consecutive steps and a final assembly of shorter sub-sequences, which in turn leads to a significant increase in time and labor needed for its production.\nThe result of a gene synthesis experiment depends strongly on the quality of the oligonucleotides used. For these annealing based gene synthesis protocols, the quality of the product is directly and exponentially dependent on the correctness of the employed oligonucleotides. Alternatively, after performing gene synthesis with oligos of lower quality, more effort must be made in downstream quality assurance during clone analysis, which is usually done by time-consuming standard cloning and sequencing procedures.\nAnother problem associated with all current gene synthesis methods is the high frequency of sequence errors because of the usage of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The error frequency increases with longer oligonucleotides, and as a consequence the percentage of correct product decreases dramatically as more oligonucleotides are used.\nThe mutation problem could be solved by shorter oligonucleotides used to assemble the gene. However, all annealing based assembly methods require the primers to be mixed together in one tube. In this case, shorter overlaps do not always allow precise and specific annealing of complementary primers, resulting in the inhibition of full length product formation.\nManual design of oligonucleotides is a laborious procedure and does not guarantee the successful synthesis of the desired gene.

Virtually all of the therapeutic proteins in development, such as monoclonal antibodies, are optimised by testing many gene variants for improved function or expression.\n\n=== Unnatural base pairs ===\n{{Main|Unnatural base pair}}\nWhile traditional nucleic acid synthesis only uses 4 base pairs - adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine, oligonucleotide synthesis in the future could incorporate the use of unnatural base pairs, which are artificially designed and synthesised nucleobases that do not occur in nature.\n\nIn 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP). The two new artificial nucleotides or ''Unnatural Base Pair'' (UBP) were named '''[[d5SICS]]''' and '''[[dNaM]]'''. More technically, these artificial [[nucleotides]] bearing hydrophobic [[Nucleobase|nucleobases]], feature two fused [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic rings]] that form a (d5SICS\u2013dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA. In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a [[plasmid]] containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg's laboratory had designed, and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium ''E. coli'' that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations. This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations. This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive algal gene that expresses a [[Nucleoside triphosphate|nucleotide triphosphate]] transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into ''E. coli'' bacteria. Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate the [[plasmid]] containing d5SICS\u2013dNaM.\n\nThe successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of [[Amino acid|amino acids]] which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel [[Protein|proteins]].<ref>{{Cite web | first = Chelsea | last = Weidman | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/making-new-life-expanding-genetic-alphabet/|title=Expanding the genetic alphabet | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-12-06 |work = Blog | publisher = Harvard University |language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In the future, these unnatural base pairs could be synthesised and incorporated into oligonucleotides via DNA printing methods.\n\n== DNA assembly ==\n\nDNA printing can thus be used to produce DNA parts, which are defined as sequences of DNA that encode a specific biological function (for example, [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], transcription regulatory sequences or [[open reading frame]]s).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://parts.igem.org/Help:Synthetic_Biology|title=Help:Synthetic Biology - parts.igem.org|website=parts.igem.org|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> However, because oligonucleotide synthesis typically cannot accurately produce oligonucleotides sequences longer than a few hundred base pairs, DNA assembly methods have to be employed to assemble these parts together to create functional genes, multi-gene circuits or even entire synthetic chromosomes or genomes. Some DNA assembly techniques only define protocols for joining DNA parts, while other techniques also define the rules for the format of DNA parts that are compatible with them. These processes can be scaled up to enable the assembly of entire chromosomes or genomes.

Of the different types of restriction enzymes, the type II restriction enzymes are the most commonly available and used because their cleavage sites are located near or in their recognition sites. Hence, endonuclease-mediated assembly methods make use of this property to define DNA parts and assembly protocols.\n\n==== BioBricks ====\n{{Main|BioBrick}}\n[[File:BioBricks_assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BioBricks_assembly.png|alt=|thumb|320x320px|BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki> assembly of two BioBricks compatible part.

All the original restriction sites are maintained in the final construct, which can then be used for further BioBricks reactions.]]\nThe BioBricks assembly standard was described and introduced by Tom Knight in 2003 and it has been constantly updated since then.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |date=2003|title=Idempotent Vector Design for Standard Assembly of Biobricks|hdl=1721.1/21168 |language=en-US}}</ref> Currently, the most commonly used BioBricks standard is the assembly standard 10, or BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki>. BioBricks defines the prefix and suffix sequences required for a DNA part to be compatible with the BioBricks assembly method, allowing the joining together of all DNA parts which are in the BioBricks format.\n\nThe prefix contains the restriction sites for EcoRI, NotI and XBaI, while the suffix contains the SpeI, NotI and PstI restriction sites. Outside of the prefix and suffix regions, the DNA part must not contain these restriction sites. To join two BioBrick parts together, one of the plasmids is digested with EcoRI and SpeI while the second plasmid is digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The two EcoRI overhangs are complementary and will thus anneal together, while SpeI and XbaI also produce complementary overhangs which can also be ligated together. As the resulting plasmid contains the original prefix and suffix sequences, it can be used to join with more BioBricks parts.<ref name=\"pmid24395353\">{{cite book | vauthors = R\u00f8kke G, Korvald E, Pahr J, Oy\u00e5s O, Lale R | title = DNA Cloning and Assembly Methods | veditors = Valla S, Lale R | chapter = BioBrick assembly standards and techniques and associated software tools | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | location = Clifton, N.J. | volume = 1116 | pages = 1\u201324 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24395353 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-62703-764-8_1 | isbn = 978-1-62703-763-1 }}</ref> Because of this property, the BioBricks assembly standard is said to be [[Idempotence|idempotent]] in nature.

These differ from other type II endonucleases as they cut several base pairs away from the recognition site. As a result, the overhang sequence can be modified to contain the desired sequence. This provides Type IIs assembly methods with two advantages \u2013 it enables \"scar-less\" assembly, and allows for one-pot, multi-part assembly. Assembly methods that use type IIs endonucleases include [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden Gate]] and its associated variants.\n\n===== Golden Gate cloning =====\n{{Main|Golden Gate Cloning}}\n[[File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|alt=|thumb|600x600px|The sequence of DNA parts for the Golden Gate assembly can be directed by defining unique complementary overhangs for each part.

For the destination plasmid, the selectable marker is flanked by outward-cutting BsaI restriction sites. This excises the selectable marker, allowing the insertion of the final construct. T4 ligase is used to ligate the fragments together and to the destination plasmid.]]\nThe Golden Gate assembly protocol was defined by Engler et al. 2008 to define a DNA assembly method that would give a final construct without a scar sequence, while also lacking the original restriction sites. This allows the protein to be expressed without containing unwanted protein sequences which could negatively affect protein folding or expression. By using the BsaI restriction enzyme that produces a 4 base pair overhang, up to 240 unique, non-palindromic sequences can be used for assembly.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Engler C, Kandzia R, Marillonnet S | title = A one pot, one step, precision cloning method with high throughput capability | journal = PloS One | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = e3647 | date = 2008-11-05 | pmid = 18985154 | pmc = 2574415 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003647 | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.3647E }}</ref>\n\n'''Plasmid design and assembly'''\n\nIn Golden Gate cloning, each DNA fragment to be assembled is placed in a plasmid, flanked by inward facing BsaI restriction sites containing the programmed overhang sequences.

For the first fragment, the 5' overhang is complementary to the 5' overhang of the destination plasmid, while the 3' overhang of the final fragment is complementary to the 3' overhang of the destination plasmid. Such a design allows for all DNA fragments to be assembled in a one-pot reaction (where all reactants are mixed together), with all fragments arranged in the correct sequence.

Flanking the insertion site of the tier 1 destination vectors are a pair of inward cutting BpiI restriction sites.

These vectors can then be used as entry vectors for higher tier constructs.\n\nEach assembly tier alternates the use of BsaI and BpiI restriction sites to minimise the number of forbidden sites, and sequential assembly for each tier is achieved by following the Golden Gate plasmid design. Overall, the MoClo standard allows for the assembly of a construct that contains multiple transcription units, all assembled from different DNA parts, by a series of one-pot Golden Gate reactions. However, one drawback of the MoClo standard is that it requires the use of 'dummy parts' with no biological function, if the final construct requires less than four component parts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein CA, Emde L, Kuijpers A, Sobetzko P | title = MoCloFlex: A Modular Yet Flexible Cloning System | journal = Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | volume = 7 | pages = 271 | date = 2019-10-17 | pmid = 31750294 | pmc = 6843054 | doi = 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00271 }}</ref> The Golden Braid standard on the other hand introduced a pairwise Golden Gate assembly standard.\n\nThe Golden Braid standard uses the same tiered assembly as MoClo, but each tier only involves the assembly of two DNA fragments, i.e. a pairwise approach.

The reaction can be summarised into two steps. The first step involves assembling the entry clones containing the DNA fragment of interest, while the second step involves inserting this fragment of interest into the destination clone.\n\n# Entry clones must be made using the supplied \"Donor\" vectors containing a Gateway cassette flanked by attP sites. The Gateway cassette contains a bacterial suicide gene (e.g. [[CcdA/CcdB Type II Toxin-antitoxin system|ccdB]]) that will allow for survival and selection of successfully recombined entry clones. A pair of attB sites are added to flank the DNA fragment of interest, and this will allow recombination with the attP sites when the BP clonase mix is added. Entry clones are produced, and the fragment of interest is flanked by attL sites.\n# The destination vector also comes with a Gateway cassette, but is instead flanked by a pair of attR sites. Mixing this destination plasmid with the entry clones and the LR clonase mix will allow for recombination to occur between the attR and attL sites. A destination clone is produced, with the fragment of interest successfully inserted. The lethal gene is inserted into the original vector, and bacteria transformed with this plasmid will die. The desired vector can thus be easily selected.\n\nThe earliest iterations of the Gateway cloning method only allowed for only one entry clone to be used for each destination clone produced. However, further research revealed that four more orthogonal att sequences could be generated, allowing for the assembly of up to four different DNA fragments, and this process is now known as the Multisite Gateway technology.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasaki Y, Sone T, Yoshida S, Yahata K, Hotta J, Chesnut JD, Honda T, Imamoto F | display-authors = 6 | title = Evidence for high specificity and efficiency of multiple recombination signals in mixed DNA cloning by the Multisite Gateway system | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 233\u201343 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14736459 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2003.10.001 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165603002657 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Gateway cloning, non-commercial methods using other integrases have also been developed.

The DNA fragments to be assembled are synthesised to have overlapping 5' and 3' ends in the order that they are to be assembled in. These reagents are mixed together with the DNA fragments to be assembled at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and the following reactions occur:\n\n# The T5 exonuclease chews back DNA from the 5' end of each fragment, exposing 3' overhangs on each DNA fragment.\n# The complementary overhangs on adjacent DNA fragments anneal via complementary base pairing.\n# The Phusion DNA polymerase fills in any gaps where the fragments anneal.\n# Taq DNA ligase repairs the nicks on both DNA strands.\n\nBecause the T5 exonuclease is heat labile, it is inactivated at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C after the initial chew back step. The product is thus stable, and the fragments assembled in the desired order. This one-pot protocol can assemble up to 5 different fragments accurately, while several commercial providers have kits to accurately assemble up to 15 different fragments in a two-step reaction.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.addgene.org/protocols/gibson-assembly/ |title= Gibson Assembly Protocol| work = Addgene |access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, while the Gibson assembly protocol is fast and uses relatively few reagents, it requires bespoke DNA synthesis as each fragment has to be designed to contain overlapping sequences with the adjacent fragments and amplified via PCR. This reliance on PCR may also affect the fidelity of the reaction when long fragments, fragments with high GC content or repeat sequences are used.<ref name=\":22\" />\n[[File:Overlap assembly using the MODAL format.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Overlap%20assembly%20using%20the%20MODAL%20format.png|thumb|500x500px|The MODAL standard provides a common format to allow any DNA part to be made compatible with Gibson assembly or other overlap assembly methods. The DNA fragment of interest undergoes two rounds of PCR, first to attach the adaptor prefix and suffixes, and next to attach the predefined linker sequences. Once the parts are in the required format, assembly methods like Gibson assembly can carried out. The order of the parts is directed by the linkers, i.e the same linker sequence is attached to the 3' end of the upstream part and the 5' end of the downstream part.]]\n\n==== MODAL ====\nThe MODAL strategy defines overlap sequences known as \"linkers\" to reduce the amount of customisation that needs to be done with each DNA fragment. The linkers were designed using the [https://omictools.com/r2odna-designer-tool R2oDNA Designer] software and the overlap regions were designed to be 45 bp long to be compatible with Gibson assembly and other overlap assembly methods. To attach these linkers to the parts to be assembled, PCR is carried using part-specific primers containing 15 bp prefix and suffix adaptor sequences. The linkers are then attached to the adaptor sequences via a second PCR reaction. To position the DNA fragments, the same linker will be attached to the suffix of the desired upstream fragment and the prefix of the desired downstream fragments. Once the linkers are attached, Gibson assembly, CPEC, or the other overlap assembly methods can all be used to assemble the DNA fragments in the desired order.\n\n==== BASIC ====\nThe BASIC assembly strategy was developed in 2015 and sought to address the limitations of previous assembly techniques, incorporating six key concepts from them: standard reusable parts; single-tier format (all parts are in the same format and are assembled using the same process); idempotent cloning; parallel (multipart) DNA assembly; size independence; automatability.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n'''DNA parts and linker design'''\n\nThe DNA parts are designed and cloned into storage plasmids, with the part flanked by an integrated prefix (''i''P) and an integrated suffix (''i''S) sequence. The ''i''P and ''i''S sequences contain inward facing BsaI restriction sites, which contain overhangs complementary to the BASIC linkers.<ref name=\":22\" /> Like in MODAL, the 7 standard linkers used in BASIC were designed with the R2oDNA Designer software, and screened to ensure that they do not contain sequences with homology to chassis genomes, and that they do not contain unwanted sequences like secondary structure sequences, restriction sites or ribosomal binding sites. Each linker sequence is split into two halves, each with a 4 bp overhang complementary to the BsaI restriction site, a 12 bp double stranded sequence and sharing a 21 bp overlap sequence with the other half. The half that is will bind to the upstream DNA part is known as the suffix linker part (e.g. L1S) and the half that binds to the downstream part is known as the prefix linker part (e.g. L1P). These linkers form the basis of assembling the DNA parts together.\n\nBesides directing the order of assembly, the standard BASIC linkers can also be modified to carry out other functions. To allow for idempotent assembly, linkers were also designed with additional methylated ''i''P and ''i''S sequences inserted to protect them from being recognised by BsaI. This methylation is lost following transformation and in vivo plasmid replication, and the plasmids can be extracted, purified, and used for further reactions.\n\nBecause the linker sequence are relatively long (45bp for a standard linker), there is an opportunity to incorporate functional DNA sequences to reduce the number of DNA parts needed during assembly. The BASIC assembly standard provides several linkers embedded with RBS of different strengths. Similarly to facilitate the construction of fusion proteins containing multiple protein domains,several fusion linkers were also designed to allow for full read-through of the DNA construct. These fusion linkers code for a 15 amino acid glycine and serine polypeptide, which is an ideal linker peptide for fusion proteins with multiple domains.\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = Right\n| direction = \n| total_width = 700\n| image1 = BASIC Parts Preparation.png\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = DNA parts to be used for BASIC assembly need to contain integrated prefix and suffix sequences (iP and iS). These contain BsaI restriction sites that will allow for the iP and iS linkers (which contain complementary overhang sequences) to be attached to the DNA part. Once the linkers are attached, the part is ready for assembly.\n| image2 = Four Part BASIC Assembly Construct.png\n| caption2 = The sequence of assembly is directed by the positioning of the linkers. The suffix linker is ligated to the 3' end of the upstream fragment, while the prefix linker is ligated to the 5' end of the downstream fragment. Shown here is an example of a BASIC assembly construct using four DNA parts.\n| footer = \n}}\n\n'''Assembly'''\n\nThere are three main steps in the assembly of the final construct.\n\n# First, the DNA parts are excised from the storage plasmid, giving a DNA fragment with BsaI overhangs on the 3' and 5' end.\n# Next, each linker part is attached to its respective DNA part by incubating with T4 DNA ligase. Each DNA part will have a suffix and prefix linker part from two different linkers to direct the order of assembly. For example, the first part in the sequence will have L1P and L2S, while the second part will have L2P and L3S attached. The linker parts can be changed to change the sequence of assembly.\n# Finally, the parts with the attached linkers are assembled into a plasmid by incubating at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. The 21 bp overhangs of the P and S linkers anneal and the final construct can be transformed into bacteria cells for cloning. The single stranded nicks are repaired ''in vivo'' following transformation, producing a stable final construct cloned into plasmids.\n\n== Applications ==\nAs DNA printing and DNA assembly methods have allowed commercial gene synthesis to become progressively and exponentially cheaper over the past years<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = El Karoui M, Hoyos-Flight M, Fletcher L | title = Future Trends in Synthetic Biology-A Report | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | volume = 7 | pages = 175 | date = 2019 | pmid = 31448268 | doi = 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00175 | pmc = 6692427 }}</ref>, artificial gene synthesis represents a powerful and flexible engineering tool for creating and designing new DNA sequences and protein functions.
