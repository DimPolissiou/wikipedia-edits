The feature was previously available to all users but became restricted to paid subscribers only.\n\n==Operational summary==\nHamachi is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] centrally-managed [[VPN]] system, consisting of the server cluster managed by the vendor of the system and the client software, which is installed on end-user computers.\nClient software adds a [[Virtual Interface|virtual network interface]] to a computer, and it is used for intercepting outbound as well as injecting inbound [[VPN]] traffic. Outbound traffic sent by the [[operating system]] to this interface is delivered to the client software, which encrypts and authenticates it and then sends it to the destination VPN peer over a specially initiated [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] connection. Hamachi currently handles [[tunneling protocol|tunneling]] of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] traffic including [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcasts]] and [[multicast]]. The Windows version also recognizes and tunnels [[IPX]] traffic.\n\nEach client establishes and maintains a control \nconnection to the server cluster. When the connection is established, the client goes through a login sequence, followed by the discovery process and state synchronization. The login step authenticates the client to the server and vice versa. The discovery is used to determine the topology of the client's Internet connection, specifically to detect the presence of NAT and firewall devices on its route to the Internet. The synchronization step brings a client's view of its private networks in sync with other members of these networks.\n\nWhen a member of a network goes online or offline, the server instructs other network peers to either establish or tear down tunnels to the former. When establishing [[tunneling protocol|tunnels]] between the peers, Hamachi uses a server-assisted [[NAT traversal]] technique, similar to [[UDP hole punching]]. Detailed information on how it works has not been made public. This process does not work on certain combinations of NAT devices, requiring the user to explicitly set up a [[port forward]]. Additionally 1.0 series of client software are capable of relaying traffic through vendor-maintained 'relay servers'.\n\nIn the event of unexpectedly losing a connection to the server, the client retains all its tunnels and starts actively checking their status. When the ''server'' unexpectedly loses client's connection, it informs client's peers about the fact and expects them to also start liveliness checks. This enables Hamachi tunnels to withstand transient network problems on the route between the client and the server as well as short periods of complete server unavailability.\nSome Hamachi clients also get closed port on other clients, which cannot be repaired by port forwarding.\n\nHamachi is frequently used for gaming and remote administration. The vendor provides free basic service, and extra features for a fee.\n\nIn February 2007, an IP-level block was imposed by Hamachi servers on parts of Vietnamese Internet space due to \"the scale of the system abuse originating from blocked addresses\". The company is working on a less intrusive solution to the problem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Addressing==\nEach Hamachi client is normally assigned an [[IP address]] when it logs into the system for the first time. To avoid conflicting with existing private networks on the client side the normal [[Private network|private IP address blocks]] 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 are not used.\n\nBefore November 19, 2012 the 5.0.0.0/8 range was used. This range was previously unallocated but was allocated to [[RIPE NCC]] in late 2010 and space from this range is now being used by hosting providers on the public internet. Hamachi switched to the 25.0.0.0/8 block.<ref name=announce>[http://b.logme.in/2012/11/07/changes-to-hamachi-on-november-19th/ \"Changes to Hamachi on November 19th\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325054401/http://b.logme.in/2012/11/07/changes-to-hamachi-on-november-19th/ |date=March 25, 2015 }}, Official LogMeIn product blog</ref>\n\nThe 25.0.0.0/8 block is allocated to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]].

The feature was previously available to all users but became restricted to paid subscribers only.\n\n==Operational summary==\nHamachi is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] centrally-managed [[VPN]] system, consisting of the server cluster managed by the vendor of the system and the client software, which is installed on end-user computers.\nClient software adds a [[Virtual Interface|virtual network interface]] to a computer, and it is used for intercepting outbound as well as injecting inbound [[VPN]] traffic. Outbound traffic sent by the [[operating system]] to this interface is delivered to the client software, which encrypts and authenticates it and then sends it to the destination VPN peer over a specially initiated [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] connection. Hamachi currently handles [[tunneling protocol|tunneling]] of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] traffic including [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcasts]] and [[multicast]]. The Windows version also recognizes and tunnels [[IPX]] traffic.\n\nEach client establishes and maintains a control \nconnection to the server cluster. When the connection is established, the client goes through a login sequence, followed by the discovery process and state synchronization. The login step authenticates the client to the server and vice versa. The discovery is used to determine the topology of the client's Internet connection, specifically to detect the presence of NAT and firewall devices on its route to the Internet. The synchronization step brings a client's view of its private networks in sync with other members of these networks.\n\nWhen a member of a network goes online or offline, the server instructs other network peers to either establish or tear down tunnels to the former. When establishing [[tunneling protocol|tunnels]] between the peers, Hamachi uses a server-assisted [[NAT traversal]] technique, similar to [[UDP hole punching]]. Detailed information on how it works has not been made public. This process does not work on certain combinations of NAT devices, requiring the user to explicitly set up a [[port forward]]. Additionally 1.0 series of client software are capable of relaying traffic through vendor-maintained 'relay servers'.\n\nIn the event of unexpectedly losing a connection to the server, the client retains all its tunnels and starts actively checking their status. When the ''server'' unexpectedly loses client's connection, it informs client's peers about the fact and expects them to also start liveliness checks. This enables Hamachi tunnels to withstand transient network problems on the route between the client and the server as well as short periods of complete server unavailability.\nSome Hamachi clients also get closed port on other clients, which cannot be repaired by port forwarding.\n\nHamachi is frequently used for gaming and remote administration. The vendor provides free basic service, and extra features for a fee.\n\nIn February 2007, an IP-level block was imposed by Hamachi servers on parts of Vietnamese Internet space due to \"the scale of the system abuse originating from blocked addresses\". The company is working on a less intrusive solution to the problem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Addressing==\nEach Hamachi client is normally assigned an [[IP address]] when it logs into the system for the first time. To avoid conflicting with existing private networks on the client side the normal [[Private network|private IP address blocks]] 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 are not used.\n\nBefore November 19, 2012 the 5.0.0.0/8 range was used. This range was previously unallocated but was allocated to [[RIPE NCC]] in late 2010 and space from this range is now being used by hosting providers on the public internet.
